NYSE Moves To Delist Enron Stock

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The New York Stock Exchange said it is suspending tr=
ading in Enron Corp. (ENE) and moved to delist the embattled energy company=
's shares from the Big Board.
The NYSE said in a statement that it "has determined that the company's sec=
urities are no longer suitable for trading on the NYSE." The exchange's act=
ion affects not only Enron stock, but also other Enron securities, such as =
preferred convertible stock.=20
Enron officials weren't immediately available for comment.=20

Enron's collapse last year triggered a huge drop in the company's stock, se=
nding it down to mere pennies a share, as well as layoffs at the Houston co=
mpany. It also set off the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy ever.=20
The NYSE moved to delist Enron after the company's stock traded below the c=
ritical level of $1 for 30 consecutive days, placing it in violation of the=
 Big Board's listing standards.=20
"The exchange notes that today's action is being taken due to the expected =
protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty a=
t this time as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ult=
imate effect on the company's common shareholders," the NYSE said in a writ=
ten statement.=20
The exchange said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission t=
o delist Enron securities "upon the completion of applicable procedures, in=
cluding any appeal by the company of the NYSE staff's decision."=20

Writer Of Enron Warning Letter Worked With Ex-CFO Fastow
By Jason Leopold

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The letter to Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chie=
f Executive Ken Lay last August, warning that irregularities relating to En=
ron's off-balance sheet partnerships could bring about the company's demise=
, was written by Sherron Watkins, the company's vice president of communica=
tions in charge of corporate investigations, employee relations and policy,=
 Enron confirmed late Monday.
The existence of the letter was disclosed Monday afternoon by the House Com=
merce and Energy Committee, which is investigating the one-time market lead=
er's collapse.=20
Watkins had worked for former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, whose =
involvement with some of the off-balance sheet partnerships raised question=
s of conflicts of interest. Enron removed Fastow from his position in Octob=
er after reporting losses related to transactions involving the Fastow part=
nerships.=20
The letter released by the House committee raised questions about the secre=
cy and accounting of the off-balance sheet partnerships.=20
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scand=
als," the letter said.=20
Watkins said in the letter that other Enron officials "consistently and con=
stantly" had questioned the accounting methods to senior Enron officials, a=
nd directly to Jeff Skilling, Enron's former president and chief executive.=
=20
"Mr. Skilling flatly denies the allegations in the letter related to him," =
said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron announced hundreds of millions of dollars in third-quarte=
r losses and a writedown of more than a billion dollars in shareholder equi=
ty relating to the partnerships. The company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.=
=20
Watkins' letter is the earliest known communication to Enron's CEO that the=
 handling of the partnerships could prove disastrous for the company.=20
Letter Writer In Position To 'Learn Things'=20

Robert S. Bennett, Enron's attorney, confirmed that Watkins wrote the lette=
r, but didn't immediately know the date. Skilling resigned from the company=
 Aug. 14, citing personal reasons. Skilling said in an interview last month=
 that he had no idea the partnerships posed any threat to Enron.=20
Bennett said Watkins had worked closely with Fastow and was in a position t=
o "learn things" about Enron. Bennett couldn't describe the extent of Watki=
ns' work for Enron, nor could a company spokeswoman.=20
"She wrote the letter, which was initially an anonymous letter, and when it=
 came to Mr. Lay's attention he became concerned," Bennett said in an inter=
view with Dow Jones Newswires. Lay "went to the general counsel to investig=
ate and get to the bottom of it."=20
Bennett said Watkins met Lay for an hour last August to discuss the concern=
s she brought up in the letter, and he said she left the meeting "quite imp=
ressed" when Lay said he would investigate the issue.=20
Lay directed Vinson & Elkins, a law firm with offices in Houston, to look i=
nto the concerns raised by Watkins, but not to "second-guess" the accountin=
g advice from Andersen, the committee noted.=20
Vinson & Elkins concluded that "further widespread investigation by indepen=
dent counsel and auditors" was unwarranted. But the firm warned that "bad c=
osmetics" involving the transactions and the decline of Enron's stock posed=
 the "serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation."=20
The House Committee on Energy and Commerce acted unfairly by releasing the =
letter, Bennett said.=20
"It's very unfair to suggest the company was trying to whitewash anything,"=
 Bennett said. Lay "wanted an answer quickly and not spend a year with a la=
w firm doing an inquiry. I think this shows that what Mr. Lay did is very r=
esponsible. If the law firm said an investigation was needed, then Mr. Lay =
would have agreed."=20
Enron, however, made only scant reference to the partnerships on Oct. 16, w=
hen the company released its third quarter earnings, which included losses =
related to transactions with the partnerships.=20
It was those losses combined with other disclosures that led to a loss of i=
nvestor confidence and eventually led to Enron filing for bankruptcy in Dec=
ember.=20
Letter Writer Asked To Be Reassigned=20

Reached late Monday evening, Philip Hilder, Watkins' Houston attorney, said=
 Watkins worked for Fastow for a couple of months last summer and asked to =
be reassigned in late August because she was concerned about accounting irr=
egularities she witnessed related to the Fastow partnerships. Hilder wouldn=
't elaborate.=20
"She worked for Mr. Fastow for a short period of time last summer. Maybe a =
couple of months," said Hilder, who worked for the Department of Justice an=
d was a former federal prosecutor. "She asked to be reassigned."=20
Gordon Andrew, Fastow's spokesman, said Fastow "would not comment at this t=
ime on any aspect of the investigation."=20
Watkins, who had previously worked in the company's broadband division as v=
ice president, has been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n but hasn't testified yet, Hilder said. Neither the Justice Department nor=
 the various congressional committees investigating Enron's collapse has su=
bpoenaed Watkins, he said.=20
"It's unclear when Watkins will testify before the SEC," Hilder said.=20
Hilder said Watkins wasn't a stakeholder in any of the partnerships set up =
by Fastow nor did she benefit financially from them, but Watkins was "invol=
ved" in some capacity in the various entities, the extent of which Hilder w=
ouldn't disclose. Hilder said the letter Watkins wrote to Lay didn't includ=
e a date and was, at first, anonymous. He wouldn't say what the events were=
 that led up to her meeting with Lay last August, why she wrote the letter =
or how her identity as the author became known.=20
While Enron's most recent roster lists Watkins as vice president of communi=
cations, Hilder said Watkins title was previously vice president of corpora=
te development and that her title may have changed with the company's bankr=
uptcy and restructuring.=20

Enron DIP Financing Now Likely Halved To About $700M
By Carol S. Remond

01/15/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Despite receiving no cash upfront from the spinoff o=
f its core trading business, bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENE) now stands to get a=
 smaller-than-expected interim financing package.
Bankers are putting final touches on a downsized debtor-in-possession, or D=
IP, financing deal under which the energy company will have access to up to=
 $700 million to $800 million, people familiar with the situation said.=20
That's half of what the company was first expected to receive.=20
Enron confirmed earlier Tuesday that it has entered a trading partnership w=
ith Swiss banking institution UBS Warburg (U.UBS). Under the deal, UBS will=
 acquire all of Enron's oil and power trading business without cash changin=
g hands. UBS won't take on any of Enron's liabilities, but Enron will recei=
ve a 33% share of the new venture profits for at least two years.=20
Under the original financing plan approved last month shortly after Enron f=
iled for Chapter 11 protection in New York, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) a=
nd Citigroup (C) had agreed to put together a $1.5 billion interim financin=
g deal to help the company back on its feet.=20
But continued apathy among bankers recruited to help J.P. Morgan Chase and =
Citigroup foot the bill has now resulted in a smaller financing plan.=20

A first $250 million DIP installment was made available to the company in e=
arly December. Enron has yet to tap that credit line.=20
An additional $250 million will likely become available over the next coupl=
e of weeks after J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup approve the energy company=
's new business plan.=20
Additional financing above that $500 million is contingent upon other banks=
 agreeing to participate in the deal with J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup.=
=20
Enron's new business plan, which was provided to the banks in early January=
, has not been made public. But people familiar with the situation said the=
 company now has between $400 million and $500 million in available cash.=
=20
That better-than-anticipated cash position is also cited as one of the reas=
ons behind the DIP downsizing.=20
Final approval of the DIP, which is crucial for Enron to continue operating=
, is now scheduled for Jan. 30.=20
Once they approve Enron's new business plan, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigrou=
p are expected to float a syndication term sheet to other large banks. The =
banks first approached other financial institutions in mid-December, with t=
he original $1.5 billion financing deal, but found that most were reluctant=
 to take on more exposure to Enron.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase's exposure to Enron stands at $2.6 billion. Meanwhile, Ci=
tigroup's Enron liabilities are believed to be around $1 billion.=20

Enron Executives, Andersen Sued By Shareholder

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Executives of bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENE) were named a=
s defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed Monday by an Enron shareholder=
 in federal court in Houston.=20
Also named as a defendant is Enron's auditing firm, Arthur Andersen L.L.P.
The Enron shareholder, Howard Bruce Klein, alleges "each of the defendants =
knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that...misleading statements and om=
issions would adversely affect the integrity of the market in Enron common =
stock. Had the adverse facts defendants concealed been properly disclosed, =
Enron's shares would not have sold at the artificially inflated prices they=
 did," according to the filing.=20
Enron and Andersen representatives didn't reply to phone messages left at t=
heir offices. In response to similar previous requests, Andersen spokesmen =
have declined comment.=20
Klein is represented by Houston-based lawyer Tom Alan Cunningham.=20
The Enron executives named in the suit are Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chi=
ef Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fas=
tow.=20
Nearly 40 shareholder class-action lawsuits are pending against Enron in th=
e U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston.=20
Enron filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after the comp=
any's equity collapsed in the face of revelations about of related party tr=
ansactions involving executives including Fastow. The related party transac=
tions kept hundreds of millions of dollars off Enron's balance sheet. The c=
ompany is the subject of more than 60 civil lawsuits, congressional investi=
gations and a federal criminal probe.=20

UBS won't pay anything in deal for Enron trading operation
By ALAN CLENDENNING
AP Business Writer

01/15/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - A Swiss investment bank won't pay anything to acquire Enron=
 Corp.'s energy trading business nor assume any of the troubled company's d=
ebts but will share a third of the energy operation's profits with Enron an=
d its creditors.=20
Stamford, Conn.-based UBS Warburg, a division of Swiss banking giant UBS AG=
, and Enron will file for approval of the deal with the Federal Trade Commi=
ssion and the Justice Department within five business days, according to do=
cuments filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
The plan to revive Enron's trading business calls for UBS Warburg to purcha=
se the unit without paying any cash up front, said Mark Palmer, an Enron sp=
okesman.=20
Enron and its creditors will initially get 33 percent of the new business' =
pretax profits and UBS Warburg the remainder, the documents indicate. After=
 three years, UBS Warburg can begin to buy out some of those profit-sharing=
 rights and eventually buy the rights to all of the profits.=20
"This is an extremely positive deal for Enron and its creditors that confir=
ms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation," said Enron chief fi=
nancial officer Jeff McMahon. "We believe this is a first step among many t=
owards an overall plan of reorganization and planned emergence from bankrup=
tcy."=20
Palmer said UBS Warburg is expected to lease Enron offices in Houston and e=
mploy about 800 of the division's workers. Court documents also indicated t=
hat UBS Warburg plans to lease Enron office space in Portland, Ore., Toront=
o and Calgary, Alberta.=20
Enron's energy trading business generated about 90 percent of the company's=
 $101 billion in revenue in 2000. The deal does not include existing contra=
cts Enron has to supply power, valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion.=
=20
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships use=
d to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial prob=
lems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading busines=
s.=20
UBS Warburg won the bidding for the trading operation, beating out Citigrou=
p Inc., a large Enron creditor.=20
The investment bank was selected after intense negotiations during a court-=
sponsored auction that began Thursday morning and ended more than 24 hours =
later.=20
The deal with UBS Warburg is for 10 years, but allows the investment bank t=
o to exercise a series of options to buy out Enron's profit-sharing agreeme=
nt starting in the third year of the pact, Enron said in a statement.=20
A creditors' committee approved the deal, but other Enron creditors have qu=
estioned it, saying they want more information about how the agreement was =
reached and how the proceeds will be allocated.=20
The deal must be approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez. A hearing is set for=
 Friday.=20
Some two dozen Enron creditors had already filed objections to the sale bef=
ore the selection was announced. Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days t=
o appeal Gonzalez's ruling.=20
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy me=
rchant and the nation's seventh largest company by revenue. Enron differed =
from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the s=
un - advertising space, broadband, paper, the weather and more than 1,000 o=
ther products.=20
Trading of Enron shares, which sold for $83 a year ago but have changed han=
ds at no higher than $1 since December, has been halted since Friday on the=
 New York Stock Exchange pending the sale announcement. UBS' U.S.-traded sh=
ares fell 4 cents to $49.17 Tuesday morning on the NYSE.=20

Enron loans sting bank's bottom line

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

CHICAGO (AP) - Northern Trust Corp. says losses on loans to bankrupt Enron =
Corp. have caused fourth-quarter earnings to fall short of Wall Street's ex=
pectations.=20
Northern Trust reported net income fell 18 percent to $102.4 million, or 45=
 cents a diluted share, from $125.5 million, or 54 cents a share, during th=
e same period last year. Thomson Financial/First Call said analysts expecte=
d the Chicago-based banking and financial-services company to report result=
s of 54 cents per share.
Northern Trust says its results were dragged down by an increase in the amo=
unt of money set aside to cover potential loan losses, from $5 million to $=
45 million. On Monday, the bank disclosed it had $43.5 million in outstandi=
ng Enron-related loans, of which $24.6 million is in the form of loans unse=
cured by collateral.=20
Chief Financial Officer Perry Pero said the bank has written off the $24.6 =
million in unsecured loans.=20
Northern Trust was the trustee of Enron's 401(k) pension plan until the now=
 bankrupt energy trader transferred in October to another provider. The ban=
k held the assets but had no investment discretion, according to spokeswoma=
n Sue Rageas.=20
It was during the shift of trustees that a "lockdown" was imposed, barring =
employees from altering their plan holdings. The bank remains a co-defendan=
t with Enron in litigation brought by Enron workers angry because they were=
 not permitted to sell their Enron shares while their value was falling.=20
Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month a=
fter disclosing it used questionable bookkeeping practices to conceal the s=
ize of its debt.=20
For the year, Northern Trust's net income was $487.5 million, or $2.11 a sh=
are, up from $485.1 million, or $2.11 a share, a year earlier.

CAPITAL VIEWS: Early Washington Noise On Budget, Enron
By John Connor

01/15/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The pace will pick up soon in the Nation's Capital=
 in areas of interest to the business and financial communities.
Congress returns to work next week, with Congressional Budget Office Direct=
or Dan Crippen testifying Wednesday on the budget outlook before the Senate=
 Budget Committee. The next day, a Senate committee will hold the first of =
many Enron hearings this year.=20
President George W. Bush will deliver his State of the Union Address Jan. 2=
9.=20
And the Federal Open Market Committee will announce its latest monetary pol=
icy decision the following day, Jan. 30, which also will feature the Treasu=
ry Department's quarterly refunding announcement.=20
President Bush will unveil his fiscal 2003 budget Feb. 4, which also is the=
 day when Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay is scheduled to testify before=
 two Congressional committees.=20
On Feb. 12, the Senate Banking Committee will hear, in the context of the E=
nron debacle, from five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission.=20
And sometime not long thereafter, in the latter part of February, Federal R=
eserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will present what used to be known as his Hu=
mphrey-Hawkins testimony.=20
Prospects of Congress enacting much if any meaningful legislation in this, =
an election year, are slim, but there should be no shortage of noise, parti=
cularly on the fiscal policy front as Democrats ask in wide-eyed wonder "wh=
o lost the surplus?" while Republicans accuse the Democrats of trying to ra=
ise everyone's taxes.=20
Veteran budget observer Stan Collender of Fleishman-Hillard Inc., said prel=

I am writing to ask you to recuse yourself from any participation in the Se=

Last Thursday, Attorney General Ashcroft recused himself from the Enron cas=

questioned the approximately $50,000 that had gone to committees affiliated=
 with Ashcroft by Enron-related individuals and groups.=20
As you know, the amount that you and committees affiliated with you receive=

 auditor, Arthur Anderson, dwarfed anything received by Attorney General As=

Enron contributed at total of $25,000 in 2000 to the group you founded, the=
 New Democrat Network, according to IRS records. Also, Enron's biggest cred=
itor, Citigroup, Inc. is listed as your largest single contributor ($112,54=
6) for the period 1997-2002 by the web site Opensecrets.org, relying on Fed=
eral Election Commission records. Citigroup, Inc. also made $100,000 in con=

USA: Treasury's O'Neill sees positive US economic signs.

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said on Tues=
day that he now saw some signs of positive growth among the mixed signals t=
he U.S. economy was giving off.=20
"The data that I'm looking at tell me the economy is and has been moving fr=
om a slow period to one where the data is kind of mixed and we are seeing s=
ome positives," O'Neill said on CNBC television.
"But I think the balance is now decidedly on the positive side and I think =
it foretells movement back into significant positive growth as we go throug=
h the year," he added.=20
The Treasury chief, in New York to address a business group, said the econo=
my should get a short-term lift simply from restocking inventories. After t=
hat, O'Neill added, "we need to kick in the investment side of business act=
ivity" to get a sustained recovery from recession that began last march.=20
"But that's the uncertainty that we have, that the inventory reversal and m=
ovement back up will be followed by business investment picking up more of =
the???ed.=20
In response to a question, O'Neill said he has not given up on reviving a p=
ackage of economic stimulus measures to spur growth. A proposed package fai=
led at the end of last year amid acrimony on Capitol Hill over how best to =
craft measures but O'Neill said he thought lawmakers might have changed the=
ir minds by now.=20
If so, "we're very hopeful we can get it done in a few weeks," O'Neill adde=
d.=20
He said there should not be a rush to judgment about what happened in the c=
ase of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. but said if it was shown that the=
re were legal violations that contributed to its collapse, then there shoul=
d be punishment.=20
"I believe this: if people knowingly, intentionally violated the law, then =
they should be brought to justice," O'Neill said. Enron and its former offi=
cers are under investigation on several fronts.=20
Enron was a major contributor to the successful presidential campaign of Ge=
orge W. Bush but gave money to both Republicans and Democrats who were seek=
ing office. O'Neill said he was not concerned that Enron had undue influenc=
e over lawmakers or over the shaping of national energy policy.=20
He said it was natural for people crafting energy policy and for lawmakers =
to talk to experts on the topic.=20
"If you really followed the dictates of the people who are on the extreme e=
dges of this, you would only talk to people who don't know anything, which =
doesn't seem to be a brilliant idea to me," O'Neill added.

Nevada Sen. Ensign on panel probing Enron

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who is among numerous lawmakers=
 who took campaign money from Enron Corp., is also among those investigatin=
g the firm's collapse.=20
Ensign took $7,500 in campaign contributions from Enron since 1989, accordi=
ng to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-money watchdog group.
Ensign is on the Senate Commerce Committee, and the panel's consumer affair=
s subcommittee, which is holding hearings on Enron's collapse.=20
Ensign said the contributions "absolutely" wouldn't hinder his ability to r=
igorously investigate how Enron plummeted into bankruptcy and left investor=
s, including company employees, holding nearly worthless stock.=20
Ensign stressed that the Justice Department was the lead Enron investigator=
.=20
"As it appears, fraud took place," Ensign said. "If that's the case, Justic=
e needs to put some people in jail. It's very unfortunate that we had peopl=
e perpetrate this sort of thing, especially when you are dealing with emplo=
yees and the top people were trying to protect their own rear ends."=20
Ensign also said the Bush administration should be lauded for not stepping =
in to help Enron, whose executives gave sizable donations to the president.=
=20
As many as eight congressional committees plan to look into Enron, but Comm=
erce was among the first to get started. Seventy-one senators and 188 House=
 members - more than half of Congress - got money from Enron, according to =
the center.=20
One other Nevada lawmaker has taken money from Enron in recent years: Sen. =
Harry Reid, D-Nev., got $1,000 in 1998. Reid doesn't sit on any committee t=

Enron, which lobbied for corporate tax repeal, faces Congress probe over it=
s own tax returns
By CURT ANDERSON
AP Tax Writer

01/15/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron Corp., which led a lobbying campaign to repeal a co=
rporate tax as it neared collapse, will undergo scrutiny in Congress of its=
 own tax returns to determine if shelters or other practices may have conce=
aled its financial condition.=20
Repeal of the alternative minimum tax sought by Enron was included by Presi=
dent Bush in an economic stimulus package and passed by the House, which ad=
ded a provision that would have given Enron a $254 million infusion of cash=
. The package ultimately failed.
Now, Senate Finance Committee investigators are "interested in whether Enro=
n has been complying with federal tax laws" said the panel's spokesman, Mik=
e Siegel.=20
Whether Enron used any shelters viewed by the Internal Revenue Service as s=
et up mainly to avoid paying taxes is one key point. Sen. Charles Grassley =
of Iowa, the top committee Republican, said the issue is "whether Enron use=
d certain tax vehicles that might have masked the company's financial condi=
tion."=20
Enron, the Houston-based energy conglomerate, faces investigations from a g=
rowing list of congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission following its collapse late last year in th=
e nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy. The Finance Committee is one of tw=
o congressional panels with access to Enron's tax records.=20
Even as its failure loomed last fall, Enron maintained a high-profile lobby=
ing effort on a variety of tax issues. Enron led the AMT Coalition for Econ=
omic Growth, a business group dedicated to repeal of the corporate alternat=
ive minimum tax, which is intended to guarantee that companies pay at least=
 a minimal amount of income taxes.=20
Bush also pushed for repeal in his economic stimulus package, arguing that =
the provision hits corporations hardest in down years.=20
The administration disclosed Tuesday that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay+ telep=
honed Mitch Daniels, director of the White House Office of Management and B=
udget, in early October to discuss prospects for passage of the stimulus me=
asure.=20
The two had a general conversation about the legislation and discussed the =
overall outlook for the economy, said OMB spokeswoman Amy Call. Repeal of t=
he alternative minimum tax was not addressed, she said.=20
Enron stood to gain handsomely from language added to the stimulus package =
by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committ=
ee. Under the original House-passed bill, billions of dollars in alternativ=
e minimum tax credits built up over past years by dozens of corporations wo=
uld have been immediately redeemed - handing Enron a $254 million infusion =
of cash.=20
Several corporate lobbyists say Enron was focused on prospective repeal of =
the tax, not the immediate refund of past credits. Thomas endured fierce cr=
iticism from Democrats for proposing the refunds, which he contended would =
enable struggling corporations to hire more people or boost investments. Ot=
her companies, including IBM and General Motors, would have gotten much lar=
ger refunds than Enron.=20
David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Co. in New York, said in a=
ny event the money would have done little to help Enron overcome its sinkin=
g credit rating and sliding stock price.=20
"Maybe they could have staved off bankruptcy for another month," Wyss said.=
 "But it would not have solved their problem."=20
Senate Democrats blocked the Republican stimulus package. A second version,=
 again passed by the House and endorsed by Bush, did not include the altern=
ative minimum tax repeal or the immediate refund.=20
Enron sought numerous other tax breaks from Congress, according to lobbyist=
 disclosure records. Among them was a five-year extension of a tax credit f=
or electricity generated by wind; Enron is a major producer of wind-generat=
ed power.=20
An Enron affiliate, Enron Wind, provided a sample letter on its Internet si=
te that people could send to members of Congress advocating extension of th=
e credit.=20
Like the stimulus package, however, extension of the wind credit failed to =
clear Congress and expired on Dec. 31. Lawmakers of both parties say it wil=
l be renewed for at least another year and probably made retroactive to the=
 beginning of 2002.=20
Enron would also have benefited from provisions of a House-passed energy bi=
ll involving oil and gas transmission lines, including tax breaks for certa=
in transmission transactions. Those items would have helped the bottom line=
s of many other companies, too - and the bill also languishes in the Senate=
.

USA: UPDATE 1-Fired Andersen partner to meet investigators Wed.
By Jeremy Pelofsky

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - David Duncan, who was fired on Tuesday by au=
ditor Andersen for his alleged role in destroying documents related to its =
review of Enron Corp.'s books, will meet with congressional investigators o=
n Wednesday, a spokesman for the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee s=
aid Tuesday.=20
"Mr. Duncan will be meeting with our investigators tomorrow," said Ken John=
son, the spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. The panel has been probing Ande=
rsen's role in the collapse of the energy trading giant last fall.
"Frankly, now that he's been fired, he may be a little more motivated to be=
 cooperative," Johnson said. "Prior to being terminated, he delivered six b=
oxes of personal files and records to the committee and we're in the proces=
s of reviewing them right now."=20
Earlier on Tuesday, Andersen said thousands of e-mails and large numbers of=
 paper documents related to Enron were destroyed shortly after lead partner=
 Duncan learned on Oct. 23 of a request by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission for information about the audit of Enron.=20
Duncan could not be reached immediately for comment.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee also said it would meet later with =
Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive who wrote a letter to Chief Executive =
Kenneth Lay last August in which she raised concerns about the company's ac=
counting.=20
"We're in the process of setting up a meeting with her," Johnson said at a =
press briefing. FIRST STEP TO ASSIGN BLAME=20
The firing of Duncan was the first public step by the accounting firm to as=
sign individual blame for the problems with its Enron audits. The Houston-b=
ased energy giant last month filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. histo=
ry.=20
Three other partners responsible for the Enron work were placed on leave by=
 Andersen.=20
"This is a useful beginning, but there is much more to be done," Rep. John =
Dingell, the ranking Democrat on the House panel, said in a statement read =
by his spokeswoman.=20
The collapse of the company came after posting its first quarterly loss in =
more than four years on Oct. 16, as it took $1 billion in charges against e=
arnings and cut shareholders equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Enron debt was listed under partnerships, considered special-purpose entiti=
es, in effect keeping the debt off its own books. Andersen was responsible =
for auditing the company's balance sheets.=20
Earlier on Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange formally suspended trading =
in Enron shares and related securities while moving to delist the stock. It=
s shares last traded for 67 cents on Jan. 10, far below the record $90.56 h=
it in August 2000.

ROUNDUP Andersen fires Enron auditor who knowingly destroyed documents

01/15/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Arthur Andersen LLP said it has fired the leading partner =
on its Enron audit after it discovered he ordered documents to be destroyed=
 even after learning that the Securities and Exchange Committee wanted to s=
ee them.=20
The Big Five firm said it has dismissed David Duncan and sent three other p=
artners involved in the case on administrative leave.
Andersen said its initial probe of the Enron matter revealed that Duncan or=
dered employees to destroy thousands of emails and numerous related papers.=
=20
"These activities were on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove an=
y doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated=
," the firm said.=20
The effort began following an urgent meeting that Duncan called on Oct 23, =
shortly after learning that Enron had received a request from the SEC for i=
nformation on its financial accounting and reporting.=20
"This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the fir=
m and at a time when the engagement team should have had serious questions =
about their actions," said Andersen.=20
The firm denied that an Oct 12 e-mail referring to company policy in docume=
nt handling or any other conversations it knew of around that time had auth=
orized the activity.=20
Most of the emails and documents were destroyed in the days following that =
meeting, although the activity only ended after the lead partner's assistan=
t sent an e-mail to other secretaries on November 9 -- one day after Anders=
en received a subpoena from the SEC -- telling them to "stop the shredding"=
, said the firm.=20
Andersen reiterated its statement of last week that it has successfully ret=
rieved some documents from electronic backup systems, and said it is attemp=
ting to restore more.=20
The firm also said that is installing new management in its Houston offices=
, where the audit team was based.=20
Andersen managing partner and chief executive officer Joseph Berardino said=
: "We promised to be forthright and to take action where appropriate. This =
was a painful decision, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. We are=
 prepared to take all appropriate steps necessary to maintain confidence in=
 the integrity of our firm."=20
Arthur Andersen said it would dismiss anyone found to have improperly destr=
oyed audit work papers as well as any employee found to have purposefully d=
eleted Enron-related e-mails or destroyed Enron-related documents after hav=
ing been informed of the November 8 subpoena.=20
"Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen wil=
l not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful viol=
ation of our policies," said Berardino.=20
Andersen's revelations came shortly after the New York Stock Exchange said =
it is delisting Enron shares with immediate effect.=20
It attributed the move to the "expected protracted nature of the company's =
bankruptcy process and the uncertainty at this time as to the timing and ou=
tcome of this process as well as the ultimate effect on the company's commo=
n shareholders."=20
The shares have also fallen below the exchange's one usd threshold for more=
 than a month.=20
Enron shares have been halted from trading for the past several days pendin=
g the announcement of details of the company's sale of its wholesale energy=
 trading unit to UBS Warburg. They last changed hands at 67 cents.=20
Earlier, Enron said that UBS Warburg will not pay any cash upfront to acqui=
re the unit, but will instead pay Enron royalties equal to 33 pct of the un=
it's income for 10 years.=20
UBS Warburg has a series of options that allow it to begin buying out Enron=
's royalty interest in the third year of the agreement.=20
Following the exercise of the first call, the royalty payment rate will dro=
p from 33 pct to 22 pct. A second option in the fourth year would lower roy=
alties payments to 11 pct. The final option in the fifth year would allow p=
ayments to cease altogether.=20
If UBS Warburg decides not to exercise these series of options, the royalti=
es will increase from year five through 10.=20
UBS is acquiring a staff of about 800 people along with the company's compu=
ter systems and hardware.=20
Additionally, as Enron lawyers made clear on Friday, the company's trading =
book is not part of the deal.=20
The book contains Enron's derivatives trading positions, which will be slow=
ly unwound.=20
The deal still requires approval by Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the US bankrup=
tcy court in the Southern District of New York.=20
The court is expected to announce that decision on Friday.=20

USA: Business group wary of new regs from Enron case.
By Peter Kaplan

01/15/2002

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The head of corporate America's biggest lobb=
ying group on Tuesday said the government should not rush to impose new bus=
iness regulations in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse.=20
Thomas Donahue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the org=
anization would oppose any immediate, "radical overhaul" of laws and regula=
tions stemming from the Enron debacle.
"We have seen one problem with one company and one accounting firm, and wit=
h it everybody is rushing to judgment and rushing to: 'We've got to pass le=
gislation,'" Donahue said at a press briefing on the Chamber's 2002 agenda.=
 "Pray we don't until we know what we're talking about."=20
Houston-based Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.=
 Its auditor, Andersen, has said its employees destroyed documents related =
to the former energy giant's balance sheet.=20
Enron's collapse has prompted a criminal probe by the Justice Department. T=
he Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Department are also investi=
gating.=20
President George W. Bush ordered a review headed by Treasury Secretary Paul=
 O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules to avoid a repeat o=
f the energy trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost =
their retirement savings.=20
Meanwhile, some lawmakers in Congress are eyeing possible legislation to pr=
otect investors and employees from similar breakdowns in future.=20
Sens. Jon Corzine, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Barbara Boxer, a Democra=
t from California, have proposed a law limiting how much company stock can =
be put into employees' 401(k) plans. Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat from Ma=
ryland, has asked the General Accounting Office to look into the adequacy o=
f financial reporting and employee retirement plan rules.=20
Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has said he also is considering legisla=
tion to protect 401(k) account holders' rights to sell shares when they wan=
t. And the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed new requiremen=
ts for reporting on derivatives and hedge funds.=20
Another Chamber of Commerce official at the briefing said the organization =
does support a bill by Ohio Republican Rep. John Boehner that would let ret=
irement plans providers offer investment advice to individual plan members.=
=20
But Donahue, of the Chamber of Commerce, said the president and Congress sh=
ould move cautiously when it comes to more radical measures. He characteriz=
ed the Enron collapse as an isolated case and said there are already rules =
and regulations in place to protect investors.=20
"Let's not start reinventing the process," Donahue said. "Let's adjudicate =
the process that's in place."=20
"After that's done, if there's a habitual problem in American industry and =
the American accounting industry because of that then we have to change the=
 system," Donahue said. "Right now there is no such habitual problem."=20
Donahue said class-action attorneys "are lining up now to see if they can l=
ine their pockets on behalf of some number of shareholders from anybody the=

USA: US official sees Enron slowing energy mart change.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Enron Corp. debacle won't end federal an=
d state efforts to further restructure U.S. energy markets, but it will slo=
w the process for the next two or three years, a top Bush administration en=
ergy official said on Tuesday.=20
"I think we've gone too far to go back," said Vicky Bailey, Assistant Secre=
tary of Energy for International Affairs and Domestic Policy.
Bailey, speaking to reporters at a U.S.-Canada energy conference, said that=
 Enron's problems along with last year's California energy crisis will drag=
 out the process of bringing more competition to the nation's electricity m=
arket.=20
"You've got the bookends of the California crisis and Enron. It doesn't hel=

three more years."=20
Bailey said it was unfortunate that the Enron fiasco would effect energy re=
structuring, because energy issues were not the cause of the company's down=
fall.=20
"The Enron issue is a financial issue, banking issue, accounting issue," sh=
e said. "It shouldn't be the death knell for energy legislation, because th=
at's larger than Enron."=20
During the seven years that Bailey served as a member of the Federal Energy=
 Regulatory Commission, she said Enron officials were "out front" and "aggr=
essive" in pushing to open U.S. energy markets to competition.=20
"There was nothing wrong with that. We needed somebody out there championin=
g that," said Bailey, referring to Enron.=20
With congressional scrutiny of Enron, Bailey said she did not think another=
 energy firm would be willing to step in any time soon to become the new ch=
eerleader for restructured energy markets. "I think you'll see a fair amoun=
t of timidness," she said.

Power Trading Business Could Be Good Fit For UBS Warburg

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- UBS Warburg's winning bid for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) po=
wer trading business could prove to be a good strategic move for the Swiss =
investment bank, analysts said.
The purchase of Enron's trading operations marks UBS Warburg's entry into a=
 new business line that adds to its experience in equity and fixed-income t=
rading. The deal is in line with UBS's stated goal to expand its U.S. marke=
t share, a focus since its 2000 purchase of brokerage firm PaineWebber Inc.=
=20
"It will be a valuable extension of our worldwide trading activities," said=
 John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg in a recent statement.=20
Enron's demonstrated track record and high-quality traders offer "potential=
ly a very complimentary fit to the trading operations of a brokerage firm,"=
 said Gene Pisasale, senior investment officer with Wilmington Trust Co.=20
Although observers are skeptical that the trading unit could reclaim its to=
p dog status in the power trading industry, UBS's backing could revive the =
business that has been virtually dormant since Enron's bankruptcy in early =
December.=20
Putting UBS's name behind it should eliminate concerns about the soundness =
of the business, said John Leonard, an analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith =
Barney in London.=20
"I don't think that UBS is taking a lot of risk," said Romain Burnand, Euro=
pean bank analyst at J.P. Morgan in London. He said UBS's risk seems to be =
limited to potential negative cash flow if the trading activity does not re=
sume quickly enough.=20
A spokesman for UBS Warburg, a unit of UBS AG (UBS), did not immediately re=
turn telephone calls seeking comment.=20

Still, there are questions about just how much business Enron's old trading=
 operation can recapture under UBS control, given the already crowded indus=
try playing field. Enron had about 20% of the market, said Leonard of Schro=
der Salomon Smith Barney.=20
UBS will be armed with Enron's technology and the talent of some of its emp=
loyees. According to a person familiar with the transaction, UBS is expecte=
d to keep between 500 to 800 of Enron's employees.=20
The staff will include executives who ran Enron's trading floor, but not an=
y of Enron's corporate employees, the person said.=20
Since trading is a relationship business, the retention of key staff is an =
important part of the picture. However, there are concerns among industry w=
atchers that Enron's staff may have lost important momentum in the weeks th=
at Enron's business wasn't operating.=20
"Enron's trading business was so big," said Commerzbank Securities analyst =
Andre Meade. "It had such a big market share that it had an information adv=
antage that is unlikely to persist."=20
Also, having gone through the painful adjustment of having to operate witho=
ut Enron, some customers may be hesitant to go back, according to Meade.=20
Indeed, the energy market has moved on since Enron's abrupt exit and typica=
lly new entrants in the energy market have had difficulty obtaining top-tie=
r status. However, since many energy traders have credit ratings below A-le=
vel, UBS may have an edge over its competition, some industry observers sai=
d.=20
UBS is rated Double-A-Plus, and good credit goes a long way in the energy m=
arket.=20
"It's a question of stability," said ABN AMRO energy analyst Paul Patterson=
. "What you find is that it gives (trading partners) more confidence."=20
The importance of confidence among trading partners cannot be overstated. M=
any likened Enron's own collapse to a run on a bank. As the trading parties=
 rushed to unwind their deals, Enron's situation began to spiral out of con=
trol.=20
Historically, energy traders with Triple-B credits haven't been penalized, =
for their lower credit ratings, but that situation may be evolving post-Enr=
on.=20
For that reason, it is important for UBS to maintain its status, observers =
said.=20

UBS hasn't indicated whether it will seek a separate rating for the trading=
 business, as is the case with many energy trading companies.=20
A person familiar with UBS said the credit of UBS' trading business will li=
kely be considered along with the credit of its parent. However, credit rat=
ing agencies will make the final determination.=20
Officials from Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service weren't imme=
diately available to comment.=20
Eileen Fahey, a banking industry analyst for Fitch Investors Service, said =
the addition of the trading business adds an element of risk to UBS's profi=
le.=20
"It's a new business for them. They had scaled down their commodities tradi=
ng," she said. However, the analyst sees the move as consistent with UBS Wa=
rburg's strategy of becoming a large, core investment bank.=20
Furthermore, UBS has the advantage of buying "a premiere platform," accordi=
ng to Fahey.=20
Historically, the strength of the UBS credit rating has been based on the s=
trength of its private client business and the support of the Swiss governm=
ent, she said. However, neither of these strengths are applicable to the en=
ergy trading business.=20
Fitch's review will look closely at how much capital the business will requ=
ire, how much liquidity the business can generate and in which areas will t=
he company focus. These details are unknown at this time.=20

Reached later, UBS spokesman David Walker declined to provide details about=
 the new venture until after the bankruptcy court hearing to discuss the de=
al on Friday. He did, however, say UBS is hoping to get the business up and=
 running in 30 days, providing it gets all the necessary approvals.=20
According to a person familiar with the transaction, UBS only expects to tr=
ade gas and power, and will abandon some of the other business lines Enron =
previously traded such as pulp and paper, metals and weather-risk.=20
Fitch's Fahey expects UBS will be best suited to trade short-term contracts=
 for power and gas. UBS could have difficulty competing for long-term contr=
acts because physical assets and logistical experience are important advant=
ages the firm will lack, she said.=20
Long-term contracts, however, tend to be the most profitable. According to =
Commerzbank's Meade, short-term contracts reap profit margins in the "singl=
e digits."=20
Without pipes and wires, the UBS trading business also will have difficulty=
 trading some short-term contracts that rely on assets, Meade said. These i=
nclude ancillary services such as spinning reserve, or energy a power plant=
 needs to have as an operating reserve.=20

USA: UPDATE 1-US lawmaker seeks Enron pension, accounting probes.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

01/15/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The chairman of a powerful Senate committee =
probing Enron Corp.'s collapse on Tuesday requested investigations into fin=
ancial reporting and employee retirement fund investments in company stock,=
 matching a White House call last week for reviews in the same areas.=20
Maryland Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes asked Congress' investigative arm to=
 look into laws governing employee stock ownership in retirement funds such=
 as 401(k) plans, as well as how corporations report their finances to the =
public.
In a move that will bring the hard-hitting General Accounting Office into t=
he debate over regulatory responses to the Enron affair, Sarbanes kept up C=
ongress' push for answers on how Enron collapsed by focusing on two key pol=
icy issues.=20
"Accurate and honestly presented financial information is essential to the =
efficiency of our capital and security markets, yet in recent years costly =
accounting irregularities have proliferated," Sarbanes, chairman of the Sen=
ate Banking Committee, said in a statement.=20
Houston-based Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2,=
 and last week the Justice Department launched a criminal probe of the comp=
any. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Department are also i=
nvestigating.=20
A sharp decline in Enron's share price last fall sapped the savings of thou=
sands of the fallen energy trader's employees whose 401(k) accounts were he=
avily invested in Enron stock. Similar losses have been seen in recent year=
s at other firms.=20
"Investment of retirement funds in company stock can enable employees to sh=
are in the fruits of their labor - as reflected in a company's stock price.=
 However, the reported results of Enron's bankruptcy raise significant issu=
es about the adequacy of our laws and their enforcement," Sarbanes said.=20
President George W. Bush, who got major campaign support from Enron and its=
 top executives, last week called for reviews of retirement fund and financ=
ial reporting rules, as well.=20
Sarbanes asked the GAO "to evaluate the governance system of the accounting=
 profession in the United States and consider the extent to which defects i=
n that system may have contributed to or increased the risks of such irregu=
larities," he said.=20
Questions about Enron's financial reports and their review by its auditor, =
Andersen, are at the heart of the SEC probe.=20
Chicago-based Andersen also audited the books of other companies that later=
 disclosed bookkeeping irregularities, such as Waste Management Inc and Sun=
beam Corp.=20
The accounting profession largely regulates itself through the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants.=20
Sarbanes has scheduled a banking committee hearing for Feb. 12 on Enron. Fi=
ve other congressional committees are looking into Enron, with other hearin=
gs set for Jan. 24 and Feb. 4.

SANTA FE (AP) - The collapse of Enron Corp. cost four of New Mexico's large=

ficials said.=20
The losses did not significantly affect the land grant and severance tax pe=
rmanent funds, the Education Retirement Board investment fund or the Public=
 Employees Retirement Association fund, investment managers said.
Enron, an energy-trading company, entered the biggest corporate bankruptcy =
in U.S. history on Dec. 2, leaving countless investors burned and thousands=
 of employees out of work.=20
"I'm sorry we got into it," Phil Archibeck, chief investment officer for th=
e state Investment Council, said of the Enron holdings. "Nobody knew the st=
ock would be hit that way."=20
The land grant and severance tax permanent funds lost $26 million - one-qua=
rter of 1 percent of the funds, which are worth a combined $12 billion, he =
said.=20
"This (Enron) was not a large holding related to the size of the funds," Ar=
chibeck said. "Although you hate to lose the money, the portfolio was diver=

The Education Retirement Board investment fund lost about $20 million - abo=
ut three-tenths of 1 percent of the $6.5 billion fund, said Frank Foy, the =
fund's chief investment officer.=20
"It's a big hit, but it's not going to hurt the fund," he said.=20
The PERA fund lost $8.5 million - less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the $=
8 billion fund, said Bob Gish, PERA's chief investment officer.=20

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2002--Everyone seems to be focusing =

Even with all that has attended the implosion of energy giant Enron Corp., =
last week's disclosure was seismic: As the company hurtled toward the large=
st bankruptcy in U.S. history, Chairman Kenneth Lay picked up the phone and=
 called two cabinet members, telling one he would welcome government help. =
After considering Enron's plight, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Comme=
rce Secretary Donald Evans say they declined to step in.=20
It's not unusual, of course, for even the closest of political friends to m=
elt away in the face of an ally's death spiral; the company is now virtuall=
y radioactive in Washington. But for Enron, which has spread money freely i=
n political circles and enjoyed an outsize reputation as one of the capital=
's most powerful players, this ultimate denial was less a denouement than a=
nother chapter in a less appreciated story: Despite several big policy wins=
, Enron may not have been the political juggernaut its extraordinary connec=
tions suggested.
Pushing into an expanding array of businesses, Enron had sharply escalated =
its lobbying attack in Washington in recent years, boosting its spending by=
 a stunning 400 percent since 1996. It had buttressed a small army of highl=
y paid lobbyists with nearly $6 million in campaign contributions since the=
 1990 elections. And then there were all those close ties to the Bush admin=
istration.=20
Undeniably, Enron has enjoyed considerable success in Washington. Both Hous=
e energy legislation and Vice President Cheney's national energy plan inclu=
de key Enron provisions, such as speeding up approval for new energy facili=
ties and encouraging electricity deregulation. In 1993, with the backing of=
 Wendy Gramm, then the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on and the wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, Enron fended off stronger regulat=
ion of energy derivatives, the complex financial instruments on which it bu=
ilt its trading empire. (Just weeks after the CFTC vote, Wendy Gramm joined=
 Enron's board of directors; Phil Gramm, a Republican, counts Enron as his =
top corporate contributor, and, as former chairman of the Senate Banking Co=
mmittee, he helped thwart energy trading regulations.) Enron had strong inp=
ut in the appointment of the chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commiss=
ion, who has backed regional electricity transmission groups--a central par=
t of Enron's business plan.=20
Despite these victories, however, Enron suffered significant political setb=
acks before the curtain came crashing down. It couldn't, for example, persu=
ade the Bush administration to push for telecommunications providers to ope=
n up their networks--something that would have allowed Enron to provide hig=
h-speed services, like movies on demand. "In the energy world, they had a l=
ot more chips on the table to play with," says one former Enron lobbyist. "=
In [others], they had to negotiate their way in--they were like a start-up.=
"=20
Enron tried hard. Even by Washington's revolving-door standards, its lineup=
 of former government officials was impressive: former top energy regulator=
s, members of Congress, key congressional staffers, top White House officia=
ls, influential tax writers, and officials from the Treasury, Commerce, Sta=
te, and Defense departments. But Enron's collapse, which has cost investors=
 billions of dollars and employees their jobs and savings, has fanned parti=
san flames because of the company's remarkable ties with the Bush administr=
ation. Bush officials who have worked for Enron include economic adviser La=
wrence Lindsey, Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, Army Secretary Thomas=
 White, and Commerce Department general counsel Theodore Kassinger. Bush hi=
mself counts Enron as his biggest single benefactor, hauling in nearly $625=
,000 in contributions over the years, according to the Center for Public In=
tegrity. Lay has personally donated at least $883,000 to candidates, about =
90 percent Republicans.=20
A vivid example of Enron's Bush connections is newly disclosed details of m=
eetings between Enron officials and the vice president and his aides, inclu=
ding while Cheney was drafting the administration's hush-hush energy policy=
. Cheney had previously acknowledged a half-hour meeting with Lay. But last=
 week, the White House said Cheney aides met five other times with Enron of=
ficials last year. The final meeting occurred a little more than a week bef=
ore the company said it was writing off $1.2 billion--news that touched off=
 its bankruptcy.=20
Empire building. Enron's sharpest increase in lobbying coincides with Bush'=
s arrival in Washington. But as the company's agenda expanded, it was force=
d to ramp up its Washington efforts to protect its interests in the new ter=
ritories. Early last year, for instance, company lobbyists began working th=
e administration on steel and trade protection--part of Enron's attempts to=
 extend its trailblazing empire into steel products.=20
But Enron failed to derail legislation that would require trading firms to =
disclose more information about their activities. It could only watch as th=
e FERC waded into California's electricity crisis with price controls. The =
company suffered a setback when the president bailed out of the Kyoto Proto=
col, which calls for capping greenhouse-gas emissions. Such limits would he=
lp the company trade pollution credits while also giving a boost to natural=
 gas, which could help Enron's pipeline business. Enron was also frustrated=
 in its push for national retail competition in electricity. "They had a lo=
t of relationships," says a former Enron lobbyist. "But when it came to mak=
ing things happen, they couldn't exert enough influence."=20
In Washington, seldom does an interest win all the time, but Enron's failur=
es have come in crucial areas. The company also didn't help itself with wha=
t some saw as an abrasive style. "There was a sense of entitlement--`We are=
 Enron, dammit,' " says one former company lobbyist. He said the company sw=
ept its offices for bugs and hired private detectives to follow competitors=
, including Jeffrey MacKinnon, a utility lobbyist. "It's amazing what they =
were willing to do," MacKinnon says.=20
Meanwhile, even before last week's developments, investigation of Enron's c=
ollapse was growing broader. On top of several congressional and regulatory=
 probes, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation--althou=
gh Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself, having accepted abou=
t $57,500 in Enron-related contributions for his failed 2000 Senate campaig=
n. (The Justice Department's Houston office has also recused itself, citing=
 too many homegrown ties to Enron.) Investigators are examining everything =
from the behavior of Enron's auditors to the impact of the crash on investo=
rs to the stupefying range of partnerships the company created to help pump=
 up its earnings. Congressional investigators expect to receive millions of=
 documents, and they are stepping up visits to company offices, U.S. News i=
s told.=20
Even Enron's past Washington successes may be fleeting. Though Enron triump=
hed in the battle over regulating derivatives, FERC has effectively reopene=
d the issue by considering new rules that would require energy firms to dis=
close more information about their derivatives exposure. When the Senate ta=
kes up its energy bill next month, lawmakers are expected to show new suppo=
rt for regulatory reforms that Democrats proposed even before the Enron cra=
sh.=20
Concluding there was little Washington could offer, Enron all but shuttered=
 its lobbying operation soon after filing for bankruptcy. As the company is=
 learning, money and attitude may not guarantee success, but there's nothin=
g like the stench of failure to bring the walls tumbling down.=20

The smoke around Enron's spectacular collapse is beginning to choke the bea=

ments and correspondence" relating to Enron in recent months. The firm said=

Financial Desk
The Nation Enron Chief Was Warned of Problems Energy: A top officer's memo =
to Chairman Lay, found by congressional investigators, cautioned that 'funn=

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was warned last summer by=
 a company vice president that the energy company's financial practices mig=
ht cause it to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," congressional in=
vestigators said Monday.=20
The vice president, Sherron Watkins, complained in an August letter to Lay =
and other senior Enron executives that a "veil of secrecy" surrounding the =
company's "funny accounting" of complex partnerships had not been adequatel=
y disclosed to the public and merited further investigation, according to e=
xcerpts from the memo.
The seven-page memo was found by investigators sifting through 40 boxes of =
Enron documents obtained from the company after it filed the largest bankru=
ptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2. The investigators said it raises troubling que=
stions about the extent to which Enron officers and the company's auditor, =
Andersen, were aware of the financial transactions and accounting practices=
 that contributed to the energy giant's fall.=20
But Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington lawyer, said Lay took the employe=
e's concerns seriously--and, in fact, met with her and ordered an investiga=
tion. He said the review by an outside law firm found that "no further inve=
stigation was necessary."=20
"This really isn't fair to the people under investigation," Bennett said.=
=20
Since Enron's collapse, investigators have alleged that the Houston company=
 used a network of partnerships to mask debt and make its balance sheet app=
ear stronger. In mid-October, the company acknowledged accounting problems =
relating to those partnerships and slashed shareholder equity by $1.2 billi=
on.=20
Congressional committees are investigating whether Enron and its auditor wi=
thheld information from employees and investors that led to billions of dol=
lars in losses as the company's stock plummeted.=20
Investigators said they plan to interview Watkins, whom they declined to na=
me publicly but who was confirmed as the author by her attorney, Philip Hil=
der.=20
Watkins worked for Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as vice p=
resident of corporate development. She wrote the memo anonymously, Hilder s=
aid, and then sought out Chairman Lay to express her concerns directly.=20
"She doesn't perceive herself as a heroine; she was just doing her job," sa=
id Hilder, who said Watkins had written the undated memo in mid-August. Aft=
er talking to Lay about it, Hilder said, she asked to be reassigned so she =
would no longer report to Fastow.=20
Before Watkins joined Enron, Hilder said, she worked for Andersen--the acco=
unting firm that has come under fire for not sounding alarms on Enron's pre=
carious financial condition.=20
Watkins, in her late 30s, still works for Enron in a variety of capacities,=
 her lawyer said. Hilder said she remains on the job because she "felt loya=
lty to the company."=20
"She's been there for eight years," he said. "It's very difficult to just p=
ick up and leave if you have a disagreement."=20
The excerpts from her August letter provide a window on an internal debate =
underway at Enron about the company's accounting practices before its probl=
ems were widely known.=20
Watkins wrote that she had complained directly to Jeffrey K. Skilling, who =
resigned as Enron's chief executive Aug. 14. Skilling has denied any knowle=
dge of the firm's financial problems.=20
"Mr. Skilling flatly denies the allegations in the letter related to him," =
said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling.=20
The memo was written about the time that Lay was reassuring investors and t=
elling employees that Enron would eventually see "a significantly higher st=
ock price," according to one Aug. 27 e-mail from Lay released last weekend.=
 Instead, Enron's stock plummeted as investors grew more concerned about th=
e controversial partnerships. On Dec. 2, the company filed for Chapter 11 b=
ankruptcy protection.=20
Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said =
the memo "clearly shows that top Enron executives, including Kenneth Lay, w=
ere warned of serious financial problems months before the company reduced =
shareholder equity."=20
"What's also troublesome is that some people may have tried to hide the tru=
th or simply did not want to know it," Johnson said.=20
According to excerpts from the memo released Monday, Watkins questioned the=
 company's accounting methods for numerous partnerships involving Fastow an=
d for other "special purpose" entities.=20
Fastow was replaced Oct. 24. On Nov. 8, the company announced that it had o=
verstated its profit since 1997 by $586 million.=20
But as early as August, several senior Enron employees were "consistently a=
nd constantly" questioning the company's accounting methods and use of stoc=
k swaps with related entities, Watkins wrote.=20
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a r=
elated company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the fut=
ure," she warned.=20
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) an=
d Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversigh=
t and investigations, sent letters to Enron, Andersen and the Houston law f=
irm Vinson & Elkins seeking records on their review of the concerns. Tauzin=
 questioned whether Enron officers had instructed Vinson & Elkins not to se=
cond-guess "the accounting advice and treatment provided by" Andersen.=20
The review by the outside attorneys concluded that the concerns did not war=

PAT KIERNAN, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: Congressional investigators say =
an Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) employee warned the company`s chairm=
an about the company`s accounting practices months before the firm filed fo=
r bankruptcy. The Enron executive wrote an internal letter of warning that =
said problems could, as the memo explained it, implode the company.=20
ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: Yesterday the top Enron story con=
cerned another memo. This one from a lawyer for Enron`s auditor, Arthur And=
ersen. A congressional committee note authorized the destruction of documen=
ts pertaining to Enron. "Time" magazine`s Wall Street correspondent, Dan Ka=
dlec, broke that news over the weekend he joins us know for a look at this =
and everything else that we can fit on Enron into the next few minutes.
DAN KADLEC, "TIME": You talk about smoking guns. You know, destroyed eviden=
ce and memos that were ignored by the chairman of the company, if not ignor=
ed at lease not given proper attention to. I mean, these things really open=
ed the door to broader issues and possibly charges. You know, it`s been ser=
ious all along but this is really getting hot now.=20
KIERNAN: The auditors know better.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
KADLEC: You`ve got this pattern with Arthur Andersen, you know, their behav=
ior in this case is obscene anyway. But you go back and you got this patter=
n with the fines and the penalties they`ve paid Waste Management (URL: http=
://www.wastemanagement.com/) and Sunbeam (URL: http://www.sunbeam.com/) , y=
ou know, it just looks like a pattern for doing business at this place and =
there`s serious question whether the firm`s even going to survive at this p=
oint.=20
ALI VELSHI, CNNfn MONEY GANG ANCHOR: All right. Now the smoking gun unfortu=
nately doesn`t tell us what -- what we`re missing. It doesn`t tell us wheth=
er these are even material documents. Do we know that in effect that they a=
re?=20
KADLEC: We don`t know. We don`t know. Odds are the material stuff has been =
saved. Okay. That`s beyond -- we don`t know if a few things were ditched do=
wn here or not. Mostly what has been gotten rid of is emails and informal m=
emos but these are the kinds of things that an investigator would love to h=
ave.=20
KIERNAN: Yeah.=20
KADLEC: . because you`re a little more revealing in an offhanded comment or=
 an email that things that show motivation and intent and this stuff is now=
 missing. I mean, what they have are the work papers but what`s that but ju=
st.=20
VELSHI: Presumably drafted by people who know not to break the wrong things=
 exactly.=20
KIERNAN: From the prospective of the investor the audit is very important i=
n that it is the shareholders advocate in the financial process making sure=
 that everything is as it appears to be and the accounting firms have been =
very successful in convincing regulators that they don`t need to be regulat=
ed.=20
KADLEC: This whole concept of self-policing is under a black cloud. I mean,=
 we saw it all this year and last with the analysts, I mean, Wall Street an=
d IPOs and underwriting are supposed to be a self-policing mechanism, well =
it didn`t work there. You know, the auditors are supposed to self-police bu=
t they have this thing called peer review. I mean, please that just means t=
hat I`m looking at what you`re doing and.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
KADLEC: . and you know, next -- you know, you`re going to do the same thing=
 for me next week. So, you know, you`re really inviting additional oversigh=
t and Congressional inquiries, there`s just no ending where this thing is g=
oing to go.=20
VELSHI: Where does the word scandal or conspiracy -- at what point do you s=
tart looking at that? Could this just be ineptitude on two separate parts, =
both Enron and Arthur Andersen and they just both happen to coincidentally =
be doing the wrong thing at the same time?=20
KADLEC: I mean, that gets to the question of who knew what and when.=20
VELSHI: Right.=20
KADLEC: But it`s the age-old question. The pattern -- on the evidence we se=
e it suggests that somebody knew something and was trying to hide it. I mea=
n, that`s a far as we can go, you know, more evidence is sure to come out.=
=20
VELSHI: Enron`s best defenses that this happened -- not Enron, but Andersen=
`s best defense is that this has happened to them before. Sloppy.=20
KADLEC: Let`s face it, other accounting firms have missed things and it`s n=
ot a bad defense. I mean companies that want to hide something can hide it =
and an auditor may not be able to pick it up every time. But the fact that =
they were paid a million dollars a week to work for this company, there`s j=
ust a lot of things that don`t look good.=20
KIERNAN: Dan Kadlec, Wall Street columnist, "Time" magazine. Thanks for bei=

Andersen`s Role in the Enron Collapse

ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: We`re continuing on, on the Enron=
 (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) topic. One of the early shareholder lawsuits=
 against Enron and Arthur Andersen comes from Amalgamated Bank .=20
PAT KIERNAN, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: This case raises a lot of questi=
ons about whether small shareholders were left out of the loop about the wo=
rsening financial condition at Enron.
William Lerach is one of the lead lawyers for Amalgamated and he joins us f=
rom San Diego. Thanks for being with us, Mr. Lerach.=20
WILLIAM LERACH, ATTORNEY, AMALGAMATED BANK: Thank you.=20
KIERNAN: Bill, let me start by asking you just to summarize exactly what yo=
ur allegation is and what the lawsuit hopes to achieve as far as compensati=
on.=20
LERACH: Amalgamated Bank, a union-owned bank that manages the pension money=
s of working people, janitors, laborers, workers, suffered a large loss as =
a result of the fraud at Enron. The lawsuit alleges that Enron and Arthur A=
ndersen artificially inflated the reported profits of Enron by over $600 mi=
llion and overstated Enron`s net worth or shareholder equity by over $1 bil=
lion during a three-year period. During which 29 top officers and directors=
 personally profited by selling off 1.1 billion shares of their Enron stock=
 at inflated prices, all of this in violation of the federal securities law=
s.=20
VELSHI: Now, noted attorney Robert Bennett working on the Enron side says t=
here`s no proof that any of these 29 executives did anything wrong. What`s =
your response to that?=20
LERACH: Mr. Bennett is being well paid to try to put a positive spin on an =
impossible situation. This is the largest dose of insider trading we have e=
ver encountered in the 30 years that we`ve been prosecuting these kinds of =
cases and remember, Enron has now admitted that its financial statements co=
ntained hundreds of millions of dollars of phony profits during the time th=
ose executives were selling off their stock. If those executives didn`t kno=
w it, it was only because they deliberately closed their eyes to what was i=
n front of them.=20
CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, THE MONEY GANG: William, if I could =
just ask you a practical question:=20
Now that Enron is in bankruptcy protection and certainly you guys out there=
 in the shareholder lawsuit community are seeking class action status, can =
you just walk us through some of the mechanics of when you might achieve cl=
ass status, when you might actually get a hearing on your case, when you mi=
ght actually potentially see some money for your clients?=20
LERACH: Well, first of all, the case is actually moving forward rapidly. Am=
algamated Bank has made an emergency motion to the court to freeze the $1.1=
 billion of insider trading proceeds. Remember, Enron is bankrupt. So Enron=
 won`t be able to pay any money. So we`re trying to attach these insider tr=
ading proceeds so they`ll be there at the end of the day when we win the ca=
se to fund a recovery or a settlement.=20
Now the court has ruled in a big victory for Amalgamated Bank that the cour=
t has the power to grant this extraordinary remedy. Next what we`re going t=
o do is trace where that $1.1 billion is and if we find out that it`s in of=
fshore bank accounts or otherwise being secreted, then the court, in my opi=
nion, will probably attach it. As the case goes forward, it will take some =
months for the complaint to be upheld by the court and for class certificat=
ion status to be obtained but that will all happen later this year.=20
VELSHI: You know, you may make a good legal argument and may get a ruling i=
n your favor in the end but what - if we have to go through that entire pro=
cess of finding out what happened to the proceeds of that $1.1 billion, fin=
ding out if they`re offshore, getting the court to attach it, what is the a=
ctual chance of recovery in the end?=20
LERACH: Oh, there`s a very good chance of recovery here for the victims of =
this fraud. The Enron officers and directors, in addition to the insider tr=
ading money, are covered by $400 million of directors and officers` insuran=
ce. In addition, Arthur Andersen, while it`s in a terrible fix, is a very p=
rofitable enterprise with over $9 billion of revenue a year and as this cas=
e expands and unfolds, several other defendants, many of whom will be insti=
tutions with large resources and large insurance, are surely going to be ad=
ded to the case as defendants.=20
HUNTINGTON: How do you account for the fact that shareholders and employee =
pension funds happily rode Enron`s stock price up to $90 a share and it rea=
lly, with the exception of the lock down period when the funds were - the 4=
01(k) was shifting administrators, there was really nothing to prevent folk=
s from selling their Enron shares for quite some period of time.=20
LERACH: Of course - of course nothing to prevent them from selling their sh=
ares other than the fact that the company was representing that it had neve=
r been more profitable, lying, that the company was representing that its f=
uture had never been brighter, lying, and the securities analysts were - wh=
o were, by the way, employed by the investment banking firm, so we`re getti=
ng hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron to peddle Enron bonds and sto=
ck to the public were issuing ever more rosy analysts` forecasts. How can y=
ou fault the victims? All the investors were doing was what investors are s=
upposed to do. Look at the information the company and the analysts give yo=
u and if it looks good, believe it and invest.=20
VELSHI: William Lerach, thanks very much for joining us here on THE MONEY G=
ANG.=20
LERACH: Thank you.=20
VELSHI: William Lerach is the managing partner at Milberg Weiss. They`re re=
presenting Amalgamated Bank in its suit against Enron.=20

Commentary Bush to Lay: What Was Your Name Again?
ROBERT SCHEER
Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.

01/15/2002
Los Angeles Times=20
Home Edition
B-13
Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company=20

If you believe President Bush, Kenneth Lay--one of his top financial backer=
s and his "good friend"--was merely an equal-opportunity corrupter of our p=
olitical system, buying off Democrats and Republicans as needed. It is a co=
nvenient claim designed to unlink Bush from the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. =
history.=20
But, as the good ol' boys in Texas--and now Bush spokesman Ari Fleisher--li=
ke to say, "That dog won't hunt."
On Friday, Bush attempted to distance himself from the Enron scandal by sta=
ting that CEO Lay "was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994," obsc=
uring the fact that Lay gave Bush three times as much money as he did the D=
emocratic gubernatorial incumbent whom Bush was trying to unseat. Bush adde=
d that he really did not get to "know" Lay--the man he nicknamed "Kenny Boy=
"--until after he won the governor's race.=20
I can't speak to the varying levels of intimacy of their relationship, but =
Bush had considerable contact with Lay two years earlier when the Enron lea=
der served as the chair of the host committee for the 1992 Republican conve=
ntion in Houston, where Bush the senior was nominated for his second term a=
s president.=20
At that time, Investor's Daily reported that "recently, Lay has turned Enro=
n into a corporate bastion for the GOP." After the elder Bush's defeat, the=
 Bush family switched its political ambitions to George W.'s prospects for =
governor, and Lay came up with the first of many contributions to that effo=
rt.=20
Lay's loyal support of the Bushes may have been gratitude for the decisive =
role that the first Bush administration played in Enron's meteoric rise. Bu=
ilding on the Republican-engineered deregulation of the electricity industr=
y that began in the 1980s, Enron got a huge boost during the first Bush adm=
inistration with passage of the 1992 Energy Act, which forced utility compa=
nies to carry Enron's electricity on their wires.=20
In fact, Lay publicly thanked Bush with a column in the Dallas Morning News=
 a week before the 1992 election. Calling Bush "the energy president," Lay =
wrote that "just six months after George Bush became president, he directed=
 Energy Secretary James Watkins to lead the development of a new energy str=
ategy." That resulted in the legislation making Enron's exponential growth =
possible.=20
Lay was effusive in expressing his gratitude, writing that the Bush "strate=
gy is the most ambitious and sweeping energy plan ever proposed."=20
That gift to Enron was coupled with a major exemption granted by Wendy Gram=
m, then chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in the Bush adm=
inistration, an exemption that permitted Enron to begin lucratively trading=
 energy derivatives. Gramm then joined the board of directors of Enron and =
served on its auditors committee, where much of the false reporting now bei=
ng exposed seems to be centered. Her powerful role in the company did not s=
top her husband, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), from pushing through legislatio=
n that further weakened government oversight of Enron's activities.=20
After Bush the elder's defeat in 1992, the ties between Enron and the Bush =
camp grew even stronger. In March 1993, Enron hired Bush's Commerce secreta=
ry, Robert A. Mosbacher, and his secretary of State, James A. Baker III, to=
 line up contracts for Enron around the world. As Enron's representative, B=
aker--later George W.'s Florida election strategist--even went on a trip ac=
companying the ex-president to Kuwait to do big business in the nation Bush=
 had fought the Gulf War to save.=20
The trip was criticized by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said that he had tu=
rned down millions in proffered deals to do business in Kuwait after the wa=
r.=20
"I represent 540,000 American men and women, not some private company," sai=
d Schwarzkopf. "They were willing to die in Kuwait. Why should I profit fro=
m their sacrifice?"=20
A decade later, the new Bush administration turned immediately to Lay to ge=
t his bearings on an energy policy. Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney=
's energy group six times. This was no surprise, given the close ties betwe=
en Lay and Bush during the latter's days as Texas governor. Consider, for e=
xample, that as governor, Bush did not hesitate to call then-Pennsylvania G=
ov. Tom Ridge and assure him that Lay--then eager to deregulate Pennsylvani=
a's electricity market--was the finest of men, representing the most worthy=
 of companies.=20
Keeping true to family traditions, the president has always aggressively su=
pported far-reaching deregulation of utilities--it is, in fact, his politic=
al mantra--and Enron appears to be the biggest benefactor of that philosoph=
y. Whether the contacts between them were actually illegal and not merely a=
n egregious betrayal of Enron's employees, shareholders and consumers, it r=
emains for the eight investigations planned or underway to reveal what Bush=
 and White House insiders knew, and when they knew it.

Commentary When Going Gets Tough, the Tough Shred
DANIEL SCHORR
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst for National Public Radio, won three Emm=
y awards for his coverage of Watergate.

Los Angeles Times=20

It was Watergate in the 1970s and Irangate in the '80s. Will Enrongate beco=
me the national scandal of the new century?=20
"Gate" has become a metaphor for the corrupt use of power. It remains to be=
 seen whether the Bush administration, consorting with a giant corporation,=
 contributed the regulatory laxity that made possible the victimization of =
employees, investors and the nation.
Now, as in the past, investigators will have to cope with the cover-up impu=
lse, which is not limited to government officials. For months, the Bush Whi=
te House has resisted providing the General Accounting Office--the investig=
ative arm of Congress--with data about the workings of Vice President Dick =
Cheney's energy task force, which produced anti-regulatory policy recommend=
ations much to Enron's liking. The GAO has filed an unprecedented lawsuit a=
gainst the White House, trying to pry loose the information.=20
Yet much of the information is buried in the files of the bankrupt corporat=
ion and its accountants in the Andersen company. With a free-enterprise whi=
ff of Watergate, Andersen has now acknowledged that "individuals" disposed =
of "a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents=
" related to Enron. The destruction apparently continued after a subpoena h=
ad been received from the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
This "Quick-Henry-the-shredder" reflex took me back three decades to June 1=
972. On the morning after five burglars had been caught in Democratic headq=
uarters in the Watergate office building, G. Gordon Liddy, chief of the ent=
erprise, drove to the office of the Committee to Reelect the President on P=
ennsylvania Avenue and started shredding files. He shredded everything conn=
ected with the project--including hotel soap wrappers and even $100 bills f=
rom illegal campaign funds.=20
A week later, L. Patrick Gray, acting director of the FBI, was called to th=
e White House and told by Nixon aide John Erlichman to "deep-six" the conte=
nts of the safe of H. Howard Hunt, Watergate operative, in the Executive Of=
fice Building. "Deep-six" meant that Gray was to drop the contents off the =
Potomac bridge. Gray chose to keep the material in his home and burn it six=
 months later.=20
The prize Watergate suppression was, of course, the erasure of 18 minutes o=
f a discussion between President Nixon and Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman on =
a tape subpoenaed by the Watergate special prosecutor. From the context it =
appears that Nixon and Haldeman were discussing who ordered the break-in an=
d why. Nixon denied making the erasure. His new chief of staff, Alexander H=
aig, testified to some possible "sinister force."=20
Fast-forward to 1985 and the explosive revelation that the Reagan administr=
ation had been dealing with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iranian gover=
nment to trade antitank missiles for Tehran's help in recovering Americans =
held hostage in Lebanon. A further development was that proceeds of the mis=
sile sales were diverted to support the anti-Communist Contras in Nicaragua=
.=20
Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese ordered an investigation, and immediately Oliver Nor=
th, the National Security Council staffer managing the enterprise, started =
shredding. Into the machine he fed paper copies of electronic messages, tel=
ephone logs--everything.=20
At one point the pile next to the shredder stood 1 1/2 feet high. When the =
shredder jammed, North went around the building looking for another secure =
shredder. North's secretary, Fawn Hall, spirited some particularly sensitiv=
e papers out of the White House hidden in her clothes.=20
Adm. John Poindexter, head of the NSC, tore up the "intelligence finding" b=
earing President Reagan's signature that authorized the arms shipments.=20
During the Clinton administration there was some shredding, tampering and t=
emporary removal of documents related to the investigation that started wit=
h the failed investment in the Whitewater Development Co. in Arkansas. Whit=
e House counsel Bernard Nussbaum was criticized for transferring Whitewater=
 files from the office of lawyer Vincent W. Foster Jr. after Foster's suici=
de.=20
But, unlike Watergate and Irangate, Whitewater was not a scandal that threa=
tened the rights and livelihoods of Americans. Enrongate could be such a sc=
andal, and so it's time to take notice when you hear the shredder at work.

Re "White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted," Jan. 13: Criticism of th=

ponsible for the wisdom of their investments.=20
The federal government is not without responsibility. If the laws regarding=
 disclosure are inadequate, the Congress can fix that. If companies do not =
comply with the laws, the federal government can take legal action. Best of=
 all, the Senate should stop its irresponsible behavior and enact meaningfu=
l campaign finance reform. And the president should fix the National Labor =
Relations Board, if Congress lets him, so that it enforces the Supreme Cour=

Enron Corp.'s proposed sale of its core energy-trading business to UBS Warb=

But now, under bankruptcy court protection, Enron is frantically unloading =
assets, including its once-dominant trading operation, its Oregon utility, =
its best natural gas pipeline and a variety of international assets.=20
If all of these deals are completed, Enron could end up much as it began, a=
 smallish operator of scattered pipelines.=20
The heady days when Enron tried to dominate the energy world and the halls =
of power are over, and its financial meltdown will haunt for years whatever=
 company survives in the form of lawsuits and investigations.=20
"Without these assets, Enron is not much," said utilities analyst Andre Mea=
de of Commerzbank Securities in New York.=20
"It's going to be a very small entity. My guess is Enron just gets liquidat=
ed and never emerges from bankruptcy ... or they might get acquired," Meade=
 said.=20
Enron, recently 21,000 employees strong, has fired 6,200 workers and will j=
ettison even more in the months ahead through asset sales and more expected=
 layoffs. A company spokeswoman Monday could not say how big the resulting =
company would be and how many people it would employ.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne acknowledged the shrinking of Enron but said =
that "the pipelines are a self-sustaining business." Enron began in 1985 as=
 a traditional natural gas pipeline operator, so "we'll be coming full circ=
le," she said.=20
The latest unloading of assets is the auction of Enron's trading business t=
o UBS Warburg, the New York-based investment banking arm of Swiss financial=
 services firm UBS. UBS won a bidding war Friday for Enron's trading operat=
ion, which once handled an estimated 25% of all the wholesale energy tradin=
g in the nation.=20
Enron and UBS were working to complete details of the agreement Monday and =
delayed filing documents detailing the agreement with the U.S. Bankruptcy C=
ourt for the Southern District of New York.=20
Enron will sell the entire operation to UBS Warburg, rather than the 51% ow=
nership stake it previously was said to be negotiating, according to publis=
hed reports. UBS Warburg would pay no cash up front for the business but wo=
uld give Enron 33% of any pretax profit generated by the trading business f=
or at least two years.=20
Enron has all but closed its trading operation, which employs about 850 peo=
ple and in 2000 generated 90% of the company's nearly $101 billion in reven=
ue. The sale does not include any existing contracts for commodities, which=
 are valued at more than $6 billion.=20
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez will hold a hearing on the proposed sale F=
riday, one day later than previously planned.=20
Although Enron's creditor committee backs the sale to UBS Warburg, some oth=
er creditors are objecting because they fear that profits would find their =
way to Enron and not to creditors, who are owed more than $31 billion.=20
Enron recently agreed to let Dynegy Inc. buy the 17,000-mile Northern Natur=
al Gas Pipeline, which Enron had pledged as part of the failed $9-billion t=
akeover by its small cross-town rival.=20
Dynegy pulled out of the agreement Nov. 28, the day Enron fell into junk-bo=
nd status, with Dynegy contending it had not realized the depth of Enron's =
problems.=20
Dynegy is getting the pipeline for $23 million on top of the $1.5 billion i=
n capital it had invested in Enron as part of the takeover agreement. But E=
nron was mired in an all-but-fatal cash crunch as investors and trading par=
tners fled, and it filed for bankruptcy law protection Dec. 2.=20
Enron still hopes to regain that pipeline as part of a $10-billion lawsuit =
it filed against Dynegy for pulling out of the merger.=20
Enron also owns all or part of three smaller pipelines. The largest is Tran=
swestern Pipeline, which operates 2,500 miles of pipe between Texas and the=
 California border. Other Enron businesses include energy marketing and ser=
vices, which sells electricity, natural gas and energy-management services =
primarily to business customers who want to bypass the traditional utility.=
=20
Enron is selling assets including its Portland-based utility, Portland Gene=
ral, and international power plants and other assets.=20
Enron's trading business was well-regarded and if it can be resurrected, it=
 could give Enron a stream of profit "that would be a nice little start of =
a business," said Chris Ellinghaus, utility analyst with Williams Capital i=
n New York.=20
"The trading business has a lot of credibility to win back," Ellinghaus sai=
d. "But that was the part of Enron that actually worked. It was all those o=
ther things that they got into that got them into trouble" including invest=
ments in water and telecommunications ventures.=20
"If they had just stuck with the core business, they would have done just f=
ine," Ellinghaus said.

Compaq, HP Detail Retention Bonuses Merger: Packages are designed to keep i=
mportant employees during integration of the technology companies.

Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. would shell out $634 million =
in bonuses to key employees as an incentive to stay on board if their merge=
r goes through, the companies disclosed Monday.=20
Hewlett-Packard would pay $33.1 million to 10 top executives and $337 milli=
on to about 6,000 selected employees over two years, according to an update=
d merger prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Compaq would pay $22.4 million to seven top executives and $242 million to =
an undisclosed number of employees over two years, the filing said.=20
The companies disclosed in their original prospectus on Nov. 15 that HP Chi=
ef Carly Fiorina had turned down a merger-related bonus package that would =
have been worth $8 million, and that Compaq leader Michael Capellas forfeit=
ed a $14.4-million plan. Both companies said the CEOs wanted to avoid the a=
ppearance of conflicts of interest as they fight hard for the deal.=20
The retention bonuses are designed to keep important employees during the d=
ifficult integration of the massive technology companies. HP has 86,000 emp=
loyees; Compaq has 66,500. At least 15,000 layoffs are expected if the deal=
 goes through.=20
HP's bonus plan was crafted by board members Sam Ginn, Phil Condit and Walt=
er Hewlett, the co-founder's son who originally voted for the deal and is n=
ow encouraging shareholders to torpedo it.=20
Compaq's retention package was developed by directors Lawrence Babbio, Judi=
th Craven and Kenneth Lay, the head of shattered Enron Corp. Lay resigned f=
rom Compaq's board last month.=20
HP and Compaq say their $24.2-billion deal is essential for their long-term=
 growth and would bolster their position in servers, data storage, personal=
 computing and high-tech services. The companies expect merging would save =
at least $2.5 billion a year by 2004, or $5 to $9 a share.=20
Opponents believe the deal is too risky, would shrink the contribution of H=
P's profitable printing division and overexpose the company to the weak per=
sonal-computer market. Hewlett and Packard family interests with 18% of HP =
shares are against the deal.=20
Palo Alto-based HP and Houston-based Compaq are awaiting regulatory approva=
l before setting a date for a shareholder vote.=20
European regulators have until Jan. 31 to announce a decision on the deal o=
r to inform the companies they need more time to study it.=20
HP shares fell 36 cents, about 1.5%, to $22.52 on the New York Stock Exchan=
ge, while Compaq lost 36 cents, or 3%, to $11.14, also on the NYSE.

As he prepares for his State of the Union address January 29, President Bus=
h is riding high. His war against terrorism is going well, he signed a comp=
romise education bill into law last week, and he has rediscovered his cowbo=
y swagger, declaring that Congress will raise taxes only "over my dead body=
." More than 80 percent of Americans approve of his job performance.=20
But there's trouble ahead. Americans are turning their attention from Osama=
 bin Laden back to domestic problems, especially the recession and unemploy=
ment, and Democrats are again attacking Bush on an issue that has plagued h=
im from the start: his coziness with big business and his strong policy til=
t toward corporate America. Making the problem markedly worse for the White=
 House is the growing furor over the collapse of Enron Corp., the once migh=
ty energy firm with close ties to Bush and the GOP. Last week, the Justice =
Department began an investigation into possible wrongdoing--the latest in a=
 series of congressional and media probes into a financial debacle that, at=
 minimum, raises questions about whether big corporations and rich contribu=
tors have unfair access to the administration (story, Page 22). "You expect=
 a Republican president to be tied to the corporate interests," says Al Fro=
m, founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. "But George W. Bu=
sh said he'd be a different kind of Republican, and he hasn't done that. . =
. . Enron will take the halo off him."
Even Bush's advisers admit his current popularity has been inflated by a pu=
blic desire to rally around the commander in chief, and they anticipate his=
 approval ratings will soon begin to slide. As the nation returns to some s=
emblance of normalcy, adds presidential historian Robert Dallek, Bush will =
pay a price for his lingering reputation as "the representative of big busi=
ness and oil and gas and tax breaks for the rich. People are asking if he i=
s just looking out for big business and his corporate friends."=20
On domestic issues, says Dallek, Bush reminds him of Charles Wilson, Presid=
ent Dwight Eisenhower's defense secretary and the former president of Gener=
al Motors, who in 1952 declared that what was "good for General Motors" was=
 "good for our country." "Bush is cut from the same cloth," the historian s=
ays. " . . . But people have to feel the president is on their side, that h=
e cares about them. And for Bush, the jury is very much out."=20
With the midterm elections looming, pressure is growing on Bush to respond =
to the wishes of corporate America, which contributed generously to his 200=
0 campaign and remains a bulwark of Republican fundraising. To that end, Wh=
ite House counselor Karl Rove and other senior aides have been meeting priv=
ately with business leaders to assess what is doable this year. Among the p=
ossibilities, according to Bush advisers: relief from the corporate alterna=
tive minimum tax (already passed by the House and pending in the Senate); t=
ax breaks on depreciation expenses and new capital investments; new protect=
ions from lawsuits; legislation to write off operating losses of some airli=
nes and chemical companies; relaxation of workplace and environmental rules=
; and opposition to healthcare legislation that could raise costs for busin=
esses.=20
Bush-appointed regulators already are floating a proposal to relax air-poll=
ution regulations at upgraded power plants--a move long sought by the energ=
y industry, which has strong ties to Bush and Vice President Cheney. Both a=
re former energy executives. Among those who sought the weakened standards =
was former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, the incoming chairman of the Republic=
an National Committee and Bush pal. All this has prompted Democratic member=
s of Congress and the attorneys general of nine northeastern states to thre=
aten to challenge the plans if they are implemented. Environmentalists are =
also up in arms.=20
Pocket watch. It's part of a broader picture in which Democrats and their a=
llies will make Bush's corporate attachments an issue in the midterm campai=
gns this fall--with the Enron case front and center. "Enron is a metaphor f=
or the way they approach managing the economy," Democratic National Chairma=
n Terry McAuliffe said in an interview. " . . . They're in the pockets of b=
ig business."=20
The White House has a different explanation. "President Bush is a populist,=
" Rove, Bush's chief strategist, told U.S. News. "For him the model is not =
the big corporation but the entrepreneur--the risk takers, the small-busine=
ss people."=20
The public doesn't see it quite that way. An ABC News/Washington Post Poll =
taken before the terrorist attacks found that 67 percent of Americans belie=
ve "large business corporations" have "too much influence" in the Bush admi=
nistration; 64 percent said "the oil and gas industries" have too much powe=
r; and 72 percent said "wealthy people" are too influential at the White Ho=
use.=20
Not that the White House is upset by the corporate connections. Quite the c=
ontrary. Bush is proud of his background in private enterprise, as a Texas =
oilman and as managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He tells=
 aides those experiences taught him a great deal about the economy and abou=
t the importance of keeping the business climate healthy. "It's not good fo=
r the country to bash business," says White House Press Secretary Ari Fleis=
cher. " . . . The fact is we all benefit from growth, and the more widely g=
rowth is spread in our society, the better it is for everyone."=20
Related interests. A U.S. News review--reinforced by a new survey of the to=
p 100 Bush appointees conducted by the nonpartisan, Washington-based Center=
 for Public Integrity--shows that the administration is filling up rapidly =
with a substantial number of former CEOs, corporate lobbyists, and other to=
p leaders of commerce and industry. Just as important, Bush has appointed a=
 number of leaders from industry to key government jobs where they will be =
making policies that could benefit their former companies or the interests =
they represented.=20
Of Bush's top 100 appointees, 34 came directly from for-profit businesses (=
even though some had served in government before) and 16 were from lobbying=
 firms and law firms with significant lobbying operations, according to the=
 center. An additional 27 were drawn from state, local, and federal governm=
ents; 19 were from nonprofit groups, including educational institutions and=
 think tanks; four were from other categories. The center found that 20 of =
the top 100 officials in the administration have positions in departments o=
r agencies that involve oversight of, or financial dealings with, their for=
mer private-sector employers or clients. At the time of their nominations, =
57 had investments of $50,000 or more in companies with either regulatory i=
ssues or contractual business with the government.=20
President Bill Clinton's administration also contained corporate leaders, a=
mong them former Goldman Sachs executive Robert Rubin as treasury secretary=
 and former energy executive Mack McLarty as White House chief of staff. Bu=
t Bill Allison, the center's managing editor, says Clinton drew more of his=
 senior advisers from politics, government, organized labor, academia, and =
the think tanks. (A precise comparison with Clinton's appointees was not fe=
asible, Allison says, partly because many records from the Clinton era were=
 not available.) Allison adds: "This is not to say you should never ever pi=
ck someone from the business community or erect a wall of separation. It's =
a question of access and bias. Who are these people [in the Bush administra=
tion] listening to?"=20
Not surprisingly, the business sector--particularly the energy industry--ha=
s a very loud megaphone. The top 100 Bush appointees collectively had the b=
iggest concentration of their holdings in the energy sector, according to t=
abulations by the Center for Public Integrity. Other major sectors: metal a=
nd mineral industries as well as financial companies.=20
At the vitally important second level of the administration, where many pol=
icies are hammered out--the subcabinet--the corporate connections are parti=
cularly apparent. In some cases, Bush has filled important subcabinet jobs =
with industry lobbyists and corporate executives who have a decidedly pro-b=
usiness outlook. Among them: Agriculture Under Secretary Mark Rey, a former=
 lobbyist for the timber industry who now has jurisdiction over the U.S. Fo=
rest Service, and Deputy Interior Secretary Steven Griles, a former lobbyis=
t for energy, chemical, and waste-disposal interests who is a key figure in=
 developing the administration's controversial energy policy that would enc=
ourage drilling on public lands.=20
The subcabinet picks reinforce Bush's first round of corporate appointments=
, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former chairman and chief exec=
utive officer of Alcoa; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former CEO and c=
hairman of G. D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instru=
ment Corp.; White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, former president and CE=
O of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association and former vice pres=
ident of governmental relations for General Motors; and Commerce Secretary =
Donald Evans, former CEO of Tom Brown Inc., an oil and gas company with off=
ices in Midland, Texas.=20
Naturally enough, the corporate-oriented appointees have set a wide range o=
f pro-business policies in motion. Among them: proposals to allow more ener=
gy development on public lands, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refu=
ge; an ongoing re-evaluation of rules that limit road building in national =
forests; a rollback of ergonomic workplace standards opposed by many busine=
sses; and opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, which would have required strin=
gent action by business and industry to minimize climate change.=20
Secret meetings. Coming under particularly heavy fire was Cheney's pro-deve=
lopment energy policy, formulated in secret meetings with business executiv=
es and lobbyists. Those meetings are the subject of a growing dispute betwe=
en the White House and congressional Democrats who, through the General Acc=
ounting Office, are demanding a list of attendees. Says Allison: "This [ene=
rgy policy] is the way energy companies believe this should work--it's the =
blueprint of the guys who think about development and drilling--and the que=
stion is whether or not government should take the same view as the oil com=
panies."=20
Another growing source of contention is Bush's economic stimulus plan, now =
stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. One provision backed by the Whit=
e House would allow companies to write off 30 percent of their new investme=
nts annually for three years. Democrats favor a substantially lower tax bre=
ak. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has tried to link such pro-business =
provisions to his larger critique of Bush's economic policy; he says that B=
ush's $1.35 trillion tax cut gave a huge windfall to wealthy individuals an=
d that it's unfair to give similarly large breaks to corporations.=20
While Bush has departed from conservative orthodoxy in some ways--spending =
more money on education, for example, and avoiding GOP "wedge issues" like =
crime and race--he has been more of a traditional conservative on domestic =
policy. Yet his views are firmly rooted in the GOP past. For most of the pa=
st century, the Republican Party was almost synonymous with corporate Ameri=
ca. In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge declared famously, "The chief busine=
ss of the American people is business." And in 1962, Dwight Eisenhower prou=
dly called the GOP "the party of business." Says Republican pollster Frank =
Luntz, an informal adviser to the White House: "Republicans believe in free=
 markets. That should come as a surprise to no one."=20
Not that Bush has given business everything it wants. In 2001, he deferred =
consideration of corporate tax breaks in favor of individual tax cuts, and =
he has shown a willingness to allow patients to sue HMOs in state courts, w=
hich business interests oppose. (Bush has shown little interest in a capita=
l-gains-tax cut because he doesn't believe Congress would pass it in the ne=
ar future.)=20
Yet business leaders are delighted with their new leader. "This guy is a Ha=
rvard M.B.A., he ran a lot of businesses, and he has a lot of guys on his s=
taff who used to be in positions where they met a payroll," says Tom Donohu=
e, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "They've got an instinctive a=
nd practical understanding" of business's needs, Donohue says, adding that =
Bush was "fundamentally correct" and "courageous" in rejecting the Kyoto cl=
imate-change treaty as potentially harmful to the U.S. economy and in rolli=
ng back or reviewing some of Clinton's strongly pro-environment policies.=
=20
Democrats believe that kind of praise from the business community can be tu=
rned to their advantage. "The public thinks his agenda is to fight for peop=
le in the boardroom and not the folks sitting behind computer screens or wo=
rking in other jobs," says John Podesta, another former White House chief o=
f staff for Clinton. "If things go badly and the economy stays soft, there'=
s no sense he's in there `fighting for us.' "=20
Such perceptions haven't had much effect on Bush's war-inflated popularity =
so far. But the situation could change--especially if Democrats succeed in =
arguing that special interests are benefiting from Bush's policies at Middl=
e America's expense. That loss of faith could send his approval ratings tum=
bling and jeopardize his presidency--just as it did for his dad a decade ag=
o.=20
Some of the faces of `Bush Inc.'=20
President Bush has been installing corporate leaders and lobbyists in promi=
nent positions throughout his administration, especially at the subcabinet =
level, where many important policies are formulated and implemented. In the=
 private sector, many of these appointees actively pushed for a pro-busines=
s agenda that included development of natural resources on public lands--an=
 ongoing source of controversy in Washington and across the country. A new =

Leavitt accepted $10,000 from Enron

01/15/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Gov. Mike Leavitt met with Enron Corp. executives las=
t year and solicited and received a $10,000 political contribution from the=
 now-bankrupt energy giant.=20
Leavitt said Monday that he met with Enron officials, including chairman Ke=
nneth L. Lay, in the normal work of his office.
"I probably first bumped into Enron government affairs officials four or fi=
ve years ago," he said.=20
He does not recall who suggested last year that Enron receive a solicitatio=
n for his yearly $10,000-per-person fund-raiser, according to a copyright s=
tory in the Deseret News.=20
"They do business in a number of Western states, although they don't operat=
e in Utah to my knowledge," Leavitt said.=20
The fund-raiser is sometimes used to help get GOP Western governors elected=
, so it makes sense the company would want to contribute, Leavitt said.=20
Enron's check came in on Nov. 6. On Nov. 16, Enron officials met with Leavi=
tt in his Capitol office to discuss energy policy, the governor said.=20
Leavitt said he doesn't specifically recall what they wanted to talk about,=
 although he surmises that they wanted to discuss transmission of electrici=
ty in the region.=20
Enron, based in Houston, became a major player in Texas and national politi=
cs through connections with a number of politicians, including President Bu=
sh. Now, four congressional committees, several lawsuits and a federal crim=
inal investigation are bearing down on Enron.=20
Leavitt, who considers Bush a friend and political ally, invited Enron lobb=
yists to his $10,000-per-person Cast and Blast fund-raiser at his family's =
Loa ranch last September. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the event w=
as rescheduled for November and turned from a weekend of fishing and huntin=
g to skiing and skating.=20
Fewer lobbyists and industry leaders attended the rescheduled event, but En=
ron's vice president of government affairs Paul Kaufman did, said Leavitt s=
pokeswoman Natalie Gochnour.=20
Lay is now being investigated for selling off $101 million of his Enron sto=
ck during the last year as Enron executives were sending out upbeat memos t=
o Enron employees, whose pension funds backed by Enron stock would ultimate=
ly be lost in the company's bankruptcy.=20
Leavitt said he never discussed Enron's money troubles with any Enron offic=
ial.=20
The $10,000 contribution came a month before Enron donated $100,000 to the =
federal Democratic Senate Committee the fund-raising PAC of Democratic U.S.=
 senators.=20
After Enron laid off thousands of workers and declared bankruptcy in Decemb=
er, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, the Democratic group announced =
it would donate the money to the laid-off workers.=20
Leavitt has not decided what to do with Enron's $10,000, said Gochnour.

rogram. Maybe it's a sign of something, or maybe it's just a short break in=
 both stories.
Enron, I'm absolutely certain, has a long way to go and I was troubled read=
ing the e-mails that came in after Friday's program about accusations of bi=
as. The accusations of bias were split, pretty much down the middle. Some f=
elt we had gone too soft on the administration. Others felt, in the words o=
f one writer, "we were licking our lips in anticipation of bringing the Rep=
ublicans down." It is, I think, pointless to argue with either. The coverag=
e was very careful.=20
So I'll tell both sides in this, please relax, take a breath. Let's just se=
e where this goes. It is very early in a complicated story. The business si=
de is complicated. So is the politics.=20
If there is a scandal there, if there is one, I hope we're the ones who unc=
over it. That's our business, but that's different from wishing for a scand=
al. We're proud of our coverage of the attacks on 9/11, but we didn't wish =
for it to happen. The right thing to do and what this program and CNN ought=
 to do, is just keep on digging, and the digging has just started.=20
So now, onto the whip we go on this 100 days since the war began, and the w=
hip begins at the Pentagon, CNN's Bob Franken. Bob just back from Cuba, a h=
eadline please.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)*******************
While all of us are working to make sense of the Enron collapse, thank good=
ness for the company's auditors, Andersen. We may not understand the comple=
xities of business accounting, but we do understand memos from lawyers tell=
ing accountants to destroy documents.=20
William Sapphire of the New York Times today titled his column, Andersengat=
e. As Sapphire put it, the accountants seemed to forget that the "P" in CPA=
 means public.=20
CNN Financial News Correspondent Allan Chernoff is here again to help us so=
rt through this one, and there's plenty to sort through tonight. Allan.=20
CHERNOFF: Aaron, tonight we have a new piece of the Enron puzzle. In fact, =
it is a letter from an Enron employee to the company's Chief Executive. The=
 employee was well aware that something was rotten in Houston.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
CHERNOFF (voice over): The letter to Chief Executive Ken Lay from an anonym=
ous female Enron employee, who appears to be well acquainted with the compa=
ny's accounting and it's (UNINTELLIGIBLE) partnerships.=20
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a r=
elated company. I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of a=
ccounting scandals. There are probably one or two disgruntled, redeployed e=
mployees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us in trouble."=
=20
The letter was written in August, two months before Enron confessed its pro=
fits had been inflated. Congressional investigators believe the writer met =
with Ken Lay for an hour to discuss here concerns and that Enron later told=
 its attorneys not to second-guess the accounting advice of Andersen, the a=
uditor that had approved Enron's books.=20
Tonight, Andersen is working damage control, releasing an e-mail about the =
Enron audit from in-house attorney Nancy Temple, to a partner at the Housto=
n office, saying:=20
"Consider reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retention =
policy."=20
Included in that policy, "only final documents will be retained. Graphs and=
 preliminary versions of information will be destroyed currently. Deletion =
of information from electronic files will be accomplished in such a way tha=
t precludes the possibility of subsequent retrieval by Arthur Andersen pers=
onnel or third parties."=20
Temple has told Andersen she was referring to an audit that was in progress=
, not previous audits that were later found to be faulty. Staffers at the H=
ouse Energy and Commerce Committee say Andersen destroyed documents as late=
 as last November, after Enron had restated its financials and the SEC had =
begun a formal investigation. Documents that should have been held indefini=
tely, according to accounting experts.=20
ALAN ANDERSON, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS: Well, if the records were subjec=
t to subpoena, and they are destroyed after the subpoena was rendered, that=
 would be more than unusual. That would be illegal.=20
CHERNOFF: Andersen Chief Executive, Joseph Beradino, is fighting dearly to =
save his company's battered reputation.=20
JOSEPH BERADINO, ANDERSEN CHIEF EXECUTIVE: Andersen will have to change to =
restore the public's interest and confidence, and we are working hard to id=
entify the changes we need to make.=20
CHERNOFF: Andersen was also the auditor that approved financials at Sunbeam=
, and Waste Management, companies that paid fines for crooking their books.=
=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
CHERNOFF (on camera): Another Big Five accounting firm is in trouble tonigh=
t. The Securities and Exchange Commission is censoring KPMG. The firm viola=
ted auditor independence rules at a time when it was a major investor in th=
e short-term investments trust. KPMG was also the auditor of the fund, part=
 of the AIM family of mutual funds. The SEC found that KPMG had no procedur=
es in place to avoid such conflicts. Aaron.=20
BROWN: Well that's great. Now I got to keep two accounting firms separate. =
Let's go back to Andersen and Enron for a minute. When you're talking to pe=
ople out there, no one knows how this is going to play out. But when you're=
 talking to people, do they believe that Andersen, which is a huge company,=
 will survive this?=20
CHERNOFF: There are questions being raised about this. We can't right away =
say that this is going to take the company down.=20
BROWN: No, I don't - right, we're not - I just want to know what people are=
 thinking out there.=20
CHERNOFF: The entire profession is in serious trouble right now, and they a=
re going to have to do something to improve their image. Clearly Andersen i=
s in the deepest trouble right now.=20
BROWN: If I were being even more cynical than I woke up this morning being,=
 I would come away with the feeling that these accounting firms, to get the=
 business that they get, and these are multi-million dollar accounts, will =
wink and nod if it is in their company, in the company's interest. Is that =
- am I being unfair here? CHERNOFF: Not in the least. In fact, there is you=
 could argue, an inherent conflict of interest, because you are hired by a =
certain company to review their books. If they don't like the way you revie=
w it, well they can go hire somebody else. There's another scandal here, po=
tentially. You could call it a scandal, in that the accounting firms also h=
ave had these auditing practices, and very often, and this was the case rig=
ht here with Enron, the firm was doing auditing and also doing consulting a=
t the same time.=20
BROWN: Allan, thank you. We're all going to get smarter about this before i=
t's over. Up next, this step's a little easier to understand. Small town mu=
rder story. We thought twice about doing it until we learned the town hasn'=
t seen a murder in more than 30 years, so we'll take a look at that. And th=
at's nowhere near the only interesting thing about it, as you'll hear when =
NEWSNIGHT continues on a Monday.=20
