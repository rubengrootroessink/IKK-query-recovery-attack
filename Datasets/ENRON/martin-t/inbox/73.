The defense of former Enron chief executive Kenneth L. Lay began yesterday =
when his wife suggested on national television that her husband was kept in=
 the dark as the nation's largest energy-trading company slipped into debil=
itating debt and collapsed, leaving thousands without jobs and life savings=
.=20
"There's some things that weren't -- that he wasn't told," Linda Lay told N=
BC's "Today" show.
Lay, alternately weepy and defiant, provided the first window into what her=
 husband's stance is likely to be if he testifies as scheduled before the S=
enate Commerce Committee on Monday. He faces congressional and Justice Depa=
rtment investigations and a barrage of civil suits charging that he misled =
shareholders, employees and the government about the well-being of Enron Co=
rp.=20
"Never, never, not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on t=
hat was illegal," Linda Lay said. "If those people had come to him and told=
 him that there was something wrong, he would have stopped it and fixed it.=
"=20
She maintained that her husband did not realize until "two or three days, m=
aybe, before everything fell apart" that he couldn't save Enron. She also s=
aid that she and her husband lost substantial amounts of money in the firm'=
s demise and are fighting personal bankruptcy.=20
Linda Lay's comments bluntly put into the public domain what Kenneth Lay's =
friends, family members and attorneys have been saying in recent weeks: The=
 man who helped build the aggressive, innovative energy company was not inv=
olved in the day-to-day details of its operations, trusting his executives,=
 former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and former chief financial officer=
 Andrew Fastow, to make the right choices. Today, Enron is expected to appo=
int an interim CEO to help restructure the company.=20
Some involved in the crisis scoffed at the notion that Lay was that far out=
 of the loop. "Enron's senior management had full knowledge of the transact=
ions and approved every aspect of them," Fastow's spokesman, Gordon Andrew,=
 said yesterday.=20
But Lay's defenders maintain that it's plausible that some things slipped b=
y him. "It's not that he wasn't in charge," said one member of Enron's vast=
 legal team said. "He was in charge, but a lot of things were kept from him=
 and procedures were put in place that didn't work, and he didn't know it u=
ntil it was too late."=20
According to this source, Lay relied heavily on the judgments of Skilling a=
nd Fastow, both of whom were involved in creating the partnerships that shi=
elded hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and overstated profits by n=
early $600 million since 1997. "Ken did not know that Fastow took out $30 m=
illion [in compensation] from [one such] partnership," the source said.=20
Lay himself, asked last year by the New York Times about the complicated pa=
rtnerships, said, "You're getting way over my head."=20
Everyone concedes that Lay spent an enormous amount of time on civic projec=
ts in recent years. A generous and high-profile activist and philanthropist=
, he assiduously worked the Houston community as well as the national polit=
ical scene. He and Enron were among President Bush's largest financial back=
ers.=20
"He has this persona as kind of a goodwill ambassador, so people want to be=
lieve that he didn't have his hands on the wheel of the ship when it went d=
own. The captain of the Exxon Valdez didn't get off easy," said one source =
familiar with Enron's inner workings.=20
Enron disclosed in November that the board had required Lay and other top e=
xecutives to review and approve every transaction of Fastow's partnerships.=
 But the company's outside counsel, Vinson & Elkins, reported that "in most=
 instances, there was no approval signature" by Enron's Office of the Chair=
man, headed by Lay. Whether the reviews were properly done is now under inv=
estigation by a special committee appointed by the board.=20
Lay received at least two warning memos from employees fearful that the com=
pany would be ruined by its complex and secretive accounting practices. In =
November, Enron admitted that accounting errors had led it to overstate pro=
fits.=20
Lay's detractors question why he did not push harder to investigate the emp=
loyees' concerns.=20
Lay's defenders, however, said he relied on Vinson & Elkins, who advised En=
ron that the concerns of Vice President Sherron Watkins did not, "in our ju=
dgment, warrant a further widespread investigation by independent counsel a=
nd auditors."=20
But the law firm also said "there is serious risk of adverse publicity and =
litigation" over the partnerships' activities. The V&E reviewers said they =
briefed Lay about their findings.=20
Lay helped form Enron in 1985, when Houston Natural Gas, which he headed, m=
erged with InterNorth Inc. He took over as CEO in 1986, helping to transfor=
m a sleepy pipeline company into one of the globe's largest, most aggressiv=
e energy-trading firms.=20
He stepped down as CEO about a year ago, passing the reins to Skilling -- a=
 brash former business consultant hired by Enron in 1990. Lay remained chai=
rman of the board, and when Skilling unexpectedly resigned six months later=
, Lay returned as CEO, at a time -- his family maintains -- that he was try=
ing to retire.=20
Linda Lay yesterday also defended her husband's public comments made as lat=
e as October assuring employees that everything was okay with the company a=
nd encouraging people to buy stock even as the price spiraled downward. "He=
 totally 100 percent believed in it," she said. "He believed it would be ok=
ay."=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. Lay resigned from the company last week =
at the urging of Enron's creditors and is spending all his time dealing wit=
h lawyers, auditors and accountants preparing for his congressional testimo=
ny. One lawyer close to Lay, who requested anonymity, said that Lay was sti=
ll committed to testifying even though some of his attorneys have advised h=
im that speaking publicly could be risky legally.=20
In the NBC interview, taped over the weekend, Linda Lay also painted a blea=
k picture of her husband's personal finances, saying that the couple were h=
eavily invested in Enron and they are now "fighting for liquidity."=20
"We don't want to go bankrupt," she said. "Other than the home we live in, =
everything we own is for sale." That includes three multimillion-dollar hom=
es in Aspen, Colo., as well as a weekend getaway in Galveston, Tex.=20
"By anyone's standards it was a massive amount of money, and it's gone," La=
y said of her husband's $300 million in compensation and stocks from Enron =
over the past four years. "There's nothing left. Everything we had was most=
ly in Enron stock."=20
In Sugar Land, Tex.,, police still declined to disclose the contents of the=
 note left by former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found =
dead of a gunshot wound in his Mercedes-Benz on Friday. They said that whil=
e the autopsy reports had ruled the death a suicide, the investigation woul=
d remain open until all the evidence is tested.=20

Wife: Lay did no wrong but couldn't stop crash=20
By BILL MURPHY=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 29, 2002, 12:42AM
The wife of former Enron Chairman Ken Lay said he would have acted to fix t=
he company's problems if he hadn't been kept in the dark by accountants fro=
m Arthur Andersen and outside legal counsel.=20
"There's some things that weren't -- that he wasn't told," Linda Lay said d=
uring an interview aired on NBC's Today show Monday. "There's some things t=
hat the board of directors weren't -- didn't know. But that will come out i=
n the investigation."=20
During the interview, Lay described her and her husband's attempt to stave =
off personal bankruptcy, defended her husband's integrity and said he belie=
ves Enron can recover.=20
The Lays declined to be interviewed by the Chronicle. A public relations fi=
rm representing the family said Linda Lay and her children would do no more=
 interviews for the time being.=20
She said she understands why her husband is the focal point of many people'=
s anger.=20
"He is at the top. That's where it ought to be," Lay said. "If I were back =
there listening to all the things that were being said, I would absolutely =
have to say that: `What is wrong here? How can all of this be happening wit=
hout something -- someone doing something terribly evil?' "=20
She praised Sherron Watkins, Enron vice president of corporate development,=
 for sending her husband a memo Aug. 15 and later meeting with him to discu=
ss her concerns about the company's practice of hiding losses in off-the-bo=
ok accounts.=20
"He had their, their outside counsel (Vinson & Elkins law firm) come in and=
 the accounting firm look at it," Lay said, "and they came back and told hi=
m it was fine."=20
Asked if her husband, who resigned as Enron's chairman last week, felt let =
down by accountants and lawyers, she replied, "Absolutely. Absolutely. Neve=
r, never, not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that w=
as illegal. If those people had come back to him and told him there was som=
ething wrong, he would have stopped and fixed it."=20
Days after receiving Watkins' memo, Ken Lay exercised options on more than =
92,000 shares of Enron stock but did not sell it. That effectively repaid a=
 $2 million loan from the company.=20
A month after Watkins warned about looming financial scandal, Lay told empl=
oyees in an e-mail session that the company was sound and urged them to buy=
 stock. Less than three weeks later, the company reported a third-quarter l=
oss of $618 million and and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=
=20
"My husband tells the truth," Linda Lay said. "He's not a liar. He totally,=
 100 percent believed in it. He believed it would be OK."=20
She said "everything we own is for sale" in an effort to stave off personal=
 bankruptcy, even though her husband earned more than $300 million in compe=
nsation and salary the past four years.=20
"By anyone's standards, it was a massive amount of money," Linda Lay said, =
"and it's gone. It's gone. There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly w=
as in Enron stock."=20
The Lays did not diversify their investments much, including their 401(k), =
she said.=20
"Why wouldn't I put it in Enron? Why wouldn't I?" she said. "My husband was=
 Enron. He believed in it."=20
The Lays own substantial property. In Harris and Galveston counties and Asp=
en, Colo., they have homes and properties worth at least $27 million.=20
Three of their four Aspen properties were up for sale earlier this month: a=
 4,500-square-foot home listed at $6.8 million; a 4,500-square-foot riverfr=
ont home listed at $6.5 million; and a 20,000-square-foot vacant lot listed=
 at $2.9 million.=20
Their Houston home, a 12,800-square-foot condominium in the Huntingdon luxu=
ry high-rise, has five bedrooms and 6 1/2 baths. It has an assessed market =
value of $7.1 million.=20
They own jointly or separately at least 13 homes and apartment homes in Har=
ris and Galveston counties. Those include a home on Avalon Place assessed a=
t $742,000, a home on Sul Ross Street assessed at $320,000 and a home in Ga=
lveston assessed at $790,000.=20
"We're fighting for liquidity," she said. "We, we don't want to go bankrupt=
. And we've had long-term investments, and those long-term investments have=
 cash calls. Other than the home we live in, everything we own is for sale.=
"=20
She began crying when she recounted a conversation with her husband after h=
e realized bankruptcy was inevitable.=20
"He was very emotional about it," she said. "He said he just didn't think h=
e could stop it. He said he tried everything, everything he could think of,=
 and he couldn't stop it."=20
She said she and her husband were devastated by the suicide of former Enron=
 Vice Chairman Cliff Baxter on Friday.=20
"My husband has spoken to him not too long ago, and Cliff is a, a -- was a =
wonderful man."=20
Most analysts say Enron -- under investigation by the Justice Department fo=
r possible criminal wrongdoing and by 11 congressional committees -- has no=
 chance of avoiding liquidation. But Lay says her husband remains optimisti=
c that the company can emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to beco=
me profitable again.=20
Consultants who specialize in corporate and political damage control were d=
ivided on whether Lay's interview will help her husband's cause.=20
Ken Fairchild, principal owner of Fairchild Consulting in Dallas, said the =
Lays should tell their side of the story since there has been so much negat=
ive coverage of Ken Lay's role in Enron's collapse. Ken Lay's lawyers have =
advised him not to do interviews.=20
Ken Lay would have been grilled by an interviewer, but Linda Lay got much e=
asier questions because she is his wife and claims to be a victim as well b=
ecause her own retirement has evaporated, said Fairchild, author of Sunday =
Showdowns with 60 Minutes, an account of how he prepared more than 30 corpo=
rate executives for appearances on the news show.=20
"Obviously, it was a good move," said Fairchild. "It doesn't work unless th=
e person really believes what she is saying. They have to believe they are =
telling the truth, and they have to look like they are telling the truth. A=
nd that certainly sounds like the case here."=20
But Houston political consultant Allen Blakemore said there is little to be=
 gained by calling on your wife to defend your integrity.=20
"She's being trotted out to make an appeal to people's emotions," Blakemore=
 said. "Should we go ask his mother if he cleaned up his room or picked up =
his bath towel? None of this stuff is relevant."=20
Gloria Alvarez, who was laid off from her job as senior administrative assi=
stant for Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, said Linda Lay's interview was p=
redictable.=20
"She's the wife of the CEO," Alvarez said. "Of course she's going to defend=
 her husband, as any wife would."=20
Nathan Childs, who was laid off from Enron's information technology hardwar=
e department, is living in a trailer on his parents' property in Kempner.=
=20
"I can't cry for the Lays right now. They have a home to go to every night,=
" Childs said. "It doesn't matter what she says; Ken Lay's got more than ex=
-Enron employees."=20

Enron Workers File Suit Over 'Staggering Losses'

Enron Corp. employees past and present who said they suffered "staggering l=
osses" in their retirement funds filed a lawsuit Monday seeking reimburseme=
nt from top company executives.=20
The legal action came as the wife of ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Ke=
nneth L. Lay was claiming in a television appearance that the couple are ne=
arly broke.
The group of more than 400 Enron employees, whose 401(k) retirement plans a=
re now virtually worthless, contends in the federal lawsuit filed in Housto=
n that employees were urged to invest in Enron stock but were not told how =
fragile the company's financial condition was. Enron filed for Chapter 11 b=
ankruptcy protection Dec. 2.=20
The suit names as defendants Lay, former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling and former=
 Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, among others. Those three execut=
ives sold more than $198 million in stock, the suit alleges. The suit also =
names Northern Trust Co., trustee for the retirement plan, and Andersen, En=
ron's former accountant.=20
"Enron executives were profiting from an elaborate shell game, using the ha=
rd-earned retirement savings of their loyal employees," Randy McClanahan, a=
 lawyer representing the group, said in a statement.=20
This is the latest in dozens of lawsuits filed against current and former E=
nron executives, accusing them of misleading investors. The company and its=
 officers have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.=20
So did Linda Lay, who defended her husband, in a taped interview aired Mond=
ay on NBC's "Today" show, as an "honest, decent, moral human being who woul=
d do absolutely nothing wrong."=20
Lay, appearing bitter and emotional, told NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers=
 that everything the family owns is for sale except the opulent Houston hom=
e where the interview took place over the weekend. Ken Lay, Myers noted, ha=
s been advised by his lawyers to avoid speaking to the media.=20
Lay acknowledged that her husband earned "a massive amount of money." Howev=
er, she added: "It's all gone. There's nothing left. Everything we had most=
ly was in Enron stock."=20
The couple's wealth has been further drained by cash calls on other long-te=
rm investments, and the Lays are nearly bankrupt, she said. Lay said that s=
he understands the anger being focused on her husband but that he did not k=
now all that occurred at Enron before the company crumbled into insolvency.=
=20
Public relations professionals, who asked not to be identified, saw the int=
erview as a desperate move to humanize Ken Lay--but one that may not play w=
ell.=20

Enron's System Has New Owners, But Will It Fly?

As UBS AG prepares to take over Enron Corp.'s once-powerful energy trading =
operation, the Swiss bank faces a question: When the trading system flicks =
back on, will Enron's former customers come with it?=20
Since Enron's meltdown late last year, competitors have been whittling at t=
he flagship oil, natural-gas and electricity trading business that UBS is t=
aking over. While some customers will go over to the new entity, which has =
been dormant for two months, others say they may stay away.
"I can't imagine us dealing with them," said George Hickox, chief executive=
 of Wiser Oil Co., a former customer and current Enron creditor that has si=
nce taken its trading business to Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hickox said he'd be i=
nclined not to go back unless the Enron bankruptcy plan "is good enough to =
make us feel that we're not doing business with someone who shafted us."=20
While companies like Reliant Energy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Cor=
p. have stepped up their energy-trading operations since the Enron collapse=
 -- as have the energy trading desks at Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chas=
e & Co. -- other Enron trading operations may have simply evaporated. Tradi=
ng in fiber-optic bandwidth and weather derivatives, for instance, weren't =
bought by UBS and aren't being picked up by others, raising questions about=
 how vibrant the businesses were in the first place.=20
The fortunes of Enron's former energy-trading business are being closely wa=
tched on Wall Street. Historically, it has been difficult for trading compa=
niess to stop operating, as Enron has done since filing for bankruptcy-cour=
t protection on Dec. 2, and then ratchet up the business again.=20
In addition, revitalizing the Enron trading operation is critical to maximi=
zing the recovery by Enron's creditors, who are owed billions. At its peak,=
 Enron enjoyed a 15% market share in natual-gas trading, and 20% in power, =
competitors estimate.=20
In an interview, UBS Warburg Chief Executive Officer John Costas expressed =
confidence that with a new name -- UBS Warburg Energy -- and UBS's credit r=
ating behind the operation, customers will return. "You have to win clients=
 one by one," said Mr. Costas. "If we're able to replicate everything they =
had in terms of capabilities on a AA+ credit-rated platform, there's a pret=
ty high probability of success."=20
The trading unit, which includes its EnronOnline Internet-based trading pla=
tform, generated roughly 90% of Enron's earnings in the most recent quarter=
, although accounting questions have clouded Enron's financial results. Mr.=
 Costas declined to comment on how Enron accounted for the unit's trading r=
evenues.=20
Some traders expect UBS to take a much more cautious approach than Enron as=
 it rebuilds the trading operation. Moreoever, many of the companies that w=
ere stuck in trading contracts with Enron itself may be gun-shy about doing=
 business with its successor, having struggled to unwind their Enron trades=
. "At the end of the day, nobody is going to undo the efforts they just wen=
t through to come back to Enron," said Charlie Sanchez, energy-markets mana=
ger for Gelber & Associates, an energy consulting firm in Houston.=20
In bidding on the unit, UBS beat out Citigroup Inc. in a bankruptcy-court a=
uction that concluded Jan. 11. Under the deal, UBS isn't offering any cash =
to Enron for its trading operations and isn't taking over its trading portf=
olio. Instead, it agreed to pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third o=
f the energy-trading operation's pretax profit for a 10-year period. UBS ha=
s an option to eliminate the royalty payments by buying out Enron's stake i=
n the profits. The agreement doesn't require UBS to inject any minimum amou=
nt of capital, nor supply any minimum amount of credit.=20
While the terms of the deal seem to limit UBS's risk in taking over a spect=
acularly tainted business, some trading experts say the deal poses other pe=
rils.=20
"UBS is taking a fair degree of risk in buying this operation," maintained =
Henry T. C. Hu, professor of banking law and finance law at the University =
of Texas School of Law. "They've invested, in a sense, their reputation. If=
 it turns out they misjudged the plusses of the Enron deal, it may undermin=
e their image in the eyes of customers and potential customers."=20
UBS hasn't yet spelled out how it will restart the Enron unit, which will b=
e run by Michael Hutchins, UBS Warburg's co-head of bond operations. UBS sa=
id it intends to use its assets to back the trades of the new operation. "W=
e're going to provide the necessary capital and credit support to ensure th=
e success of the business," said Mr. Costas.=20
Since winning the auction, UBS has been working to hire Enron trading emplo=
yees it deems key to the new operation. UBS said yesterday it had signed on=
 about 625 of the Enron trading group's 800 employees.=20
Enron's competitors are also in the hunt for talent. "The number of resumes=
 flying around this industry from Enron traders is amazing," says Harvey Pa=
dewer, president of the energy-services unit of Duke Energy, an Enron compe=
titor. Mr. Padewer said his company has received more than 500 resumes, and=
 hired about two dozen, including a dozen traders.=20
As Enron's woes unfolded, industry analysts say the trading activity quickl=
y shifted from its online platform to several competitors. In a few cases, =
smaller companies that couldn't find companies like Enron to guarantee thei=
r trades simply got out of the market.=20
The online IntercontinentalExchange seems to be the biggest winner, with it=
s overall volume up about 65% since the Enron collapse began. On the New Yo=
rk Mercantile Exchange's trading floor, energy trading volume is up 71% thi=
s month, while Duke Energy reported a 77% year-over-year increase in electr=
icity trading in the fourth quarter, due in part to Enron's collapse.=20
Despite such an abundance of busy trading outlets, Mr. Costas contends that=
 the widening of spreads on energy trades since the collapse of Enron indic=
ates that there isn't enough liquidity in the marketplace. "The markets are=
 telling us if we restore liquidity, we're going to be able to capture mark=
et share," he said.=20
Nymex President J. Robert Collins cautioned against attributing his exchang=
e's recent volume gains entirely to Enron, considering that natural-gas tra=
ding tends to be busiest during the winter heating season anyway.=20
"It's hard to characterize whether we've seen a lot of business or a little=
," because of Enron, said Mr. Collins. "It's definitely helped, but just ho=
w much is very difficult to know."=20

Doubts Increasing About Enron's Ability To Reorganize
By Kathy Chu

01/29/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- What little confidence remains in Enron Corp.'s (ENR=
NQ) ability to reorganize itself is rapidly waning.
Amid allegations of document shredding and other misdeeds by Enron executiv=
es, creditors are becoming more aggressive in their criticism of the compan=
y, and more vocal in their demands for information.=20
In the past week, a movement to appoint an independent trustee to take cont=
rol of the company or an examiner to investigate wrongdoing has been brewin=
g. Also, creditors are petitioning the court to segregate the cash flowing =
into one of Enron's units, saying that the parent company can't be trusted =
to keep accurate records and to divvy up funds appropriately among its subs=
idiaries.=20
They also want detailed accounting of cash flows for some of the bankrupt s=
ubsidiaries - information that Enron isn't required to submit to federal Ju=
dge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern Distri=
ct of New York, for another five months.=20
The continuing source of Enron's troubles: a colossal collapse of confidenc=
e that first brought the company to its knees late last year, and now is th=
reatening to endanger its reorganization efforts.=20
Andrew Entwistle, of the Entwistle & Cappucci law firm, which represents a =
Florida state pension fund that lost $334 million in Enron-related investme=
nts, said he has "very grave concerns" about the company's ability to overs=
ee its own operations in light of recent disclosures.=20
The Florida State Board of Administration hasn't joined the movement to get=
 a trustee named, according to Entwistle, but "may yet find that it's neces=
sary."=20
Lately, even Enron has been less optimistic about prospects for getting bac=
k on its feet quickly.=20
When asked a little more than a week ago about whether Enron will emerge fr=
om bankruptcy within a year - as the company had previously said it would -=
 Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said that reorganization will be c=
ompleted "as soon as possible." He declined to give a specific timeframe.=
=20
Examiner More Likely Than Trustee=20

The naming of a trustee to wrench Enron North America out of the hands of t=
he parent company isn't likely because of the disruption this would have on=
 already complex bankruptcy proceedings, according to legal experts.=20
But the odds are increasing for having an examiner assigned to the case to =
investigate wrongdoing, according to experts, as allegations of corporate m=
isconduct by Enron executives pile up.=20
Under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, "fraud, dishonesty, incompetence o=
r gross mismanagement" are grounds that could warrant the appointment of an=
 independent trustee or examiner.=20
Pending investigations by the Department of Justice and at least 10 congres=
sional committees could yield information useful to Enron's bankruptcy proc=
eedings, but these probes could take months, if not years, to be completed,=
 according to Jack Williams, the outgoing scholar at the American Bankruptc=
y Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va.=20
This may provide justification for Judge Gonzalez to name an examiner, in o=
rder to investigate specific aspects of Enron's complex business operations=
 on a court-dictated timeline.=20
Also, if the judge feels that ongoing investigations aren't "full or fair,"=
 he may revert to this legal option, said Williams.=20
A half-dozen energy concerns and the Regents of the University of Californi=
a are spearheading the effort to name either a trustee or examiner in the c=
ase, the largest bankruptcy in history.=20
Some of these same creditors also are taking issue with Enron's cash manage=
ment system, and are petitioning the bankruptcy court to segregate Enron No=
rth America's funds for that unit's creditors.=20
This will prevent "future plundering" of the estate by other bankrupt entit=
ies, according to Wiser Oil Co. (WZR), an Enron creditor owed about $7 mill=
ion on energy trades.=20
The Enron North America unit includes the core wholesale trading operations=
, which comprised about 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last y=
ear. This business was recently sold to UBS Warburg for future profit payou=
ts, with no cash up front.=20
Under the current cash management system, funds are swept up to the parent =
company, which is charged with keeping track of which unit is owed money. T=
his system is commonly used to centralize a company's finances and keep the=
 accounting simple, according to legal experts.=20
Requiring Enron to implement a separate system for Enron North America will=
 entail "a significant expenditure of time and effort on the part of the De=
btors' employees and retained professionals," the company said in a court f=
iling on Sunday.=20
It also would be a wasted step if Enron ever decides to enact a substantive=
 consolidation, which would sweep all of the company's assets into one pot =
and allocate them to a greater pool of creditors.=20
"It's too early to think about" this possibility, Enron attorney Brian Rose=
n, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, said earlier this month.=20
The company believes that the cash management system is sufficient to prote=
ct creditors because a subsidiary's cash flow will "continue to be subject =
to the guidelines of budgets and business plans for each individual Debtor.=
"=20
Also, because most of the company's units have been pledged as collateral u=
nder a debtor-in-possession facility led by J.P. Morgan Chase Inc. (JPM) an=
d Citigroup Inc. (C), any money borrowed will be "repaid by entities whose =
creditors benefit" from the loan, according to Enron.=20
The final size of Enron's financing has yet to be decided, but banking sour=
ces familiar with the deal have said it could be less than $500 million. Th=
is compares with $1.5 billion originally expected under the facility, which=
 Enron has yet to draw upon.=20

DESTRUCTION OF ENRON AUDIT DOCUMENTS
EDWARD J. MARKEY

02/24/2002
Congressional Testimony by Federal Document Clearing House
(Copyright 2002 by Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.)

JANUARY 24, 2002=20
OPENING STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDWARD J. MARKEY (D-MA)
OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE=20
HEARING ON DESTRUCTION OF ENRON-RELATED DOCUMENTS OF ARTHUR ANDERSON PERSON=
NEL THURSDAY,=20
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for extending to me the courtesy of participating =
in today's hearing.=20
I think it is outrageous that the same executives who may be responsible fo=
r the destruction of workers' pensions -- and the destruction of documents =
that might prove their guilt -- are currently protected by Congress when de=
frauded worker's actually try to recover their life savings. But, sadly, it=
 is true. Why? Because in 1995, Arthur Anderson and the other big accountin=
g firms succeeded in lobbying Congress to strictly limit their future liabi=
lity for securities fraud. That bill passed over the President's veto as pa=
rt of the Republican Contract with America. And today, we are seeing the gr=
im results -- Arthur Anderson can no longer be held jointly and severally l=
iable when a court has found them guilty of securities fraud. I believe tha=
t this ill-advised law has directly contributed to a rising tide of account=
ing failures, culminating in the Enron-Arthur Anderson fiasco. The types of=
 internal checks and balances that a healthy concern about litigation risk =
used to create within each accounting firm has been undermined. The many ho=
nest and decent people who want to do the right thing get overruled, and th=
e increasing revenues coming from consulting and non-audit businesses put g=
rowing pressure to sign off on the `cooked books' of major clients.=20
Yesterday, I introduced legislation aimed helping to address this problem. =
This bill would, among other things, require auditors to retain copies of a=
ll documents generated during the course of an audit for a period of four y=
ears and establish criminal penalties of up to ten years imprisonment for a=
uditors that knowingly and willfully destroy such documents. The bill also =
would reform the liability standards applicable to accountants in securitie=
s fraud cases and provide an exemption from the "Catch 22" discovery stay t=
hat allows accounting firms to escape accountability for their actions. I l=
ook forward to working with Members on this and other reforms. Clearly, we =
have a system that is very broken, and we need to work together to fix it.=
=20
Today's hearing is focused on the disturbing reports that employees of Arth=
ur Anderson have destroyed documents in connection with the Enron debacle. =
I think it's appalling that Anderson CEO Joseph Berardino has declined the =
Subcommittee's invitation to testify on this matter, when he was somehow ab=
le to make an appearance on Meet the Press last Sunday. I have also read th=
at Mr. Berardino has agreed to appear before the House Financial Services C=
ommittee on February 4th. If Mr. Berardino can appear to answer questions o=
n national television and before other Committees, it seems to me that he s=
hould be able to appear before this Subcommittee so that we can get to the =
bottom of why his firm destroyed documents being sought by the SEC, by the =
Justice Department, and by defrauded workers and investors.=20
Now, I have many questions about the underlying transactions and investment=
s whose accounting treatment helped to bring Enron to bankruptcy, but I und=
erstand that this is not the subject of today's hearing. I would merely hop=
e, Mr. Chairman, that we will have a chance to thoroughly examine Enron's i=
nvestments in broadband, its energy trading operations, and its derivatives=
 and other structured financings in the detail needed to understand just wh=
at happened here and what lessons we can learn from this massive fraud and =
misbehavior. That will require more than a single hearing of all of the pri=
ncipals to do properly.=20
Thanks again, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate in today's heari=
ng. I look forward to the testimony.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The city of Sugar Land, Texas, has requested that th=
e Texas Attorney General decide whether the contents of a suicide note foun=
d in the car of former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive J. Clifford Baxter wil=
l be released to the public.=20
Baxter, 43 years old, was found dead early Friday morning in his parked Mer=
cedes Benz by police on a routine patrol in the affluent Houston suburb.
Although a coroner has ruled Baxter's death a suicide, the Sugar Land Polic=
e Department is continuing a full investigation in accordance with procedur=
e. The investigation includes ballistic tests, fingerprinting and hair and =
fiber analysis, police said.=20
The police department had not yet received the medical examiner's official =
report as of Tuesday morning.=20
The suicide note found in the vehicle has been under seal while the investi=
gation proceeds.=20
The police department has completed its review of the note and doesn't obje=
ct to the release of its contents, said Sugar Land city attorney Joe Morris=
. "However, under Texas law, the contents of the note raise confidentially =
issues, including right-to-privacy questions that prohibit the city from re=
leasing the note without first receiving a determination from the Texas Att=
orney General."=20
According to Morris, the city must submit a request for an Attorney General=
 ruling within 10 business days from the first request for the note. The fi=
rst request was received Jan. 25.=20
The Attorney General has 45 business days to make a determination, unless e=
xtended.=20
Baxter, who resigned as vice chairman of Enron last May, was reported to ha=
ve complained about Enron's questionable accounting practices. Baxter was s=
ubpoenaed to appear in front of two congressional committees and was named =
in an insider trading lawsuit.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in early December, the largest in the=

Anytime a stock market bubble bursts, a business scandal that epitomizes th=
e excesses of that particular period is seldom far behind. The Roaring '20s=
 had Teapot Dome. The end of the bull market in the early 1970s was marked =
by the collapse of Equity Funding Corp. The 1980s, of course, had Michael M=
ilken.=20
Until recently it wasn't easy to choose the scandal that encapsulated the 1=
990s bubble. That's not because there was a shortage of sleazy behavior but=
 rather because there was an abundance of it. Rampant conflicts of interest=
 on Wall Street. Wildly creative accounting. Auditors who didn't audit. Mon=
ey managers who didn't manage. A stunning lack of oversight by regulators. =
We could go on.
But now the wait is over: Enron's bankruptcy is, without doubt, the grand f=
inale of the last decade of the 20th century. The company's rise and fall w=
as made possible by a willingness to overlook--and indeed, for a time, even=
 to reward--all of the above behavior.=20
Then there's the politics. The hint of impropriety at the highest levels of=
 government has cemented the energy giant's place in history, producing a b=
arrage of coverage that has even supplanted the war in Afghanistan as the l=
ead story in newspapers. That alone, in today's weird circular logic, would=
 be enough to make a nonresponse by the political system nearly impossible.=
=20
But politics are almost beside the point. As a financial scandal, Enron is =
much bigger than anyone imagined--and, more important, the factors that ena=
bled it haven't gone away. "Systemic conflicts of interest are more pervasi=
ve and corrosive than either Congress, regulators, investors, or the press =
appreciate," Scott Cleland, CEO of the Precursor Group, an independent rese=
arch firm, said in congressional testimony. "The breathtakingly swift colla=
pse of Enron is no isolated incident that can be dismissed as unique, brush=
ed under the rug, and ignored." The real question should be not whether the=
 Enron debacle will change anything, but how much and how soon?=20
The most scintillating Enron tidbits are emerging from a nondescript set of=
 rooms on Capitol Hill, filled with some 40 boxes of documents from the com=
pany and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. Over the past few weeks as many as t=
en people, four of them working full- time, have been combing through the b=
oxes. On the wall of a room is a map laying out details of Enron's controve=
rsial myriad partnerships. The investigation is being conducted by the Hous=
e Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Louisiana's Billy Tauzin, whose=
 work makes it seem unlikely that the financial story will be buried by eit=
her its sheer complexity or the unfolding political sideshow.=20
What has the committee discovered? For one thing, founder and chairman Ken =
Lay, who often came across as clueless as Enron unraveled, deserves a great=
 deal of blame. If nothing else, Lay allowed a culture of rule breaking to =
flourish, and he obviously misled investors. Enron's adventures in creative=
 accounting are not a recent development. Back in mid-1995, Jim Alexander, =
then CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, walked into Lay's office to rep=
ort concerns he had about Enron's numbers for overseas projects. "I told hi=
m I had heard there were manifold serious problems with the [accounting on]=
 international projects," Alexander recalls. Lay's reaction? Nothing.=20
That wasn't the only warning. One of the most remarkable documents unearthe=
d by Energy and Commerce researchers was an unsigned seven- page letter fro=
m Enron vice president Sherron Watkins to Lay, written on Aug. 15, 2001. Th=
e letter informed him, among other things, that Enron executives "consisten=
tly and constantly" questioned the company's accounting methods to senior o=
fficials, including former CEO Jeff Skilling. "I am incredibly nervous that=
 we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wrote. That was aro=
und the same time Lay was telling Wall Street that there weren't any "accou=
nting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron. Two months later=
, when Enron announced its quarterly financial results, Lay had this to say=
: "The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadin=
g market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."=
=20
In reality, of course, Enron was a bigger financial scandal than even the m=
ost critical observers believed. Watkins' letter makes it clear that the pa=
rtnerships and off-balance-sheet entities that Enron created weren't used j=
ust to "reduce risk," as the company claimed repeatedly last fall. They wer=
e used to cook the books, plain and simple. "That's just too bad, too fraud=
ulent, surely AA&Co. wouldn't let them get away with that," wrote Watkins, =
anticipating the reaction should outsiders begin to dig into the accounting=
.=20
If Arthur Andersen hadn't "let them get away with it," what would Enron's e=
arnings have looked like? How much of the $101 billion in revenues that Enr=
on reported in 2000 were created via multiple transactions with entities th=
at weren't independent third parties? And the partnerships are only part of=
 the story. The other issue is Enron's overly aggressive use of mark-to-mar=
ket accounting. There's nothing wrong with this method of accounting, which=
 entails pricing securities at their fair value and running gains or losses=
 through the income statement. But in illiquid markets, like those for long=
- term energy contracts, there's no benchmark of fair value. So Enron often=
 relied on internal models--which creates serious potential for abuse. And =
because Skilling and Lay had established a culture in which earnings growth=
 was paramount, managers had plenty of incentive to push the limits.=20
Enron's much-hyped North American trading operation, which at one point acc=
ounted for the majority of its reported earnings and $70 billion valuation,=
 is now nearly worthless. After the company declared bankruptcy, it set out=
 to find a well-capitalized third party and create a joint venture to resta=
rt the trading operation. Only two firms--UBS Warburg and Citigroup--were i=
nterested (although BP Amoco did offer $25 million for some pieces of Enron=
's technology). UBS Warburg, the winning bidder, will pay Enron a third of =
any pretax profits for ten years and has the option to buy the business out=
right for a multiple of the previous years' profits--but UBS is not assumin=
g any of the business' liabilities. In other words, UBS basically got a fre=
e option on the business.=20
All this makes Enron a political issue, but not for the obvious reasons. Mu=
ch has been made of the multiple phone calls that Enron executives placed d=
uring the company's dying days to Administration officials--including Treas=
ury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Commerce Secretary=
 Don Evans, and Treasury's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Peter Fishe=
r. But despite the money that Enron lavished on all sorts of people, no one=
 came to its rescue. And whatever influence Enron had on energy policy (acc=
ording to one former employee, Vice President Dick Cheney had only one sit-=
 down meeting with Lay in early 2001, and he opposed Enron on such key issu=
es as the Kyoto Accord and nuclear power), the company isn't around to enjo=
y the benefits.=20
The bigger political issue is not Enron's input on energy matters but rathe=
r its earlier influence on financial policies. Most notably, Enron lobbied =
for legislation, passed in 2000, that exempted much of its energy-trading b=
usiness from oversight. That legislation passed through the Senate Banking =
Committee, which was chaired by Phil Gramm, a big recipient of Enron funds;=
 his wife, Wendy, sat on Enron's board. Enron also lobbied for mark-to-mark=
et accounting; in 1998 the Emerging Issues Task Force, which is backed by t=
he Financial Accounting Standards Board, said that energy-trading contracts=
 should be booked on that basis--but the agency included few guidelines for=
 valuing illiquid contracts.=20
Clearly, the fallout from Enron has only just begun. One obvious candidate =
for change is the accounting business. Enron is just the latest in a long s=
tring of disasters for the industry--remember Waste Management, Sunbeam, an=
d Cendant?--but it's by far the biggest. And Arthur Andersen is facing not =
just a slap on the wrist but a battle for survival. That won't be easy, giv=
en that Andersen is the only one with deep pockets left standing--and Enron=
's legal strategy will be to say that complicated transactions were left to=
 the judgment of its accounting firm. Mark L. Cheffers, a former accounting=
 litigation consultant who is now CEO of Accountingmalpractice.com, estimat=
es that Andersen may be exposed to $10 billion to $20 billion in liabilitie=
s. The previous largest settlement of an accounting case was the $335 milli=
on Ernst & Young paid to settle claims related to Cendant. Putting legal li=
abilities aside, Andersen may not have much of a business left. "The tremen=
dous damage done to their credibility will make it extremely difficult to a=
ttract business to their firm," says Lynn Turner, the SEC's former chief ac=
countant. One portfolio manager says that if a company is audited by Anders=
en, he simply won't invest in it.=20
All that may finally be enough to give accountants backbone. The fact that =
even lay people now realize that the profession is a mess may give regulato=
rs the clout they didn't have when Arthur Levitt, the former head of the SE=
C, tried to enact reforms a few years ago. At that time the cognoscenti wer=
e well aware of the conflicts that accounting firms faced--but no one cared=
 enough to make the situation change. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt has now call=
ed for an organization that would discipline accountants for ethical violat=
ions.=20
But while Arthur Andersen has much to answer for, current accounting rules =
allowed Enron a great deal of latitude. In the view of some, there are actu=
ally too many rules, because rules inevitably leave loopholes that can be e=
xploited and create a mindset where form is more important than substance. =
Contrast that with Britain, where accountants have a "true and fair" overri=
de, which they use if the accounting treatment follows the letter of the la=
w but doesn't fully reflect the economics of a transaction.=20
Another good candidate for reform is retirement plans. The talk is that Con=
gress will finally put limits on what percent of a plan's total assets can =
be in company stock--perhaps 20%--and make it easier for ordinary employees=
 to sell their shares. Oddly enough, there's less discussion about options,=
 although the fact that Enron executives were able to sell $1 billion in st=
ock over the past decade is precisely because they were given such generous=
 option grants. If accounting laws had mandated that the cost of those opti=
ons be reflected in reported earnings, would Enron--which cared deeply abou=
t reported earnings--have enriched its executives to such an extent?=20
But the area most in need of reform is the one that is least likely to chan=
ge. That's Wall Street. Although Enron's inadequate financial disclosure ma=
de it impossible to ascertain the company's true condition, those who bothe=
red to read its documents saw enough-- including curious mentions of the pa=
rtnerships as early as 2000--to be suspicious. Despite the professions of s=
hock about Enron's liberal use of off-balance-sheet entities, when CFO maga=
zine bestowed the "Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management" on fo=
rmer CFO Andy Fastow in 1999, analysts and rating agencies raved about his =
creative use of such "unique" financing techniques. And the fact that execu=
tives were selling stock at a frightening pace was publicly available infor=
mation. Skeptics eventually made fortunes shorting the stock. Why didn't an=
yone else care? Perhaps because when everyone-- money managers, analysts, b=
anks, management--benefits from a soaring stock, no one has any incentive t=
o ask disturbing questions. "A lot of knowledgeable people on Wall Street w=
ere duped, didn't care, or purposefully went along for the ride at the expe=
nse of thousands of others," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat.=
=20
You only have to look at Citigroup to see the multiple roles that Wall Stre=
et firms can play today. Analyst Ray Niles of Salomon Smith Barney (which i=
s owned by Citigroup) was one of Enron's biggest bulls. Citigroup (along wi=
th J.P. Morgan) led most of Enron's financings in the '90s, and was owed ar=
ound $1 billion by Enron. Why did the banks, which have access to informati=
on that equity investors don't, keep handing Enron money? And Citigroup is =
an investor in LJM2, one of the Enron partnerships that was run by Andy Fas=
tow. Of all the phone calls that were placed during Enron's final days, the=
 one that seems most inappropriate was made by Robert Rubin, former Treasur=
y Secretary and current Citigroup chairman of the executive committee, to U=
nder Secretary Fisher, raising the possibility that he intervene with the r=
ating agencies on behalf of Enron.=20
So far all the major players in this drama are doing whatever they can to d=
odge responsibility. "Lay, Skilling, Fastow et al. have demonstrated a rema=
rkable ability to ignore their personal responsibility for this," says Univ=
ersity of Houston management professor J. Timothy McMahon. If it weren't so=
 tragic, it would be comical: In Skilling's one public appearance since he =
abruptly resigned from the company last August for undisclosed "personal re=
asons," he said, "I had no idea the company was in anything but excellent s=
hape." Watkins' letter suggests otherwise: Skilling "knew this stuff was un=
fixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years=
," she wrote. All the stories can't conflict forever, and at some point, we=
'll know the answer to the biggest question of all: Who's going to jail?=20
FEEDBACK: bmclean@fortunemail.com=20
Quote: This scandal isn't an isolated incident that can be dismissed as uni=
que. Many Wall Streeters were either duped or went along for the ride.

First; Value Driven
You're On Your Own That Enron workers lost life savings is just another sig=
n that the short era of economic security is over.

The miserable fate of Enron's employees will be a landmark in business hist=
ory, one of those awful events that everyone agrees must never be allowed t=
o happen again. This urge is understandable and noble: Thousands have lost =
virtually all their retirement savings with the demise of Enron stock. But =
making sure it never happens again may not be possible, because the sudden =
impoverishment of those Enron workers represents something even larger than=
 it seems. It's the latest turn in the unwinding of one of the most audacio=
us promises of the 20th century.=20
The promise was assured economic security--even comfort--for essentially ev=
eryone in the developed world. With the explosion of wealth that began in t=
he 19th century it became possible to think about a possibility no one had =
dared to dream before. The fear at the center of daily living since caveman=
 days--lack of food, warmth, shelter--would at last lose its power to terri=
fy. That remarkable promise became reality in many ways. Governments create=
d welfare systems for anyone in need and separate programs for the elderly =
(Social Security in the U.S.). Labor unions promised not only better pay fo=
r workers but also pensions for retirees. Giant corporations came into bein=
g and offered the possibility--in some cases the promise--of lifetime emplo=
yment plus guaranteed pensions. The cumulative effect was a fundamental cha=
nge in how millions of people approached life itself, a reversal of attitud=
e that must rank as one of the largest in human history. For millennia the =
average person's stance toward providing for himself had been, Ultimately I=
'm on my own. Now it became, Ultimately I'll be taken care of.
The early hints that this promise might be broken on a large scale came in =
the '80s. U.S. business had become uncompetitive globally and began restruc=
turing massively, with huge layoffs. The trend accelerated in the '90s as t=
he bastions of corporate welfare faced reality. IBM ended its no-layoff pol=
icy. AT&T fired thousands, many of whom found such a thing simply incompreh=
ensible, and a few of whom killed themselves. The other supposed guarantors=
 of our economic security were also in decline. Labor-union membership and =
power fell to their lowest levels in decades. President Clinton signed a hi=
storic bill scaling back welfare. Americans realized that Social Security w=
on't provide social security for any of us.=20
A less visible but equally significant trend affected pensions. To make cos=
ts easier to control, companies moved away from defined- benefit pension pl=
ans, which obligate them to pay out specified amounts years in the future, =
to defined-contribution plans, which specify only how much goes into the pl=
an today. The most common type of defined-contribution plan is the 401(k). =
The significance of the 401(k) is that it puts most of the responsibility f=
or a person's economic fate back on the employee. Within limits the employe=
e must decide how much goes into the plan each year and how it gets investe=
d- -the two factors that will determine how much it's worth when the employ=
ee retires.=20
Which brings us back to Enron. Those billions of dollars in vaporized retir=
ement savings were in employees' 401(k) accounts. That is, the employees ch=
ose how much money to put into those accounts and then chose how to invest =
it. Enron matched a certain proportion of each employee's 401(k) contributi=
on with company stock, so everyone was going to end up with some Enron in h=
is or her portfolio; but that could be regarded as a freebie, since nothing=
 compels a company to match employee contributions at all.=20
At least two special features complicate the Enron case. First, some shareh=
olders charge top management with illegally covering up the company's probl=
ems, prompting investors to hang on when they should have sold. Second, Enr=
on's 401(k) accounts were locked while the company changed plan administrat=
ors in October, when the stock was tanking, so employees could not have bai=
led out if they wanted to.=20
But by far the largest cause of this human tragedy is that thousands of emp=
loyees were heavily overweighted in Enron stock. Many had placed 100% of th=
eir 401(k) assets in the stock rather than in the 18 other investment optio=
ns they were offered. Of course that wasn't prudent, but it's what some of =
them did.=20
The Enron employees' retirement disaster is part of the larger trend away f=
rom guaranteed economic security. That's why preventing such a thing from e=
ver happening again may be impossible. The huge attitudinal shift to I'll-b=
e-taken-care-of took at least a generation. The shift back may take just as=
 long. It won't be complete until a new generation of employees see assured=
 economic comfort as a 20th-century quirk, and understand not just intellec=
tually but in their bones that, like most people in most times and places, =
they're on their own.

Economy
Pension Plans Are Adjusted After Enron --- Workers, Firms Shy Away From Own=
ing Too Much of 1 Thing
By Kathy Chen

WASHINGTON -- After thousands of Enron Corp. workers lost their nest eggs i=
n the energy company's collapse, employees at other companies are looking t=
o diversify their retirement savings -- sometimes with the help of their em=
ployers.=20
Enron employees were hit hard because their 401(k) plans were stacked with =
Enron stock, to the tune of 60% of total assets at the end of 2000. But if =
Enron's combustion was spectacular, its pension situation was hardly unusua=
l. Many other major companies, including General Electric Co., Texas Instru=
ments Inc. and William Wrigley Jr. Co., also have most of their 401(k) asse=
ts in company stock, say 401(k) industry analysts.
In many cases, the companies match employee contributions with their own st=
ock and impose restrictions on selling the stock. Workers themselves often =
choose to bet heavily on their companies. Even former Enron Chairman Kennet=
h Lay is now facing bankruptcy after failing to diversify his portfolio, ac=
cording to his wife, Linda, who was speaking on NBC's "Today" show.=20
Now the situation is starting to change.=20
Leslie Sewell, a former television producer for NBC, a GE affiliate, volunt=
arily put all of her 401(k) holdings in GE and rode the stock as its value =
more than quadrupled since the mid-1980s. GE stock continues to perform wel=
l, but she isn't taking any chances. "The Enron thing is like the vampire i=
n the bedroom," says Ms. Sewell, who is in her 50s. "If you survive it and =
wake up the next morning, you should do something about it." She says she w=
ill probably leave only 10% to 20% of her 401(k) assets in GE, and put the =
rest into stock or bond funds.=20
Diebold Inc., a Canton, Ohio, maker of automated teller machines, last week=
 announced that it will ease restrictions that require employees to hold co=
mpany-matched Diebold stock in their defined contribution plan until they t=
urn 55, and instead require them to hold such stock for one year.=20
Diebold has invited the Vanguard Group, a 401(k) provider, to speak to empl=
oyees about the need to diversify, especially targeting those with heavy co=
ncentrations in any one instrument.=20
These moves are part of a continuing plan to increase employees' investment=
 options, says Chuck Sheurer, Diebold's vice president for human resources,=
 but "I can't say we weren't influenced by Enron."=20
To be sure, for many companies the benefits of matching in company stock, w=
hich is cheaper than contributing cash and keeps the stock in friendly hand=
s, are attractive and numerous companies are unlikely to pay more than lip =
service to change.=20
But political pressure from the Enron bankruptcy-proceedings could force ch=
ange upon them, so some companies are contemplating loosening restrictions =
to fend off potential legislation, says John Doyle, vice president of marke=
ting and communications for T. Rowe Price's retirement-plan service.=20
Congress has scheduled numerous hearings on pension reform, and a number of=
 lawmakers have proposed bills that would cap the amount of employer-compan=
y stock in 401(k) plans.=20
Mr. Doyle says T. Rowe Price is helping clients that are talking about loos=
ening their rules to understand the pros and cons of such a move. In additi=
on, "a lot of pressure will come from employees," he says, adding that his =
company's phone banks have fielded a number of calls from plan participants=
 who are asking, "Can this happen to me?"=20
That is certainly a question being asked by some workers at Sam's Club, a c=
hain of warehouse stores owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart allows empl=
oyees to participate in both a profit-sharing program, which is heavily wei=
ghted in company stock, and a 401(k) plan, where Wal-Mart makes cash contri=
butions to employees who then may choose how to invest the money from a num=
ber of options, including Wal-Mart stock.=20
Alan Peto, a 28-year-old Sam's Club cashier in Las Vegas, says he had been =
planning to increase his allocation of Wal-Mart stock to as much as half of=
 his 401(k) assets from the current 5% -- until Enron collapsed. "There's a=
 lot of tongue-in-cheek comments, `If this happens to Enron, what about us?=
' " he says.=20
Other worried Wal-Mart employees are turning to unions for advice. Greg Den=
ier, assistant to the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers I=
nternational Union, says its Web site aimed at wooing Wal-Mart workers has =
averaged 250 hits a day in the wake of the Enron debacle, with many questio=
ns focused on the security of workers' retirement savings.=20
Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams says, "Wal-Mart is known as a very solid co=
mpany that thinks of its employees first." He adds that it provides 14 diff=
erent investment choices, including company stock, for its 401(k) plan.=20
At Textron Inc., one-fifth of the company's 35,000 employees have changed t=
heir 401(k) asset allocation in the past few weeks -- most choosing to redu=
ce the ratio of their company holdings -- after the Providence, R.I., compa=
ny eased investment restrictions late last year, says company spokeswoman S=
usan Bishop.=20
Some companies that already have flexible investment policies are pushing h=
arder the importance of diversification. Texas Instruments' stock accounts =
for about three-quarters of the $3 billion in assets in the Dallas company'=
s 401(k) plan, even though it matches employee contributions in cash and gi=
ves employees flexibility to shift holdings among a dozen investment option=
s, including company stock. While the company doesn't plan to change its ap=
proach, it is intensifying messages to workers about the need to diversify,=
 says Melendy Lovett, a human-resources vice president at Texas Instruments=
. It has posted a report on its internal company Web site outlining how its=
 pension policy differs from Enron's, she says.=20
Not all employees are embracing the diversification message. Paul Feaser, D=
iebold's director of corporate services and security, says some older emplo=
yees at the company plan to take advantage of the company's new relaxed ret=
irement plan policy. Not Mr. Feaser, who is 55 and has been putting half of=
 his contributions into Diebold stock for years. Though the stock has recen=
tly fallen from its highs, "I'm still very satisfied with the profits it's =
shown," he says. "My diversification comes from other holdings," such as st=
ock and bond funds he has invested in on his own.=20
Dan Larson, Texas Instruments' director of government and media relations, =
admits that, "I'm probably not diversified as much as I should be," with ha=
lf of his 401(k) assets in Texas Instruments stock. But he says Enron hasn'=
t changed his mind about unloading company shares, some of which he bought =
at a higher price than they are currently valued. While Texas Instruments h=
asn't taken a stand on legislation that would cap the share of employer-com=
pany stocks in 401(k) plans, Mr. Larson personally is concerned that such a=
 bill could force him to sell some of his company stocks prematurely. But a=
ny bill is unlikely to force employees to sell shares purchased with their =
own funds, experts say, and will instead concentrate on company contributio=
ns.=20
Other companies and business and industry groups also are opposing such leg=
islation. "What happened in Enron has nothing to do with GE," says Jeffrey =
R. Immelt, GE's chairman, in a recent interview. "The fact is that having G=
E stock has done damn well for our employees over the last 10 or 15 years."=

The Analyst Who Warned About Enron
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/29/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Financial analysts who tracked Enron Corp. have taken a pounding for being =
company "shills" and for failing to concede they didn't fully understand th=
e Houston energy-trading concern's complex finances.=20
Then there is Daniel Scotto.
The bond analyst in New York for BNP Paribas says he was forced out of the =
French securities firm because he told his clients in August that Enron sec=
urities "should be sold at all costs and sold now." That warning came about=
 two weeks after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling suddenly quit and a=
 couple of months before Enron began the plunge that ended in federal bankr=
uptcy court on Dec. 2.=20
Mr. Scotto, 49 years old, issued a research report on Aug. 23 to his client=
s that lowered his firm's recommendation on Enron to "neutral" from "buy." =
He pushed that designation even further by suggesting Enron might be a "sou=
rce of funds." Translation: Consider selling Enron securities to raise mone=
y for other investments.=20
If he had gone with a "sell" rating, he says, "I'd have been taken out to t=
he guillotine that very day."=20
BNP Paribas declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr. Scotto's departure=
. A spokesman says the move "was completely unrelated to any research he wr=
ote on any company, including Enron." Spokesman Mark Wisniewski, reading fr=
om a statement, added that the securities firm "is committed to the integri=
ty of its research product" and said the securities firm was surprised by M=
r. Scotto's allegations, as "he has not raised this issue with us."=20
Mr. Scotto's experience highlights one of the oldest pressure points on Wal=
l Street involving financial analysts, who traditionally act as a filter be=
tween investors and the financial markets. During the past decade, Wall Str=
eet securities firms increasingly have pushed their research analysts to ac=
tively trumpet stocks and bonds, not impartially analyze them.=20
The side benefits to the securities firms can be enormous: If an analyst to=
uts a company's securities, the securities firm stands a greater chance at =
becoming an adviser to that company, and garnering the fees that will follo=
w. Nowadays, analysts can be stars, receiving bonuses of several hundred th=
ousand dollars for helping their firm to win big underwriting deals. Bash t=
he securities of a corporate client, though, and the securities firm could =
be shut out of lucrative deals. Enron issued billions of dollars worth of s=
ecurities in recent years, generating huge fees for its financial advisers =
and bankers.=20
Some analysts say Enron wasn't hesitant to complain about research conclusi=
ons it didn't like. Some of these people say they now are under orders not =
to talk about Enron, in view of its stunning collapse.=20
For his part, Mr. Scotto says Paribas didn't want him to say negative thing=
s about Enron because the securities firm had an investment-banking relatio=
nship with the energy trader.=20
Still, Mr. Scotto says he followed up his August written report with an inv=
estor conference call -- recorded because it took place from the firm's tra=
ding floor -- that he says was much blunter. He says he decided to flatly a=
dvise his clients to dump Enron securities because Enron's profit margins "=
were flattening out and starting to decline. This wasn't a company with har=
d assets; it was built on paper and highly leveraged."=20
A few days after the brouhaha, Mr. Scotto says he was told "you're demoted,=
 and we don't think it was a good recommendation or a reasonable one."=20
After the flap and reprimand, Mr. Scotto says, he was put on family leave, =
at full pay, for 120 days. He says he checked in frequently but was told he=
 wasn't needed back at work and to take time to "cool off." He then receive=
d a termination letter dated Dec. 5. That letter said, in part, that due to=
 a lack of documentation "justifying your continued absence from work, as w=
ell as the indeterminate nature of your extended leave, BNP Paribas is left=
 with no choice but to terminate your employment effective December 5, 2001=
."=20
Mr. Scotto says he is looking at other options and has no intention of retu=
rning to Wall Street. He once worked at New York investment bank Bear Stear=
ns Cos. and the bond-rating division of Standard & Poor's Corp. He says he =
is considering writing a whistleblower-type book on how Wall Street "really=
 works." He says he wants investors to understand that companies like Enron=
 won't tolerate dissension. "You couldn't ask hard questions, because it wa=
s viewed as offensive," he says.=20
Consider an April conference call Enron had with analysts. Mr. Skilling, th=
en Enron's chief executive, called a questioner -- upset because the energy=
 concern's balance sheet wasn't available when the quarterly earnings were =
released -- a vulgar term.=20
In another call that followed the release of Enron's disastrous third-quart=
er financial results in October, Enron's former chairman, Kenneth Lay, cut =
off an analyst widely regarded as "short" on the stock, meaning the analyst=
's firm was betting on a continued decline in Enron's stock. Mr. Lay moved =
on to others with more sympathetic questions.=20
"All I can say," Mr. Scotto says, "is it's been a long 30 years on Wall Str=
eet for me." He adds that the motto for the Street should be: "Don't ask, d=
on't tell."

Accounting for Enron: Enron's Hiring of One Firm to Represent Forty Employe=
es Raises Some Concerns
By Richard B. Schmitt and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

A Washington law firm hired by Enron Corp. is representing about 40 company=
 employees and managers in probes arising from Enron's collapse, raising po=
tential conflicts of interest and concerns that the company is trying to co=
ordinate responses to investigators.=20
The law firm, Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, represented the late J. Clif=
ford Baxter, the former Enron vice chairman who was found dead in his car n=
ear Houston last week, in an apparent suicide. Swidler Berlin also represen=
ts a wide range of other Enron employees, including the chiefs of its accou=
nting and risk-management units, among others, people familiar with the fir=
m's involvement said. Any fees the firm receives have to be approved by the=
 New York bankruptcy-court judge overseeing the company's Chapter 11 procee=
ding.
Legal ethics rules permit -- and corporate targets increasingly seek out --=
 single law firms to represent multiple employees in a matter. The theory i=
s that so long as the clients are neither subjects nor targets of any inves=
tigation, and thus only have an interest in telling the truth, a single law=
 firm is able to represent them aggressively without being conflicted.=20
But the system quickly breaks down when one client starts pointing the fing=
er at others. A client might decide to strike a deal with the government th=
at includes giving testimony that implicates other clients. Swidler could h=
ave trouble, for instance, if lower-level employees it represents begin to =
implicate their bosses also represented by the law firm.=20
Some companies are required under indemnification agreements to pay for att=
orneys to represent employees who are caught up in job-related criminal pro=
bes. Hiring a single firm is often a cost-efficient approach to meeting tha=
t duty.=20
But some defense lawyers, who themselves have clients in the Enron case, sa=
y the number represented by Enron seems unusually high, and that the chance=
s of conflicts emerging, given the early stages of the Enron inquiries, see=
m high, too.=20
Such agreements, others note, also limit the ability of investigators to qu=
estion employees because so many of them now have lawyers.=20
"Prosecutors hate it. They prefer to play one person off the other. That is=
 harder to do if a single law firm is representing everybody," said Stephen=
 Gillers, an ethics specialist at New York University law school. While say=
ing that he wasn't familiar with details of Swidler Berlin's retention, Mr.=
 Gillers added that another common concern is that "the law firm paid for b=
y the employer will really be working covertly for the employer."=20
Guy Petrillo, a Swidler Berlin partner in New York, said the firm is carefu=
lly monitoring the situation, and is fully complying with ethics rules. "If=
 a conflict of interest presents itself, then our firm will address the con=
flict and act appropriately," he said. Of the idea that Enron might be atte=
mpting to coordinate testimony, he added, "Clients who are called to testif=
y and who elect to do so are under an obligation to testify truthfully. Wha=
t some call coordination, others call due diligence." Lawyers for Enron cou=
ldn't be immediately reached.=20
"Forty is a lot, but not inconceivable," said Peter Romatowski, a white-col=
lar specialist at Jones, Davis, Reavis & Pogue in Washington, who isn't rep=
resenting any Enron entities or employees. A major risk, he added, is that =
a law firm will be disqualified from representing some, and possibly all th=
e clients, if a conflict emerges later.=20
In extreme cases, people ultimately convicted of crimes have challenged the=
ir convictions based on concerns that their employer-financed lawyers weren=
't independent, according to NYU's Mr. Gillers.=20
None of Swidler's clients are believed to be the focus of any of the myriad=
 inquiries into Enron's demise. The most senior company executives, moreove=
r, such as former chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay, have retained t=
heir own counsel. And not all of Swidler's clients have been sought out for=
 questioning.=20
Michael Levy, another Swidler partner, who represented Mr. Baxter, was cont=
acted by investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesd=
ay, two days before Mr. Baxter's apparent suicide. The investigators reques=
ted an interview but no date had been set.=20
Mr. Levy, a former federal prosecutor, previously worked at Skadden, Arps, =
Slate, Meagher & Flom, with white-collar specialist Robert Bennett, who cur=
rently represents Enron.=20
Other Enron managers represented by Swidler include Richard Causey, the com=
pany's chief accounting officer, and Richard Buy, its chief risk officer.

THE FALL OF ENRON Firm Did Not Get His Help, President Says Enron: Bush als=

WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Monday called the Enron Corp. debacle "a co=
rporate governance issue . . . not a political issue," and he declared uneq=
uivocally that his administration provided no help to the now-bankrupt ener=
gy company despite large contributions from its employees, directors and po=
litical action committee to his presidential campaign.=20
"There are some on Capitol Hill who want to politicize this issue," Bush sa=
id, clearly seeking to inoculate himself against political fallout in the b=
urgeoning controversy.
"And, you know, Enron had made contributions to a lot of people around Wash=
ington, D.C. And if they came to this administration looking for help, they=
 didn't find any," the president added.=20
Bush's comments--his most extensive yet on Enron--came a day after a poll s=
howed that 45% of those surveyed believe Enron had closer ties to Republica=
ns than Democrats; only 10% believed Democrats had closer ties. In the CBS/=
New York Times poll, more than half also said the Bush administration is ei=

Republicans on Capitol Hill are growing deeply concerned over such percepti=
ons, fearful that Enron could derail key Bush priorities--including a natio=
nal energy policy--as the president enters his second year in office.=20
That angst was further fueled by Bush's adamant refusal Monday to disclose =
White House contacts last year with Enron and other energy industry executi=
ves while Vice President Dick Cheney developed the administration's controv=
ersial energy policy.=20
With nearly a dozen congressional committees looking into various aspects o=
f the Enron collapse, the matter is likely to hang heavily over the adminis=
tration, even as Bush delivers his State of the Union address tonight and t=

At a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, the president spoke animatedly =
as he defended his refusal to release details of Cheney's energy task force=

Pivoting from his lectern, Bush pointed to the Oval Office and asked rhetor=
ically: "Should an administration be allowed to have private conversations =
in this office without everybody knowing about it?"=20
With fervor, the president answered his own question, saying:=20
"This is part of how you make decisions, is to call people in and say, 'Wha=
t's your opinion? What's your opinion on stem cell? What's your opinion on =
energy? What's your opinion on the war?' "=20
Demands by Congress for such information amount to an "encroachment on the =
executive branch's ability to conduct business," Bush said.=20
"We're not going to let the ability for us to discuss matters between ourse=

The president made his remarks on Enron and the looming legal battle with t=

As the repercussions of Enron's collapse continue to spread, the White Hous=
e has become increasingly defensive--in part because of campaign contributi=
ons to Bush and other Republicans, and in part because of a friendship betw=
een the president and Enron's just-ousted chairman, Kenneth L. Lay.=20
It was unclear to whom Bush was referring Monday when he accused "some" of =
seeking to politicize the issue. The committees probing the Enron matter in=
 the House are chaired by Republicans.=20
Bush's comment about contacts between Enron and his administration was a re=
ference to previously disclosed calls from Lay to Commerce Secretary Don Ev=
ans and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. Both Cabinet secretaries said t=
hey did nothing after the calls that could be construed as helping Enron.=
=20
The Houston-based company, the seventh-largest in the country until its sud=

cade or more. While its employees, directors and political action committee=
 gave to Democrats as well, 74% of nearly $6 million in various types of co=
ntributions went to Republicans. Bush personally raised more than $114,000 =

"This is not a political issue," he added.=20

Politics & Policy
Enron Collapse Has Congress Backing Off Deregulation --- Better Financial R=
eporting, Tighter Accounting Rules Top Bipartisan Call for Changes
By Michael Schroeder and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp.'s collapse has Congress taking its finger off the=
 deregulation button, as members instead suddenly queue up to push for new =
controls on the financial community.=20
A dizzying array of bills seek tougher regulation on financial disclosures,=
 auditor conflicts, insider trading and pension investments.
Most of them may fail to reach floor votes, but in the new atmosphere what =
doesn't become law could well get adopted instead by industry regulators.=
=20
Though Democrats are sponsoring most of the bills, prominent Republicans no=
rmally against regulation are saying they favor stepped-up oversight from f=
ederal regulators and industries' self-policing bodies -- if only to blunt =
the drive for new regulatory laws. And the Senate Finance Committee's top R=
epublican, Iowa's Charles Grassley, is calling for a crackdown on corporate=
 tax shelters and protections for worker retirement savings in Enron's wake=
.=20
The complicated scandal also has muted the antiregulatory rhetoric of the B=
ush administration, even on unrelated issues. But powerful business groups =
are mobilizing to scuttle any new regulations, or at least soften them.=20
Improved financial reporting and tighter accounting rules top the bipartisa=
n calls for changes.=20
For instance, one narrow proposal with wide appeal is Sen. Jean Carnahan's =
bill to overhaul the system for company executives' reports of their inside=
r-trading transactions. News accounts of Enron executives' sales of its sto=
ck, before the energy-trading company's dramatic demise, has spotlighted th=
at issue.=20
"Enron executives told the world the company was on solid footing, while at=
 the same time they sold off their own stock," Mrs. Carnahan, a Missouri De=
mocrat, said in a statement. "Such a dramatic insider selloff would have be=
en a big warning sign to investors, but this information was not readily ac=
cessible to them."=20
Among the current system's problems is that insiders enjoy lax filing deadl=
ines; weeks-old information isn't of much use to small investors.=20
The Carnahan bill proposes that insiders report trades the day they occur, =
and file them electronically to the Securities and Exchange Commission so t=
hat the SEC can immediately post the information on its Web site.=20
Currently, forms filed by corporate executives, directors and other insider=
s reporting the sale or purchase of their own companies' stock are among th=
e few reports for which electronic filing is optional.=20
Public companies have been required to file other corporate documents, such=
 as quarterly and annual reports, on the SEC's Edgar system since 1996, but=
 at least 90% of insider-trading forms still arrive by mail.=20
Companies and their insiders have argued that immediate electronic filing c=
reates an unnecessary burden.=20
Some corporate analysts have questioned whether the SEC's current database =
could handle the added volume of insider filings. About 350,000 forms are f=
iled annually, according to Edgar Online, Norwalk, Conn.=20
"The idea of more electronic filing and greater dissemination is a good thi=
ng," says Stuart Kaswell, general counsel of the Securities Industry Associ=
ation.=20
But, he adds, "We need to make sure the reporting time period is realistic =
. . . so individuals are able to gather and report information accurately."=
=20
If the Carnahan bill fails, the SEC has the authority to impose such new re=
porting requirements.=20
With accounting irregularities getting much of the blame in Enron's fall, D=
emocratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New J=
ersey propose to restrict accounting firms from offering other services to =
their audit clients.=20
Their bill has the support of Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of Sout=
h Dakota; it would prohibit accounting firms from auditing companies whose =
executives recently worked for the auditor.=20
Just over a year ago, the accounting industry successfully fought off a sim=
ilar conflict-of-interest ban that former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt advoca=
ted.=20
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants opposes the new meas=
ure, and argues that no evidence suggests that a ban on such relationships =
would have made a difference in the Enron case.=20
AICPA President Barry Melancon says he backs new SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's=
 plan to overhaul the existing system of industry self-regulation, to creat=
e an independent oversight panel.=20
Mr. Pitt, who represented big accounting firms as a private attorney before=
 his SEC appointment by President Bush, says he is developing an industry-f=
unded response to the accounting problems, rather than beefing up the SEC s=
taff and budget to directly regulate the accounting industry.=20
Although the chairman has said he would work with Congress if a consensus d=
evelops for some accounting legislation, he noted that the SEC could approv=
e new disclosure rules and oversee the new private-regulatory body more qui=
ckly than Congress would get new legislation to Mr. Bush's desk.=20
The Enron investigation also has revived the debate about whether complicat=
ed derivatives investments should be regulated.=20
In late 2000, Congress exempted from nearly any regulation these over-the-c=
ounter derivatives, which are contracts whose value is derived from the und=
erlying assets such as commodities or currencies. Enron led the massive lob=
bying effort on Capitol Hill and, with the exemption, escaped federal overs=
ight of its trading activities.=20
Rep. Peter DeFazio, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, says he is drafting leg=
islation to require detailed disclosure.=20
Derivatives played a big role in Enron's alleged misrepresentation of its t=
rue financial condition.=20
Mr. DeFazio is joining with Reps. Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, and Be=
rnie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, on two other bills to change corporate=
 auditing and protect worker pensions.=20
Enron employees' losses in retirement funds, heavily invested in the compan=
y's now-worthless stock, have spawned at least a half-dozen pension-reform =
bills.=20
Sens. Corzine and Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, have teamed on a bi=
ll aimed at more-diversified worker accounts.=20
It would limit to 20% the investment employees can have in any one stock in=
 their 401(k)s.=20
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers and oth=
er business groups oppose pension changes, contending they should not be pu=
nished because of the misdeeds of one company.=20
They also are pressing Congress for legislation to shield from liability th=
ose companies that hire advisers to help employees develop retirement plans=
.=20
Their argument: Employers don't give investment advice to employees for fea=
r of being sued if the advice leads to big losses, but such advice could ha=
ve kept Enron workers from relying so heavily on Enron stock.=20
--- Out Of The Woodwork

The Enron-Andersen scandal is spawning new bills, and giving new life=20
to old ones, as lawmakers react to the unfolding story of the fallen
energy giant and its auditor. A sampling:

"The stunning collapse of a Fortune 10 company in such a short period

02/01/2002
Financial Executive's News
Copyright c 2002 by the Institute of Management & Administration (IOMA). Re=
production without permission is strictly prohibited.

"The stunning collapse of a Fortune 10 company in such a short period of ti=
me gives pause to all of us who care about financial reporting." So said Ro=
bert Herdman, the new chief accountant of the SEC, as he spoke about the En=
ron debacle at a recent AICPA conference.=20
In his speech, Herdman noted that he and other SEC staff members are barred=
 from commenting on the specifics of the energy company's troubles, due to =
the commission's pending probe. Even so, numerous speakers at this AICPA co=
nference referred to the problematic role of Andersen LLP, in what has beco=
me the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. In particular, they referred to =
the pattern of misstatements in Enron's financial reports. Apparently, thes=
e are not fine-point controversies over judgment calls in gray areas, but v=
iolations of fundamental accounting principles.
Breaking Basic Rules=20
In mid-October, for example, Enron announced a $1.2 billion reduction in sh=
areholder equity. According to The Wall Street Journal, Enron said the redu=
ction developed from its decision to unwind certain transactions with some =
limited partnerships. Shortly thereafter, the company announced the origina=
l accounting for the transactions violated GAAP.=20
Details: Starting in 2000, the company issued shares of its own common stoc=
k to four "special purpose entities." In exchange, it received a note recei=
vable. In doing so, Enron said it increased both its notes-receivable asset=
s and shareholder equity, a move it later admitted was an accounting error.=
=20
Explanation: Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock =
only counts as equity if it is cash. Upshot: Enron's 2000 audited financial=
 statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholde=
r equity by $172 million. Meanwhile, Enron's 2001 unaudited statements over=
stated them by $828 million.=20
"It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, an=
d a note doesn't count as cash," remarked Lynn Turner, a former chief accou=
ntant for the SEC, in an interview in The Wall Street Journal. "The questio=
n this raises is: How did both [the Andersen] partners and the manager on t=
his audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?"=20
De'ja Vu All Over Again=20
Unfortunately, Andersen's sign-off on these accounting decisions has a fami=
liar ring. Indeed, multiple accounting disasters at large companies have hi=
t every Big Five auditor in recent years. But at Andersen, the reporting pr=
oblems at Enron appear remarkably similar to those at former client Sunbeam=
, another large bankruptcy.=20
Enron, for example, reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure =
the company reduced last November to $9 million. Here, Enron said the prima=
ry cause of this restatement was $51 million in audit adjustments and recla=
ssifications that its auditor had proposed in 1997 but had later determined=
 to be immaterial. Key point: Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments to=
taled nearly half of the company's 1997 net income.=20
At Sunbeam, this issue of immateriality was remarkably similar. Reason: Acc=
ording to the SEC's May settlement order, Andersen's auditors routinely dis=
missed numerous violations of GAAP as immaterial. But eventually, these pil=
ed up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements.=
 Altogether, they made this barely solvent company look profitable.=20
In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executive=
s and the Andersen partner in charge of the audit, accusing them of engagin=
g in financial fraud.=20
Key point: In certain situations, the SEC says intentional immaterial misst=
atements are unlawful. Reason: When immaterial misstatements are combined w=
ith other misstatements, they can render the financial statements, as a who=
le, to be materially misleading. Upshot: Under GAAP, misstatements aren't i=
mmaterial simply because they fall beneath a numerical threshold.=20
Response From the Accounting Establishment=20
In his speech at the AICPA conference, Herdman primarily focused on prevent=
ing future accounting debacles. In this activity, he praised the Big Five f=
or their pledge to submit specific recommendations to the SEC for improving=
 corporate financial disclosures, in the wake of things gone awry with Enro=
n's financial reporting.=20
The Big Five submitted this document on December 31. Available on the SEC W=
eb site, the document offers reporting improvement suggestions for: (1) man=
agement's discussion and analysis of financial condition (MD&A); (2) disclo=
sures for the liquidity and capital resources of off-balance sheet arrangem=
ents; (3) disclosures of trading activities that include nonexchange traded=
 contracts accounted for a fair market value; and (4) disclosures about rel=
ationships and transactions with persons who are not independent third part=
ies.=20
Meanwhile, Herdman also praised the AICPA for "detailing initiatives that a=
re designed to improve financial disclosure and audit performance in the ne=
ar term." As announced by James G. Castellano, AICPA chairman, and Barry Me=
lancon, AICPA president and CEO, these include:=20
An exposure draft covering a new audit standard for detecting fraud, includ=
ing more precise guidance on auditing for material misstatements due to fra=
ud (first quarter of 2002);=20
Guidance for company managements and audit committees on the new measures f=
or deterring fraud, such as internal control procedures;=20
Revised auditor standards on review of quarterly financial statements (firs=
t quarter of 2002); and=20
An exposure draft focusing on the risks of material misstatements. Technica=
lly, this draft will detail improved audit standards for guiding auditors t=
hrough the audit process. But, its heart will be an approach for assessing =
the risks of material misstatements.

Whistle-Blowers
To Tell the Truth Sherron Watkins gave Enron a piece of her mind-- and inve=
stigators a smoking gun
Samantha Miller Gabrielle Cosgriff in Houston

(Copyright 2002)

On Aug. 14 Sherron Watkins sat down at her computer and began typing a scat=
hing--and now famous--memo to her boss. "I am incredibly nervous that we wi=
ll implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wrote in the missive to E=
nron chairman Kenneth Lay. Worried about the wisdom of such blunt talk, the=
 42-year-old vice president for corporate development sought out colleagues=
 and got mixed advice on whether she should send the note. But her mother d=
id not waffle. "I told her," says Shirley Klein Harrington, 67, "to stick w=
ith her convictions."=20
Watkins did just that, and the seven-page memo has become a smoking gun in =
the unfolding investigation of alleged financial chicanery at Enron and its=
 accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. On Dec. 2 the formerly high-flying Houst=
on corporation became the largest company in U.S. history to file for bankr=
uptcy. Watkins's memo, made public on Jan. 14 by congressional leaders who =
found it buried in 40 boxes of subpoenaed documents, had proven prescient. =
Now, more than a dozen federal agencies and Capitol Hill committees are pro=
bing the mushrooming morass--the latest news being that Enron and Andersen =
employees continued to shred documents even after it was clear that Congres=
s was opening what could become a criminal investigation.
More important to hundreds of employees who saw their retirement packages c=
ollapse with the failing stock price, Watkins's memo was also key evidence =
that Lay and other Enron execs knew about the company's precarious finances=
 well before they alerted the staff or the public. "She's one of the few et=
hical bright spots," says Barbara Shook, a Houston energy-industry analyst,=
 of Watkins. Adds Watkins's sister, homemaker Julie Reagan, 40: "She couldn=
't believe what people were getting away with, and she didn't think it was =
right. I'm so proud of her I'm about to pop."=20
Watkins, who lives in Houston with husband Rick, 51, an executive for a Can=
adian oil and gas firm, and their daughter Marion, 2, doesn't regret sendin=
g the memo. "The die was already cast," she says through her lawyer, Philip=
 Hilder. "My take on it changed nothing." Life at Enron, where she is still=
 employed, has been "extremely painful, as it is for everybody, with the co=
mpany under fire," she adds. Watkins has been subpoenaed to testify before =
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more subpoenas are likely.=20
In and out of the office, Watkins has left a variety of impressions--some g=
ood and some bad, but all forceful. Friends say they value her sometimes ro=
ugh honesty: She once told her sister Julie that a picture frame Julie had =
given her was "the tackiest thing I've ever seen." Coworkers see her as har=
d-driving, with one Enron employee likening her to "a bull in a china shop.=
" Her former secretary Wilma Williams, 60, disagrees. "Sherron wasn't abras=
ive; she just expected people to do their job," Williams recalls.=20
Her frankness and salty language even had some coworkers buzzing that she w=
as a New Yorker. In fact, Watkins was raised in the Houston suburb of Tomba=
ll, Texas. (Singer Lyle Lovett is her second cousin.) Her mother, a retired=
 accounting teacher divorced from her daughters' attorney father, Dan C. Sm=
ith, 67, encouraged Sherron to go into accounting. "It's an area in which w=
omen can be accepted on an equal basis," Harrington says. Watkins earned ba=
chelor's and master's degrees at the University of Texas. "She was brillian=
t," says friend Anne Benolken, 42. "You know the way girls in college often=
 act more stupid than they are or try not to make waves? Not Sherron, she'd=
 always stir the pot."=20
Watkins began her career as an auditor for Arthur Andersen. She then moved =
to a firm in New York City, MG Trade Finance Group, before returning to Hou=
ston to work for up-and-coming energy wholesaler Enron in 1993. In 1997 she=
 wed Rick, whom she had met at Houston's First Presbyterian Church.=20
By last summer Watkins had come to suspect that Enron, which FORTUNE ranked=
 as the seventh-largest company in the U.S. last year, was a house of cards=
. When Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, chairman Lay invited =
employees to forward any concerns to him. Watkins sent him the first page o=
f her memo detailing her uneasiness about "funny" accounting to hide compan=
y losses. "Has Enron become a risky place to work?" she asked.=20
On Aug. 22 Watkins met with Lay, who told the company's law firm to look in=
to the matter. The firm reported in October that the practices might make t=
he company look bad but did not appear to be illegal. But Watkins's fears r=
apidly came to pass. Since December, Enron has fired more than 4,000 employ=
ees, and thousands of others have lost much of their life savings. Watkins =
was fortunate in having sold some stock in 1999 to buy her house.=20
Watkins doesn't relish the prospect of playing a pivotal and highly visible=
 role in the ongoing investigation. "The only good thing that might come ou=
t of all this," she says, "is there may be certain reforms so that there wo=
n't be another Enron."=20
