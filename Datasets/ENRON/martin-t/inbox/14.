Questioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=
 Plan

WASHINGTON -- A top Enron Corp. human-resources executive who also served a=
s a trustee of the company's 401(k) plan said she became aware of serious a=
llegations about the company's financial practices in August, but did nothi=
ng to protect retirement-plan members.=20
Speaking at a Senate government affairs committee hearing, Cindy Olson said=
 Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins approached her for advice before send=
ing her now well-publicized e-mail to former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in =
August voicing concerns about the company's accounting practices. Ms. Olson=
 said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =
operating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.
Enron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=
oncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=
r Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =
Committee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =
Enron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=
 and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20
In yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=
ations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=
er responsibility to repeat "hearsay." In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=
ad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=
y and he ordered an investigation, "I felt it was all in good hands," Ms. O=
lson said.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=
ntered those arguments. "She had information that affected the lives of 10,=
000 people and did nothing," he said, adding, "It's so clear that she breac=
hed her duty." He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =
of the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=
uld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=
pped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =
stock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20
Ms. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=
bility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=
rs.=20
Ms. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=
 of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=
ning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=
t who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=
ed she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=
00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=
lling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=
 management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =
to a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=
uggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=
o government bonds.=20
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=
. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=
loyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=
 of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20
During the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=
ore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=
agement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=
ed failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=
=20
As Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=
 planned "blackout" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =
their investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=
nager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =
consulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=
efore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=
 about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=
ith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=
 all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=
d outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20
Executives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=
tes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=
ey were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20
Ms. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=
n whether it "made sense" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=
oldings.=20
This week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=
s who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=
ated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.) says=
 a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=
uch as those at Enron. "Clearly, we need pension reform," Mr. Tauzin, the l=
eading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20
However, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=
ll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=
ose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=
 plans.=20
Somewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=
y President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =
would provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=
ed by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=
l age 50 or later.=20
On this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =
all proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=
 company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=
ification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=
 from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=
 large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=
s into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and STEPHEN LABATON

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Enron executives acknowledged today that before they =
temporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirem=
ent accounts last fall, the executives had sharply debated delaying the mor=
atorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock p=
rice.=20
''We were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of t=
he stock price,'' Mikie Rath, a benefits manager at Enron, said in testimon=
y before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But after the debate on=
 the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=
ive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.
Enron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=
cipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=
d they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=
fied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20
The disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =
took up Enron matters.=20
House and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=
n's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state o=
fficials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and st=
ate agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward l=
ast year.=20
The Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to re=
quire Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by R=
epresentative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the =
House Financial Services Committee.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lay, who had been scheduled to testify on Monday but =
bowed out, said his lawyers would work out details for his appearance, alth=
ough lawmakers said they expected that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment =
right against self-incrimination.=20
While Mr. Lay may not answer any questions, members of a House subcommittee=
 on oversight and investigation focused on him today, trying to glean, by p=
roxy, what he might say.=20
Under questioning, William C. Powers, chairman of the special investigative=
 committee of Enron's board that wrote a harshly critical report, said that=
 in his four-hour interview with Mr. Lay, the former chairman understood th=
at off-the-books partnerships were set up to hide losses. ''But,'' Mr. Powe=
rs said, ''he didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong=
 with that. That's his story. The accountants signed off, and he was O.K. w=
ith that.''=20
President Bush brushed aside a demand by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the So=
uth Carolina Democrat who heads the Commerce Committee, that a special coun=
sel should be appointed to supervise the criminal investigation of Enron. M=
r. Hollings cited Enron's ties to administration officials, including the a=
ttorney general.=20
Mr. Bush told reporters as he toured a research laboratory in Pittsburgh: '=
'This is a business problem, and my Justice Department is going to investig=
ate. If there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of=
 employees and shareholders.''=20
Lawyers representing the employees have accused Enron of stock fraud for im=
posing the moratorium and for not disclosing the company's financial condit=
ion, resulting, the lawyers say, in losses of more than $1.2 billion for th=
e 15,000 participants in Enron's retirement plan. During the moratorium, em=
ployees could not sell stock in the retirement plan, but senior executives =
faced no restrictions in selling their stock.=20
The testimony prompted a new round of criticism of Enron's senior officials=
 for looking out for their own interests while turning their backs on their=
 employees.=20
''Management knew full well that their employees' 401(k)'s were overloaded =
with shares of Enron,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut D=
emocrat who is chairman of the governmental affairs committee. ''Shouldn't =
that have prompted them to postpone the lockdown when the company was reeli=
ng?''=20
In response to the collapse of Enron, an administration task force is prepa=
ring recommendations to revise securities and corporate laws. Administratio=
n officials said that they were debating proposals to make it more likely t=
hat corporate executives and boards face personal liability for violating t=
he law.=20
Officials in Connecticut, one of several states considering whether to susp=
end or revoke the license of Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, said=
 they had subpoenaed Andersen records.=20
Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general in Connecticut, said he was examin=
ing a state agency's decision last year to pay Enron $220 million for an en=
ergy contract that might never be fulfilled.=20
At a House committee hearing, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's chief executi=
ve, repeated earlier statements that important information about Enron's fi=
nances had been withheld from his firm.=20
Democrats and Republicans repeatedly complained that Mr. Berardino was evad=
ing the committee's questions about Andersen's involvement in Enron's colla=
pse.=20
''Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers,'' s=
aid Representative Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of New York. ''Your not knowi=
ng what was going on, if that's the case, is basically saying that you have=
 squandered the integrity of your company.''=20
Mr. Berardino said Andersen would establish new offices of audit quality an=
d ethics and compliance.=20
Before approving the subpoena of Mr. Lay, members of the Senate Commerce Co=
mmittee said that they had begun investigating losses that state pension fu=
nds sustained from the decline in Enron stock.=20
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said it was suspicious that an in=
vestment manager for the Florida retirement system bought millions of dolla=
rs in shares last fall, at prices ranging from $22.82 to $9.02, even after =
Enron had announced that it was being investigated by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
A few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, the fund sold more than seven=
 million shares at 28 cents each.=20
The investment management firm that bought the Enron stock for Florida's re=
tirement funds is Alliance Capital. Frank Savage, a recently retired senior=
 executive at Alliance, sits on Enron's board.=20
Mr. Nelson said that if Mr. Lay had agreed to testify, he would be asked, '=
'Were they told to buy the stock to prop it up?''=20
John Meyers, a spokesman at Alliance Capital, said that the investments wer=
e reasonable at the time and that Mr. Savage ''had no involvement in the bu=
ying, holding or selling of Enron'' stock.=20
At the Senate governmental affairs hearing, Cindy Olson, Enron's executive =
vice president for human resources, said there had been a debate on the day=
 before the trading moratorium about whether the company should postpone th=
e blackout, which was needed for a change in plan administrators.=20
But executives said they decided against delaying after concluding that it =
would be too hard to notify the participants in Enron's 401(k) plan immedia=
tely. The executives said they feared that if they delayed this blackout pe=
riod, they would open themselves to lawsuits by participants who were notif=
ied later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20
Though the company says the blackout began Oct. 26, it sent out conflicting=
 bulletins. The confusion led many employees to think that the blackout beg=
an Oct. 19, when Enron stock traded at $26.05. By the time employees were a=
ble to sell shares on Nov. 13, the shares had plunged, closing at $9.98 tha=
t day.=20
Deborah G. Perrotta, a former senior administrative assistant, told the com=
mittee that the blackout hurt. ''A delay would have saved a lot of people,'=
' she said.=20
Several senators said it was unconscionable for Mr. Lay and other Enron off=
icials to tell employees that the stock price would continue to rise while =
some officials were raising tough questions about the stability of the comp=
any's finances.=20
Ms. Olson, who served as a trustee of Enron's retirement plan, testified th=
at in August, Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, had told her of =
concerns she had about whether Enron executives had engaged in some chicane=
ry that undermined the company's finances. Ms. Watkins raised many of those=
 questions in a letter last summer to Mr. Lay.=20
Saying she was not convinced that Ms. Watkins's assertions were accurate, M=
s. Olson said that she, as a plan fiduciary, did not deem it necessary to i=
nform plan participants of the questions about Enron.

Two Enron employees told a Senate committee yesterday what happened to them=
 before and immediately after the collapse of the giant Texas energy-tradin=
g company.=20
Their stories were very different.
Deborah G. Perrotta, an administrative assistant, broke down in tears as sh=
e described losing her job, $40,000 in retirement savings and all but a fra=
ction of her severance pay.=20
The other, Cindy Olson, executive vice president of Enron's human resources=
 department and one of the people in charge of the company's ill-fated 401(=
k) plan, still works for Enron. She matter-of-factly described how a year a=
go, when Enron stock was near its peak, she cashed in options on 83,000 sha=
res, netting about $3 million.=20
Their testimony again highlighted the devastation that can befall employees=
 who tie their jobs and their retirement security to a single company. But =
it also showed how much difference professional advice and investment insti=
ncts can make for workers in a situation like Enron's, and how workers caug=
ht up in a company's collapse can be affected very differently.=20
Perrotta and Olson testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ=
ee, which is trying to determine what changes might be needed in federal pe=
nsion and employment laws to improve worker protections should their employ=
er fail.=20
The hearing highlighted several issues that are common in 401(k) and other =
retirement savings plans known as defined-contribution plans, which, unlike=
 old-fashioned defined-benefit pensions, place the market risk and reward o=
n employees.=20
* Fiduciary responsibility. Who is responsible for sharing information with=
 employees and retirees, and how and when?=20
Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay encouraged workers to keep their retir=
ement money in company stock. Perrotta recalled that in August she was awar=
ded a block of shares, and an accompanying e-mail from Lay said that "one o=
f my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This sh=
ould result in a significantly higher stock price. I hope this grant lets y=
ou know how valued you are to Enron."=20
Olson, however, had a higher position at the company and access to more inf=
ormation than Perrotta. Indeed, Olson actually spoke with whistle-blower Sh=
erron Watkins before Watkins sent her anonymous letter to Lay, in which she=
 said she worried that the company's accounting practices could lead to a m=
ajor scandal. Olson said Watkins was fearful that she was overlooking somet=
hing or that there was some other reason her conclusions might be incorrect=
. Olson took no action to inform other employees about the concerns, howeve=
r. "She went to speak to Mr. Lay, and Mr. Lay kicked off an investigation,"=
 Olson said. ". . . I felt like it was in good hands."=20
* How tough it is to separate loyalty from investment decisions.=20
Enron's restrictions on employees selling stock they received as matching c=
ontributions to their 401(k) plans have been well chronicled. But, by some =
accounts, 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan was there because worke=
rs invested in it voluntarily.=20
Olson, however, had been granted options that did not have the same restric=
tions against selling as the Enron stock matches in the 401(k) plan. Olson =
said she cashed in her options only because she had a run-in with then-chie=
f executive Jeffrey Skilling that motivated her to seek professional invest=
ment advice. The adviser told her she was too emotionally involved with the=
 stock, and she agreed to sell.=20
Olson said she held on to another 3,000 shares in her retirement account un=
til two days before the company went into bankruptcy.=20
The panel is looking at proposals to limit the percentage of company stock =
permitted in a 401(k) account. But employer groups argue that retirement pl=
ans are often designed to align the interests of workers and companies, and=
 they are urging Congress to be careful not to discourage companies from of=
fering retirement plans or matching worker contributions to plans.=20
* Investment advice. Most companies are reluctant to provide it for fear of=
 exposing themselves to liability if the advice doesn't work out.=20
Pending legislation would permit them to provide advice or to pay for it fr=
om third parties.=20
The potential benefits for employees seem clear in retrospect. Olson went t=
o an adviser while Perrotta did not. "When it started to fall apart, we jus=
t sat there -- watched it," Perrotta said.=20
But critics say that the issue is more complex than it seems and that any l=
egislation should be careful to eliminate conflicts of interest among advis=
ers and employers.=20
* "Lockdowns" of 401(k) plans. These freezes on account activity occur when=
 a company changes plan administrators, and can last up to several months. =
Enron changed administrators last fall and employee accounts were frozen fo=
r several weeks. The exact duration is in dispute.=20
* Severance in bankruptcy. Laid-off workers are generally limited to paymen=
ts of about $4,500. Severance owed beyond that is usually treated as a gene=
ral unsecured debt, though some courts have been more lenient.=20
It has become routine, however, for companies entering bankruptcy to pay la=
rge "retention bonuses" to keep certain workers while the newly unemployed =
get little. Enron paid out $55 million in such bonuses.=20
Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath, who testified with Olson, drew snickers =
in the crowded hearing room when she said she had gotten a retention bonus =
but could not remember exactly how much it was. Pressed, she said it was "a=
bout" $20,000.=20
Enron workers who were laid off would have been entitled to about $150 mill=
ion total, and Olson said "we thought we could give employees the full seve=
rance" but "at the 11th hour we found we could only give $4,500." Company l=
awyers said the limit was set by law, she said.

Feb. 5, 2002, 9:17PM
WASHINGTON -- Two Enron executives told a Senate panel Tuesday that they sc=
rambled to protect employees' retirement savings and severance pay as soon =
as they realized the company was collapsing last year.=20
"We did the best we could with a difficult situation," said Cindy Olson, ex=
ecutive vice president for human resources for the Houston energy trader.=
=20
Olson and Enron benefits manager Mikie Rath told members of the Senate Gove=
rnmental Affairs Committee that they had considered, then rejected, putting=
 off a planned change in the company's investment administrator last fall w=
hen they realized the transition would take place as Enron's stock was fall=
ing. Employees were prevented from selling the stock in their 401(k) retire=
ment accounts during the transition.=20
Later, as the company was headed for bankruptcy, Olson said she had several=
 conversations with then-Chairman Ken Lay to try to salvage employees' seve=
rance pay. She quickly concluded, she said, that employees would get only a=
 nominal payment of $4,500 each if Enron declared bankruptcy. The realizati=
on was devastating, she said.=20
Several former Enron workers, who are suing Olson and other top executives,=
 criticized the executives' testimony.=20
Debbie Perrotta, a laid-off senior administrative assistant who had worked =
at Enron for five years, testified Tuesday that 4,500 Houston Enron employe=
es lost their jobs, their retirement savings and an estimated $150 million =
in severance and vacation pay after the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec=
. 2.=20
But two days before that filing, Perrotta said, "Enron cut $105 million in =
retention bonuses for a small number of executives."=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who heads the Senate committee, said he wou=
ld subpoena records on the retention bonuses.=20
Perrotta broke down and cried several times as she told of losing $40,000 i=
n retirement money and struggling to pay for her family's health care and h=
er daughter's wedding. She said she and other laid-off employees now must w=
ait in line behind Enron's creditors in bankruptcy court to recover whateve=
r they can.=20
"It may be the law," she said, "but it's wrong."=20
Lieberman asked Olson to explain why she failed to warn employees to sell t=
heir Enron stock as the price was sliding.=20
"We didn't have a crystal ball," Olson said. "We didn't know where the stoc=
k was going to go."=20
She added that federal law limits what investment advice employers can give=
 their employees. Besides, she said, the company's top executives put their=
 faith in Lay and hoped he could save the company.=20
But Lieberman pointed out that something must have motivated Olson to sell =
$6.5 million of her own Enron stock months earlier.=20
Olson -- who served on Enron's executive committee from 1999 until she and =
then-Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling had a falling out and he removed=
 her in early 2001 -- said she sold most of her company stock in late 2000 =
and early 2001.=20
Olson said she was thinking of leaving Enron after Skilling demoted her fro=
m the executive committee and took away some of her human resources duties.=
 She said she and Skilling "did not see eye to eye" about how employees sho=
uld be treated.=20
Olson said she and her husband hired their own financial adviser, who urged=
 her to diversify her stock portfolio so she would not be so reliant on her=
 company's stock.=20
Olson also testified that Sherron Watkins, a former Enron executive, had co=
me to her last summer, asking Olson's advice on whether she should approach=
 Lay with concerns about accounting problems she believed threatened to bri=
ng down the company.=20
Olson said Watkins was unsure whether a memo she had written to Lay on Aug.=
 15 was technically or legally accurate. Olson said she encouraged Watkins =
to talk to Lay.=20
Even after her conversation with Watkins, however, Olson said she did not w=
arn her colleagues. Her talk with Watkins had been confidential, she said, =
and she trusted Lay to act if Watkins' fears were on target.=20
Both Olson and Rath told lawmakers that they had considered halting the tra=
nsition to a new retirement fund administrator last fall, but concluded tha=
t it would take longer to stop the process than to go through with it.=20
In the midst of last fall's anthrax scares and the resulting delays in mail=
 service, they said, it would have been impossible to notify the 11,000 ret=
irees invested in Enron's retirement plan if the company had decided to cha=
nge the schedule for the transition. Notifying current Enron employees via =
e-mail would have treated current and former Enron employees differently an=
d that would have been unfair, they said.=20
Instead, they decided to speed up the transition process and were able to s=
have one week off of the lockdown period so that employees would have acces=
s to their accounts sooner, they said.=20
At the time, Rath testified, she was still hoping the stock price would go =
back up.=20
In the hallway outside the hearing later, several laid-off workers criticiz=
ed the two executives' testimony.=20
"She cashed out six and a half million dollars in her own Enron stock," Gwe=
n Gray said of Olson. "She knew (the company was failing)."=20
Gray, who also worked in Enron's human resources department before she was =
laid off, said she was disturbed by Rath's remark that she couldn't remembe=
r the amount of her own retention bonus.=20
When Rath's former colleagues in the audience laughed at her statement, sen=
ators pressured Rath. She said the bonus was "in excess of $20,000." (Olson=
 testified that she had received nothing to stay with the company.)=20

Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth L. Lay told investigators for the Enron=
 board that he should have paid more attention to his company's bookkeeping=
 but felt "betrayed" by others at the company who kept information from him=
, the board's lead investigator testified yesterday.=20
Lay, in four hours of interviews with the special board committee investiga=
ting the company's collapse, indicated that he knew the company was using E=
nron stock to protect investors in its off-the-books partnerships, said Wil=
liam C. Powers Jr., chairman of the committee, which issued its report Satu=
rday.
That unusual strategy helped Enron hide large debts and losses.=20
"When we interviewed Mr. Lay . . . he didn't understand or appreciate there=
 was anything wrong with it," Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law S=
chool, told the House Government Reform subcommittee on oversight and inves=
tigations. Lay's story was that "the accountants had signed off on it," Pow=
ers said. "It was a credible device."=20
Powers also disclosed that the Enron board's investigative committee spent =
"a couple of hours" interviewing former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Bax=
ter, who was found dead on Jan. 25 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Power=
s said Baxter gave no hint that he was "a person . . . in danger."=20
House members asked Powers for notes or recordings from that interview. Pow=
ers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the com=
pany, but he said he would support their release. Enron attorney Robert Ben=
nett later said the company "certainly will provide the materials requested=
."=20
Committees in the Senate and House yesterday subpoenaed Lay to appear on Ca=
pitol Hill on Feb. 12 and 14. Lay, who withdrew from a scheduled appearance=
 Monday, is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrim=
ination and refuse to testify, but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so=
 in person in the full glare of publicity.=20
Meanwhile, members of a Financial Services subcommittee unleashed their wra=
th on Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino, blasting the big=
 accounting firm's audits of Enron and voicing exasperation when Berardino =
said he didn't know the answers to many of their questions about Andersen's=
 conduct.=20
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," sai=
d Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).=20
"I mean, your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the=
 mast unless you start talking to us about what happened."=20
Berardino, who headed Andersen's audit practice before becoming its chief e=
xecutive about a year ago, said Andersen was still trying to gather the fac=
ts.=20
"I don't know, with authority, what we knew and when we knew it," he told t=
he Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, one of several congr=
essional panels investigating Enron's collapse.=20
Separately, a spokesman for Andersen said yesterday that its auditors went =
to Enron's board earlier than was previously known with concerns about poss=
ible illegal activity.=20
The first approach was in August, after the emergence of a letter from exec=
utive Sherron Watkins to Lay warning of widespread accounting irregularitie=
s, spokesman Charlie Leonard said.=20
Federal law requires auditors to alert the SEC when they suspect illegality=
 and the board or management does not address it. In this case, Andersen pe=
rsonnel went to the board but not to the SEC because they were assured the =
board was investigating the matter, Leonard said.=20
Andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activ=
ities last fall as Enron unraveled.=20
As lawmakers search for ways to prevent future Enrons, Rep. Richard H. Bake=
r (R-La.), chairman of the House subcommittee, floated what would be a fund=
amental change in the auditing business -- having stock exchanges hire the =
auditors. Currently, auditors are hired by the companies they are responsib=
le for auditing -- an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from =
challenging dubious corporate accounting.=20
In other developments yesterday, President Bush rejected a call by Sen. Ern=
est F. Hollings (D-S.C.) for a special prosecutor to investigate Enron, say=
ing his Justice Department could do the job. Enron was a major contributor =
to the Bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administratio=
n officials.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday subpoenaed former Enron c=
hief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow. Fa=
stow's attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily,=
 but they later informed the committee he had "a change of heart," committe=
e spokesman Ken Johnson said. Fastow, who organized some of Enron's largest=
 partnerships and earned at least $30 million from running them, intends to=
 assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Johnson said,=
 but he will be required to do that in front of the committee.=20
Fastow has hired criminal lawyer John Keker of San Francisco, who prosecute=
d Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair, to represent him in the Justic=
e Department's criminal investigation.=20
Andersen's chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance b=
efore the capital markets subcommittee, and lawmakers praised him for testi=
fying. But that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during a=
bout four hours of stern questioning and speechifying. It was a much more s=
keptical reception than Berardino received from the same lawmakers in Decem=
ber, when he faced few if any probing questions. That appearance, however, =
took place before Andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous docu=
ments pertaining to its work at Enron, and before the Powers report said it=
 "did not fulfill its professional responsibilities" in its Enron work.=20
Berardino said auditing is "a hard job" and Andersen personnel "are trained=
 to do the right thing."=20
"But we are human beings, and we may not get it right every time. I'm not a=
pologizing for that," he said.=20
Rep. Max Sandlin (D-Tex.) asked Berardino to consider "the people whose liv=
es . . . you helped destroy," a reference to Enron employees who lost their=
 jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when Enron collapsed. Rep. M=
ichael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) said Andersen "blew it so badly."=20
The report commissioned by Enron directors accused Andersen of failing in i=
ts responsibilities and helping Enron create a web of transactions designed=
 to hide debts and losses. In the process, the report said, Andersen accoun=
tants "had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting=
 rules."=20
For example, the report said Andersen advised Enron each step of the way ab=
out transactions with a group of off-the-books partnerships known as the Ra=
ptors, which "had little economic substance."=20
The Raptor transactions accounted for about $1.1 billion of the $1.5 billio=
n of pretax income Enron reported during the five quarters that preceded En=
ron's December bankruptcy filing.=20
Berardino said Andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn'=
t come up with the ideas for them. The accounting firm was reacting to plan=
s developed by Enron personnel, investment bankers and others, he said.=20
"Suffice it to say that we were very much involved, as the company was, set=
ting up these transactions, giving our advice on whether they would pass th=
e rules," Berardino said. That was part of Andersen's job as auditor, he sa=
id.=20
"The point I would like to emphasize is, at the end of the day, these are t=
he company's financial statements," Berardino told the committee. "We canno=
t make a company report any more than what the rules require," he said.=20
Berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing, saying th=
at simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial=
 debacles. He said stronger discipline is needed because today "punishment =
is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession."=20
The Andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company's acc=
ounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade, as they now do. He to=
ld lawmakers that Andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outsid=
e auditor for the same company -- as it did at Enron -- and will stop consu=
lting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial =
information systems.=20
Berardino said such activities accounted for "very, very little" of the $52=
 million Andersen received from Enron in 2000.=20
Some lawmakers called on Berardino to stop consulting to audit clients alto=
gether.=20
Meanwhile, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the global parent of accounting firm D=
eloitte & Touche, said it will announce today that it intends to split off =
its $3.5 billion management-consulting business, following a similar announ=
cement last week by fellow Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.=

Enron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Pa=
rtnership
By Tom Hamburger and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives tried to get one of the company's in-h=
ouse lawyers fired in 2000 after their boss expressed unhappiness with the =
way the lawyer was negotiating with a partnership in which the boss had an =
interest, congressional investigators said.=20
The disclosure underlined the conflicts of interest that apparently existed=
 with outside partnerships set up and run by some Enron executives. For Enr=
on, which is now in bankruptcy proceedings, the partnerships allowed the Ho=
uston energy-trading company to enhance its profits and to move debt off it=
s books. But the partnerships also were used by some senior Enron executive=
s to enrich themselves, according to an internal company report released th=
is weekend.
The investigators' statements came as several congressional committees push=
ed forward with probes into Enron's collapse. A House and Senate panel each=
 voted to issue subpoenas to force appearances by Kenneth Lay, Enron's form=
er chairman and chief executive. Meanwhile, the head of Arthur Andersen, En=
ron's former auditor, was aggressively questioned before a House panel and =
outlined additional steps the accounting firm is taking to restore its repu=
tation.=20
At issue in the case involving the Enron lawyer was one of the outside part=
nerships known as LJM2. Enron attorney Joel Ephros was negotiating with att=
orneys for LJM2 from the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis in 2000, when he rece=
ived an expletive-laced angry voice mail about his handling of the negotiat=
ion from Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, according to an ac=
count given to congressional investigators. Mr. Fastow at the time ran and =
had an ownership interest in LJM2, which eventually earned him substantial =
profits.=20
Later, in the fall of 2000, two of Mr. Fastow's subordinates, Ben Glisan Jr=
. and Michael Kopper, approached Mr. Ephros's boss to accuse the lawyer of =
being unresponsive and incompetent and to urge his dismissal. The boss, Jor=
dan Mintz, general counsel of Enron Global Finance, had just started his ne=
w job and said he wasn't prepared to make any personnel moves, so he declin=
ed. Informed of the decision, Mr. Fastow didn't object. Mr. Mintz later dec=
ided to keep Mr. Ephros on staff and praised his performance.=20
The attempt to fire Mr. Ephros will be aired at a hearing tomorrow before t=
he House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel, Billy Tauzin, cha=
irman of the full committee, said in an interview. The Louisiana Republican=
 offered the episode as an example of what he called a corrupt culture with=
in Enron as it sought to inflate revenue and conceal losses using entities =
such as LJM2.=20
"They literally became sham operations," said Mr. Tauzin, who is leading th=
e most aggressive probe of nearly a dozen now being conducted on Capitol Hi=
ll into Enron. "One purpose was to fool investors into believing that debt =
had moved, that risk had moved. And the other purpose was to create phony i=
ncome. This is an old game. This is nothing new. This is insider theft."=20
Mr. Mintz will be a chief witness at tomorrow's hearing and is expected to =
detail his recollections about the effort made to muzzle Mr. Ephros. A spok=
esman for Mr. Fastow declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Glisan didn't re=
turn a call for comment. Mr. Ephros and Mr. Kopper couldn't be reached. Mr.=
 Tauzin said he expects Messrs. Fastow and Kopper to invoke their Fifth Ame=
ndment rights against possible self-incrimination to avoid testifying at to=
morrow's hearing.=20
The Ephros episode is an example of a problem addressed cryptically in the =
internal report by a special committee of Enron's board that was released l=
ast weekend. Mr. Fastow "was in a position to exert great pressure and infl=
uence. . . . We have been told of instances in which he used that pressure =
to try to obtain better terms for LJM," the report said. "Simply put, there=
 was little of the separation and independence required to enable Enron emp=
loyees to negotiate effectively against LJM2."=20
Mr. Tauzin said that tomorrow's hearing will also feature details of what h=
e called "literally a sweetheart deal" involving another partnership. Accor=
ding to Mr. Tauzin and his investigators, one of the partnership deals was =
cut by two Enron employees who were engaged to be married, one representing=
 Enron and one representing LJM2.=20
Congressional investigators said that the agreement netted huge profits for=
 the couple, Trushar Patel, an Enron attorney, and his fiancee, Anne C. Yae=
ger, who worked with Mr. Fastow and later left Enron. Ms. Yaeger signed a $=
30 million agreement on behalf of LJM2, listing herself as an "authorized p=
erson," documents shows. Her husband signed representing Enron.=20
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said investigators have learned Ms. Yaeger =
entered into the transaction by initially providing just $10 as a down paym=
ent, later kicking in an additional $2,913. "We believe she walked away fro=
m the deal with a profit of half a million dollars," Mr. Johnson said. "Tha=
t's not a bad return for a $10 initial investment."=20
Messages left at the home of the couple weren't returned.=20
In other action, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Serv=
ices Committee approved subpoenas for Mr. Lay to appear before their panels=
 on Feb. 12 and 14, respectively. Mr. Lay had agreed to appear at hearings =
this week, but backed out in response to scathing criticism from Capitol Hi=
ll prompted by revelations in the Enron board's internal report. Though he =
will be forced to appear, he can refuse to testify by invoking the Fifth Am=
endment, and several senators and House members predicted he would do so. K=
elly Kimberly, Mr. Lay's spokeswoman, said he and his lawyers haven't yet d=
ecided whether he will testify.=20
In his second appearance before the House Financial Services panel, Anderse=
n CEO Joseph Berardino outlined new steps the accounting firm will take to =
restore confidence in its work, including creating offices for audit qualit=
y, ethics and compliance. Mr. Berardino came under heavy criticism from pan=
el members for Andersen's role in the Enron affair, including a document-de=
struction effort undertaken by Houston-based employees, one of whom was sub=
sequently fired. He said he was "embarrassed" by the shredding. On Andersen=
's role in reviewing questionable partnership transactions, which later led=
 to Enron's collapse, he reiterated his assertion that "information was wit=
hheld" by Enron as Andersen was reviewing them.=20
The difficulty Mr. Berardino faces in restoring confidence in his company w=
as made clear in Connecticut yesterday as the state's Board of Accountancy =
escalated its investigation of the firm, issuing a subpoena for Enron-relat=
ed documents. The state could revoke Andersen's license to practice in Conn=
ecticut and levy a fine. State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says his=
 staff is searching for common policies between Andersen's activities in Ho=
uston and Hartford. He added that other state attorneys general have been i=
n contact with him and could pursue similar actions.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TRANSACTIONS
The Financial Wizard Tied to Enron's Fall
By DAVID BARBOZA and JOHN SCHWARTZ

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Feb. 5 -- Before the financial shell games; before Chewco, Raptor =
and LJM; before the partnerships that earned him $30 million, Andrew S. Fas=
tow had his first setback at the Enron Corporation.=20
The setback came in 1996, when Mr. Fastow, a rising young star in corporate=
 finance, was nearly fired for the poor job he did running a retail unit th=
at aimed to put Enron into competition with local utilities around the coun=
try.
Mr. Fastow, whose surname rhymes with how, was simply out of his element am=
ong the intricacies of the retail market, colleagues said and his spokesman=
, Gordon Andrew, acknowledged. Yet while Enron was notorious for its cutthr=
oat corporate culture, its succeed-or-leave ethic, Mr. Fastow had enough in=
fluence to return to his old department, finance.=20
''What the guy knew was numbers and finance,'' a longtime colleague said. '=
'He knew how to close a deal. No one did that better than Andy.''=20
Today, investigators think that Mr. Fastow's financial wizardry, his abilit=
y to wrap the company's assets and debts into complicated off-balance-sheet=
 deals, was a central cause of Enron's undoing. What Mr. Fastow presented a=
s an arrangement intended to benefit Enron, according to a report released =
on Saturday by a special committee of the board, ''became, over time, a mea=
ns of enriching himself personally, and facilitating manipulation of Enron'=
s financial statements.''=20
No one yet knows how much of the blame for Enron's collapse should fall upo=
n Mr. Fastow. On Thursday, Mr. Fastow, 40, a father of two who was Enron's =
chief financial officer until he was forced to resign in October, is expect=
ed to invoke his Fifth Amendment right rather than give potentially self-in=
criminating answers to questions from members of Congress.=20
The crucial question is whether Mr. Fastow was the mastermind behind Enron'=
s most suspect financing deals. Or was he, as Mr. Fastow has maintained thr=
ough a spokesman, merely doing, with the board's knowledge, the bidding of =
his superiors at Enron, the former chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jef=
frey K. Skilling?=20
Even before Mr. Fastow's appearance on Capitol Hill, Representative James C=
. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, called him the ''Betty Crocker of =
cooked books.'' And today, in one Congressional hearing, William C. Powers =
Jr., an Enron director who led the committee that wrote the internal report=
, said Mr. Fastow had been plagued by dual loyalties. ''Fastow couldn't min=
d the store,'' Mr. Powers said, ''because he was involved in the transactio=
ns.''=20
For now, Mr. Fastow is not telling his story. He declined to be interviewed=
 for this article, and he refused to cooperate with a special investigative=
 committee for Enron's board. He also invoked his right against self-incrim=
ination at a meeting a few weeks ago with the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion.=20
But the portrait that is emerging of Mr. Fastow, from interviews with forme=
r colleagues and details from the Enron special report, is that of a brilli=
ant, ambitious and hard-charging executive who, it appears, grew obsessed w=
ith using complex financing techniques to supercharge Enron's earnings whil=
e inflating his own paycheck.=20
Besides the $30 million he made in the LJM partnerships, Mr. Fastow earned =
a hefty salary and stock options at Enron. In 1999 and 2000, he sold about =
$23 million in Enron stock.=20
It was not as if he needed the money, his friends say; his wife, the former=
 Lea Weingarten, is the heiress to a Houston real estate fortune. But Mr. F=
astow was adamant, friends say, in his belief that the amount of money a pe=
rson made was the only meaningful measure of success in business.=20
Even after Mr. Fastow retreated into seclusion last fall, he continued buil=
ding an 11,500-square-foot house in Houston's wealthy River Oaks neighborho=
od. The Fastows also maintain an art collection, some of which has been dis=
played at the Contemporary Arts Museum and at the Menil Collection, both in=
 Houston.=20
He also had a prominent role in Houston's Jewish community, taking charge o=
f fund-raising for the city's new Holocaust museum.=20
''The work was significantly greater than the reward,'' said Bobby Lapin, a=
 lawyer who has known Mr. Fastow for years. ''The person I know bears absol=
utely no relation to the person who has been characterized, in some reports=
, within the walls of Enron.''=20
But the focus on Capitol Hill is not on good deeds.=20
According to the internal report, Mr. Fastow and a group of other top execu=
tives secretly invested in a series of partnerships that benefited from swa=
pping assets with Enron. Mr. Fastow used some of those partnerships to conc=
eal losses at Enron. He used others to inflate profits, by about $1 billion=
 in a 12-month period in 2000 and 2001. And in one instance, he invested $2=
5,000 in Southampton Place, a partnership that in a matter of two months ma=
de $4.5 million from a deal with Enron, the special report said.=20
That transaction, and many others, were never disclosed to Enron's director=
s, the report said. The $4.5 million would eventually reach Mr. Fastow thro=
ugh a family foundation he had set up as a charity.=20
The collapse of Enron is a dramatic reversal of fortune for Mr. Fastow. Unt=
il last August, when Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, Mr. Fastow w=
as at his side constantly, a crucial player in winning Enron acclaim as one=
 of the world's most innovative companies.=20
He arrived at the company in 1990, at age 29, a handsome, talented and ambi=
tious man who would eventually assume the job of chief financial officer in=
 1998 at the age of 36.=20
A graduate of Tufts University and the Kellogg School of Management at Nort=
hwestern, Mr. Fastow was helping to refashion a gas pipeline company into s=
omething more akin to a Wall Street trading house.=20
Those who knew Mr. Fastow at Enron described a man with twin personalities.=
 They say he could be charming yet aggressive, quiet yet mercurial, and phi=
lanthropic yet bent on accumulating the trappings of wealth.=20
''He was very smart and very good at what he did,'' one former executive sa=
id. ''He could be nice, but he could also be quite volatile and short-tempe=
red. He didn't have a lot of patience with people who weren't as smart as h=
im.''=20
Andrew Stuart Fastow was born in Washington but grew up in New Providence, =
N.J., the son of a buyer for supermarkets and department stores. His career=
 started in Chicago in the 1980's, at Continental Bank, where he worked on =
''troubled loans,'' and more complicated deals, like leveraged buyouts.=20
At Enron, he started by trying to arrange financing for Mr. Skilling's inno=
vative plan, the creation of a ''gas bank'' that would help struggling ener=
gy companies by providing them with loans in exchange for their oil and gas=
 reserves, which Enron could hedge and trade against in its growing derivat=
ives unit.=20
Enron later began supporting energy producers by creating partnerships that=
 allowed the company to keep the debt off the balance sheet. The first of t=
hose partnerships was named Cactus.=20
By 1993, the partnerships Mr. Fastow helped set up were so successful that =
Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, approached Enr=
on about a joint venture. The partnership was called JEDI, or the Joint Ene=
rgy Development Investments.=20
Later, there were hundreds of other partnerships, with names like Obi 1, Ch=
ewco and Raptor.=20
In recent years, as Enron pushed to build power plants and to develop new m=
arkets, the company needed huge amounts of capital, and partnerships were o=
ne way to pay for the projects without having the debt accumulate on Enron'=
s balance sheet.=20
In 1999, CFO magazine honored Mr. Fastow for creating an innovative financi=
ng structure. In a rare interview, he told CFO that he would use off-balanc=
e-sheet transactions to avoid weakening Enron's credit rating. And he would=
 do this while operating in the shadows.=20
''This guy was never anything but low profile,'' said John E. Olson, an ene=
rgy analyst at Sanders Morris Harris. ''He rarely, if ever, showed up at an=
alyst meetings. He was a loan consolidator.''=20
By 1999, there were small fissures in Mr. Fastow's labyrinthine financing e=
mpire. As early as 1997, Enron had difficulty finding a partner to buy out =
Calpers's interest. So, apparently to skirt disclosure rules, Mr. Fastow pr=
oposed listing his wife's family as outside investors. When he was rebuffed=
, Michael Kopper, who worked under Mr. Fastow at Enron, was selected. Becau=
se he was a lower-level employee, Enron would not have to disclose his inte=
rest in S.E.C. filings. Mr. Kopper would eventually make at least $10 milli=
on in profit from the venture.=20
Later, Mr. Fastow dealt with partnerships that involved at least four other=
 Enron employees.=20
Mr. Fastow, the board report said, often played dual roles as an Enron exec=
utive and a partner of LJM. Once, he found himself at odds with Enron Broad=
band Services. ''Fastow's involvement caused great distress for the E.B.S. =
team,'' the special report said. ''They understood that their job was to ge=
t the best deal possible for Enron but driving a hard bargain for Enron dre=

Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth L. Lay told investigators for the Enron=
 board that he should have paid more attention to his company's bookkeeping=
 but felt "betrayed" by others at the company who kept information from him=
, the board's lead investigator testified yesterday.=20
Lay, in four hours of interviews with the special board committee investiga=
ting the company's collapse, indicated that he knew the company was using E=
nron stock to protect investors in its off-the-books partnerships, said Wil=
liam C. Powers Jr., chairman of the committee, which issued its report Satu=
rday.
That unusual strategy helped Enron hide large debts and losses.=20
"When we interviewed Mr. Lay . . . he didn't understand or appreciate there=
 was anything wrong with it," Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law S=
chool, told the House Government Reform subcommittee on oversight and inves=
tigations. Lay's story was that "the accountants had signed off on it," Pow=
ers said. "It was a credible device."=20
Powers also disclosed that the Enron board's investigative committee spent =
"a couple of hours" interviewing former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Bax=
ter, who was found dead on Jan. 25 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Power=
s said Baxter gave no hint that he was "a person . . . in danger."=20
House members asked Powers for notes or recordings from that interview. Pow=
ers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the com=
pany, but he said he would support their release. Enron attorney Robert Ben=
nett later said the company "certainly will provide the materials requested=
."=20
Committees in the Senate and House yesterday subpoenaed Lay to appear on Ca=
pitol Hill on Feb. 12 and 14. Lay, who withdrew from a scheduled appearance=
 Monday, is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self-incrim=
ination and refuse to testify, but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so=
 in person in the full glare of publicity.=20
Meanwhile, members of a Financial Services subcommittee unleashed their wra=
th on Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino, blasting the big=
 accounting firm's audits of Enron and voicing exasperation when Berardino =
said he didn't know the answers to many of their questions about Andersen's=
 conduct.=20
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," sai=
d Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).=20
"I mean, your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the=
 mast unless you start talking to us about what happened."=20
Berardino, who headed Andersen's audit practice before becoming its chief e=
xecutive about a year ago, said Andersen was still trying to gather the fac=
ts.=20
"I don't know, with authority, what we knew and when we knew it," he told t=
he Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets, one of several congr=
essional panels investigating Enron's collapse.=20
Separately, a spokesman for Andersen said yesterday that its auditors went =
to Enron's board earlier than was previously known with concerns about poss=
ible illegal activity.=20
The first approach was in August, after the emergence of a letter from exec=
utive Sherron Watkins to Lay warning of widespread accounting irregularitie=
s, spokesman Charlie Leonard said.=20
Federal law requires auditors to alert the SEC when they suspect illegality=
 and the board or management does not address it. In this case, Andersen pe=
rsonnel went to the board but not to the SEC because they were assured the =
board was investigating the matter, Leonard said.=20
Andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activ=
ities last fall as Enron unraveled.=20
As lawmakers search for ways to prevent future Enrons, Rep. Richard H. Bake=
r (R-La.), chairman of the House subcommittee, floated what would be a fund=
amental change in the auditing business -- having stock exchanges hire the =
auditors. Currently, auditors are hired by the companies they are responsib=
le for auditing -- an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from =
challenging dubious corporate accounting.=20
In other developments yesterday, President Bush rejected a call by Sen. Ern=
est F. Hollings (D-S.C.) for a special prosecutor to investigate Enron, say=
ing his Justice Department could do the job. Enron was a major contributor =
to the Bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administratio=
n officials.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday subpoenaed former Enron c=
hief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow. Fa=
stow's attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily,=
 but they later informed the committee he had "a change of heart," committe=
e spokesman Ken Johnson said. Fastow, who organized some of Enron's largest=
 partnerships and earned at least $30 million from running them, intends to=
 assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Johnson said,=
 but he will be required to do that in front of the committee.=20
Fastow has hired criminal lawyer John Keker of San Francisco, who prosecute=
d Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair, to represent him in the Justic=
e Department's criminal investigation.=20
Andersen's chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance b=
efore the capital markets subcommittee, and lawmakers praised him for testi=
fying. But that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during a=
bout four hours of stern questioning and speechifying. It was a much more s=
keptical reception than Berardino received from the same lawmakers in Decem=
ber, when he faced few if any probing questions. That appearance, however, =
took place before Andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous docu=
ments pertaining to its work at Enron, and before the Powers report said it=
 "did not fulfill its professional responsibilities" in its Enron work.=20
Berardino said auditing is "a hard job" and Andersen personnel "are trained=
 to do the right thing."=20
"But we are human beings, and we may not get it right every time. I'm not a=
pologizing for that," he said.=20
Rep. Max Sandlin (D-Tex.) asked Berardino to consider "the people whose liv=
es . . . you helped destroy," a reference to Enron employees who lost their=
 jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when Enron collapsed. Rep. M=
ichael E. Capuano (D-Mass.) said Andersen "blew it so badly."=20
The report commissioned by Enron directors accused Andersen of failing in i=
ts responsibilities and helping Enron create a web of transactions designed=
 to hide debts and losses. In the process, the report said, Andersen accoun=
tants "had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting=
 rules."=20
For example, the report said Andersen advised Enron each step of the way ab=
out transactions with a group of off-the-books partnerships known as the Ra=
ptors, which "had little economic substance."=20
The Raptor transactions accounted for about $1.1 billion of the $1.5 billio=
n of pretax income Enron reported during the five quarters that preceded En=
ron's December bankruptcy filing.=20
Berardino said Andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn'=
t come up with the ideas for them. The accounting firm was reacting to plan=
s developed by Enron personnel, investment bankers and others, he said.=20
"Suffice it to say that we were very much involved, as the company was, set=
ting up these transactions, giving our advice on whether they would pass th=
e rules," Berardino said. That was part of Andersen's job as auditor, he sa=
id.=20
"The point I would like to emphasize is, at the end of the day, these are t=
he company's financial statements," Berardino told the committee. "We canno=
t make a company report any more than what the rules require," he said.=20
Berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing, saying th=
at simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial=
 debacles. He said stronger discipline is needed because today "punishment =
is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession."=20
The Andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company's acc=
ounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade, as they now do. He to=
ld lawmakers that Andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outsid=
e auditor for the same company -- as it did at Enron -- and will stop consu=
lting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial =
information systems.=20
Berardino said such activities accounted for "very, very little" of the $52=
 million Andersen received from Enron in 2000.=20
Some lawmakers called on Berardino to stop consulting to audit clients alto=
gether.=20
Meanwhile, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the global parent of accounting firm D=
eloitte & Touche, said it will announce today that it intends to split off =
its $3.5 billion management-consulting business, following a similar announ=
cement last week by fellow Big Five accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.=

Lou Pai struck many colleagues as the brightest brain at Enron. Others say =
he was notable for helping to produce some of the company's biggest busines=
s disasters while head of Enron Energy Services, the Houston firm's effort =
to sell electricity to retail customers.=20
The 54-year-old Pai certainly stands out as the company's biggest winner am=
id financial devastation -- he sold $270 million of Enron stock in the 16 m=
onths before he resigned last July.
Because of his stock sales, he, along with other senior Enron executives an=
d board members, is being sued by shareholders. But so far he is one of the=
 second-tier players in the Enron drama. He was not named in the Enron boar=
d's special report on the partnerships run by the company's chief financial=
 officers. He has not been called to testify by the myriad congressional co=
mmittees probing Enron's collapse.=20
But Pai's role at Enron illustrates some central themes in the company's ri=
se and fall, according to former executives and colleagues.=20
His windfall from Enron stock sales highlights a compensation strategy that=
 provided huge rewards to top executives who launched new business or creat=
ed major new trading opportunities for the Houston company. Some company cr=
itics say this reward structure led Enron to take greater and greater busin=
ess risks that finally caught up with the company last year.=20
There are allegations that the retail energy business Pai headed until last=
 year racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses in 2000, =
according to a memo written by former Enron manager Margaret Ceconi. She co=
ntends that those losses were effectively hidden when the division was comb=
ined with a much larger wholesale energy operation around March 2001.=20
An Enron spokesman has disputed that allegation.=20
Pai, who lives with his second wife in Houston's Sugar Land suburb, decline=
d, through one of his attorneys, to be interviewed for this report.=20
A source close to Pai said Pai "doesn't know anything" about the alleged hi=
dden losses. She called Pai "a consummate professional" who also knows noth=
ing about the partnerships accused of hiding company losses and inflating e=
arnings. "Lou was an operations guy" who had "nothing to do with accounting=
," she said.=20
Pai is "a very quiet guy," the source added. "If you walked into a room of =
people, you would not pick him out as the guy with all the money," she said=
.=20
There were signs Pai was willing to spend freely, however. He, and possibly=
 other partners, bought 77,000 acres of Colorado mountain land since 1999 f=
or at least $23 million, according to press reports in that state.=20
In the spring of 2000, about the time he was going through a divorce, Pai w=
as intent on buying a house. He told people he wanted to have a home for hi=
s son to visit during a break from college.=20
The house he chose in the Tanglewood section of Houston had been on the mar=
ket for only a day or two. He paid just over $900,000 in cash, according to=
 a person familiar with the deal. "There was hardly anybody ever at the hou=
se. Within six months, the house was back on the market," the person said.=
=20
The source close to Pai said he used tens of millions of dollars of the pro=
ceeds from his Enron stock sales for his divorce settlement in 2000.=20
Pai is the son of a distinguished aeronautics engineering professor at the =
University of Maryland, Shih-I Pai, who died in 1996. He himself earned an =
undergraduate degree at Maryland in 1970 and a master's degree in economics=
 there three years later.=20
Pai worked at Conoco Inc., another energy company, before joining Enron in =
1987. Three years later he was part of a new group of executives forming ar=
ound Jeffrey K. Skilling -- later the company's chief executive -- bent on =
turning Enron from a dowdy natural gas pipeline company into a fast-paced e=
nergy-trading firm.=20
Quiet-spoken and diminutive, Pai did not push his way into discussions, ass=
ociates said. He did win notice for his ability to devise ingenious energy-=
trading strategies that covered a variety of business risks, including shar=
p swings in prices and changes in the weather, they added.=20
Working first for the corporate planning group, he helped set up one of the=
 company's first risk-management units. It used complex financial contracts=
 to help protect Enron's natural gas investments against sharp price swings=
.=20
That became a model for Enron's wholesale electricity-trading business, Enr=
on Capital & Trade Resources, which led in turn to the creation of the comp=
any's retail energy unit.=20
Pai's expertise was strong enough to insulate him from the first of his set=
backs as a manager, Enron's attempt to sell retail electricity to household=
s and commercial customers in California and East Coast states as energy de=
regulation began in those states in the mid-1990s.=20
In 1997, Pai became chairman of Enron Energy Services (EES), the company un=
it handling retail energy marketing. Thomas E. White, now secretary of the =
Army, was vice chairman of the unit from 1998 until last year.=20
A year later, however, after spending $15 million to promote the unit's ser=
vices with Super Bowl ads and other promotions, Enron gave up in California=
 -- the costs of competing against the state's utilities were too high.=20
Outside California, the move toward electricity deregulation was halting, d=
espite state-by-state lobbying by Enron's political teams.=20
But Pai wasn't through, and EES shifted its sights to large commercial and =
industrial customers while spinning off its power-marketing operation for h=
ouseholds to a new subsidiary called New Power Co.=20
In one interview in 2000, Skilling called Pai "my ICBM," an intellectual mi=
ssile instantly launched at new ventures. "He can conceptualize it, bring i=
n the right people, and get it up and running fast," Skilling said.=20
But the creation of New Power as a separate unit was an admission that EES =
had failed at consumer retailing, said Marc E. Manly, a managing director o=
f New Power, now a separate company.=20
"They didn't know how to do it," Manly said of Enron's efforts in the field=
. "They failed miserably." While remaining at Enron and EES, Pai was given =
the chairmanship of New Power when Enron spun it off as a publicly traded f=
irm in 2000.=20
He showed his loyalty by investing $5 million in New Power. And Enron recip=
rocated, giving Pai 2 million shares of New Power stock.=20
"That was an arrangement with Lou," Manly said. "He was in at the beginning=
 of this, the originator of the idea of the company, and Enron worked out a=
 compensation arrangement. . . . We had to abide by the commitment Enron ha=
d made with Lou."=20
Pai is listed in the latest New Power company filings as its largest single=
 shareholder, with 3.4 million shares. While Pai's timing in his sales of E=
nron shares was fortunate, that wasn't the case with New Power.=20
The stock went public in October 2000 at $21 a share. But the public's resi=
stance to electricity deregulation after the California crisis and a steep =
drop in electricity prices has battered New Power's operations. It's stock =
closed yesterday at 36 cents a share.=20
While running EES in 1999, Pai began purchasing the Taylor Ranch in souther=
n Colorado, on the west side of a mountain range that rises to 14,000 feet =
and runs down almost to the New Mexico border.=20
Exactly how much Pai owns and controls isn't clear. Before Pai bought the l=
and, the owner had tried to keep local residents off the sprawling site, ba=
rring them from hunting and gathering wood. Pai has continued to oppose acc=
ess and now is the target of a 20-year-old lawsuit over the issue.=20
Lawyer Jeff Goldstein, who has represented local residents suing the ranch,=
 said it's Pai's property. "There is no question that he is the principal. =
He goes there and seems to be running the show," Goldstein said.=20
But as with Enron's entities, the exact ownership is murky, Goldstein said.=
 The listed owners are partnerships.=20

THE NATION Enron Execs Sold Stock as Losses Grew Probe: The $44-million sel=
l-off came amid concern that problems at partnerships could become public. =
The action raises questions of possible insider trading.

HOUSTON -- A handful of senior Enron Corp. executives sold $44 million in c=
ompany stock while concerns were growing inside the company that losses rac=
ked up by a group of obscure partnerships could spill into public view, rec=
ords show.=20
The huge investment losses by the four so-called Raptor partnerships were d=
isclosed months later and played a key role in forcing Enron in October to =
say it had overstated the value of the company by $1.2 billion, spurring th=
e company's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.
Stock sales by Enron executives before the company's descent previously hav=
e come under a spotlight, but the timing of the sales gained new significan=
ce with the release Saturday of an internal Enron investigation that detail=
ed the executives' knowledge of the Raptor problems.=20
Four Enron executives--including former President and Chief Executive Jeffr=
ey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow--sold ab=
out $44 million in stock from Aug. 7, 2000, when the Raptor problems became=
 known internally, through March 26, 2001, when the partnerships were restr=
uctured to prevent disclosure of losses, according to a review of stock sal=
es Tuesday.=20
There is no evidence that the sales were directly related to knowledge of t=
he problems facing the Raptors. But any stock sales by executives based on =
information not available to the public could be construed as trading on in=
side information, a federal crime, according to a Washington securities law=
yer who declined to speak for attribution.=20
The executives--Skilling, Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard A. Ca=
usey and Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy--could not be reached for commen=
t.=20
During the period Aug. 7, 2000, to March 26, 2001, Skilling had stock sales=
 totaling $28.2 million, and Fastow sales totaling $4.3 million, according =
to data compiled by Thomson Financial, a securities research firm.=20
Causey's sales totaled $7.1 million and Buy's totaled $4.3 million, Thomson=
 said.=20
The sales came at a time when Enron executives were concerned that losses b=
y the Raptors could force damaging public disclosure. The fear of disclosin=
g those losses led Enron to expand and restructure the Raptors during an ei=
ght-month period in 2000-01 to keep its losses off the corporate books, acc=
ording to an Enron board committee's internal report issued Saturday.=20
Only an elaborate reorganization of the Raptors last March 26 saved Enron f=
rom having to disclose a $504-million loss on its first-quarter financial s=
tatements, according to Enron's internal report.=20
Starting April 18, 2000, Enron created the first of four Raptor entities so=
 that losses in its investment portfolio (including stocks) would not show =
up on Enron's income statement, the internal report said. The Raptors, whic=
h were little known beyond a small group of corporate insiders, allowed the=
 energy company to hedge, or shield itself from, future losses on its inves=
tment portfolio by shifting some of the risk to the Raptors.=20
Enron provided the initial funding for three of the Raptors with shares of =
its own stock. Each one also received a modest investment from a related pa=
rtnership headed by Fastow.=20
In essence, the Raptors agreed to cover potential losses on certain Enron i=
nvestments. As long as the value of the Enron shares backing the Raptors he=
ld up, the entities would be able to pay their debts to the energy giant. E=
nron counted the debts owed by the Raptors as income, offsetting losses fro=
m its portfolio.=20
Soon after creating the Raptors, however, Enron executives learned how quic=
kly they could slip into trouble.=20
According to the report, Skilling, Fastow, Causey and Buy attended an Aug. =
7, 2000, meeting of Enron's finance committee in which Treasurer Ben Glisan=
 noted that the credit capacity of Raptor I was "almost completely utilized=
 and that Raptor II would not be available" until months later. The committ=
ee recommended creating a Raptor IV, but before that could be activated exe=
cutives created, without board approval, Raptor III without informing the b=
oard.=20
Unlike the other entities, Raptor III was not backed by Enron stock, making=
 it what the internal investigation called an "extraordinarily fragile stru=
cture."=20
One day after Raptor III became active, on Sept. 28, 2000, Causey exercised=
 61,097 stock options and sold an additional 19,536 shares, netting $5.4 mi=
llion, according to the analysis by Thomson. That was one of only four days=
 Enron's chief accounting officer has traded shares, according to Thomson.=
=20
By late 2000, two of the entities, Raptor I and Raptor III, were essentiall=
y insolvent, lacking the credit to be able to pay back their debts, the rep=
ort said.=20
Raptor III was in especially bad shape. Unlike the three other entities, Ra=
ptor III was essentially backed by shares of New Power Co., an Enron spinof=
f that quickly foundered after going public. But under the deal designed by=
 Enron accountants, the more that New Power shares fell, the more money Rap=
tor III owed Enron.=20
New Power went public Oct. 5, 2000. By mid-November, the stock had lost 50%=
 of its value, threatening to wreak havoc with the Raptor structure and for=
ce Enron to disclose huge losses, according to the internal report.=20
On Nov. 7, Fastow sold 52,080 shares at $83 each for a gross of $4.32 milli=
on. Filings reviewed by Thomson did not indicate Fastow's cost, so his net =
gain on the sales is unclear. Stock sales by Fastow earlier in the year--af=
ter the Raptors had been devised but before they showed signs of serious tr=
ouble--netted him an estimated $3.4 million.=20
To avoid having to disclose a huge loss, Enron executives on Dec. 22, 2000,=
 merged the credit of the four Raptors under a 45-day pact, allowing Enron =
to avoid reporting a credit-reserve loss in its year-end financial statemen=
ts.=20
In early January, Enron accountants began work to develop a more permanent =
solution to replace the 45-day agreement, according to the internal report.=
 The accountants designed a complex restructuring that took effect March 26=
, 2001.=20
"We were told that, during the first quarter of 2001, Skilling said that fi=
xing the Raptors' credit capacity problems was one of the company's highest=
 priorities," the report said.=20
Skilling has disputed that account. He told the board investigation team, l=
ed by Texas Law School dean William Powers, that he recalls being informed =
of the Raptors' credit problems "in only general terms" and that he underst=
ood the matter to be "an accounting issue."=20
The committee found that "either Skilling was not nearly as involved in Enr=
on's business as his reputation--and his own description of his approach to=
 the job--would suggest, or he was deliberately kept in the dark by those i=
nvolved in the restructuring."=20
By February 2001, Enron accountants were providing daily reports of the cre=
dit status of at least two of the Raptors to Causey and Buy, according to t=
he internal report.=20
Tension built through March 2001, according to the report, after executives=
 became aware that Enron would have to take a pretax charge against earning=
s of about $504 million to reflect the shortfall in credit capacity of Rapt=
ors I and III.=20
Buy, who had not traded any Enron shares since becoming Enron's chief risk =
officer in mid-1999, began an intense sell-off Jan. 2, 2001. According to T=
homson's analysis, the 54,874 shares he sold from that date through March 5=
 of that year are the only shares he has sold since taking that post. The s=
ales netted him an estimated $2.8 million.=20
For his part, Enron's since-ousted chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L.=
 Lay, knew of the creation of the Raptors, the internal report said. But in=
vestigators said they found no evidence that Lay, who stepped aside as CEO =
in February 2001 in favor of Skilling, was aware of the entities' debts and=
 reorganization.=20
On Aug. 24, 2000, Lay exercised 140,230 options and sold 75,000 shares, net=
ting a $4.09-million profit on the day. On Nov. 1, he settled into a patter=
n, selling blocks of 1,000 to 4,000 shares almost every day until August 20=
01.=20
In hindsight, the committee said, Enron's top executives, as well as outsid=
e advisors including accounting firm Andersen, should have kept closer over=
sight ofthe Raptors and other partnerships.=20
"The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors =
was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by =
a group of innovative accountants," the committee report said. "We believe =
. . . especially after the restructuring, the Raptors were little more than=
 a highly complex accounting construct that was destined to collapse."=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE MANAGEMENT
2 Officials Are Expected To Leave the Company

Page 9, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Two of the senior Enron executives who were sharply criticized in a report =
by a special committee of the board are expected to leave the company.=20
Members of the senior staff at Enron have been told that Richard A. Causey,=
 the chief accounting officer, and Richard B. Buy, the chief risk officer, =
are expected to leave the company and are currently negotiating the terms o=
f their departures.
The situation is in flux, according to people close to the board.=20
While the report examined the role of other executives who remain at Enron,=
 including Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's new president, and James V. Derrick Jr.=
, the general counsel, it focused on the responsibilities of Mr. Causey and=
 Mr. Buy in providing accounting and risk-management controls at Enron.=20
An Enron spokesman and a lawyer for Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy did not return p=
hone calls seeking comment.=20
None of the four executives had a direct role in the arrangement outlined i=
n the report that used the partnerships to inflate profits and enrich some =
employees. But none of the executives alerted the board to troubling signs =
that these partnerships posed problems, according to the report.=20
Mr. Causey, Mr. Buy and Mr. Derrick were all broadly responsible for overse=
eing what the company told investors about the partnerships, and they all p=
layed a part in the general oversight of Enron's finances.=20
Mr. Derrick's lawyer, J. Clifford Gunter, said Mr. Derrick could not commen=
t on the report.=20
But the two executives with explicit duties to oversee the partnerships, re=
viewing transactions between the partnerships and the company, were Mr. Cau=
sey and Mr. Buy. While the report says they did not ignore their duties, ''=
they interpreted their roles very narrowly and did not give the transaction=
s the degree of review the board believed was occurring.'' As the most seni=
or accounting officer, Mr. Causey was ultimately responsible for Enron's fi=
nancial reporting, according to the report. ''He presided over and particip=
ated in a series of accounting judgments that, based on the accounting advi=
ce we have received, went well beyond the aggressive,'' said the report.=20
Mr. Causey also had a significant role in the decisions surrounding what En=
ron would make public, according to the report. Although the report depicte=
d him as relying on the advice of the company's outside accountant, Arthur =
Andersen, he was described as ''the final arbiter of unresolved differences=
 among the various contributors to the financial reporting process.''=20
The report concluded that Enron's disclosures, involving the compensation o=
f the former chief financial officer involved in the partnerships and a var=
iety of transactions between the partnerships and the company, ''were funda=
mentally inadequate.''=20
Because of Mr. Causey's specific responsibility ''with reviewing Enron's tr=
ansactions with the LJM partnerships,'' he should have been in a position t=
o provide advice concerning the disclosures, according to the report. ''The=
 evidence we have seen suggests he did not.''=20
The report criticized Mr. Buy for neglecting his role in reviewing and appr=
oving all of the transactions between the partnerships and Enron. Mr. Buy n=
ever followed a procedure to identify all the transactions and did not, in =
the report's words, ''affirmatively'' carry out his responsibility for care=
fully reviewing the economic terms of all of the transactions.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that both Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy=
 were being placed on leave.=20
The board's report provides less detail on the role of Mr. Derrick, Enron's=
 general counsel, who oversaw the dozens of in-house lawyers involved. The =
report does, however, suggest that Mr. Derrick and Enron's in-house legal s=
taff played some role in determining what Enron told the public, in conjunc=
tion with the company's outside accountants and lawyers.=20
Mr. Derrick was also at the center of Enron's investigation of the concerns=
 raised by Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron executive, last August, according t=
o the report. In consultation with Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, he sel=
ected Vinson & Elkins, despite potential conflicts, as the law firm to cond=
uct the preliminary inquiry and severely limited its range. ''The scope and=
 process of the investigation appear to have been structured with less skep=
ticism than was needed to see through these particularly complex transactio=
ns,'' the report said.=20
Even Mr. McMahon, who was named Enron's president last month as part of the=
 team now leading Enron's restructuring, appears to be among the many execu=
tives who failed to speak up, according to the report. While Mr. McMahon ra=
ised doubts about the partnerships as early as March 2000, according to the=
 report, he appears never to have voiced them to Mr. Lay or the board.=20
All four executives were named in a lawsuit concerning possible insider tra=
ding because of their sales of Enron stock in recent years. According to th=
e lawsuit, Mr. Causey sold $13.3 million in stock, Mr. Derrick sold $12.7 m=
illion, Mr. Buy sold $4.3 million and Mr. McMahon sold $2.7 million. Mr. De=
rrick never exercised a single option that was not about to expire, accordi=
ng to his lawyer.=20
In the end, the report highlights what appear to be a series of failures of=
 the various checks in place that led to $1 billion in false profits and th=
e crisis in confidence that culminated in Enron's filing for bankruptcy las=
t fall. At any point, concerns raised by the legal, accounting or risk-mana=
gement executives involved might have prevented the company's collapse, acc=
ording to Robert Mittelstaedt Jr., a professor at the Wharton School of the=
 University of Pennsylvania.=20
''It takes a whole series of mistakes to go so very badly,'' he said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CONGRESSIONAL MEMO
Investigators Buying Time For Inquiry
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Kenneth L. Lay backed out of his date with Congress t=
his week, but his refusal to testify voluntarily only served to increase th=
e resolve of politicians to get the truth about the fall of the Enron Corpo=
ration, even if they never get the opportunity to hear the former Enron cha=
irman's side of the story.=20
Two panels sent subpoenas today to Mr. Lay, but lawmakers said they were al=
most certain Mr. Lay would refuse to answer their questions and would inste=
ad invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Two other f=
ormer Enron executives, Andrew S. Fastow and Jeffrey K. Skilling, are also =
expected by lawmakers to decline to testify.
Yet in the end, the former Enron executives' refusal to cooperate may repre=
sent little more than a speed bump to the 11 Congressional inquiries focusi=
ng on the many strands of the largest bankruptcy case in American history, =
Congressional leaders and staff members said today.=20
The extension of the Congressional inquiries is a mixed blessing for the Wh=
ite House because the Enron examination on Capitol Hill will continue to be=
 a distraction from the Bush administration's war on terrorism and its effo=
rts to invigorate the economy.=20
Congressional staff members say the Enron executives' refusal to testify no=
w will allow staff members more time to comb through more than two million =
Enron documents and assemble the many pieces of a very complex corporate pu=
zzle.=20
''It helps us more than it hurts us,'' Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House=
 Committee on Energy and Commerce, said of the delay in hearing from the fo=
rmer executives. ''The game plan was always to bring in the underlings firs=
t and set the stage for an appearance by Mr. Lay and the other senior execu=
tives when we have more evidence.''=20
In 1994, as a House panel inquiry on the tobacco industry was just beginnin=
g, seven tobacco executives voluntarily testified and swore under oath that=
 nicotine was not addictive and they did not market cigarettes to children.=
 Later in the inquiry, the panel obtained a slew of documents that undercut=
 many of the statements made by the tobacco executives. But when Republican=
s seized the leadership of the House in 1995, the executives were not requi=
red to testify again after the Republicans closed the inquiry.=20
Mr. Lay's refusal to testify served as a reminder on Capitol Hill that the =
Bush administration has refused to cooperate with a related Congressional i=
nquiry. Several Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill aimed their anger over M=
r. Lay's refusal to cooperate squarely at the White House.=20
The Bush administration has rejected a request by the General Accounting Of=
fice, the investigative arm of Congress, for a list of energy industry exec=
utives, including some from Enron, who met with Vice President Dick Cheney'=
s energy task force last year. The accounting office is expected to file a =
lawsuit against Mr. Cheney and the administration.=20
''The appearance is awful,'' said Philip M. Schiliro, the chief of staff fo=
r Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. ''Lay is reversin=
g himself and refusing to voluntarily testify, and at the same time the adm=
inistration is continuing to refuse to cooperate with the Congress. It's ha=
rd to believe that's a combination the administration wants.''=20
Mary Matalin, counselor to the vice president, portrayed some Democrats' an=
ger at the White House as ''playing politics with Enron.''=20
''As we've been saying from the beginning, we are greatly saddened by the D=
emocrats who prefer to play politics with this difficult issue as opposed t=
o joining the president to form policies that will ensure this will never h=
appen again,'' Ms. Matalin said.=20
Another senior administration official scoffed at the idea that the Enron c=
ollapse was anything but a corporate scandal. ''People think Ken Lay is Sat=
an,'' the official said. ''They don't think we are and they don't think som=
e G.A.O. process story is the equivalent of lying and robbing people.''=20
Mr. Lay had agreed in December to appear on Feb. 4 before the Senate Commer=
ce Committee. But his offer occurred before many of the most damning revela=
tions about Enron, which was capped over the weekend by a highly critical r=
eport by a committee of Enron's board.

Enron Team Says Lay Took Some Blame Hearings: Former chief admits lapse in =
oversight, according to internal investigator questioned by lawmakers.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

WASHINGTON -- Former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay acknowledged to co=
mpany investigators that he should have kept a closer eye on the energy tra=
der's financial operations, but he also pointed the finger at subordinates,=
 the head of the company's internal investigation told Congress on Tuesday.=
=20
"I think he felt he had not been watching carefully enough, but he certainl=
y felt he had been betrayed," said William C. Powers, whose team interviewe=
d Lay as part of a recently released report examining the company's collaps=
e.
Meanwhile, lawmakers grilled Joseph F. Berardino, the head of Enron's forme=
r outside auditor, Andersen, for destroying thousands of documents related =
to Enron and for helping to create some of the off-the-books partnerships t=
hat led to Enron's demise.=20
"Your company helped set these up," said Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.). "Y=
ou're not some innocent coming in here as an auditor and having all these t=
ransactions that are out there and you're just looking at them. You went th=
rough the intellectual analysis of how to do these things."=20
House and Senate committees still want to hear directly from Lay, issuing s=
ubpoenas Tuesday for him to appear next week. He and another star witness--=
former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who has been asked to appe=
ar on Thursday--are expected to invoke their 5th Amendment right against se=
lf-incrimination.=20
Lay was summoned to appear Feb. 12 before the Senate Commerce Committee and=
 Feb. 14 before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital market=
s.=20
Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly, asked about whether Lay would invoke the 5t=
h, said, "He is still determining his strategy for how to handle the hearin=
gs."=20
Unable to hear from Lay, members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommit=
tee on oversight and investigations sought to find out from Powers, dean of=
 the University of Texas law school who joined Enron's board last fall, exa=
ctly what the former Enron chief knew and when he knew it.=20
The Houston-based energy company--once one of the nation's largest and best=
-connected corporations--sought bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 amid questions=
 about its accounting practices. Less than a month before filing for Chapte=
r 11, Enron revealed previously unreported losses of $586 million over the =
previous 4 1/2 years.=20
Powers, whose team spent four hours interviewing Lay during its internal pr=
obe, said Lay was aware Enron was using company stock to hedge against inve=
stment losses.=20
"He didn't understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong with that=
," Powers told the committee. "I don't know whether that's credible. That's=
 his story." Lawmakers said they hope to secure notes of Powers' interviews=
 of Lay and other senior officials.=20
Powers' 203-page report, released late Saturday, concluded that accounting =
abuses masked more than $1 billion in losses in a one-year period and assig=
ned widespread blame to Enron management, accounting firm Andersen, company=
 lawyers and Enron's board for creating--and then failing to oversee--a ser=
ies of partnerships that sparked the company's bankruptcy filing. The repor=
t noted that Lay, a major fund-raiser for President Bush, was "captain of t=
he ship" for most of the time that abuses were occurring and "bears signifi=
cant responsibility for ... flawed decisions" of subordinates.=20
Powers said the Enron investigating team also met briefly with Fastow, but =
"very little information was forthcoming"--a sign of the challenge before C=
ongress in grilling the man who is regarded as the expert on the partnershi=
ps.=20
Powers told the committee that Andersen stopped cooperating with Enron's in=
ternal investigation once the company fired the accounting firm, saying the=
 auditors had destroyed documents sought by government investigators.=20
But Andersen's chairman, Berardino, said the firm offered to assist Powers =
but was not contacted by his team after the Jan. 17 firing.=20
At his second appearance before a House Financial Services subcommittee, Be=
rardino offered few new details about why Andersen destroyed documents and =
failed to warn investors about Enron's questionable accounting practices.=
=20
Asked about the shredding, Berardino said, "I'm embarrassed by what happene=
d at my firm."=20
But Berardino repeatedly said he did not know the details of Andersen's bus=
iness dealings with Enron, whether Andersen employees knew about problems o=
r what documents were destroyed. "How could you not know?" asked Rep. Richa=
rd H. Baker (R-La.).=20
"Maybe it's better to be dumb than culpable, but we want some answers," sai=
d Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.).=20
Andersen has not completed its own internal investigation into the Enron ma=
tter. Berardino disputed allegations in the Powers report that the firm was=
 instrumental in creating some of the questionable partnerships. "It's not =
like we were running around town shopping these things," he said. He said A=
ndersen merely reviewed proposals made by Enron managers.=20
At a separate House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of =
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that congressional investigat=
ors were finding that "there was no legitimate purpose in the construction =
of some of these deals except in the defrauding of investors."=20
Investigators also have found that "some [investment] banks were told they'=
d get special bond deals if they would put the money up for some of the par=
tnerships," Tauzin said.=20
A Tauzin spokesman declined to elaborate.

Astros want out of naming-rights deal=20
By ERIC BERGER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Feb. 6, 2002, 1:55AM
Saying Enron's collapse has "tarnished the reputation of the Houston Astros=
," the club sought a court order Tuesday to get out of its naming-rights ag=
reement with the company.=20
With the 2002 season looming, lawyers for the team asked U.S. Bankruptcy Ju=
dge Arthur Gonzalez to force Enron to accept or reject the agreement that h=
as kept the company's name on the ballpark and virtually all related materi=
als since it opened.=20
Enron almost certainly couldn't make another payment on the 30-year, $100 m=
illion contract, so it would have to relinquish the Enron Field name and al=
low the Astros to sell the rights to another bidder.=20
"We felt like we needed to take an aggressive stance," said Astros owner Dr=
ayton McLane. "We just find it kind of embarrassing that we're tangled up i=
n all of this."=20
Since Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, McLane said, the team has tried to=
 renegotiate the agreement, which also requires the company to lease a larg=
e luxury suite and buy 35 season tickets for box seats.=20
McLane said he and his assistants have had one meeting with the company's t=
hen-chairman, Ken Lay, and more talks with other executives, including Cind=
y Olson, an Enron executive vice president.=20
"Ken said he was going to follow through, but it just never unfolded," McLa=
ne said.=20
Enron officials responded that their main concern is trying to recover some=
 or all of the $3.4 million they paid the Astros last August. The next annu=
al payment, for $3.65 million, is due Aug. 31.=20
Company spokesman Mark Palmer said Enron is acting on behalf of its credito=
rs. To comply with the terms of the contract, the company paid $108,000 for=
 a 14-person luxury suite on Jan. 22, and nearly $90,000 for the 35 season =
box seats on Monday.=20
"Let me get this right," Palmer said, "they're upset that we're living up t=
o our contractual obligations?"=20
With opening day less than two months away, the club faces the embarrassing=
 possibility of having the Astros continually linked to a disgraced and ban=
krupt company.=20
Palmer said Enron is ready to talk buyout.=20
Because Enron has not defaulted on its payments, there is no way for the As=
tros to rename Enron field until at least Aug. 31 without negotiating an en=
d to the contract or the judge compelling Enron to accept or reject it. A h=
earing has been set on the Astros' motion for Feb. 27 in the New York court=
.=20
In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy the debtor, Enron in this case, does not have to=
 accept or reject a contract until it files a reorganization plan, which li=
kely won't happen until this summer, or later.=20
In arguing their case, the Astros maintain the association with Enron has h=
urt their business. McLane said many people believe Enron owns a piece of t=
he club.=20
"One thing is clear: The Astros are being perceived in the public and cast =
in the national media as an affiliate (and even an ally) of Enron even thou=
gh the Astros have done nothing wrong," Astros attorney Paul K. Ferdinands =
argues in the legal motion.=20
"The court should not allow this irreparable harm to continue."=20
In the motion, the Astros say the team has had to devote substantial resour=
ces to respond to a "deluge of daily inquiries" about the Astros' relations=
hip with Enron. Also, fans and corporate sponsors may seek to distance them=
selves from the team because of the association with Enron.=20
And the financial uncertainty of whether the company will make its $3.7 mil=
lion payment this August affects the Astros' ability to field the best team=
 possible, the motion states.=20
Judge Gonzalez may well buy none of those arguments, said Nancy Rapoport, d=
ean of the University of Houston Law Center and a bankruptcy law expert.=20
"The judge is most likely to say, `Thank you for your motion,' " she said. =
"There's no rush and there may be more pressing executory contracts."=20
At the heart of the dispute is whether Enron could re-license the ballpark'=
s name to another company. In theory, they might be able to profit by selli=
ng the name for more than the annual payment to the Astros.=20
The team says flatly that Enron cannot, and there are clauses in the contra=
ct prohibiting a re-licensing of the name. However, Rapoport said, in bankr=
uptcy court such assignment clauses may not be enforced if they would be to=
 the advantage of the debtor and its creditors.=20
Beyond the assignment clauses, however, there is language in the naming rig=
hts contract that prevents the ballpark's name from being changed before 20=
09 without the club's consent, said Pam Gardner, president of business oper=
ations for the Astros.=20
Even Gardner acknowledged, however, that all bets on even this type of lang=
uage may be off in bankruptcy court. Either way, the team just wants Enron =
to be forced to accept or reject the contract, so the matter can be put to =
rest, she said.=20
Despite the negative association with Enron, and a glum economy, there's a =
good chance the ballpark's name could be resold for $3.3 million annually, =
possibly even more, said Dean Bonham, of the Bonham Group, a Denver sports =
marketing firm.=20
"I'm very bullish on the Astros eventually coming out on top in this financ=
ially," he said. "Part of it is it's quite likely there would be a good bit=
 of public rejoicing for the company that comes in and removes the Enron na=
me."=20
McLane said three or four local companies have contacted him about the nami=
ng rights, though there have been no negotiations. Bonham said he, too, kno=
ws of several interested Houston companies.=20

For Houston Astros, a Sponsorship Turns Sour

At the start of the 2000 baseball season, when the gates opened at Enron Fi=
eld, the Houston Astros' new, $250 million, state-of-the-art ballpark, "we =
just could not have been prouder to see that name up there," recalls Pam Ga=
rdner, the team's president of business operations. After all, Enron Corp. =
stood for vibrancy, for innovation, for success.=20
"Unfortunately," Gardner noted yesterday, "things have changed."
Oh, have they ever.=20
There's nothing proud about Houston-based Enron anymore. And the Astros, as=
 Gardner politely put it, "would like to move in another direction" with th=
e ballpark name. Worried about "the negative public perception" of the bank=
rupt, scandal-tainted energy trader, Gardner said, the team wants out of it=
s 30-year, $100 million-plus naming rights contract with the company. But E=
nron won't play ball.=20
The dispute, which surfaced yesterday, seems a mere sideshow to this week's=
 congressional hearings on Enron's questionable financial practices. But as=
 Astros officials see it -- staring up at that name, writ bright and huge o=
n a facade high above the right field seats, among other places -- their lo=
vely, 42,000-seat stadium might as well be called "Bankruptcy Ballpark."=20
"It's a perception issue," Gardner said.=20
The problem for the Astros is that Enron, despite its financial problems, h=
as been making its annual payments under the contract, and its next install=
ment, $3.7 million, isn't due until August. Enron also has held up its cont=
ract obligations on leasing a luxury box and buying season tickets, Gardner=
 said.=20
"We are continuing to honor our agreement," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne s=
aid, adding that the naming rights "are a valuable asset, and it is our res=
ponsibility to preserve that asset for [Enron's] creditors." She said lawye=
rs for Enron are reviewing the contract to determine whether the rights cou=
ld be sold, to help satisfy Enron's creditors.=20
Astros lawyers say the contract does not allow such a sale, Gardner said.=
=20
Denne suggested that Enron would agree to give up the naming rights for a p=
rice. "We've had some discussions, but they haven't offered to do that," sh=
e said of a potential buyout.=20
Gardner said Astros officials have scoffed at the idea.=20
It remains to be seen whether the bankruptcy court in New York that is hand=
ling Enron's case will let the company retain the naming rights when the ne=
xt contract payment comes due in August. The Astros this week asked the cou=
rt to decide the issue now, rather than wait until summer.=20
"The allegations against Enron have been overwhelming," Gardner said. "Fan =
response has intensified in the last several weeks. A lot of people think t=
he relationship between Enron and the Astros is stronger and closer than ju=
st a sponsorship agreement."=20
The team and company used to have a strong and close relationship.=20
Enron's then-chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, "did a whole lot of work to get this=
 [stadium] built downtown," Gardner said. "He was instrumental in the proce=
ss, talking to a lot of people, convincing a lot of people that it was the =
right thing to do."=20
The ballpark, with its natural grass and nostalgic design, is owned by the =
Harris County-Houston Sports Authority and leased to the Astros for $7 mill=
ion a year. It replaced the Astrodome as the team's home.=20
Opening day is less than two months away.=20
And the Astros are anxious. "When you're a baseball team, you're viewed as =
a public trust," Gardner said. "We don't want everybody focusing on the nam=
e of our field."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A SPORTS CONNECTION
Astros Cry Foul and Try for an Enron Pickoff Play
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

Page 9, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

It is not often that a Major League Baseball team wants to prevent a corpor=
ation from buying box seats and other stadium goodies, but then, it is not =
often that a big company loses billions of dollars in shareholder equity be=
fore going spectacularly bankrupt in an exploding accounting scandal.=20
That company, of course, is Enron, and the baseball team is the Houston Ast=
ros, which barring some change will start the season playing at Enron Field=
.
Yesterday, the Astros asked a federal bankruptcy court to force Enron eithe=
r to pledge to honor its obligations under a contract that gives the stadiu=
m its name or to reject the contract and free the Astros to negotiate a nam=
ing deal with somebody else. The Astros say that for Enron to continue to m=
ake payments under the name contract costs its creditors money and will ear=
n them nothing; Enron says it can sell the right to name the stadium to ano=
ther company.=20
So far, Enron has complied with its obligations to the Astros, and lawyers =
say its contract can be sold to a third party with the blessing of the bank=
ruptcy court. Enron has paid $75,890 for 35 box seats, said Karen Denne, a =
spokeswoman for the company; the next payment is not due until August.=20
''That naming rights agreement is a valuable asset and the creditors view i=
t as a valuable asset,'' Ms. Denne said. ''It was our responsibility to pre=
serve the value, and we're doing that.''=20
The Astros say that Enron cannot comply with the terms of the agreement and=
 that they want to be able to resell the lucrative naming right to another =
company.=20
''This was not our preferred way to go about this,'' said Pam Gardner, pres=
ident of business operations for the Astros. ''Since this started a few mon=
ths ago, we've been trying to work in a new direction'' through negotiation=
s with Enron, she said, but those negotiations did not resolve the dispute.=
=20
Sandra Mayerson, a lawyer representing several creditors in Enron's bankrup=
tcy proceedings, said it was possible that the bankruptcy court could overr=
ide terms of the the Astros agreement with Enron to allow the company to se=
ll the naming rights. And it is in everyone's interest to rename the field,=
 she added. ''Wouldn't you be kind of anxious to go ahead and have it renam=
ed?''

Questioning the Books: Enron's Fall Spurs Desire to Revisit Laws
By Greg Hitt
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- The chairman of one of the leading congressional committees i=
nvestigating the collapse of Enron Corp. says he expects to make a major le=
gislative push this year to address problems arising from the debacle.=20
Republican Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin of Louisiana said he wants his House En=
ergy and Commerce Committee to tighten the rules governing investments in t=
he sort of off-balance-sheet partnerships Enron used to hide debt. He also =
is calling for pension reforms, citing concern about Enron workers who lost=
 their retirement savings. And he voiced support for greater scrutiny -- wh=
ile not ruling out complete elimination -- of the common corporate practice=
 of having one accounting firm audit the books as well as consult on busine=
ss practices, as was the case with Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur An=
dersen LLP.
"We can see several things emerging" from the congressional hearings, Mr. T=
auzin said.=20
At the same time, though, he warned against legislative overreach, suggesti=
ng too-aggressive action "could create incredible problems for the stock ma=
rket and for investors." He also voiced misgivings about efforts by some on=
 Capitol Hill to turn Enron's collapse into an overtly political matter.=20
"My concern is that -- because Democrats have decided to `Enronize' Republi=
cans on this issue -- that the thing gets bogged down politically, and to m=
e that's terrible," Mr. Tauzin said in an interview. "We owe a bigger oblig=
ation to the country than an election in November."=20
Mr. Tauzin's comments provided the clearest indication yet that lawmakers, =
despite the distractions of the unfolding election year, won't be content t=
o simply probe Enron's failure.=20
In the Senate, key members of the Banking Committee, having lost faith in t=
he accounting industry in the wake of Enron, signaled support for direct fe=
deral oversight. Sens. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) and Christopher Dodd (D., =
Conn.) said the privately funded accounting group that regulates the indust=
ry, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, should be brought under the g=
overnment control.=20
"Can the accounting profession police themselves?" Mr. Shelby asked. "I don=
't think they can."=20
In an appearance before the Senate panel, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Gre=
enspan agreed changes are needed but cautioned prudence. "It's important to=
 ask what are the consequences," he said.=20
Mr. Tauzin, whose panel has sweeping jurisdiction over business regulation =
in the U.S., is seen as a good barometer of the legislative outlook in the =
GOP-controlled House.=20
As with Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Tauzin, too, counseled some caution. He describe=
d the problems at Enron as an "aberration," not necessarily an indication o=
f systemic problems in the business community. And he urged regulators -- s=
uch as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FASB, which has quasi=
-government status -- to begin moving ahead of Congress to respond to perce=
ived problems.=20
But he also made clear his intention to act. "Our obligation to supervise t=
he operation of FASB is real, and I'm going to exercise it," he said.=20
Mr. Tauzin cited specific concern with existing accounting rules that allow=
ed Enron to create off-book partnerships with outside investments of as lit=
tle as 3% and the balance of funding coming from the company.=20
"It's a surprise to a lot of people that such a rule exists," he said, sugg=
esting he "thought it was always 50%." He added, "I should think we ought t=
o have a better rule than that."=20
Describing the current situation as "not adequate," Mr. Tauzin also indicat=
ed his intention to wade into the debate over whether to separate the bookk=
eeping and consulting services offered by accounting firms. "We have to exa=
mine that now in light of Enron," he said. He suggested he is "ready to con=
clude that we need stronger" oversight of those two accounting roles, but h=
e hasn't yet determined where to draw the line legislatively.=20

Former chairman of Enron to face lawmakers next week=20
By JULIE MASON=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Feb. 6, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- After abruptly canceling on lawmakers Sunday, former Enron Co=
rp. Chairman Ken Lay will answer next week two congressional subpoenas issu=
ed Tuesday on Capitol Hill.=20
It was unclear whether Lay would answer questions or refuse to testify.=20
"I'll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that he doesn't testify and invokes hi=
s right under the Fifth Amendment," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. The amendm=
ent guarantees protection against self-incrimination.=20
The Senate Commerce Committee is requiring Lay to appear Tuesday, while the=
 House Financial Services Committee has ordered that he appear on Feb. 14, =
Valentine's Day. Lawmakers said Tuesday the more they learn about the colla=
pse of Enron, the greater the urgency to hear from the former chairman.=20
"Any of Enron's officers who claim they didn't know isn't telling the truth=
," said Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., "No one has ever accused these people o=
f being stupid."=20
Lay for months has remained silent on his role in the complicated outside p=
artnerships and other factors being blamed for the company's stunning finan=
cial free-fall.=20
In testimony Tuesday, an in-house Enron investigator told lawmakers that La=
y failed to closely monitor events leading up to Enron's collapse, and now =
feels betrayed by other executives.=20
Enron attorney Bob Bennett declined to comment on Lay's plans for answering=
 the subpoenas, while Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly confirmed he would app=
ear, but said strategy was still under discussion.=20
Lay's attorney Earl Silbert did not return calls. Lay was to have testified=
 before lawmakers this week, but declined to do so less than 24 hours befor=
e he was to appear.=20
"It's unfortunate that Mr. Lay didn't appear voluntarily as he promised," R=
ep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and committee chairman, said as he signed the su=
bpoena. "We thought we were dealing in good faith with Mr. Lay and his atto=
rney."=20
Lawmakers are not inclined to barter immunity for Lay's testimony, although=
 several expressed continued frustration at his unwillingness to answer que=
stions.=20
"Mr. Lay, wherever you are," said Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., "Get you=
rself some new lawyers, sir."=20
Tauzin was among a number of lawmakers blamed by Silbert over the weekend f=
or creating a "prosecutorial" atmosphere that forced Lay to cancel his cong=
ressional testimony.=20
What Lay knew and when he knew it are key pursuits for congressional invest=
igators, as more than 10 different committees have launched probes of the c=
ompany's downfall.=20
On Capitol Hill, the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House=
 Energy and Finance Committee closely questioned William Powers, dean of th=
e University of Texas law school, about his own probe of Lay and other Enro=
n executives.=20
Powers, a specially appointed board member named to conduct the internal in=
vestigation, on Saturday released a report criticizing company executives, =
auditors, lawyers and board members for allowing improperly created partner=
ships to inflate Enron's earnings, hide its debt and wrongfully enrich a ha=
ndful of insiders.=20
"I think he felt that he had not been watching carefully enough," Powers sa=
id of Lay. "He felt he had been betrayed."=20
Powers said that in four hours of interviews with internal investigators, L=
ay expressed a lack of familiarity with some of the issues now under scruti=
ny in the probe of Enron's collapse.=20
For example, Lay was at an executive committee meeting where one of the com=
plicated outside partnerships was approved, but he told Powers' internal co=
mmittee that he did not recall the name of that entity.=20
There were other matters that Lay knew about, but didn't perceive as proble=
matic, Powers said.=20
"Mr. Lay fully understood they were using their own stock to offset their l=
osses," Powers said. "He didn't understand or appreciate that there was any=
thing wrong with that."=20
Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee, noted the partne=
rships set up by Enron executives used names from the Star Wars movies, suc=
h as Jedi and Chewco, for Chewbacca.=20
With reference to the hero and the villain of Star Wars, Greenwood asked Po=
wers of Lay, "Is he Luke Skywalker or is he Darth Vader?"=20
Powers replied, "He is not Luke Skywalker. He certainly is responsible for =
letting this happen, and there certainly were red flags that he chose to ig=
nore."=20
While congressional rhetoric increasingly targets Lay and his oversight of =
Enron, other executives scheduled to testify are coming under added scrutin=
y as well.=20
In the House subcommittee hearing, one lawmaker referred to former Enron Ch=
ief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as "Fast Andy Fastow," while another ca=
lled him "the Betty Crocker of cooked books."=20
Fastow is scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committe=
e Thursday, but is expected to invoke the Fifth Amendment.=20
Also slated to appear is former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, who is expected to=
 testify Thursday.=20
As congressional probes continue, lawmakers also want to hear from members =
of the Bush administration about its dealings with Enron executives.=20
Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee,=
 on Tuesday called on White House political adviser Karl Rove to disclose h=
is efforts securing an Enron job for Ralph Reed, the former executive direc=
tor of the Christian Coalition.=20
According to the White House, Rove recommended Reed to Enron for a job in 1=
997. Reed was hired by Enron in September, shortly after he resigned from t=
he Christian Coalition.=20
Bush, who was considering a presidential run at the time, wanted Reed to he=
lp him court conservative voters for the 2000 election.=20
Reed, now chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, says he did not know of=
 Rove's recommendation.=20
Bush, meanwhile, rejected a suggestion from Capitol Hill that a special pro=
secutor be appointed for the Enron investigation under way at the Justice D=
epartment.=20
"Listen, this is a business problem, and my Justice Department is going to =
investigate," Bush said. "And if there is wrongdoing, we'll hold them accou=
ntable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders."=20
Lay and Enron have been major contributors to Bush campaigns, dating back t=
o his first run for Texas governor.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Creditors' committee can quiz audi=
tor - COURT RULING.
By ANDREW HILL.

(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron creditors were granted permission yesterday to demand paperwork from =
Andersen about its audit of the energy trader and the firm's involvement in=
 the establishment of off-balance-sheet partnerships.=20
A New York bankruptcy judge also said the official creditors' committee cou=
ld quiz Andersen executives, including David Duncan, the lead partner invol=
ved in the Enron audit.
The committee, which acts on behalf of all Enron's creditors, sought the ru=
ling last month after Andersen said it had destroyed Enron-related document=
s and sacked a number of employees, including Mr Duncan.=20
The creditors said in a court filing that "a thorough examination" of Enron=
 deals carried out prior to its bankruptcy filing in December was crucial t=
o their attempt to discover Enron's true financial condition.=20
The revelation that Andersen and Enron shredded documents has prompted othe=
r creditors to demand the appointment of an examiner at Enron, who would in=
vestigate allegations of wrongdoing at the company. Some have even asked fo=
r a court-appointed trustee to run the company.=20
The publication of a damning internal report on Enron's deals with partners=
hips at the weekend could add to the pressure for such an appointment. But =
legal experts say the judge is unlikely to approve a trustee at this stage,=
 as it would be disruptive.=20
The Enron creditors' committee wants all documents relating to Andersen's a=
udits from 1996 to 2000. The firm was fired as Enron's auditor last month.=
=20
The committee will also seek documents about special purpose entities (SPEs=
) set up by Enron, including partnerships such as LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-In=
vestment run by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer, and Michael =
Kopper, another former Enron employee.=20
The internal report concluded that a number of Enron deals with such partne=
rships were intended to flatter Enron's figures and enrich employees involv=
ed in running the SPEs.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Andersen chief urges change in acc=
ounting rules ENERGY TRADER'S FAILURE BERARDINO SAYS FIRM BARRED FROM RAISI=
NG ALARM - * DISCREPANCY OVER 401(k) PENSION PLAN ADVICE - * AUDITOR WEIGHS=
 UP THE AFTER-SHOCKS.=20
Joseph Berardino, Andersen chief executive, yesterday blamed the structure =
of the accounting industry for contributing to the collapse of Enron, sayin=
g that audit rules barred Andersen accountants from warning the public abou=
t the energy trader's financial condition.
Mr Berardino urged lawmakers to change accounting regulations to allow audi=
tors to grade the quality and risk of a company's financial statements. Fir=
ms can give only a "pass" or "fail" to financial data submitted by a compan=
y.=20
"Some companies do the bare minimum to meet (accounting) requirements, whil=
e others are much more prudent in their accounting decisions and disclosure=
s," Mr Berardino told a hearing of the House financial services committee.=
=20
"There are some companies that are pushing the envelope and investors don't=
 know which one is which."=20
The hearing was one of four held yesterday on Enron's collapse. The Senate =
commerce committee voted unanimously to subpoena Kenneth Lay, Enron's forme=
r chief executive, who pulled out of a hearing before the panel on Monday a=
t the eleventh hour. Mr Lay is likely to be forced to appear on February 12=
, although senators said they expected him to invoke his Fifth Amendment ri=
ght to silence.=20
Michael Oxley, chairman of the House financial services committee, which wa=
s also to have heard from Mr Lay yesterday, also issued a subpoena, saying =
he would compel the former Enron chief to appear on February 14.=20
In his testimony before the panel, Mr Berardino said his company repeatedly=
 questioned Enron's accounting practices, pointing to a widely reported mee=
ting of Andersen auditors in which some of Enron's practices were labelled =
"intelligent gambling". However, while accounting rules allowed auditors to=
 raise their concerns with Enron's board - which Mr Berardino said they did=
 regularly - they prevented any public disclosure unless there were clear v=
iolations of accepted accounting principles.=20
"Our only option is to resign the engagement (but) resigning an engagement =
may destroy a company that is fundamentally sound," he said. "So those are =
our choices when faced with a client whose accounting treatments are risky:=
 give it a pass or give it the death penalty."=20
Mr Berardino's recommendations were largely ignored by committee investigat=
ors, who repeatedly questioned the Andersen chief on the auditor's role in =
Enron's questionable financial reporting.=20
Mr Berardino declined to answer most of the questions, insisting he had no =
direct knowledge of how the Enron audit was conducted - a response that enr=
aged some committee members.=20
"You're captain of the ship," said Democrat Gary Ackerman.=20
"If they came to you and said: we want to rob a bank and here's who's going=
 to drive the getaway car, and this is what we're going to pay for the gun,=
 you don't feel you have a duty to blow the whistle?"=20
Mr Berardino said Andersen was aware of Enron's now infamous private partne=
rships, which enabled the company to take debts off its balance sheets, but=
 insisted they were set up by Enron executives and investment bankers, with=
 Andersen only giving passive judgments as to whether they passed accepted =
accounting principles.=20
He added that Andersen would set up a new ethics office which would investi=
gate questionable audit reviews when concerns were raised about the integri=
ty or independence of an accountant.=20

Populist Pitch -- Without the Punch; Both Parties Claim Title, but Neither =
Makes Full-Scale Attack on Moneyed Interests
Juliet Eilperin
Washington Post Staff Writer

02/06/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL

As the Enron scandal pumps new life into the old caricature of corporate ex=
ecutives as greedy and shady, politicians in both parties are stepping up e=
fforts to claim the title "populist."=20
"President Bush is a populist," Bush senior adviser Karl Rove declared last=
 month. Other White House aides said the president's latest string of speec=
hes had populist themes. House Democrats, meanwhile, have embraced "an econ=
omically populist, fiscally conservative, socially moderate message" this y=
ear, said their campaign group's executive director, Howard Wolfson.
But neither Bush's late-January swing through the South, nor a recent serie=
s of speeches by Democratic leaders, came close to the full-scale attack on=
 moneyed interests that defines true populism.=20
These rhetorical stabs acknowledged voters' anger over news that top execut=
ives made tens of millions of dollars while ordinary workers saw their jobs=
 and retirement funds vanish. But they did not propose significant legal or=
 regulatory changes that might rattle the nation's corporate hierarchy -- a=
 structure that pours millions of dollars into Republican and Democratic co=
ffers alike.=20
"True economic populism, in the sense of William Jennings Bryan, would invo=
lve a direct attack on corporate America," said Claremont McKenna College p=
olitical science professor Jack Pitney. "You're not hearing anything like [=
Bryan's 1896] 'Cross of Gold' speech."=20
Populist themes reemerge periodically in American politics, from the Whiske=
y Rebellion to the Bull Moose movement to the presidential candidacies of R=
oss Perot and John McCain. Even the self-described centrist Bill Clinton es=
poused populist ideas in the 1992 election. He called for eliminating tax d=
eductions "for excessive executive pay" and letting shareholders "determine=
 the compensation of top executives." But little came of it all, and execut=
ive compensation packages skyrocketed in the 1990s.=20
The latest populist boomlet is fueled mainly by revelations about Enron Cor=
p., where one executive collected $353 million in stock proceeds while thou=
sands of workers and shareholders lost huge sums. Enron's saga could prove =
politically troublesome for Bush, even if the scandal is never linked direc=
tly to the White House. Voters tell pollsters they associate Bush more clos=
ely with corporate influence than they do many other political figures.=20
The president combats this potential problem not so much by offering populi=
st changes in government as by returning to his folksy campaign rhetoric. I=
n speeches in battleground states or GOP-leaning regions, he portrays himse=
lf as a fighter against Washington -- in other words, a populist, his aides=
 say.=20
"Thank goodness we cut taxes when we did," Bush told an applauding crowd in=
 Winston-Salem, N.C., last Wednesday. "The best way to help an economy reco=
ver is to let hard-working people keep more of their money. When they get m=
ore money in their pocket, they spend more money, and as they spend more mo=
ney, it helps create jobs."=20
Bush pivoted to the opposition. "And for those who want to do away with tax=
 relief -- you don't know what you're talking about," he said. "We've got t=
o trust people with their own money. I'm not sure what textbook some of the=
m are reading up there. But, obviously, it's not the same one we've been re=
ading here in this room."=20
Numerous Democrats, meanwhile, are claiming the populist label for themselv=
es, hoping it will undercut high approval ratings for the president in part=
icular, and for Republicans in general.=20
"Enron reinforces, very dramatically, the image of the Republican Party as =
being too beholden to special interests," said Democratic pollster Mark Mel=
lman.=20
Reporting on a poll it conducted recently about the Enron collapse, Democra=
cy Corps -- a group founded by Democratic consultants Stan Greenberg, James=
 Carville and Robert Shrum -- urged Democrats to seize upon the Enron issue=
 to contrast themselves with Republicans. "Enron has the potential to shape=
 the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce =
confidence in the Bush administration and Republicans," the report said.=20
But the poll raises doubts about the political benefit Democrats might reap=
 from the issue. Respondents agreed 57 percent to 34 percent with the state=
ment, "What happened at Enron is indicative of a larger pattern of abuses b=
y big corporations that have too much influence over what happens in Washin=
gton." But they agreed, 46 percent to 35 percent, that the Bush administrat=
ion "is not part of the Enron mess."=20
Pushing the populist refrain could reignite an old debate between Democrati=
c progressives and centrists. Many remain divided over the wisdom of Vice P=
resident Al Gore's emphasis on populist themes in the 2000 election. At his=
 convention speech, Gore promised voters he was "on your side" and vowed to=
 protect "the people" over "the powerful."=20
After the election, several influential Democrats concluded the strategy ha=
d backfired. "Economic populism as a message for Democrats has failed," pol=
lster Mark Penn said in a recent interview. Penn has worked extensively for=
 Clinton and the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.=20
Liberals including Greenberg and union leaders disagreed. They said Gore's =
attack on entrenched interests gave him the biggest lead of his campaign. T=
his advantage evaporated, they said, when subsequent campaign events made i=
t harder for voters to distinguish between Gore and Bush.=20
Such debates may explain why Florida Democrats have been cautious in tying =
Gov. Jeb Bush (R) to Enron. The president's brother recently attended a fun=
draiser at the home of a former Enron executive, despite Florida's pension =
plan losing $335 million in Enron stock. Jeb Bush's reelection campaign see=
ms little troubled by the news.=20
Even Greenberg said it is unreasonable to expect Democrats to take a hard-l=
ine populist stand. "I don't think either party centers their policies on g=
oing after corporations or going after CEOs," he said.=20
Indeed, at the national level, Democrats are pushing the tamer goals of gre=
ater government oversight and more job creation. In his response to Bush's =
State of the Union speech, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.=
) called for tighter financial regulations, targeted tax cuts and fiscal re=
straint.=20
That suits Simon Rosenberg, director of the centrist New Democrat Network, =
just fine. Gephardt's list, he said, amounts to "a repudiation of populism =
on its face. . . . The mainstream economic view is winning out in the Democ=
ratic Party."=20
The mainstream view allows for modestly populist-sounding goals. Democrats,=
 for example, continue to challenge the House GOP's decision to provide tax=
 breaks in its economic stimulus plan for corporations such as Enron.=20
"Democrats in the House have a unique opportunity to take on the Washington=
 special interests," said Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democrats' Hous=
e campaign committee.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A CASE STUDY
Enron Is Grist for Business School Courses
By SANA SIWOLOP

02/06/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Business school professors across the country say they are latching onto th=
e Enron scandal as a way to make courses on everything from Accounting 101 =
to crisis management come alive.=20
Some teachers are treading cautiously, partly because business-school case =
studies usually focus on historical events, not unfolding dramas, and partl=
y because the Enron collapse is so complicated.
But the revelations about the maneuverings of Enron Corporation executives =
and the actions of the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, are too tempting=
 to pass up, professors say.=20
Roger D. Martin, an assistant accounting professor at the business school a=
t Indiana University, says he introduced a graduate accounting class on the=
 company early in November, when Enron had to restate its earnings and ''th=
ings started smoking.''=20
Professor Martin said he planned to use Enron's financial meltdown for year=
s to come as a case study in his advanced accounting class. ''This is a cla=
ssic case in almost everything related to accounting,'' he said. ''If anyth=
ing, it might make it tough to keep the conversation going in just one dire=
ction because there are so many angles.''=20
Other business school professors say they are eager to use Enron to enliven=
 business cases that too often focus on old examples like the Ford Pinto ga=
s tank of the 1970's. ''Students now are largely unimpressed if something i=
s more than four to five years old,'' said Al Hartgraves, an accounting pro=
fessor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta.=20
Before his students left for their Christmas break in the second week of De=
cember, Professor Hartgraves promised to e-mail them a summary of the compa=
ny's situation, and did so at the end of the month. Then a couple of weeks =
ago, he created a computer bulletin board about Enron over the internal e-m=
ail system that connects roughly 1,000 Emory business students. Within 24 h=
ours, he said, more than 100 students had asked him for bulletin board acce=
ss.=20
''We've seen audit failures before with companies like Waste Management and=
 Sunbeam,'' Professor Hartgraves said, ''but never anything as big as this.=
''=20
At Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., Alfonso F. Canella, an adjunct pr=
ofessor who teaches a class in financial modeling, said he planned to use E=
nron to illustrate the mechanics, as well as the riskiness, of putting toge=
ther limited partnerships, especially when the deals were not listed on a c=
ompany's balance sheet.=20
Not everyone is convinced that Enron's troubles belong in every classroom. =
Jan Barton, an assistant accounting professor at Emory, thinks that it is a=
ppropriate to use Enron in an introductory course on financial statement an=
alysis, but that its accounting and energy-trading practices may be too com=
plicated for most students.=20
Even when it comes to teaching more advanced students, Professor Barton sai=
d, he preferred to focus on companies like Dell Computer, Sears Roebuck, Wa=
l-Mart and Microsoft, whose financial statement practices and products are =
easier to understand.=20
''I don't want to talk about a company that operates in a funky industry, l=
ike utilities, and whose transactions involved things like financial deriva=
tive contracts,'' Mr. Barton said.=20
Still, Diana C. Robertson, an associate professor of organization and manag=
ement at Goizueta, in time concluded that the Enron case could not be ignor=
ed.=20
In December, she decided to stick to well-documented cases like the antitru=
st charges against Microsoft and Nike's foreign labor practices for her bus=
iness ethics classes. But as Enron unraveled, she decided that using a busi=
ness story in the making, rather than one that is years or decades old, was=
 too ''wonderful'' to pass up.=20
Raymond D. Horton, chairman of the Columbia University Business School's ma=
nagement division, said he would allocate plenty of time to the subject thi=
s winter in his course on the modern political economy. ''We're all itching=
 to discuss it,'' he said, pointing to a pile of Enron news clippings on hi=
s desk.=20
Robert Rupe, a second-year finance student at Columbia, said one lecture fo=
r a course on corporate turnarounds he just signed up for is titled simply =
''Enron.''=20
A useful point in the Enron case, business professors say, is the light it =
sheds on the evolution of the American corporation into unexpected forms. F=
or example, Anne Carter, an economics professor at Brandeis, says it helps =
illuminate the nature of the modern corporation, which often bears little r=
esemblance to the ''mythical'' manufacturing and farming companies that app=
ear in many textbooks. For one thing, she said, Enron is a good way to show=
 students just how much of an imbalance there is in the information investo=
rs typically receive, and how a company can exploit that imbalance.=20
Professor Carter plans to devote three classes to Enron this semester in an=
 undergraduate course she teaches. ''I really think that Enron shows studen=
ts that the market now is very different from the market that was shaped by=
 Adam Smith's invisible hand,'' she said.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Lerach's Enron Gambit

02/06/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

As with any dead carcass, Enron is attracting downstream scavengers. Of cou=
rse this includes the lawyers, especially lawsuit king Bill Lerach, who rec=
ently posed before TV cameras in Houston with a carton of what he claimed w=
ere shredded Enron documents. But before he cashes in one more time, Mr. Le=
rach's own legal practices deserve some greater public scrutiny.=20
For example, a Los Angeles grand jury is investigating whether the Lerach l=
aw firm -- Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach -- paid plaintiffs to sign =
onto class-action lawsuits. There's also the recent decision by a federal j=
udge to give the lead counsel slot in a class-action suit to a lower-cost l=
aw firm; the judge said that Milberg's stiff fees would have gobbled up too=
 much of any money its clients might recover. Milberg's appeal on the latte=
r will be heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 15.
This all deserves more attention than it's received because Mr. Lerach is n=
ot just any old tort warrior. The Milberg firm accounts for the lion's shar=
e of all federal shareholders' suits, and in California Mr. Lerach is appro=
aching Bill Gates levels of market share.=20
With Enron's failure, a movement is also afoot to make tort lawyers the big=
 beneficiaries. They're mobilizing to repeal a modest 1995 tort reform bill=
 that reined in the worst of the tort bar's securities lawsuits. Mr. Lerach=
 is himself now posing as a defender of Enron shareholders, and he's even b=
een retained by Calpers, the big public pension fund that had invested in E=
nron partnerships. Mark this down as wildebeest hiring hyenas as bodyguards=
.=20
The Lerach methods have been challenged before. Three years ago he lost big=
 when the firm paid out $50 million to settle an abuse-of-process lawsuit b=
rought against it by a Chicago-based consulting firm. According to Californ=
ia press reports, today's grand jury investigation revolves around a Beverl=
y Hills eye surgeon who is in prison for fraud and who has appeared as a pl=
aintiff in a number of suits filed by Milberg. It certainly wouldn't be kos=
her for a law firm to induce "victims" into filing contingency-fee claims.=
=20
Mr. Lerach's standard defense is that his rough methods are the only way to=
 make big business accountable. But that's just what makes the issue of Mil=
berg's attorneys fees now headed for the Ninth Circuit so juicy. No one in =
this case is denying anyone her day in court. All the ruling by U.S. Distri=
ct Court Judge Vaughn Walker did was ensure that if the plaintiffs win, the=
y won't have to turn nearly all of their winnings over to the Milberg pluto=
crats.=20
The story begins, as many Milberg stories do, with a drop in the share pric=
e of a company, in this case Copper Mountain Networks. Milberg quickly move=
d in. But Milberg's wasn't the only suit, so when it came time to choose a =
lead counsel, Judge Walker asked for rival bids. When he looked at the pric=
e sheets he found that another firm's lower fees served the interests of th=
e shareholders better than Milberg's hefty ones.=20
This judgment is startling, because when it comes to fees lawyers nearly al=
ways stick together. But recent fees have become so obscene (in the case of=
 tobacco and asbestos into the billions of dollars) that they may have open=
ed up a new political and legal vulnerability for the tort bar.=20
Lawyers love to shout "price controls" when anyone talks about their fees, =
but lawyers aren't normal businessmen. As Judge Walker noted in his opinion=
, lawyers are not independent contractors but are "fiduciaries for absent c=
lass members." They are officers of the court. This is the same understandi=
ng embodied in the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional C=
onduct, which forbids "unreasonable" fees on precisely these grounds.=20
That understanding is even more critical in class actions, because the clie=
nt being represented is absent and thus has no real voice. While in a norma=
l case the client contracts with a lawyer, in class actions the lawyer esse=
ntially conscripts the clients. Then if the lawyer wins or settles the case=
, he takes the bulk of the winnings as fees, often leaving a pittance for t=
he actual plaintiffs. "I have the greatest practice of law in the world," M=
r. Lerach once quipped to a group of corporate directors. "I have no client=
s."=20
But it is about time he got some adult legal supervision. The tort bar has =
become so rich, increasingly at the expense of its own clients, that its ab=
uses need to be reined in for the good of the broader society. All the more=
 so now that it is lining up to ravage Enron one more time.

Questioning the Books: Panel, in Enron's Wake, to Review Lawsuit Curbs
By Robert S. Greenberger

WASHINGTON -- As federal investigators and Congress expand their probe into=
 the collapse of Enron Corp., lawmakers want to revisit a 1995 law limiting=
 lawsuits that will make it difficult for company shareholders to recoup th=
eir losses.=20
The Senate Judiciary Committee today will hear testimony on the Private Sec=
urities Litigation Reform Act and how its provisions shielding corporate ad=
visers from shareholder lawsuits could block Enron employees and shareholde=
rs from suing the accountants and lawyers who helped create the complicated=
 partnerships that contributed to the giant energy trader's demise.
The law does nothing to inhibit the government from taking civil and crimin=
al action against Enron, its lawyers and accountants.=20
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the U.S. by revenues, saw its sh=
are price implode last fall amid allegations of questionable accounting and=
 overstated earnings, and was forced to seek bankruptcy-court protection. I=
ts employees, whose retirement savings accounts were tied to company stock,=
 and outside shareholders saw their investments evaporate.=20
The bill was part of the Republican Party's "Contract with America," a plat=
form of 10 bills aimed at overhauling government programs and the legal sys=
tem that the GOP used to win control of the House in the 1994 elections. Th=
e securities-litigation bill was intended to curb a rash of lawsuits filed =
by shareholders angry over company performance, particularly in the volatil=
e high-technology industry. It had the strong backing of the accountants an=
d high-tech executives who saw themselves increasingly vulnerable to frivol=
ous class-action suits.=20
The committee will probe how the law tightens rules on bringing complaints =
that initiate lawsuits and how it protects accountants and other profession=
als from exposure to complete liability for corporate losses and from lawsu=
its seeking triple damages. Overall, the law partly shields the accountants=
, lawyers, bankers and other outsiders to whom victims might turn for redre=
ss from wrongs by a company in bankruptcy court.=20
"By forcing through special exemptions for securities, Congress has contrib=
uted to the `Wild West' mentality reflected in Enron's hidden partnerships,=
" said the judiciary panel's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). Should=
 legislation to change the 1995 law come out of the hearings, however, it i=
s unclear if it would be made retroactive and aid Enron shareholders.=20
Steven Schatz, a California attorney who was selected as a witness by Sen. =
Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee's ranking Republican, rejects the notion=
 that the law makes it difficult for plaintiffs to bring legitimate lawsuit=
s. Overall, it has a positive effect, he said, because "it has caused the p=
laintiffs' bar to be more circumspect with regard to whom they sue."=20
One example is that the 1995 law requires that a complaint in a securities-=
fraud case must present details "giving rise to a strong inference" of frau=
d. Previously, the complaint didn't have to be as detailed.=20
Meanwhile, the rules have also been changed to bar the beginning of discove=
ry until after a court has decided whether to allow the case to go forward.=
 Previously, plaintiffs attorneys could begin to gather documents and inter=
view witnesses when the complaint was filed.=20
Columbia University law professor Jack Coffee said that taken together, the=
 two rules are a Catch-22: "You can't get discovery unless you have strong =
evidence of fraud, and you can't get strong evidence of fraud without disco=
very."=20
The statute also substitutes proportionate liability for the old law under =
which everyone involved in the financial scheme would be fully liable for a=
ll the damages involved. So, in most circumstances under the new law, the a=
mount for which an accounting or law firm could be held liable would be onl=
y a fraction of the 100% for which it might previously have been sued. This=
 could be crucial for plaintiffs when a defendant company, such as Enron, i=
s in bankruptcy court.=20
Finally, it limits the use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organiza=
tions Act, or RICO, in civil suits involving securities. The RICO law was v=
ery unpopular with corporate defense attorneys, because among other provisi=
ons it permits an award to plaintiffs of triple damages.=20
Although the examination of the 1995 law involves such arcane legal issues,=
 it is fueled by politics. Democrats are eager to pin the Enron debacle on =
pro-business Republicans. Consumer groups also are weighing in.=20
The Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union and U.S. Public Interes=
t Research Group are among the groups pointing to a Dec. 12, 1995, letter t=
hey wrote lawmakers opposing the bill. "This legislation will protect finan=
cial swindlers from being held accountable to their victims," the letter sa=
id.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Post-Enron equity fears fuel 'flight from risk=
' WORRIED INVESTORS IN EUROPEAN AND US MARKETS SHUN STOCKS THAT FACE ACCOUN=
TING OR FINANCIAL CONCERNS.=20
Equity markets in Europe and the US witnessed a "flight from risk" yesterda=
y, with investors shunning any stocks that faced accounting or financial co=
ncerns.
Worries about the quality of corporate accounts in the wake of the collapse=
 of Enron were accompanied by fears that heavily indebted companies would e=
ither collapse or be forced to raise large amounts of equity to restore the=
ir balance sheets.=20
Investor concern was demonstrated when General Electric, the world's larges=
t company, had to dismiss questions about the transparency of its accountin=
g by reaffirming its earnings growth targets. Jeff Immelt, chairman and chi=
ef executive, said: "We have tremendous financial strength and a system of =
controllership that is second to none." GE shares recovered 3.5 per cent to=
 close at $36.21 yesterday.=20
European companies came under the spotlight. UK-based electronics group Inv=
ensys was one of the biggest casualties, its shares falling 8 1/2p, or 8 pe=
r cent, to 97 1/2p, the worst performance in the FTSE 100 index.=20
Credit Suisse First Boston reduced its earnings forecasts for the company a=
nd said: "Market feedback on Invensys remains very discouraging." Dresdner =
Kleinwort Wasserstein warned of the possibility of a rights issue to reduce=
 the company's debt.=20
Elan, the Irish pharmaceutical company, whose accounts have come under inte=
nse scrutiny, saw its share price fall a further Euros 3.5, or 18 per cent,=
 to Euros 16 in the wake of Monday's profits warning.=20
Shares in Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, fell Euros 2.8, or 4 per c=
ent, to Euros 67 on concern that corporate financial problems would prompt =
a rise in its bad debt provisions.=20
European markets were pushed lower by the concerns and by Wall Street losse=
s on Monday. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 73.9, or 1.4 per cent, to 5=
,093.4.=20
In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.66 at 9685.43. Ty=
co International shares continued to tumble after the beleaguered conglomer=
ate on Monday drew down its credit lines, triggering a downgrade by Standar=
d & Poor's, the credit rating agency. Even though Tyco's move has removed a=
ny short-term questions about its stability, the shares closed down more th=
an 22 per cent at $23.10.=20
Tyco has lost almost half its value since announcing plans for a four-way b=
reak-up.=20
Companies adjusting earnings continued to suffer - even if reporting profit=
s not previously disclosed. Reliant Resources shares fell fell more than 13=
 per cent to close at $11.95 yesterday after the energy group said it would=
 restate second-and third-quarter earnings to show additional profits of $1=
00m ( #70m) and $130m ( #90m) respectively.=20
The Enron fall-out has made investors far more cautious about the quality o=
f corporate profits, particularly in the US, where accounting standards had=
 been assumed to be the best in the world.=20

WASHINGTON -- Hollywood is trying to figure out how to turn Enron into a TV=
 movie.=20
How do they take all the stuff about ''the contingent nature of existing re=
stricted forward contracts'' and ''share-settled costless collar arrangemen=
ts,'' jettison it like the math in ''A Beautiful Mind,'' and juice it up?
Enron is such a mind-numbing black hole, even for financial analysts, that =
if you tried to explain all the perfidious permutations, you'd never come o=
ut the other end.=20
A movie executive asked Lowell Bergman, the former ''60 Minutes'' producer =
who is now an investigative reporter for The Times and ''Frontline,'' for t=
he most cinematic way to frame the story. (Mr. Bergman had the ultimate Hol=
lywood experience of being played by Al Pacino in another corporate greed-a=
nd-corruption saga, ''The Insider.'')=20
''It's about the women up against the men,'' he replied.=20
Before you know it, Enron will be Erined, as in Brockovich. Texas good ol' =
girl, fast-talking, salt-of-the-earth whistle-blower Sherron Watkins will b=
e Renee Zellweger in a Shoshanna Lonstein bustier. The adorable and intrepi=
d Fortune reporter Bethany McLean, the first journalist to sound an alarm a=
bout Enron's accounting practices, will be look-alike Alicia Silverstone. A=
nd Loretta Lynch, the tough California utilities czarina and Yale-trained l=
itigator who questioned a year ago what Enron did that was of any value to =
consumers, will be look-nothing-alike Angelina Jolie, sporting power plant =
tattoos.=20
''From the beginning of the California energy meltdown, women were not afra=
id to point a finger at the seventh-largest corporation in the U.S. and say=
 'You can't do this,' '' Mr. Bergman told me. ''And the electric cowboys at=
 Enron, where the culture had a take-no-prisoners, get-rid-of-any-regulatio=
n, macho perspective on the marketplace, was aggressive when it came to shu=
tting them up.''=20
As a Texas writer says: ''This was Jeff Skilling's club and there weren't a=
 lot of women in his club.''=20
At first, the slicked-back Gordon Gekko C.E.O. and his arrogant coterie in =
the Houston skyscraper -- where men were wont to mess around and leave wive=
s for secretaries -- dismissed female critics.=20
Some privately trashed Ms. Lynch as ''an idiot'' and coveted Ms. McLean, ca=
lling her ''a looker who doesn't know anything.'' But when they realized th=
e women were on to them, the company that intimidated competitors, supplier=
s and utilities tried to oust Ms. Lynch from her job and discredit Ms. McLe=
an and kill her article.=20
When Ms. Watkins confronted Kenneth Lay with her fears last August, he knew=
 the cat was spilling out of the beans, as Carmen Miranda used to say. With=
in two months he had to 'fess up to $600 million in spurious profits.=20
(In Houston's testosterone-fueled energy circles, many men watched Linda La=
y crying on TV and muttered that in Texas, there is nothing lower than send=
ing your wife out to fight your battle.)=20
As a feminine fillip, there's Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive w=
ho revealed the shredding shindigs there. Ms. Castaneda realized something =
was wrong when she took some shreds home to use as packing material and saw=
 they were marked with the galactic names Chewco and Jedi, which turned out=
 to be quasi-legal partnerships.=20
Only 10 years after Mattel put out Teen Talk Barbie whining ''Math class is=
 tough,'' we have women unearthing the Rosetta stone of this indecipherable=
 scandal.=20
What does this gender schism mean? That men care more about inflating their=
 assets? That women are more caring about colleagues getting shafted?=20
It is men's worst fear, personally and professionally, that women will pin =
the sin on them, come ''out of the night like a missile and destroy a man,'=
' as Alan Simpson said during the Hill-Thomas hearings.=20
There has been speculation that women are more likely to be whistleblowers =
-- or tattletales when they are little -- because they are less likely to b=
e members of the club.=20
Some men suggest that women, with their vast experience with male blarney, =
are experts at calling guys on it.=20
At Enron, it was men who came up with complex scams showing there was no li=
mit to the question ''How much is enough?'' And it was women who raised the=
 simple question, ''Why?''
