Subject:	List of Customers

Attached below is a combined form showing the customer lists of all the gas groups and how each group has prioritized their customers.  I will continue to review this list over the weekend.  If you have any changes please let me know by responding to me at both my work e-mail address and at my home address:  Kbuss@houston.rr.com.
Thank you,
