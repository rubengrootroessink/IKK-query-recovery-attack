Tammie, I have completed the org chart in PowerPoint.  I am unsure how the original org chart differed from the others.  If additional changes need to be made in order for this org chart to look the same as the other group's, please send me another group's chart for me to go by.  

Thanks,
Laura

Laura,

Unfortunately, I need you to re-do your org chart in Powerpoint.  Louise likes all the charts to look the same and the rest of my charts are in powerpoint and yours is in Org Plus and they look different.  Can you please do it in Powerpoint and forward to me by mid morning tomorrow?

Thanks!
