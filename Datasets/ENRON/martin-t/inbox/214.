Tom,

Your Ice ID should be working now, however the aventail log in is not.

Please use the following Aventail login until they have this issue resolved:

User ID: production
Password: bug1fox9

Your Ice login:

User ID: thmartin
password: spinit32

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will let you know as soon as ICE has the Aventail login working appropriately.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465
