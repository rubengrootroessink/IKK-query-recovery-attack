Secretaries Say Enron Had Them Pose As Traders In 1998

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some current and former employees of Enron Energy=
 Services, the retail energy unit of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), say the company a=
sked them to pose as busy electricity and natural gas sales representatives=
 one day in 1998 so the Enron unit could impress Wall Street analysts visit=
ing its Houston headquarters.
More than a dozen former and current Enron Energy Services staff who spoke =
to Dow Jones Newswires said Enron executives rushed about 75 employees, inc=
luding secretaries and actual sales representatives, down to an empty tradi=
ng floor on the sixth floor and told them to act as if they were trying to =
sell energy contracts to businesses over the phone.=20
"When we went down to the sixth floor, I remember we had to take the stairs=
 so the analysts wouldn't see us," said Kim Garcia, who at the time was an =
administrative assistant for Enron Energy Services and was laid off last De=
cember. "We brought some of our personal stuff, like pictures, to make it l=
ook like the area was lived in. There were a bunch of trading desks on the =
sixth floor, but the desks were totally empty. Some of the computers didn't=
 even work, so we worked off of our laptops. When the analysts arrived, we =
had to make believe we were on the phone buying and selling electricity and=
 natural gas. The whole thing took like 10 minutes."=20
Penny Marksberry - who also worked as an Enron Energy Services administrati=
ve assistant in 1998 and was laid off last December - and two employees who=
 still work at the unit also said they were told to act as if they were try=
ing to sell contracts.=20
"They actually brought in computers and phones and they told us to act like=
 we were typing or talking on the phone when the analysts were walking thro=
ugh," Marksberry said. "They told us it was very important for us to make a=
 good impression and if the analysts saw that the operation was disorganize=
d, they wouldn't give the company a good rating."=20

Enron Confirms Employees Moved=20

Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services' spokeswoman, confirmed that some empl=
oyees were told to move to sixth floor so it would appear to be occupied an=
d busy for a visit by 150 analysts from Wall Street firms who were in town =
for a convention.=20
But she said it was just a handful of employees who went down to the sixth =
floor, not 75, and that the company didn't ask anyone to pose as traders or=
 sales representatives.=20
"We weren't trying to mislead anyone," Mahoney said. "There were some emplo=
yees who were moved down there. They were told to just sit there. I don't k=
now why. Analysts were brought in, and we showed them our operation. We wer=
e just showing them how we structured deals and contracts."=20
Mahoney couldn't confirm the exact date of the analyst visit, but said it h=
appened as the unit was in the middle of signing a contract with General Ca=
ble. Enron announced that deal on June 30, 1998.=20
One analyst based in Houston recalled the visit to Enron's headquarters, wh=
ere analysts were bused following a meeting at the Four Seasons hotel in Ju=
ne 1998. Analysts were led around by Ken Lay, then Enron's chairman and chi=
ef executive, and the EES floor appeared busy with actual work, he said.=20
"The big push then was EES and retail electricity in California," the analy=
st said, asking that his name be withheld because his bank still conducts b=
usiness with Enron. "The trading floor looked fully staffed. There was a pr=
esentation in a little auditorium right where EES was operating. It looked =
like people were very busy. We didn't interact with any of the employees on=
 the floor."=20
A number of the other analysts currently covering Enron weren't following t=
he company in 1998. Of those that were, some didn't recall the specific com=
pany visit or weren't available for comment.=20

Need To Show 'Warm Bodies Working'=20

Enron Energy Services was set up in late 1997 to sell energy and advisory s=
ervices to large consumers that had been freed or were expected to be freed=
 from their local utilities by newly minted deregulation laws.=20
The unit was still small in 1998. Some of its employees shared space with o=
ther units on the ninth floor, and others were spread throughout the buildi=
ng while the sixth floor was being fashioned as a permanent home, employees=
 said.=20
Enron executives including Lay escorted the analysts through the floor and =
returned later to tell the employees that they had done a good job, said Ga=
rcia, the administrative assistant.=20
"I think a bunch of us asked him why did we just do this, and he said the a=
nalysts needed to see a bunch of warm bodies working so Enron could get a g=
ood credit rating," Garcia said. "He said the trading part of Enron was the=
 company's bread and butter."=20
Earl Silbert, a lawyer representing Lay, declined to comment specifically o=
n the employees' claims, saying they didn't deserve a response.=20
Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a memo e-mailed=
 to Lay in August 2001 warning that Enron Energy Services' financial result=
s were being misrepresented. The memo was sent by Margaret Ceconi, who work=
ed for the unit for nine months.=20
Mahoney said at the time the memo "does not represent all the facts."=20
A bankruptcy court judge allowed Enron to drop hundreds of Energy Service c=
ontracts, but the company has taken extraordinary measures to keep many of =
the remaining deals alive, an indication many of the unit's contracts remai=
n profitable.=20

Enron's auditor "knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature" of c=

FASB To Discuss Off-Balance-Sheet Entities Next Week

02/06/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to di=
scuss the issue of accounting for a controversial type of off-balance-sheet=
 entity at its Feb. 13 meeting, the board said Wednesday.=20
In the schedule for the meeting, the accounting rulemaker said it will disc=
uss issues related to identifying and accounting for "special-purpose entit=
ies," or SPEs - partnerships which currently don't have to be consolidated =
with the rest of a company's balance sheet even though the company may have=
 effective control over them.
The board said it "will consider various approaches to dealing with SPE sit=
uations" and will consider expanding its work to address accounting and dis=
closure by "the issuer of guarantees of the indebtedness of others."=20
The issue of accounting for SPEs has come to the fore because of their prom=
inent role in the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) scandal. Enron used SPEs, some contro=
lled by its own executives, to move assets and debt off its balance sheet a=
nd thus improve its financial results; the now-bankrupt company later recon=
solidated some of the SPEs into its balance sheet, which reduced its previo=
usly reported earnings by $586 million.=20
Companies can form non-consolidated SPEs apart from their balance sheets ev=
en though outside investors might provide as little as 3% of the entities' =
capitalization. The FASB has tried for years to tighten the requirements fo=
r when such entities should be consolidated with the rest of companies' ope=
rations, but in the past companies have successfully fought any changes.=20
The FASB has said it hopes to release new draft rules for accounting for SP=
Es this spring.=20

US Rep Tauzin says Congress has learned 'of theft by insiders' at Enron

02/06/2002

(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzi=
n said his committee's investigation of Enron Corp has now uncovered "self-=
dealing transactions" by senior Enron management, violations of securities =
laws as well as "theft by insiders".=20
Tauzin revealed the findings in a committee hearing which is investigating =
Enron's collapse.
"In the end, it turns out that the Enron debacle is an old-fashioned exampl=
e of theft by insiders, and a failure by those responsible for them to prev=
ent that theft," Tauzin said.=20
In a list of new findings, the committee has found that senior Enron execut=
ives engaged in self-dealing transactions.=20
The committe said that company executives reported "fictitious gains" on pa=
rtnerships controlled by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and o=
thers associated with the company, which helped to artificially pump up Enr=
on's stock price and "allowed the same executives to enrich themselves with=
 sales of Enron stock."=20
The committee findings also levelled significant criticism at former Enron =
auditor Arthur Andersen LLP.=20
"We have also found that Enron's auditor, Andersen, knew or should have dis=
covered the fraudulent nature of the Fastow transactions," Tauzin said, add=
ing that these transactions "clearly violated existing law and the most bas=
ic norms of corporate behaviour."=20
The committee has subpoenaed Fastow to appear tomorrow to give evidence on =
his role in Enron's collapse. But committee staff said they expect the form=
er Enron executive to plead the fifth amendment, which would prevent him fr=

UBS to Start Energy Trading Soon After Hiring Enron Workers
2002-02-06 13:32 (New York)

     New York, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- UBS AG said it expects to complete thi=
s week its purchase of Enron Corp.'s energy trading business, which will re=
sume electricity and natural gas transactions that all but dried up after E=
nron's bankruptcy.
     About 625 Enron traders, technicians and back-office workers are prepa=
ring to buy and sell energy contracts for UBS, though no date has been set,=
 UBS spokesman David Walker said. Enron traders have been contacting former=
 customers and lining up credit agreements that UBS will need to complete t=
ransactions.
     The energy-trading business won't come close to equaling the $43.4 bil=
lion in revenue it generated for Enron in the third quarter, before its col=
lapse, Enron traders said. Many customers were burned by the Dec. 2 bankrup=
tcy and have since taken their business to competitors such as Intercontine=
ntal Exchange Inc.
     "It's going to be an uphill battle to build confidence,'' said Jim Wal=
ker, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge=
, Massachusetts. "The market's already operating fairly efficiently. It wil=
l be a challenge to offer better deals (than Intercontinental) and still ma=
ke a living.''
     The move to UBS has revived morale for the Enron traders, who watched =
as 4,500 of their fellow employees at the company's Houston headquarters lo=
st their jobs shortly after the bankruptcy filing, which was the largest ev=
er.
     "We're all excited about moving on from the whole Enron thing, and tha=
t we'll be back trading soon,'' said Tom Martin, director of Texas natural =
gas trading at Enron. "It'll take some time for people to get used to doing=
 business with us. I'm sure there will be some residual effects of what hap=
pened at Enron.''

Bankruptcy Sale

     UBS won a bankruptcy auction for Enron's dormant trading business in J=
anuary. Under the bid, which was approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Jan=
. 18, UBS would pay Enron a royalty of 33 percent of pretax profit from the=
 trading business. UBS also agreed to pay $5 million of the $11 million in =
retention bonuses promised to Enron's gas and power employees.
     "We expect the deal to close by the end of the week,'' said David Walk=
er, the UBS spokesman. The energy-trading business, which will be based in =
Houston and called UBS Warburg Energy, "should be up and running soon after=
ward.''
     Shares of UBS, a Switzerland's largest banks, fell 1.85 Swiss francs t=
o 73 francs ($43.10). The stock is down 12 percent since Jan. 11, when UBS =
submitted the highest bid for Enron's energy- trading business.
     The royalties may be worth $1 billion to $2 billion to Enron over the =
next several years, according to Blackstone Group LP, a private merchant-ba=
nking firm hired to help Enron restructure while it tries to emerge from ba=
nkruptcy. The liquidation value of the business would have been less than $=
50 million, the firm estimated.

Enron Obligations

     Some creditors' groups had argued that UBS's bid would force Enron to =
bear a disproportionate share of the cost and risk of getting the trading b=
usiness going again.
     There was no guarantee that other energy-trading firms would want to d=
o business with the new entity, Dallas-based bankruptcy lawyer David M. Ben=
nett, who represents a group of creditors, said at the bankruptcy hearing.
     As of Sept. 30, banks, utilities and power companies were owed more th=
an $19 billion by Enron in past trades and contracts for future commodity d=
eliveries, according to Standard & Poor's.
     With so much money still owed them, some companies may be reluctant to=
 do business with Enron's successor, even with a new name and the backing o=
f UBS, said Jim Walker, the analyst at Forrester Research.
     Enron's former trading partners also have gotten used to trading elsew=
here.

Rivals Gain

     Officials at the Intercontinental Exchange say trading has doubled in =
its markets to a nominal value of $4 billion a day in the past three months=
, fueled partly by transactions from former Enron customers. Intercontinent=
al, based in Atlanta, is owned by companies such as BP Plc, Morgan Stanley =
Dean Witter & Co. and American Electric Power Co.
     To convince traders to return, UBS will have to offer higher prices fo=
r sellers and lower prices for buyers than its rivals, which would keep pro=
fits thin, Forrester's Walker said.
     In some ways, UBS will be starting with a fresh slate. Enron's book of=
 energy contracts, many of which have been canceled and written off as loss=
es by its trading partners, belongs to the Enron estate, said Martin, the f=
ormer Enron trader who will be moving to UBS.
     Martin has been spending some of his time in the past week contacting =
former customers about setting up credit agreements with UBS.

No Enron Link

     "After a short period of time people will realize we have nothing to d=
o with Enron,'' he said. "We won't be as big a player as we were, but I thi=
nk we can get to be a pretty significant player'' during the next six month=
s to a year.
     Enron's energy-trading unit was profitable before the bankruptcy and w=
asn't responsible for the company's downfall, Martin said.
     Enron used special partnerships controlled by its executives to keep d=
ebt off its books, which helped hide losses in other businesses, according =
to company officials, government documents and congressional investigators.

Enron's Lay Told Investigators He Felt 'Betrayed'
2002-02-06 14:45 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay to=
ld investigators for the company's board that senior executives had "betray=
ed'' him in setting up partnerships that hid the energy trader's debt.
     Lay, who denied to investigators any criminal wrongdoing, said he gave=
 former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow too much leeway in creating t=
he partnerships, said William Powers, head of the board committee that on S=
aturday released a report about Enron's collapse.
     "He felt he had not been watching carefully enough,'' Powers told a su=
bcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday. "He felt h=
e had been betrayed.''
     Lawmakers questioned Powers in an attempt to piece together who contri=
buted to Enron's Dec. 2 filing of the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history an=
d wiping out the retirement savings of thousands of employees. Power repeat=
ed the conclusions of his report, which blamed everyone from Lay to the boa=
rd of directors and Arthur Andersen LLP for not questioning partnerships th=
at concealed more than $1 billion in losses.
     "The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and account=
ing errors were the result of failures at many levels and by many people,''=
 according to a summary of the report. The Enron culture "appears to have e=
ncouraged pushing the limits.''

Aggressive Style

     In his testimony, Powers said Fastow's aggressive style cowed other ex=
ecutives into approving partnerships from which he made $30 million.
     "They were unwilling to stand up to Andy Fastow,'' he said.
     Powers was appointed as an Enron director in November to lead an inves=
tigation at the board's request. He told the committee he expects to leave =
the board.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee is subpoenaing Fastow and Mich=
ael Kopper, a former Enron executive involved in the partnerships, to appea=
r tomorrow on Capitol Hill, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the panel, wh=
ich is overseeing one of 10 congressional investigations. Fastow and Kopper=
 are expected to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimina=
tion and not testify, he said.
     Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August, is expect=
ed to answer the panel's questions, Johnson said.
     The committee is seeking to have Lay testify before the end of the mon=
th, Johnson said. Two other congressional panels have issued subpoenas to L=
ay after he canceled an appearance set for Monday, citing prejudicial comme=
nts from lawmakers.
     The commerce panel voted today to give its chairman, Representative Bi=
lly Tauzin, broad authority to subpoena any other executive of Enron or And=
ersen during the investigation into Enron's collapse.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department also=
 are looking into what happened at Enron as more lawmakers said that execut=
ives probably broke the law.
     "It's an old story,'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said yesterday. =
``It's a story of inside theft.''

Labor secretary testifies at Enron hearings=20
By MARCY GORDON=20
Associated Press=20
Feb. 6, 2002, 11:24AM
WASHINGTON -- Responding to the Enron collapse, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao=
 today told Congress that President Bush's proposal to revamp pension laws =
would strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers.=20
Bush is asking Congress give workers greater flexibility to diversify their=
 company savings accounts, aiming to prevent another Enron-style meltdown. =
Thousands of Enron employees lost their retirement savings as the company s=
tock plummeted and they were barred from selling it from their investment a=
ccounts.=20
"We must strengthen the confidence of the American workforce that their ret=
irement savings are secure," Chao testified at a hearing by the House Commi=
ttee on Education and the Workforce. "We must accomplish this without unnec=
essarily limiting employers' willingness to establish and maintain plans fo=
r their workers or employees' freedom to direct their own savings."=20
Although some changes in pension laws are needed, the system is not irrepar=
ably broken and is in fact a great success story, Chao said.=20
The president's plan also would require employers to give workers quarterly=
 statements with detailed information on their accounts and their rights to=
 diversify holdings, Chao noted.=20
Chao spoke as subpoenas multiplied and hearings mushroomed in Congress' inv=
estigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once-powerful company transf=
ormed into a symbol of corporate failure.=20
Across the Capitol, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from leg=
al and labor experts on how to prevent similar future scandals. Proposals i=
ncluded requiring more disclosure from accountants and capping the amount o=
f money that bankrupt corporations can shield from creditors.=20
Such changes would require vast revisions to bankruptcy and other laws, and=
 there was disagreement early in the hearing over how best to do that. "You=
 can't legislate against greed, but you can stop greed from succeeding," sa=
id Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the panel's chairman.=20
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire told the panel that En=
ron's conduct amounted to "a perfect storm" that rained financial loss and =
fraud on thousands of investors.=20
"They assumed the seventh largest company in America was playing by the rul=
es," Gregoire said. "In the end, they found themselves ripped off just like=
 the naive person who lost money in a pyramid scheme."=20
At the hearing on pension law changes, Rep. George Miller of California, th=
e committee's senior Democrat, said the Enron case shows how workers' retir=
ement savings can be jeopardized if employees' rights and protections are i=
nadequate. "Today's outdated pension rules are putting employee nest eggs a=
t risk," he said.=20
Enron's human resources executives have said employees were frozen out of t=
heir accounts for 11 trading days while the company switched 401(k) plan ad=
ministrators.=20
As the lockout period approached and Enron's stock continued to plummet, En=
ron managers considered delaying the switch and the lockout period so emplo=
yees would not be frozen out of their accounts.=20
"We considered postponing, but found it was not feasible to notify more tha=
n 20,000 participants in a timely fashion," Mikie Rath, Enron's benefits ma=
nager, told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday.=20
An employee "told me my timing was horrible, which I agreed with," Rath sai=
d.=20
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $1=
5.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had=
 fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended.=20
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Departme=
nt and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has d=
eep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scra=
mbled to distance themselves from Enron.=20


Chao: US Pension Laws Need Reform; Warns Of Going Too Far
By Jennifer Corbett Dooren

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Labor Secretary Elaine Chao Wednesday told Congres=
s the collapse of Enron highlights the need to update the nation's pension =
laws but warned of going too far.
In testimony before the House Education and Workforce Committee, Chao said =
Enron's collapse has "revealed the need for stronger safeguards to protect =
workers."=20
Enron's stock price sharply fell last year before the firm filed for bankru=
ptcy protection in December, wiping out much of the retirement savings of t=
he company's workers.=20
But, Chao said, approving legislation that would limit the amount of employ=
er stock that can be placed in workers' 401(k) and other retirement account=
s was a bad idea.=20
"While it may be tempting to go down this road in the wake of recent busine=
ss failures, this would actually take away from workers the right to choose=
, which they deserve," she said. "Arbitrary limits on workers' investment c=
hoices would not be progress; it would be turning back the clock."=20
Instead, Chao urged Congress to approve legislation incorporating the plan =
outlined last week by President George W. Bush designed to update the 1974 =
Employee Retirement Income Security Act.=20
The Bush administration and lawmakers agree the law known as ERISA needs up=
dating because it was primarily designed to cover pension plans in which th=
e employer controlled the investments. While some firms still offer such tr=
aditional pension plans, most companies offer workers 401(k) and other reti=
rement plans in which the employee is primarily responsible for investment =
decisions. More than 42 million Americans have 401(k) retirement plans.=20
The Bush plan would require employers to offer their employees impartial in=
vestment advice, allow employers to sell company stock after three years, s=
ubject company executives to the same so-called blackout periods as employe=
es, and require companies to give employees quarterly statements of retirem=
ent plan performances.=20
Most lawmakers agree that employees need better access to investment advice=
, which would highlight the need to ensure that retirement assets are diver=
sified. More than 60% of Enron's 401(k) assets were invested in Enron stock=
 as is common for many large companies. Enron, like many companies, gave em=
ployees matching contributions in the form of stock. However, Enron employe=
es were required to hold on to the stock until age 50. Many Enron executive=
s had a different arrangement, allowing them to sell their stock sooner.=20
However, lawmakers are divided on whether to cap the amount of employer sto=

UK: No quick sale for Enron's UK power station stake.
By Matthew Jones

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Future ownership of Enron's most valuable physica=
l asset in Europe, the UK Teesside power station, remained in the balance o=
n Wednesday as its co-owners struggled to unravel contractual issues surrou=
nding the bankrupt U.S. energy company's 250 million pound ($353.5 million)=
 stake.=20
Enron's partners in the 1,875 megawatt power station are in talks with thei=
r banks in an effort to clarify the complex supply contract and ownership i=
ssues left when Enron, which operated the plant, went bankrupt in late Nove=
mber.
"It could take months before the situation is resolved," said a spokeswoman=
 for GPU Power, one of Enron's partners in Teesside, the first independent =
power station built in the UK after electricity privatisation in the early =
1990s.=20
"We are currently in talks with the other partners and with the banks," she=
 said.=20
Enron Europe went into administration in November as a financial scandal ov=
erwhelmed its Houston-based parent and administrators PricewaterhouseCooper=
s (PwC) this week said Enron Europe owed "billions" of dollars in losing po=
sitions on power and gas trading contracts.=20
Enron's 42.5 percent stake in Teesside is probably the collapsed company's =
most valuable physical asset in Europe, where the bulk of its business was =
based on trading in energy and commodities.=20
Industry sources believe Enron's equity in Teesside, the largest combined c=
ycle plant of its kind in Europe, is likely to be sold to one of its existi=
ng partners in the venture. The complex ownership structure is likely to di=
scourage outside bidders.=20
"There is no formal process to seek outside bids," a spokeswoman for Enron =
said.=20
She said Enron's partners in Teesside - Midland Power International (GPU Po=
wer), Northern Electric owned by MidAmerican Energy and itself part of Berk=
shire Hathaway , and Western Power Distribution - have first call on whethe=
r to acquire Enron's stake.=20
ONE STAKE HOLDER NOT INTERESTED=20
So far none have declared an interest in doing so. Western Power Distributi=
on said it does not want to extend its 15.4 percent stake in the venture.=
=20
"We are a distributor, not a generator and we are not interested in expandi=
ng our generation at Teesside," a company spokesman said.=20
Western Power's stance is unsurprising given the current high cost of UK ga=
s set against electricity prices which are at 10-year lows.=20
Before Enron's collapse the group's stake in Teesside was valued at about 2=
50 million pounds thanks in part to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) - cont=
racts to sell power at a set price - which currently provide a steady reven=
ue stream.=20
The PPAs are understood to be favourable to the power station since Innogy =
paid 391 million pounds to get out of the contract it acquired when it boug=
ht the supply side business of MEB.=20
The Teesside station is run by Teesside Power Limited, of which Teesside Po=
wer Holdings has a 50 percent share.=20
Enron itself has 85 percent control of Teesside Power Holdings, with Midlan=
ds Power International holding the remaining 15 percent.=20
Of the other 50 percent of Teesside Power Limited, Midlands Power has 19.2 =
percent, Northern Electric 15.4 percent and Western Power Distribution 15.4=
 percent.

Enron's Creditors' Group Setting Stage for Lawsuit Against Andersen
By Kathy Chu

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires=20
NEW YORK -- Arthur Andersen LLP's mountain of legal troubles could get a li=
ttle higher.
Andersen, which is already dealing with a slew of shareholder lawsuits over=
 its relationship with Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), may be slapped with more litiga=
tion in the coming weeks -- this time, by Enron's creditors' committee, acc=
ording to people familiar with the matter.=20
The committee didn't return repeated phone calls seeking comment. But Marti=
n Bienenstock, an attorney who represents Enron and deals with the committe=
e extensively, said, "It's more likely than not" that a lawsuit will be fil=
ed. "It's not a question of whether, it's a question of when."=20
Andersen didn't return repeated calls seeking comment.=20
The lawsuit, always considered a possibility in the legal proceedings, woul=
d come on the heels of the Powers report, the three-month internal Enron in=
vestigation led by William C. Powers, dean of the University of Texas law s=
chool. The report criticized Andersen for failing to give Enron "objective =
and critical professional advice."=20
As a result, the creditors' committee now has more ammunition to use agains=
t Andersen, experts said.=20
"[The committee] almost has a duty to pursue this," said Nancy D. Rapoport,=
 dean of the University of Houston Law Center. "There's enough in the Power=
s report that people are going to wonder why, if it doesn't happen."=20
In the meantime, the committee is still gathering information. The group is=
 getting ready to subpoena key financial documents and depose select auditi=
ng executives.=20
A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday granted the committee's request for an i=
n-depth examination of Andersen, which, according to a court filing, will b=
e given 20 days notice from the time the subpoena is issued to produce docu=
ments and 30 days notice before executives are deposed.=20
The information gleaned from Andersen over the next few weeks will likely b=
e used as fodder in any potential lawsuit against the auditors. Such a laws=
uit could allege fraud and negligence by Andersen related to the firm's adv=
ice about the risk associated with Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions a=
nd how that risk should be managed, according to bankruptcy experts.=20
In court documents filed with the New York bankruptcy court in late Decembe=
r, the creditors' committee said a "complete examination" of Andersen would=
 shed light on the "accounting irregularities disclosed by Enron and the re=
sulting financial implication that in part precipitated the bankruptcy fili=
ng ..."=20
The extensive documents requested by the group range from routine auditing =
paperwork to more detailed e-mails and computer disks. But it is the demand=
 for Andersen's "internal manuals, statements of policies and procedures," =
and "documents referring to, describing, suggesting or alleging possible vi=
olations of professional standards in the services Andersen provided to Enr=
on" that suggest the committee isn't just trying to piece together the deta=
ils of Enron's collapse.=20
Rather, the committee seems to be trying to establish a case against Anders=
en, and recoup for creditors some of the millions it paid the auditing firm=
, bankruptcy experts said.=20
Enron, for its part, plans to steer clear of the committee's deliberations.=
 "We told the creditors' committee at the outset that we would allow the cr=
editors group to take the legal action -- when or whether it was necessary,=
" said Mr. Bienenstock. "They may still be investigating the facts."=20
A lawsuit against Andersen by the committee would come as little surprise t=
o bankruptcy experts. "It's not unheard of by any stretch," said Margaret H=
oward, the scholar-in-residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a non=
profit think tank in Alexandria, Va.=20
But it could be an uphill, and costly, legal battle. In cases where a credi=
tors' committee or trustee have sued a company's auditors or lawyers, the p=
laintiffs are usually left with substantial legal fees and a disappointing =
ruling. That is partly because it's difficult to establish a third party's =
responsibility for a company's actions, say experts.=20
But because Enron's bankruptcy is the largest and possibly the most complex=
 in corporate history, little precedent exists for this type of lawsuit. "I=
t's really going to come down to the quality of the facts and the quality o=
f the lawyers," said Ms. Rapoport. "[The committee] doesn't have to have a =
slam-dunk case. They only have to be 51% right."=20

US lawmakers, SEC's Pitt to unveil binding new rules for Wall St analysts

02/06/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House lawmakers together with Securities & Exchange Comm=
ission chairman Harvey Pitt and executives of the National Association of S=
ecurities Dealers plan to unveil a range of new rules tomorrow governing Wa=
ll Street financial analysts' conduct.=20
The binding new rules, details of which have yet to be fully released, will=
 make Wall Street analysts subject to strong oversight and enforcement in o=
rder to boost their independence and stock recommendations, according to a =
statement from the House Capital Markets subcommittee.
"These people are professionals and should be held to professional standard=
s, especially because what they do has direct bearing on the lives and live=
lihoods of so many average Americans," said subcommittee chairman Richard B=
aker.=20
Baker said the rules will "protect unsuspecting minnows from irresponsible =
and self-serving sharks... rebuild Chinese Walls, and usher in dramatic cha=
nges in financial sector governance, oversight, disclosure, and responsibil=
ity."=20
The subcommittee chairman convened a blue ribbon panel of academic experts =
last year to come up with a range of new rules to reform analysts' independ=
ence following a series of hearings which uncovered instances of analysts i=
ssuing 'buy' recommendations on stocks while ordering their in-house broker=

Baker's subcommittee also found instances of analysts unwilling to downgrad=
e companies whose stock they themselves owned or whose investment banking b=

Several Wall Street securities organisations moved to bolster their analyst=
s reporting procedures as a result of the hearings, and several institution=
s including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc subsequently=
 ordered their analysts to disclose all their stock holdings.=20
The new rules were due to be unveiled last year, but an announcement has be=

Enron's Baxter Died From Self-Inflicted Wound, Examiner Says
2002-02-06 14:52 (New York)

     Houston, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. executive J. Cliffor=
d Baxter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to=
 autopsy results from the Harris County, Texas, Medical Examiner's office.
      The report, released today by Chief Medical Examiner Joyce Carter, co=
nfirms an earlier ruling that Baxter committed suicide on Jan. 25. Police i=
n the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, Texas, found Baxter's body at 2:23 a.m.=
 in his 2002 Mercedes-Benz, about a mile from his home. Attempts to revive =
Baxter, who was wearing a blue t-shirt and workout pants, were unsuccessful=
, the report says.
     A suicide note found at the scene has been sent to the Texas Attorney =
General's office for a ruling on whether it can be made public. The note sa=
id Baxter, 43, was distraught over Enron's collapse and the prospect of tes=
tifying against friends who worked there, CNBC reported the day of his deat=
h. Baxter resigned in May after a decade with Enron.
     The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well a=
s congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankr=
uptcy in corporate history in December. Baxter was Enron's vice chairman be=
fore leaving the company in May.
     Sugar Land police are continuing to investigate Baxter's death. Justic=

Tragedy
Ripple Effect ; In the wake of the Enron collapse ex-exec Cliff Baxter take=
s his life

In the past month or two friends had noticed his hair go from salt- and-pep=
per to almost completely white. Otherwise Cliff Baxter, a former vice chair=
man of the Enron Corp., seemed in reasonably good spirits. But the collapse=
 of Enron amid allegations of wrongdoing was surely preying on Baxter, 43, =
who left the company abruptly last May. "People are being investigated; peo=
ple are being sued," Baxter's wife, Carol Whalen, 43, told a reporter for t=
he Los Angeles Times recently. "This is going to follow people for the rest=
 of their lives, people who didn't do anything wrong."=20
A few days later the Enron scandal caught up with her husband-- and the con=
sequences were tragic. In the early morning hours of Jan. 25, Baxter left h=
is $700,000 home in the affluent Houston suburb of Sugar Land, got into his=
 new Mercedes-Benz sedan and drove about a half mile. He pulled over betwee=
n the medians and shot himself once in the head with a .38-cal. revolver. I=
n the car was a suicide note, which reportedly expressed anguish over Enron=
's stunning tumble into bankruptcy. In recent weeks Baxter had been subpoen=
aed by Congress to testify about what he knew of the shady financial dealin=
gs that led to the company's fall and had also been named in a class-action=
 suit filed by disgruntled shareholders who claim the top brass cashed in s=
hares before the stock tanked.
The sad irony was that Baxter was one of the few executives who had raised =
objections within the company about accounting practices that allegedly wil=
dly inflated the firm's profits, and he may have dreaded being forced to go=
 public with his concerns. "Cliff was looking pretty good in this," says on=
e friend who had worked closely with Baxter and is now a consultant. "But h=
e was intensely loyal and would never like to be seen as a guy who's going =
to tell on everybody else."=20
Until the recent troubles, Baxter had led something of a charmed life. The =
youngest of six children, he was raised in the seaside community of Amityvi=
lle, N.Y., where his father, Edwin, was a police sergeant and his mother, D=
orothy, a municipal employee. He grew up as an avid surfer and boater. Afte=
r graduating in 1980 from New York University, he enlisted in the Air Force=
 for five years, where he served as a captain. He then attended Columbia Un=
iversity School of Business, graduating first in his class. In 1991 he move=
d to Houston to join Enron, a formerly staid natural-gas-and-pipeline firm =
that was then getting into the more aggressive area of trading commodities.=
=20
His intelligence and brashness served Baxter well in Enron's go- go culture=
. He soon became chairman and CEO of Enron North America, the company's hug=
ely profitable trading business. He was named chief strategy officer in Jun=
e 2000 and vice chairman of the entire company four months after that. At i=
ts peak Enron was ranked as the seventh largest corporation in America.=20
Baxter himself enjoyed an uncommonly favorable reputation among those who w=
orked for him. John Allario, who was a manager at Enron North America, reca=
lls the way Baxter handled the teams he coached in the company's annual bas=
ketball tournament. "He reminded me of a very successful coach of a college=
 or pro team--very demanding but very fair," says Allario. "He made sure ev=
erybody got to play, but he had a burning desire to win." And though Baxter=
 worked long hours, he still carved out plenty of time for his family--wife=
 Carol and their two children, John Clifford III (known as J.C.), 16, and L=
auren, 11. "He was very into his family," says one former employee. "He rea=
lly did go to Disney World every year." Baxter's greatest delight, however,=
 was going out on his 72-ft. cabin cruiser Tranquility.=20
Meanwhile, over the past year or so, Baxter had started to raise storm flag=
s over the way Enron did business. In her now-famous memo last August to En=
ron's former chairman Kenneth Lay, company executive Sherron Watkins pointe=
d out that Baxter had already "complained mightily" to then-chief executive=
 Jeffrey Skilling "and all who would listen, about the inappropriateness of=
 our transactions." (In an interview with NBC's Today Show, Lay's wife, Lin=
da, praised Baxter as a "wonderful man" whose death "makes my heart ache. I=
t makes Ken's heart ache.") When he suddenly stepped down from his post las=
t May, Baxter cited a desire to spend more time with his family as the reas=
on. It is still not clear why he did quit. What is certain is that he left =
a very wealthy man. From 1998 until early last year, Baxter had sold stock =
options worth $35.2 million.=20
To be safe, police in Sugar Land are continuing to look into Baxter's death=
, though they say they have no reason to doubt it was a suicide. Congressio=
nal investigators in Washington, D.C., were hoping that Baxter would be abl=
e to supply some inside information of any possible malfeasance at Enron. A=
round the depleted corporate headquarters of Enron, which has taken plenty =
of hits lately, the news of Baxter's suicide left many people "devastated,"=
 according to one staffer who worked with Watkins. "It was like the last st=
raw," she says. "It just brings home the total misery of this situation."=

When Ken Lay shows up this week to testify before Congress, the disgraced f=
ormer chairman of Enron should know how to handle a hostile crowd. Even his=
 current employees, after all, are calling for his head. Just a few weeks a=
go, Enron employees tell TIME, the Houston-based energy-trading company bro=
ught in an outside consulting firm to conduct a series of focus groups with=
 some of the remaining workers on how to reinvigorate the sagging firm. One=
 of the first steps, six out of eight people indicated in one session, shou=
ld be to get rid of Lay.=20
Before the company officially went bankrupt, Lay, who had earned admiration=
 for his unpolished, affable manner, had lost his loyal fan base. In late O=
ctober--a day after Enron acknowledged that the SEC had opened an investiga=
tion of its accounting practices--Lay tried his best to raise the spirits o=
f his downtrodden workforce. At a company gathering caught on videotape, th=
e son of a Missouri minister promised that there wouldn't be any layoffs an=
d that Enron would rise again. For once, though, the rank and file weren't =
drinking Ken's Kool-Aid. As one disgruntled worker put it, in a statement t=
hat Lay chose to read aloud: "I would like to know if you are on crack. If =
so, that would explain a lot."
Not enough, surely, to satisfy members of Congress. An army of legislators,=
 lawyers and federal agents is bearing down on Lay with the threat of both =
civil and criminal charges. They all want to know why he seemed to be touti=
ng Enron stock and simultaneously selling his own shares--while knowing tha=
t the firm he had turned from a staid pipeline operator into an innovative =
energy-trading giant was imploding. Investigators for plaintiff lawyers tel=
l TIME they are looking into allegations that investment bankers helped top=
 executives like Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling (who is also supposed =
to pay a visit to Capitol Hill this week) put so-called collars on their st=
ock options so they would not lose money, no matter how low the stock sank.=
=20
Lay's dubious defense strategy was foreshadowed by his wife Linda in an ill=
-conceived appearance last week on NBC's Today show. She claimed that her h=
usband was hoodwinked by nefarious underlings and that the proof of his inn=
ocence is that he and his family are now near bankruptcy. "If those people =
had come back to him and told him there was anything wrong, he would have s=
topped it and fixed it," Linda Lay declared. "There's nothing left. Everyth=
ing we had mostly was in Enron stock."=20
When he appears before the Senate Commerce Committee, Lay is expected to ar=
gue, as his wife did, that he relied on the counsel of legal and financial =
experts, who told him there was nothing illicit or unethical about hiding b=
illions of dollars of Enron's debts in off- balance sheet partnerships that=
 ended up inflating the company's reported earnings. To prove his point--an=
d show how much he believed in the company until the bitter end--the man wh=
o has collected some $200 million in compensation over the past three years=
 will try to explain how he is now flat broke. An internal Enron probe rele=
ased Saturday night blamed the company's demise on a wide range of executiv=
es and auditors but went easy on Lay.=20
But the lawmakers and staff members preparing questions for Lay wonder how =
he is going to explain away all the evidence to the contrary. Lay's claim o=
f ignorance is "as implausible as imagining that Richard Nixon did not know=
 what was being done by his staff at Watergate," says David Beim, a profess=
or of economics and finance at Columbia University Business School.=20
Lay knew all along about the possible ethical conflicts posed by the involv=
ement of Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in off- the-books part=
nerships with shell corporations, according to a confidential study conduct=
ed at Lay's request by the Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins. On Nov. 5, 199=
7, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the executive committee of=
 Enron's board voted to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in loan gua=
rantees to a partnership known as Chewco. Then, in June and November of 199=
9, the board waived the company's ethics code to allow Fastow to serve as g=
eneral partner of two additional partnerships, both supposedly independent =
of Enron.=20
It's hard to imagine how the mounting evidence of trouble could have escape=
d Lay's attention by last summer. Vice chairman Clifford Baxter--who commit=
ted suicide late last month--resigned in May after voicing concerns about a=
ccounting practices to Lay's top deputy, Jeffrey Skilling. The whistle-blow=
ing memo by Enron vice president Sherron Watkins was sent to Lay on Aug. 15=
. Another warning memo, from employee Margaret Ceconi, made its way to Lay =
soon after. Nonetheless, Lay in September was telling employees to buy more=
 stock and bet on Enron's future.=20
It was an open secret at Enron that the company was all but a "house of car=
ds that will fall," as a Texas energy executive attending an industry confe=
rence in Vail, Colo., a year ago groused to a senior Enron v.p. His dinner =
companion's startling reply: "You're more right than you know." Even people=
 who believe that Lay was not involved in the dubious dealings of Skilling,=
 Fastow and chief accounting officer Richard Causey concede that Lay had la=
id the foundation by encouraging Enron's ruthless, winner-take-all culture.=
 A band of cocky, inexperienced young M.B.A.s was left alone to do whatever=
 it took to structure a deal, regardless of the consequences. "Pushing the =
limits was what you were told to do, and you were given the resources to do=
 it," says an Enron manager.=20
The Lays' claim that they are nearly as bankrupt as Enron is not winning th=
em much trust or sympathy in Houston--or in Washington. Ken Lay now holds c=
lose to 3 million essentially worthless Enron shares, but he got most of hi=
s money by selling Enron stock early, reaping more than $100 million over t=
he past three years. During that same period, he received salary and cash b=
onuses of more than $17 million. Last year alone he unloaded $25.7 million =
in Enron stock between January and mid-July as the share price fell from $8=
0 to less than $50. And at the end of 2001, according to public records, he=
 owned stock that today is worth more than $11 million in companies for whi=
ch he was either an officer or director, including Compaq, Eli Lilly and a =
bevy of start-ups.=20
The Lays own at least 20 properties in Colorado and Texas. These include th=
eir principal home--a five-bedroom high-rise condo in Houston that's worth =
at least $8 million--as well as rental properties from Houston to Galveston=
 that are worth an additional $4.5 million. The Lays are selling all their =
Aspen, Colo., properties, including a 4,537-sq.-ft. log cabin and a four-be=
droom riverfront house, together worth about $20 million.=20
What's unclear is how much debt the Lays have. Lay and his lawyers declined=
 to discuss that issue or answer other questions put to them by TIME. Last =
year Lay sold millions of dollars of Enron stock back to the company to rep=
ay some loans. It was not illegal, but it's a maneuver that makes it harder=
 to track insider selling; instead of disposing of stock on the open market=
 and having to declare it publicly soon afterward, Lay did not have to repo=
rt it until 45 days after the end of the fiscal year.=20
It was just that penchant for secrecy that got Enron in trouble in the firs=
t place. But as FBI agents and 10 congressional committees and subcommittee=
s probe the scandal, it's only a matter of time before someone breaks the c=
ode. And when they do, Ken Lay may well have to deal with an even less symp=
athetic audience.=20

Ken Lay isn't the only member of his family to make a name in Houston's bus=
iness elite. Travel Agency in the Park, co-owned by his younger sister Shar=
on Lay, 56, took the No. 4 spot in the Houston Business Journal's 2001 rank=
ing of woman-owned businesses. But Ken Lay didn't just set an example for h=
is sister--his company sent lots of deals her way. From 1996 through 2000, =
Sharon Lay's company (renamed Alliance Worldwide in December) received $6.8=
 million in commissions from Enron travel, according to SEC documents. Enro=
n commissions reportedly accounted for half the travel company's revenue.=
=20
While Enron's employees were in theory permitted to book their business tra=
vel elsewhere, Sharon Lay's was the agency of choice. Callers to Enron's co=
rporate-travel department still reach a telephone extension at Alliance Wor=
ldwide. Enron managers strongly discouraged employees from going elsewhere,=
 according to former Enron staff members. Says one: "You only did that once=
." A memo last June reminded Enron employees to use TAP because of its volu=
me discounts. But in some cases, the agency quoted fares that were no bette=
r than published rates, and still charged Enron a $30-per-ticket fee, Enron=
 insiders say. Sharon and Ken Lay declined to comment.
Other Houston travel firms knew they had little hope of an Enron contract. =
"Let's just say it was hard to get in," says Gary Pearce, general manager o=
f Navigant, one of the city's largest corporate- travel firms. For all of K=
en Lay's belief in free-market competition, for family he made exceptions. =
Enron also acquired a company owned in part by Ken Lay's son Mark, who then=
 received a three-year, $1 million employment contract. As for Ken Lay, he =
continues to travel on a private Enron jet.=20

As a member of Enron Corp.'s board of directors, Frank Savage seemed ideal =
for providing the kind of unvarnished advice and oversight that big compani=
es need from their governing bodies. A director of Alliance Capital Managem=
ent, a leading investment company, Savage also served on two other major co=
rporate boards.=20
That's what Enron told the world. What it didn't say was that Alliance is p=
art of Axa Financial, a New York investment and insurance company, and that=
 Axa was a huge Enron shareholder. So much for Savage's independence--and s=
o, too, for the independence of the rest of Enron's board.
This week, as Congress holds another round of hearings on Enron's spectacul=
ar collapse, lawmakers will begin delving into why Enron's board failed to =
prevent financial calamity. It has been known that some directors have had =
extracurricular ties with the company. But the relationships are even tight=
er than has been revealed. As Enron was crumbling, its board effectively be=
came one composed entirely of insiders, such that even the board committees=
 that served crucial watchdog roles lacked anyone without some other relati=
onship to the firm.=20
Because outside directors are a public company's last line of defense, expe=
rts widely agree that these members should make up the majority of a compan=
y's board. But Enron's outside directors have had investment, consulting, a=
nd other business ties to the company, some of them not disclosed. They bec=
ame involved in Enron's jumble of partnerships and subsidiaries. Several we=
re part of "interlocking directorates," in which they served together not o=
nly on the Enron board but on others as well. Some have been involved in or=
ganizations that have reaped millions in charity from Enron or its former c=
hief, Kenneth Lay. Beyond those connections, directors had a strong incenti=
ve to back Lay's go-go strategy because they were required to take much of =
their compensation in stock.=20
A few cases highlight the problem. Director Robert Belfer was the chief exe=
cutive of Belco Oil & Gas Corp. For years his company has done tens of mill=
ions of dollars in business with Enron units, and it even acquired an Enron=
-affiliated company. Various Enron entities have invested in Belco. Belfer =
has joined many other directors in serving with other Enron ventures.=20
Many of Enron's directors--including Robert Jaedicke and fellow audit commi=
ttee members John Mendelsohn, Paulo Farraz-Pereira, Wendy Gramm, Ronnie Cha=
n, and John Wakeham--are listed as directors of a murky Enron entity known =
as ES Power 3, among the thousands of subsidiaries and partnerships now und=
er scrutiny.=20
Sweet charity. Three Enron directors--Mendelsohn, Charles LeMaistre, and Jo=
hn H. Duncan--have been key figures in the University of Texas's M. D. Ande=
rson Cancer Center, which has received at least $1.9 million from Enron or =
the Lay family or foundation. In Enron's early days, a firm in which Duncan=
 was a partner received hundreds of thousands of dollars for investment ser=
vices. Director Joe Foy has been a director of a Dallas utility company tha=
t competed with Enron to obtain power plant facilities. He was also a retir=
ed partner of a Houston law firm that has done work for Enron.=20
Several directors have had well-paid consulting contracts with the company =
they oversaw. Perhaps the most lucrative of them went to John Urquhart, who=
 has earned millions for such services, on top of millions more from stock =
deals with Enron and affiliated companies. An oil and gas services company =
affiliated with director Herbert S. Winokur Jr. has also reaped millions in=
 sales from Enron.=20
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, could not be reac=
hed, and directors didn't return phone calls or declined comment. But the d=
irectors are expected to argue that the Enron executives and outside audito=
rs withheld crucial information from them. Minutes of board meetings may su=
ggest otherwise. But with Enron's vaporization of $67 billion in shareholde=
r wealth, one thing seems sure: The subject of corporate governance, long t=
he province of academics and activists, won't remain in the corner much lon=
ger.=20
Bush's first Enron shot=20
PENSION REFORM=20
Employees would have more flexibility in managing their 401(k)'s--and Presi=
dent Bush deflects criticism that he's too tight with Enron. That's the ups=
hot of a plan Bush announced last week that would allow employees to sell s=
tock matched by their employers after just three years. Under the plan, Bus=
h's first response to the Enron debacle, executives could not divest holdin=
gs when employees were barred from doing so. Businesses were pleased; Democ=
rats said their plan is better.

Washington vs. Wall Street, again

With 11 congressional committees pawing at the ground to investigate Enron =
and fears spreading that other corporations may have played hide-the-ball w=
ith their finances, the public must decide: Should Washington rein in corpo=
rate America? Or will government intervention only make matters worse and p=
ut the brakes on economic growth?=20
Just about everyone agrees that executives at Enron and its auditor Arthur =
Andersen should be put through the wringer and held accountable if they bro=
ke the law. But beyond that, there's a growing divide. On one side are the =
free marketers who say Enron is just one bad apple that duped its sharehold=
ers.
Congress should close a few accounting loopholes and call it a day--the mar=
kets will take care of the rest. On the other side are people who believe E=
nron is a sign that our regulatory system is broken--that big business is s=
tampeding out of control and that we need new laws and agencies with sharp =
teeth to regulate the "new economy."=20
Though the polling data are still raw, it's not encouraging for the free-ma=
rket crowd. Three out of four Americans say big business has too much influ=
ence over Congress. Nearly as many feel the corporate practices that got En=
ron in trouble are widespread. Just 8 percent of Americans say they have a =
great deal of confidence in large corporations.=20
Given those numbers, some political analysts say the stage is set for a tec=
tonic shift in how the government and the public treat big business. A quic=
k tour of 20th-century history shows Americans don't tolerate unregulated c=
enters of power. Whether it's big business, big government, or big labor, w=
hen one force begins to dominate the landscape, the public tries to restore=
 balance. When robber barons and massive financial trusts corrupted politic=
s and manipulated markets in the early 1900s, the Progressive movement was =
born and Teddy Roosevelt went on a trustbusting spree.=20
Curbing power. Labor's power surged in the 1930s and '40s, bringing long-de=
nied basic rights to workers. But when the public decided labor's muscle wa=
s excessive--some 4.6 million workers went on strike in 1946--Congress bega=
n reining in unions with the Taft-Hartley Act.=20
Government grew dramatically from Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to Lyndon J=
ohnson's Great Society. But a stagnant economy, Vietnam, and Watergate conv=
inced Americans that Washington was bloated and corrupt. By 1981, Ronald Re=
agan could proclaim, "Government is not the solution to our problem. Govern=
ment is the problem." A decade and a half later, Bill Clinton would declare=
, "The era of big government is over."=20
The influence of these forces in society waxes and wanes. CNN political ana=
lyst Bill Schneider, who cowrote a book about public attitudes toward these=
 institutions, told U.S. News that America could be on the verge of another=
 "progressive era," where perceived excesses of capitalism are curtailed. "=
What captivates the public's imagination is the heedless behavior of the En=
ron executives," Schneider said. "That's where you can draw real parallels =
between an Enron and the famous trusts of the early 19th century."=20
In predictable fashion, Congress is now considering a laundry list of refor=
ms, from how we fund our pensions to how we finance our political campaigns=
. But for free-market advocates, those "cures" are far worse than the disea=
se. Deregulation and corporate freedom, they say, are what fueled the great=
 booms of the 1980s and 1990s. They insist that the market will correct its=
elf with little new regulation, arguing that it's the financial damage to E=
nron and Andersen, along with the prospect of their executives doing jail t=
ime, that will discourage other companies from pulling the same tricks.=20
Some critics have gone further, calling for an end to annual audit requirem=
ents altogether. Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal points out that =
annual audits, required by the federal government for public companies, hav=
e failed to detect any of the nation's biggest financial scandals. In fact,=
 rather than detect fraud, annual audits actually do damage by giving inves=
tors a false sense of security. Better to have the market hold CEOs respons=
ible for convincing shareholders--by whatever means--that their books are c=
lean. If the CEO can't do it, market forces will punish his company.=20
So how should Congress respond to Enron? Is dealing with the specifics of t=
he case enough? Or are we on the cusp of something much bigger? Does Congre=
ss need to rein in corporate power in America? We invite your thoughts as p=
art of our ongoing World@Large series. We can be reached at letters@usnews.=

ENRON=20
In the aftermath, auditors of publicly held companies will become accountab=
le only to the shareholders, not to a company's top management. That means =
the auditors will be hired and fired by the board of directors' audit commi=
ttee. It will be the audit committee telling management who's going to be l=
ooking over the books rather than the other way around. The audit committee=
 will determine fees, and it will approve the actual payment of those fees.=
 Management won't be able to terminate the services of public accounting fi=
rms; only the audit committee will have that power. Management will be able=
 to complain about the auditors, but that's all it'll be able to do. If the=
re are major disputes between management and outside examiners, the audit c=
ommittee will have to know about those conflicts.
Other than taking care of routine regulatory filings with the Securities & =
Exchange Commission (SEC) and perhaps preparing company tax returns, outsid=
e auditors will be barred from providing services to publicly held companie=
s whose books they are auditing.=20
The SEC should be able to do most of the job of overseeing accountants and =
accounting rules. If legislation is needed to reinforce the notion that acc=
ountants are to work for the shareholders and the public, a now-cowed Congr=
ess will quickly comply.=20
But let's not kid ourselves. Some managements will still be tempted to cook=
 the books, though they'll have less cover and opportunity. Be that as it m=
ay, there are still going to be speculative booms. After all, numerous now-=
busted dot-coms never resorted to Enron-style sleights-of-hand to attract c=
apital. They had no profits and often no sales, but investors still desired=
 those dot-com shares. These speculative bubbles are similar to one definit=
ion of love--a willing suspension of disbelief.=20

A spooky antecedent to the Enron scandal goes back 15 years.=20
Armed guards at Enron's door. Fake trades and illicit gains. Criminal inves=
tigations. Pleas of ignorance from the top. Talk about history repeating it=
self--this was all back in October 1987, at Enron Oil's trading offices in =
Valhalla, N.Y. For two years a pair of rogue traders, Enron Oil President L=
ouis Borget and his treasurer, Thomas Mastroeni, routinely violated the com=
pany's risk parameters and set up sham oil contracts with phony companies t=
hey created. They even pushed all deals through a single brokerage firm, an=
d then collected kickbacks of up to five cents per barrel. Their reported t=
ake was almost $6 million. When the scam broke, Enron took an $85 million h=
it, wiping out the year's expected earnings. Chairman Kenneth Lay expressed=
 shock at the shenanigans.
Kelly Dunn, a futures trader who was then a 24-year-old staffer in the Valh=
alla office, remembers it well. Looking back, it's hard to imagine Enron br=
ass didn't know Borget was playing fast and loose with deals, she says, bec=
ause she was told that at least one seasoned oil trader called Houston to w=
arn of Enron Oil's true trading positions and losses. For instance, Enron O=
il reportedly had open short positions (contracts to sell oil but no corres=
ponding purchase contracts) in excess of 80 million barrels-more than six t=
imes the limit spelled out in Enron's risk-reduction policy and the rough e=
quivalent to three months' output of the North Sea oilfields at the time. D=
unn says the risk rules were routinely ignored in Valhalla: Every week posi=
tion reports that detailed trading activities were written out in longhand =
and faxed to headquarters. "Houston had to know our position was bigger tha=
n we were reporting, if we were making that kind of money," Dunn says. "The=
y turned a blind eye to big profits."=20

A question of values

At the World Economic Forum last week in New York, talk centered not only o=
n rogue nations like Iraq and North Korea. Delegates also worried about rog=
ue companies like Enron and wondered if the U.S. government would be equall=
y tough on them.=20
Are there other huge enterprises out there that could collapse overnight? M=
any think so. Klaus Schwab, founder of the phenomenally successful World Ec=
onomic Forum, told U.S. News that, based on his soundings of the business e=
lite, there may be as many as 10 major corporations that could fall without=
 warning.
No doubt, many of them could fail because of tough times. That's how capita=
lism is supposed to work--as economist Joseph Schumpeter said, it periodica=
lly unleashes "gales of creative destruction." We shouldn't worry much abou=
t those failures. But others could implode like Enron, companies that have =
lied to investors and then, when the bubble burst, allowed top executives t=
o walk away with millions while leaving employees and investors holding the=
 bag.=20
Our problem is that we can't tell one company from the other because our sy=
stem of safeguards has broken down. We no longer have reliable fraud protec=
tors to spot the liars in advance. Enron, after all, didn't slip under the =
radar screen because it went off course once or twice. It hid debt in hundr=
eds if not thousands of sketchy partnerships undisclosed to shareholders an=
d dodged taxes by creating nearly 900 overseas subsidiaries--692 in the Cay=
man Islands alone. And, it turns out, Enron wasn't alone in hiding its loss=
es behind accounting gimmicks. In the gilded '90s, a good many other compan=
ies did the same thing, and their books still aren't straight.=20
Predators. That's why it is so disappointing that the Bush administration, =
admirably harsh in defending us against international wrongdoers, has been =
lackadaisical in guarding us against economic predators at home. Its respon=
se to Enron has been modest at best. To be sure, terror is more dangerous t=
o life and limb. But companies like Enron are dangerous, too: They rob our =
financial system of public trust, which has always been an essential part o=
f its magic.=20
Who wants to invest in liars?=20
Harvey Pitt, the president's choice to run the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission, argues that the answer is to tighten up self-policing by industry. =
He has put forward a plan that is drawing nearly universal scorn. Others ha=
ve put forward better ideas. Stanford's Maureen McNichols thinks companies =
should be forced to rotate their auditors every five years, thus avoiding c=
ozy relations. Accountant Dave Cotton proposes that accounting firms work f=
or the stock exchanges, not for private companies.=20
These ideas, and others on the table, are worthy of exploration by Congress=
. But self-policing is ultimately not a complete answer. While most busines=
s people are honest--the accounting profession is full of top-flight profes=
sionals--some will always put private profits first. Like it or not, the go=
vernment is the best instrument we have for protecting the public interest,=
 and it is to government that we should turn now. Clearly the place to star=
t is in stopping the sewage of campaign money in politics.=20
True, there is no evidence that campaign contributions by Enron or Arthur A=
ndersen bought specific favors from the Bush team. But the record is plain =
that by flooding Washington with cash, Enron was able to create a "regulato=
ry black hole" so that regulators couldn't see what it was doing. It's also=
 no coincidence that the accounting profession blocked a Clinton-era reform=
 that would have prevented Andersen from performing a $25 million audit and=
 simultaneously receiving $27 million in consulting fees from Enron. Most p=
oliticians aren't bought, but until we get campaign finance reform, they wi=
ll remain on long-term lease.=20
With Bush reluctant, Congress must now take the lead: Stiffen criminal pena=
lties for company malfeasance. Restore the SEC as a corporate watchdog with=
 teeth. Straighten up public reporting so that companies are transparent. A=
nd protect the pension funds of employees from company manipulation.=20
Isn't it obvious, for example, that the SEC must be rebuilt? It was once a =
top-flight agency whose lawyers and accountants were fierce watchdogs again=
st corporate chicanery. Recently, it has been in turmoil, losing a third of=
 its employees in just three years. Its turnover rate among lawyers is twic=
e that of other government agencies, a reflection, in part, of how our civi=
l service has been allowed to deteriorate.=20
Coming to the World Economic Forum, one saw, once again, that America is th=
e envy of many other nations for reasons that extend far beyond our militar=
y might. By the standards of much of the world, we are an open and resilien=
t people, remarkably free of corruption. To others, our values help explain=
 why just 5 percent of the world's population produces some 28 percent of t=
he world's wealth. Enron deeply offends our values, and we must act now to =
stop any encores.

The Wives First Club

We've seen this movie before: Politician/CEO gets into big trouble. His law=
yers won't let him talk. His political/business advisers worry about his im=
age. His press grows more and more abysmal. He's sinking fast. There is onl=
y one thing left to do: Send out the wife. After all, if she still stands b=
y her man, how bad can he be?=20
And so it was hardly a surprise when Linda Lay went public last week, defen=
ding her hubby, "Kenny Boy" (as both she and President Bush call him), the =
ex-CEO of Enron fame and misfortune. The sad and tearful spouse testified t=
o her husband's decency and honor, both having been trampled by the "mass h=
ysteria" of the press. "He spent his entire life making absolutely certain =
that there was never, ever a point in his life that anyone could say he did=
n't have integrity," she assured NBC's Lisa Myers. ". . . Never, never not =
for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal."
Thank goodness we got that all cleared up.=20
What a handy idea, this Wives First Club: Send the sympathetic little woman=
 out there as the first character witness to plead her spouse's case. So it=
 was with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who made it clear that Gennifer Flowers w=
as of no concern to her and therefore should be of no concern to us. It wor=
ked. And it worked again when Clinton blamed the "vast right-wing conspirac=
y" for her husband's problems. If she had not defended Bill Clinton, no one=
 else would have.=20
Just think of how much ground wives have gained over the years: Did Richard=
 Nixon send Pat out to defend his character? Never. She emerged only to sit=
 behind him during his "Checkers" speech as he struggled to save his vice p=
residency and once again to wave goodbye to the White House. And as White H=
ouse counselor John Dean became engulfed in Watergate, where was his wife, =
Maureen? Sitting silently, too, watching him testify. And where was Lee Har=
t after her presidential candidate husband, Gary, was caught gallivanting w=
ith an attractive blond? Noticeably absent from his first--and most crucial=
--post-scandal press conference.=20
Women's work. So we've come a long way, baby. Maybe it's cultural--feminism=
 writ large. It's no longer unmanly to hide behind a woman's skirts; we've =
become a great PR move. (Tough luck for those unmarried pedophile priests.)=
 After all, women are more sympathetic characters; at least that's what the=
 pollsters say. We're also more believable. And since we're also legally pr=
otected from testifying against our spouses, we're perfect! So long as the =
culture of personal confession is with us, why not have a woman do the fami=
ly confessing? In fact, if we don't publicly defend our spouses now, people=
 wonder what's really wrong. To wit: Where was Mrs. Gary Condit last summer=
 when Larry King was on the line?=20
One caveat: The spousal defense is not foolproof. It's a good idea to make =
sure the wife has talking points that are (a) easy to believe and (b) easy =
to explain. That's where Linda Lay fell way short: In her TV chat, she said=
 the family had "nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock.=
" Just what does "mostly" mean in this context? Could it mean the $8 millio=
n in stock in two outside companies and an additional $25 million in real-e=
state holdings? "We're fighting for liquidity," she confessed. If you were =
a broke ex-Enron employee, would you be sobbing into a Kleenex upon hearing=
 that news? And what about the explanation that CEO extraordinaire Ken Lay =
was out of his own loop? "There's some things that weren't--that he wasn't =
told," his wife says. "There's some things that the board of directors . . =
. didn't know." A vast bureaucratic conspiracy, perhaps?=20
Sure, Linda Lay just wants the rest of us to know her husband as she knows =
her husband. So do his kids, who were also understandably eager to talk abo=
ut their dad's integrity. (The Lay family even made Ken's ex-wife available=
, who we learn still likes Ken so much that she even vacations with him and=
 Linda and the rest of the clan.) Remember--even Condit's children went on =
TV to talk about their great dad. They felt that it was the least they coul=
d do.=20
The family instinct to protect clan members is as old as civilization itsel=
f. But even Socrates, facing death over youth corruption charges, told his =
jury that he would make his own case. "I have a family, yes . . . and yet I=
 will not bring any of them hither in order to petition you for an acquitta=
l." And why not? "One who has reached my years, and who has a name for wisd=
om, ought not to demean himself."=20
Besides, his wife wasn't good on TV, anyway.
