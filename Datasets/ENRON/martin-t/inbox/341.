Laura,

The allocated costs are determined by other groups but so far we haven't gotten much planning information for 2002.  We did get information for Outside Legal but that was just what had been allocated in 2001 as of August.  I did include an estimate for this by considering what was planned for in 2001 and what actuals were.  No information has been provided for the other allocated costs.  In some cases such as System Development, the amount planned for in 2001 was quite large so I went ahead and included that  same plan number for 2002 until we can get better information.

I don't have any detail to give you as of now but I'll pass along anything I receive.

Hi, Laynie.  Tom sent me an email, asking for a detail of our budgeted allocated costs ... can you please help?  These are his exact words:

Also Louise mentioned in the staff meeting that we are going to be more directly accountable and able to control our allocated costs such as IT and logistics costs next year.  Please ask Laynie to give a detail of our budgeted allocated costs such as IT, logistics, etc for next so that we can review it.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist you with this somehow.
Thanks,
Laura
