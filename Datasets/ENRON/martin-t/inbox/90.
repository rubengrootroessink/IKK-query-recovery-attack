Shredded Documents Taken to Court
=20

Jan. 22 - An attorney handed over shredded Enron documents to a federal cou=
rt in Houston today, claiming they were important papers company workers ha=
d attempted to destroy as recently as last week.=20


The attorney, William Lerach, who has filed a class-action suit against the=
 failed energy firm on behalf of employees and stockholders, said he though=
t the court should begin to take physical possession of evidence from the f=
irm and its now-fired auditor Arthur Andersen, and appoint independent expe=
rts to try to restore deleted e-mail.=20
"It may be necessary that we put a U.S. marshal or someone on the premises =
there at Enron to make sure these people behave themselves," argued Lerach =
on ABCNEWS' Good Morning America today.=20
Shredders Were 'Working Overtime'=20
Document-shredding continued at Enron's headquarters up until at least last=
 week, former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda told ABCNEWS, despite feder=
al subpoenas and court orders since last October forbidding the destruction=
 of documents.=20
Castaneda, the former director of Enron's foreign investments section, said=
 the shredding was done in an accounting office on the 19th floor of the co=
mpany's Houston headquarters.=20
"I left the second week of January and the shredding was going on until the=
 day I left, and I have no idea if it continues," said Castaneda, who worke=
d across the hall from the accounting office.=20
"After Thanksgiving, there was great interest in the accounting documents s=
tored," she said. "They pulled out all the boxes and people had to go throu=
gh every box."=20
Castaneda added in a Good Morning America interview this morning: "I think =
the accountants were probably working a lot of overtime. You could tell by =
the pizza boxes and trash cans."=20
The former executive says she had no idea what was going on - even used the=
 shreddings to pack up her belongings - until she received an e-mail from t=
he corporate attorney reiterating company policy forbidding document shredd=
ing.=20
"That's when the light bulb went on," recalled Castaneda, "And I said, 'Wel=
l, wait a minute, if they're not supposed to destroy them, why are they des=
troyed?' "=20
'It Will Not Be Tolerated'=20
Enron attorney Bob Bennett said that all employees had been forbidden to sh=
red any documents as of Oct. 25.=20
"At a very early time, the legal team made all employees aware of the pendi=
ng litigation and that all documents should be retained," Bennett told ABCN=
EWS. "If anyone has disobeyed that policy or if anyone is discovered to hav=
e shredded documents, it will not be tolerated and severe action will be ta=
ken."=20
He also said the company was investigating the reports.=20
Castaneda said she discovered the shredded documents when she was cleaning =
out her office and looking for packing material. She showed ABCNEWS boxes f=
ull of shredded documents dated from November and December, which she found=
 in the hallway.=20
"I got these when I was leaving work, to basically use for packing material=
," she said. "I only took one box."=20
The word "confidential" can be seen on the shredded papers, which were dens=
ely packed into the box she showed ABCNEWS.=20
"A lot are accounting documents," said Castaneda. "You can tell because of =
the colors yellow and pink."=20
Also, she said she found shreds with references to some of Enron's off-the-=
books partnerships, which the company used to mask its financial problems. =
Lawyers in the case regard this as likely evidence of a criminal act: Destr=
oying documents in the middle of a federal investigation is potential obstr=
uction of justice.=20
Enron's accounting practices have come under heightened scrutiny since the =
company's stunning October announcement that it lost $638 million in the th=
ird quarter of 2001 and was worth $1.2 billion less than it had previously =
claimed.=20
ABCNEWS' Brian Ross contributed to this report.

Paper Chase
Congress to Probe Destruction of Enron Documents

By Pete Yost
The Associated Press

W A S H I N G T O N, Jan. 21 - A House panel plans to issue subpoenas if ne=
cessary to compel testimony from Enron's accounting firm and the auditor it=
 fired for the destruction of thousands of documents.


Arthur Andersen LLP chief executive Joseph Berardino criticized his firm's =
lead auditor on the Enron account, David Duncan, saying he displayed "at th=
e least ... extremely poor judgment" for his part in discarding documents i=
n October and November. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.=20
Duncan has told investigators he was simply following the advice of Anderse=
n's legal department when he directed the shredding. The House Energy and C=
ommerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations has scheduled a hearin=
g for Thursday.=20
The tentative witness list includes Duncan, Andersen attorney Nancy Temple =
and Berardino or another top-ranking Andersen official.=20
It was uncertain whether Duncan would appear voluntarily.=20
"We have made it clear that we'll be prepared to subpoena any reluctant wit=
nesses," said committee spokesman Ken Johnson.=20
Johnson said "a number of people have approached the committee about immuni=
ty" from prosecution, "but we have not offered it to anyone, nor have we se=
riously considered it up to this point."=20
"We're very interested in finding out where Andersen is, in its internal in=
vestigation" of the Enron controversy, "and we want to examine administrati=
ve and disciplinary actions taken in the wake of the disclosure that docume=
nts were destroyed," Johnson said.=20
Focus on Stock Sales=20
A variety of federal law enforcement agencies and congressional investigato=
rs are looking into Enron's sudden collapse, the largest bankruptcy in U.S.=
 history and one that cost many employees their retirement savings.=20
Among the avenues of interest: actions taken by Enron managers to sell some=
 of their own stock in the company even as employees were encouraged to con=
tinue investing.=20
A lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said Lay=
 disposed of millions of dollars in Enron stock because he needed to raise =
cash to repay loans, not because of concerns about the health of his compan=
y, The New York Times reported today.=20
Attorney Earl J. Silbert said Lay had put up shares of his Enron stock as c=
ollateral for other investments. On at least 15 occasions between February =
and October of last year, Silbert told the Times, Lay returned shares in En=
ron to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit lin=
e.=20
The House panel meeting Thursday hoped to get to the bottom of Andersen's s=
hredding of the documents.=20
Temple, a lawyer at Andersen headquarters in Chicago, e-mailed a copy of th=
e firm's document destruction policy to the Houston office where Duncan and=
 other accountants worked on the Enron account.=20
Temple sent the e-mail just four days before Enron announced more than $600=
 million in third-quarter losses. At the same time, the energy company took=
 the first step to fully disclose details of partnerships that had kept hun=
dreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt off the company's balance sheet.=
=20
E-mail Defended=20
Appearing Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Berardino defended Temple's sen=
ding of the e-mail, saying "Nancy just told people to use their judgment. S=
he did not instruct them to do anything, to my knowledge."=20
According to congressional investigators, Duncan said last week that genera=
l discussions began at Andersen in September about what Enron-related docum=
ents to discard.=20
"It was unusual" to emphasize the document-destruction policy, Duncan told =
the investigators, according to congressional sources familiar with what he=
 said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.=20
Asked why Temple reminded the Houston office of the policy to do away with =
some documents, Berardino replied, "Because accountants are pack rats ... W=
e save lots of stuff that's not relevant."=20
Asked about the timing of Temple's e-mail, Berardino said "we were in the p=
rocess of putting our files together to make sure that all of the third-qua=
rter events were properly documented in our work papers."

Judge to hear request to halt shredding
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - An attorney representing shareholders suing 29 current and f=
ormer Enron Corp. executives and directors carried a box of shredded docume=
nts into federal court Tuesday, claiming employees of the fallen energy tra=
ding giant were destroying records through at least mid-January.=20
"This is the shredded evidence that we got out of Enron," attorney William =
Lerach said as he hurried into the downtown Houston courthouse, where he wa=
s prepared to ask a judge to ban any shredding by Enron or its former audit=
or, Arthur Andersen.
A state judge's order already prohibits Andersen's Houston office from shre=
dding Enron-related documents. Chicago-based Andersen acknowledged earlier =
this month its Houston office had destroyed a significant but undetermined =
amount of audit-related work.=20
Lerach's law partner, Paul Howes, released a court brief late Monday in whi=
ch a former Enron executive saw staffers in the accounting and finance depa=
rtment review and shred thousands of documents.=20
Maureen Raymond Castaneda, who was laid off as Enron's director of foreign =
exchange and sovereign risk, told Howes the "gather-review-shred" process s=
tarted Oct. 31, when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a for=
mal investigation into Enron finances, and continued through at least Jan. =
14.=20
In a statement released Monday, Enron reiterated that it has had a strict a=
nti-shredding policy in place since last autumn.=20
"Since Oct. 25, Enron has notified employees in no uncertain terms that the=
y are to preserve all documents and materials. The company has sent out fou=
r e-mails to that effect from Oct. 25, 2001, through Jan. 14, 2002," said t=
he statement.=20
Castaneda confirmed she saw at least two such e-mails from Enron general co=
unsel James Derrick.=20
Houston-based Enron cited Andersen's shredding issues when it fired the ven=
erable accounting firm last week.=20
Neil Rothstein, attorney for another plaintiff, the Archdiocese of Milwauke=
e Support Fund, said Tuesday morning that justice can be served only with i=
ntact evidence.=20
"We are entitled to see what they have," Rothstein said, referring to anyon=
e with pertinent Enron documentation. "No one should have destroyed documen=
ts."=20
Lerach said Castaneda took some boxes of shredded documents home, intending=
 to use them as packing material in a move to a more affordable house. She =
gave Lerach's team the spindly documents, which Howes said were clearly mar=
ked as related to debt-laden partnerships that fueled the company's downfal=
l.=20
"Enron's communications with its employees were very clear on the destructi=
on of documents, and any breach of the company's policy will be dealt with =
swiftly and severely," the company said. "Enron has been cooperating fully =
with congressional investigators and handed over to various government inve=
stigators 41 boxes of documents and materials."=20
Drowning in a sea of exposed questionable accounting methods, massive third=
-quarter losses and elimination of millions in profits since 1997 with rest=
ated earnings, Enron on Dec. 2 filed the largest bankruptcy in history.=20
Lerach's firm last month sued current and former top Enron executives and b=
oard members who sold $1.1 billion in stock from October 1998 through Novem=
ber last year, just before the company imploded.=20
The lawsuit differs from more than 60 filed on behalf of shareholders and i=
nvestors across the country because it names only the individuals as defend=
ants, not Enron Corp. Suits targeting the company are on hold until the ban=
kruptcy is resolved in a Manhattan court.=20
The suit alleges the defendants, including Enron chairman Ken Lay and Texas=
 Sen. Phil Gramm's wife, Enron board member Wendy Gramm, engaged in a three=
-year pattern of fraud and deception that caused Enron shares to fall from =
a high of about $80 a year ago to less than a dollar.=20
Amalgamated Bank, the lead plaintiff, claims it lost more than $10 million =
in the meltdown, and the suit is seeking $25 billion in damages. Pension fu=
nds for several states have joined the suit since it was filed.

Lawyers Ask Houston Crt Order To Stop Enron `Tampering'

01/22/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--Lawyers suing Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) say a massive number of =
company documents were shredded in the face of a federal investigation and =
want a court to step in to prevent more tampering.=20
"It was a major accounting fraud and now they have been caught destroying t=
he evidence," attorney William Lerach said Tuesday on NBC's "Today." "I'd s=
ay they've got trouble on their hands."
Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, said the company to=
ld employees after coming under investigation that they were not to destroy=
 relevant documents. He said the company is looking into charges papers wer=
e destroyed despite that directive.=20
Lerach told the Associated Press the shredding was "open and notorious and =
widespread," consuming "hundreds of thousands of documents" and taking plac=
e even on Christmas Day.=20
Former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda said on morning talk shows Tuesday=
 that the shredding began after Thanksgiving on the 19th floor accounting o=
ffice of the company's Houston headquarters and continued at least until th=
e middle of this month.=20
Lerach was bringing some of the shredded documents to federal court Tuesday=
 to seek court custody of relevant Enron papers, as part of a class-action =
lawsuit against the company by aggrieved investors.=20
"We're going to ask the court to take extraordinary measures...to prevent a=
ny further tampering or destruction," he said on ABC's "Good Morning Americ=
a."=20
"It may be necessary that we put a U.S. marshal or someone on the premises.=
"=20
The reported shredding follows revelations over the past two weeks about do=
cument destruction at Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor.=20
Another attorney in the lawsuit, G. Paul Howes, said in court papers that s=
ome of papers destroyed at Enron headquarters were marked Jedi II and Chewc=
o - partnerships through which the energy giant concealed hundreds of milli=
ons of dollars in debts.=20
The partnerships, described by lawmakers as slick financial gimmicks, helpe=
d drive the company into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron's accountin=
g practices in mid-October, after the company reported more than $600 milli=
on in third-quarter losses, and a congressional committee began asking for =
documents in mid-December. The SEC opened a formal investigation at the end=
 of October, including demands for financial documents from Enron and Ander=
sen.=20
Enron said in a statement late Monday that it had issued four e-mails from =
Oct. 25 to Jan. 14 warning employees against destroying documents, specific=
ally those related to Enron's complex web of partnerships.=20
"We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of docu=
ments," Bennett said.=20
Bennett said anyone who violated directives against destroying documents "w=
ill be dealt with appropriately."=20
Castaneda, who was laid off last week, said she did not know who ordered em=
ployees to do the shredding. "I think they were just doing what they were t=
old," she said.=20
She said she brought shredded paper home to use as packing material.=20
The Justice Department announced on Jan. 9 that it was pursuing a criminal =
investigation of Enron, which entered the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. histor=
y on Dec. 2 following a six-week downward spiral.=20
Andersen last week fired its lead Enron auditor for destroying Enron-relate=
d documents. The auditor, David Duncan, has told congressional investigator=
s he was just following the advice of Andersen's legal department when he d=
irected the shredding.=20
Lawyers for Duncan have been seeking to delay his public testimony, schedul=
ed for Thursday before the investigative panel of the House Energy and Comm=
erce Committee, saying Duncan needs more time to prepare.=20
But Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., the subcommittee's chairman, rejected the re=
quest, arguing that Duncan "doesn't really need to recall every detail of w=
hat he did for Enron. We're focused on the destruction of documents. We'll =
subpoena him if we have to."=20
Said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee: "T=
his whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute, and we're determ=
ined to get to the bottom of it. ... Making bad business decisions is one t=
hing, but trying to cover up bad business decisions is another."

WASHINGTON - Enron is looking into the reported destruction of documents th=

In an on-air interview with ABC News, a former Enron executive, identified =
as Maureen Castaneda, said the shredding of documents took place in an acco=
unting office on the 19th floor.
Castaneda displayed one box of the shredded material which "I got . . . whe=

Castaneda said the destruction began after Thanksgiving. "I left the second=
 week of January and the shredding was going on until I left. And I have no=
 idea if it continues." Castaneda was identified as a director in the forei=

REPORT: ENRON KEPT ON SHREDDING ; FORMER EXECUTIVE: SUBPOENAS IGNORED

WASHINGTON -- A former Enron Corp. executive said Monday that company docum=
ents were destroyed at its Houston headquarters even after the federal gove=
rnment issued subpoenas for the bankrupt company's records last fall.=20
The startling accusation of document shredding prompted Enron's attorney, R=
obert Bennett, to say that the company would immediately look into the alle=
gation made by former executive Maureen Castaneda in an ABC News interview.
Displaying a box of shredded material, Castaneda, identified by ABC as the =
former director of Enron's foreign-investments section, said the document d=
estruction began after Thanksgiving and continued as late as last week in t=
he 19th-floor accounting office of the company's Houston headquarters.=20
She said she got the box of paper to use for packing material and that ther=
e were "a lot more" boxes like the one she showed on the air.=20
Federal authorities and congressional committees are already investigating =
the shredding of documents by Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in conn=
ection with Enron's failure. The revelations that Enron may have done the s=
ame thing added a new dimension to the burgeoning scandal.=20
"It's one thing to make bad business decisions; it's another thing to cover=
 up bad business decisions," said Ken Johnson, spokesman for Rep. Billy Tau=
zin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the=
 panels investigating the firm. "If it's true, this is an even bigger mess =
than we thought."=20
Johnson said the committee undoubtedly would look into the new allegation a=
nd probably call Castaneda to testify. Meanwhile, the panel will hold a ses=
sion Thursday to hear evidence on the shredding of documents at Andersen, a=
nd is threatening to force a former Andersen auditor, David Duncan, to test=
ify. Duncan has sought a postponement.=20
Castaneda told ABC she found shredded paper with references to some of Enro=
n's controversial businesses partnerships, such as "Jedi," which the firm u=
sed to hide millions of dollars in debt.=20
"A lot are accounting documents," she added. "You can tell because of the c=
olors yellow and pink."=20
"I left the second week of January, and the shredding was going on until th=
e day I left, and I have no idea if it continues," said Castaneda.=20
Bennett issued a statement after the broadcast, saying that "we are investi=
gating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documents. In Octob=
er, the company issued several directives to all Enron employees worldwide =
that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigat=
ion. If anyone violated these directives, they will be dealt with appropria=
tely."=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating Enron in mid-Oct=
ober and this month the Justice Department said it had opened a criminal in=
vestigation. Other federal agencies are looking into various aspects of Enr=
on's collapse.=20
The shredding of documents also is becoming a major issue in a suit against=
 Enron's board and its officers. William Lerach, attorney for plaintiffs wh=
o have sued the firm's board and its officers, said he plans to take the bo=
x of shredded documents to federal court, according to The Associated Press=
.=20
"They even shredded on Christmas Day," Lerach said.

Manager Says Enron Shredded Documents; Probe Allegedly Was Already Underway

An Enron project manager has told attorneys suing the company that she saw =
evidence of widespread shredding of documents at Enron Corp.'s Houston head=
quarters, beginning after the start of a former federal securities investig=
ation was announced Oct. 31 last year.=20
Maureen Castenada, a manager in Enron's foreign-investments section who was=
 laid off in mid-January, said the names of outside partnerships that are a=
t the center of ongoing investigations of Enron are legible on scraps of sh=
redded paper. The shredding took place inside offices on the 19th floor of =
the headquarters building, where she worked, she said.
Castenada's allegations are contained in a sworn affidavit by attorney G. P=
aul Howes, whose firm is suing Enron's top officials and directors on behal=
f of Enron shareholders and investors whose retirement savings were devasta=
ted by the company collapse and bankruptcy filing in December. She repeated=
 the allegations in an interview yesterday on ABC News.=20
Howes said that according to Castenada, boxes of documents from throughout =
Enron's headquarters were gathered on the 19th floor beginning about Thanks=
giving. She said she saw Enron employees going through the boxes' contents =
page by page and removing documents, Howes's account states.=20
At the end of the day, trash bags and boxes full of shredded documents were=
 stacked up in the hallway, she said, adding that the shredding was continu=
ing as recently as the second week of January.=20
One scrap described a division of revenue between Enron and one of the off-=
balance-sheet entities the company created named Raptor, attorneys said.=20
"We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of docu=
ments," Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett, who is representing Enron, s=
aid in a statement.=20
"In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron employe=
es worldwide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pe=
nding litigation," Bennett added. "If anyone violated those directives, the=
y will be dealt with appropriately."=20
Enron reported on Oct. 22 that the Securities and Exchange Commission had b=
egun an inquiry into the company's financial dealings. A week later, the SE=
C upgraded the probe to a formal investigation.=20
The destruction of documents by Enron's outside accounting firm, Arthur And=
ersen, already is a key issue for investigators. Andersen fired David B. Du=
ncan, its top Houston auditor on the Enron account, last week after learnin=
g he ordered the shredding of documents related to the Enron audit.=20
Attorney William Lerach, a senior partner in Howes' firm, said last night t=
hat he will take a box of shredded material obtained by Castenada into fede=
ral court in Houston today to back up his demand that relevant Enron docume=
nts be put under the court's control.=20
"You just have to conclude, based on what we know to date, this was a delib=
erate, coordinated effort to destroy evidence," Lerach said.=20
Castenada told ABC News she could tell that a lot of the shredded papers we=
re once accounting documents. "You can tell because of the colors -- yellow=
 and pink," she said. She took one box of shredded paper away with her to g=
ive to attorneys. "There were . . . a lot more than this," she said.=20
Congressional investigators said yesterday that they are still negotiating =
with Duncan's attorney to secure his testimony at a hearing on the document=
 destruction at Andersen scheduled for Thursday before the House Energy and=
 Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee.=20
Duncan's lawyers sought to delay his public testimony, arguing that Duncan =
needs more time to prepare.=20
The subcommittee chairman, Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), turned down tha=
t request. He said the committee will subpoena Duncan if necessary.=20
Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, appearing Sunday on NBC's =
"Meet the Press," criticized Duncan and defended Andersen attorney Nancy Te=
mple, who sent an Oct. 12 e-mail to Andersen's Houston office as a reminder=
 of the firm's document-destruction policy.=20
Berardino said Duncan displayed "at the least . . . extremely poor judgment=
" for his part in destroying the documents in October and November. He said=
 Temple sent the reminder "because accountants are pack rats. . . . We save=
 lots of stuff that's not relevant."=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The former executive who first disclosed document-sh=
redding at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) said Tuesday that she hadn't informed her su=
periors because her previous warnings about risky deals had fallen on "deaf=
 ears."=20
Interviewed on ABC's "Good Morning America," Maureen Castaneda said she did=
n't know the names of those who had shredded the documents and didn't know =
who had ordered the shredding.
Castaneda, former Enron director for foreign exchange and risk management, =

seen a lot" over the past three years - "things that weren't forthright."=
=20
She referred to deals that she called "incredibly risky," citing countries =
that she said "nobody in the world would lend capital to" but where Enron d=
evelopers wanted to go into.=20
Castaneda, who was separated from Enron earlier this month, said she had se=
en "accountants" looking through documents after Thanksgiving on her way to=
 her office on the 19th floor, which housed the accounting and research dep=
artments.=20
Repeating remarks to ABC on Monday evening, Castaneda said she realized wha=

JACK CAFFERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The other big story, of course, new accus=
ations of document shredding at Enron have surfaced just as a federal judge=
 in Houston is set to hold hearings this morning on an injunction to get ac=
counting firm Arthur Andersen to stop destroying Enron related documents.
According to a former Enron employee, documents were being systematically s=
hredded at the company as late as last week. Maureen Castaneda, who's part =
of a shareholder lawsuit against Enron, told ABC News the shredding began i=
n late October after the SEC began their investigation into the company's a=
ccounting practices.=20
CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now with more in a live report from Houston -- =
Ed.=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Jack.=20
The attorneys in this case sat down with reporters late last night inside a=
 19th floor posh downtown Houston hotel room, showing off what they say are=
 those shredded documents that Maureen Castaneda witnessed being shredded i=
nside the Enron building. They say that over the last 12 weeks they've talk=
ed with several dozen witnesses here at Enron who say that they did witness=
 this shredding of documents in the finance and accounting department. Maur=
een Castaneda worked in an office just across the hallway from this departm=
ent.=20
They say the shredding started heavily after Thanksgiving and it continued =
in through Christmas and into, as you said, last week. And this, of course,=
 if this indeed is true, happened well after the federal investigators star=
ted taking over in this case and issued subpoenas in efforts to claim much =
of these documents.=20
Enron spokespeople say that they have issued several e-mails telling all em=
ployees not to tamper with any documents whatsoever and to preserve every m=
aterial that they can get their hands on, as well. But the attorneys in thi=
s case aren't convinced by what Enron is saying.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is an absolute smoking gun. You've got, the auditor s=
aid we destroyed thousands of pages of documents. They've admitted that. Th=
e company now can't get around the fact that in the face of three directive=
s not to do it, personnel were directed to do it because the personnel that=
 were doing this clearly wouldn't have acted unilaterally.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
LAVANDERA: We spent some time last night looking at some of those shredded =
documents and trying to find any kind of evidence ourselves. The attorneys =
say that in many of these slices of paper that you can see the names of Rap=
tor and Jedi, which, of course, are the names of these partnerships that ha=
ve become infamous for bringing down Enron.=20
We were only able to find one slip of paper that had Raptor on it, but they=
, indeed, say that this is the only box that they do have but that they do =
fear that hundreds of thousands of documents, there are witnesses that say =
that they saw this as a systematic shredding of documents over the course o=

Enron Claims to Fire Andersen as Auditor.

01/22/2002
The Oil Daily
(c) 2002 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

Enron tried to restore some of its badly tarnished image late last week by =
claiming to fire outside auditor Andersen for destroying Enron financial do=
cuments.=20
The firing, however, is about as credible as Capt. Louis Renault's statemen=
t in the classic movie Casablanca that he was "shocked" to learn that gambl=
ing was taking place in Rick's Cafe Americain, just as he was handed his ev=
ening's winnings.
In fact, the relationship with Andersen terminated last month after Enron m=
ade its Chapter 11 filing in the US Bankruptcy Court (OD Dec.4,p1). Bankrup=
tcy rules require that a new auditor be named, so Andersen has been out for=
 more than a month.=20
Still, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay indicated that the pr=
oblems at Andersen were news to him and that action on the matter couldn't =
await the outcome of an internal investigation the company initiated in lat=
e October.=20
"While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until =
the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in=
 light of recent events," he said in a statement.=20
Andersen disclosed on Tuesday that employees had shredded some paper docume=
nts and deleted electronic files after it was aware of a Securities and Exc=
hange Commission investigation of Enron (OD Jan.16,p1). The company fired t=
he head of the Enron account in its Houston office, put three others on adm=
inistrative leave, and demoted another four executives.=20
The fired auditor, David Duncan, apparently doesn't plan to fall on his swo=
rd to protect others. He was already talking to the US House Committee on E=
nergy and Commerce before his termination by Andersen and continued his tes=
timony in what a committee spokesman described as a cooperative manner.=20
Enron's shares continue to be traded actively in the over-the-counter marke=
t since going off the New York Stock Exchange last week. Shares now are lis=
ted in the National Quotation Bureau "Pink Sheets." The price has ranged be=
tween 22? and 57.5? since making the move.=20
"This is purely a penny stock now," said analyst John Olson of Sanders, Mor=
ris, Harris in Houston. He said he is becoming less confident that UBS Warb=
urg can resurrect the company's trading business soon enough to satisfy Enr=
on's multitude of creditors and salvage any vestige of the company.=20
Olson noted that Enron owes about $15 billion just to banks and has another=
 $19 billion in derivative exposure - and creditors will want whatever they=
 can get as soon as possible.=20
Another regulatory figure walked the plank last Friday after admitting to a=
n Enron taint. Max Yzaguirre, who once headed Enron's operations in Mexico =
and served in other Enron jobs, resigned as chair of the Texas Public Utili=
ty Commission.=20
Yzaguirre succeeded Pat Wood, now chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Co=
mmission, last summer.=20

SMARTMONEY.COM: Special Report: The Enron Papers
By Matthew Goldstein

01/21/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of SMARTMONEY.COM=20
(This report was first published late Friday.)=20

MANY VOICES on Wall Street have professed bafflement at the sudden collapse=
 of Enron (ENRNQ). According to the many investment bankers and trading par=
tners who did business with the company, the commercial banks that lent it =
money, and the securities analysts who followed it, the accounting maneuver=
s Enron allegedly used to inflate its profits and hide its debts were so co=
mplex and so hidden from view that no one could have foreseen the outcome.
It turns out, however, that some of the biggest names in American finance w=
ere active participants in Enron's strategy. SmartMoney.com has obtained a =
number of financial documents and partnership records related to LJM2 Co-In=
vestment partnership, one of the key entities relied on by Enron. The docum=
ents - four books altogether measuring more than two inches high - reveal t=
hat a virtual Who's Who of financial institutions invested in the $394 mill=
ion fund established in 1999 by former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew=
 Fastow. The documents provide a breakout of the estimated rates of return =
on the more than a dozen investments made by LJM2. They even offer an expla=
nation for how those mysterious Raptors worked - the subsidiaries LJM2 esta=
blished to carry on hedging activities with Enron. We're making selections =
from the documents available for download in PDF format.=20
The documents make one thing clear: LJM2 was anything but an arm's-length e=
ntity for Enron - as it would've had to be for Enron's accounting treatment=
 of it to have been legitimate. "The Partnership expects that Enron will be=
 the Partnership's primary source of investment opportunities and that the =
Partnership will co-invest with Enron," according to one document. As the d=
ocuments state, the partnership was created and managed by then-CFO Fastow =
and was "focused on acquiring energy and communications assets primarily ow=
ned by Enron." And while Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive w=
ho suddenly resigned last August, told the New York Times in December that =
he didn't have many details about partnerships like LJM2, the records show =
Skilling was a guest speaker at LJM2's annual partnership meeting on Oct. 2=
6, 2000.=20
Some highlights from the documents:=20
"LJM Rationale": LJM2 was formed in October 1999 with the stated goal of ac=
quiring assets primarily owned by Enron and generating a 30% average annual=
 return for its limited-partner investors. Why focus on Enron assets? The d=
ocuments explain that some of those assets were diluting Enron's earnings a=
nd harming the ratios on which its credit ratings were based. It wanted to =
"deconsolidate" those assets and "create structures which accelerate projec=
ted earnings and cash flows."=20
A selling point to potential investors in LJM2: "The Partnership expects to=
 benefit from having the opportunity to invest in Enron-generated investmen=
t opportunities that would not be available otherwise to outside investors.=
"=20
Investors: The papers contain a partial list of the biggest companies and f=
inancial institutions that are known to have invested in LJM2, either direc=
tly, through subsidiaries or on behalf of third parties: American Internati=
onal Group (AIG), AON (AOC), Citigroup (C), CIBC, Credit Suisse First Bosto=
n, Dresdner Bank, General Electric (GE), J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), Lehman Br=
others (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MWD), Merrill Lynch (MER) and Wachovia Bank (=
WB).=20
Smaller institutional investors were also involved, including pension funds=
 and private equity funds. These included Aero Capital, Alpine Investment P=
artners, C&I Partners, Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, Fort Washington Private Eq=
uity, Freidenrich Family Trust (associated with Bay Partners, a big Califor=
nia venture-capital firm), Lakeview Capital Management, Mousse Partners, Rh=
o Management, the State of Arkansas Teachers Retirement Fund, Ulysses Partn=
ers and Weyerhaeuser Employee Retirement Trust (WY).=20
LJM2 Key Employees: As of early 2000, LJM2 was being managed by Fastow; Mic=
hael Kopper, former managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Grou=
p; and Kathy Lynn, a former Enron vice president. Fastow, during his tenure=
 at LJM2, earned roughly $30 million in management fees.=20
Advisers: The partnership employed Big Five accounting firm Pricewaterhouse=
Coopers and Chicago-based law firm Kirkland & Ellis, where Whitewater prose=
cutor Kenneth Starr is a partner.=20
Bankers: Two banks were LJM2's main lenders: Chase Manhattan Bank, part of =
J.P. Morgan Chase, and Germany's Dresdner Bank, a division of Dresdner Klei=
nwort Wasserstein. On Nov. 30, 2001, just days before Enron would file for =
bankruptcy, Dresdner Bank sent LJM2 a letter informing it that it had defau=
lted on a provision of its loan agreement.=20
Working Capital: As of April 2000, LJM2 had raised $394 million. Of that am=
ount, 42% came from top-rated financial institutions and insurance companie=
s, 36% was invested by individuals and private equity funds and the remaini=
ng 22% came from employee pension funds. The value of the assets held by th=
e partnership as of Sept. 30, was $156 million, down 39% from Dec. 31, 2000=
.=20
Investments: LJM2 invested in a total of 23 investments - most of them invo=
lving Enron-related entities - with odd-sounding names like Bobcat, Osprey =
Trust, Apex, Rawhide and Talon. The five biggest investments were: NewPower=
 Holdings (NPW), $50 million; Bobcat I, $30 million; Osprey Trust, $26 mill=
ion; Apex, $25 million and Zenith Telecom Trust, $21 million.=20
NewPower is a deregulated electrical power company that Enron spun off in O=
ctober 2000. Bobcat is a so-called special entity, like the Raptors that En=
ron and LJM2 used to hedge investments. Osprey Trust is an investment vehic=
le set up by Enron and another limited partnership, Whitewing, which sold $=
1.4 billion in corporate bonds. Apex is a collaterized loan obligation - a =
derivative security whose underlying instrument is a commercial loan - that=
 LJM2 has with First Union, which since has been acquired by Wachovia Bank.=
 Zenith is one of the few non-Enron investments made by LJM2. It was an inv=
estment in an off-balance-sheet partnership established by TXU (TXU) called=
 Pinnacle One Partners.=20
The Raptors: These are a structured finance vehicle - usually capitalized w=
ith Enron stock and an investment from LJM2 - that enters into derivative, =
or hedging, transactions all designed to reduce the risk associated with En=
ron's own investment portfolio. There were at least six Raptors created by =
LJM2. The Raptors helped manage the impact of price volatility of Enron's s=
tock investments by purchasing put and call options on those shares. (A cal=
l option is a bet a stock will rise in price, while a put option is a bet i=
t will fall.) But the Raptors posed a problem if Enron's stock dropped belo=
w $48 a share - something that first occurred in early August, around the t=
ime Skilling suddenly resigned. In the event of such a drop, Enron would ha=
ve to give the Raptors more of its stock in an attempt to keep them solvent=
, and this would be potentially dilutive to the stock.=20

SMARTMONEY.COM: The Spreading Enron Stain

Of SMARTMONEY.COM=20
(This report was first published late Friday.)=20

ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, my editor and I got together to think of a fresh wa=
y to approach the Enron (ENRNQ) scandal for my column this week. We wanted =
to try to offer investors some guidance as the sordid details of Enron's of=
f-balance-sheet activities continue to unfold.
I decided that I would argue that while the Enron blowup is a shocking exam=
ple of greed, cunning and guile, it was an isolated incident. The underpinn=
ings of our financial system are still fundamentally sound.=20
Now, I'm not so sure.=20
It's true that Enron was unlike any company that makes its living - or a bi=
g chunk of it - in the derivatives markets. Derivatives? Wasn't Enron prima=
rily an energy trader? Yes, but many energy trades involve forward sales (a=
kin to futures) and options. And Enron dealt in dozens of other, more exoti=
c derivatives markets, from credit to weather to advertising. Derivatives w=
ere a bigger part of Enron's revenue stream than they are at any other publ=
icly traded company that deals in them, even powerhouses like Goldman Sachs=
 (GS), Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Morgan Stanley (MWD).=20
Yet Enron didn't resemble other derivatives dealers in the least. Wall Stre=
et firms that are active in these highly sophisticated, highly lucrative an=
d highly risky markets have elaborate risk-management systems in place to p=
revent Enron-like disasters from happening. Ever notice that most of the de=
rivatives blowups you've heard about in the past - from Orange County to Pr=
octer & Gamble (PG) to Gibson Greetings - involved relatively unsophisticat=
ed investors being burned by Wall Street bandits? (The delicate term for th=
at on the Street is ripping someone's face off.) Yes, Barings Bank and Kidd=
er Peabody were brought down by derivatives - but those cases involved rogu=
e traders circumventing their company's risk-management systems for fun and=
 profit. Because derivatives can blow up in their faces, dealers pay slavis=
h attention to the risk they undertake. Risk managers are some of the best-=
paid people on Wall Street. Their job is to keep their companies from going=
 boom - and by and large, they succeed.=20
Some years ago, as scandals started becoming more common, derivatives becam=
e something of a four-letter word. Wall Street came up with an ingenious fi=
x, one that just happened to add some safety to the derivatives world: In t=
he early 1990s, dealers began creating AAA-rated offshore subsidiaries that=
 do some of their bidding for them. (No big investment bank carries that ra=
ting, or anything close.) To get those ratings, the subs had to be incredib=
ly well capitalized and maintain impeccable books. That helped allay certai=
n nervous counterparties, as well as institutional investors permitted to d=
eal only with triple-A-rated entities. Even in the unlikely event that, say=
, Goldman Sachs imploded, its triple-A sub would still have the cash on han=
d to settle its bets, which often mature far into the future. Nowadays, big=
 banks and insurers often have several of these entities. And that helps th=
em lower their overall risk profiles. Everyone wins: The corporate trader g=
ets to deal with a safer partner, while the bank's positions, on an aggrega=
te level, are less risky. In the derivatives world, subsidiaries exist sole=
ly in the service of the corporate parent.=20
Enron was an entirely different story. While many of the infamous LJM partn=
erships engineered and managed by Andrew Fastow, Enron's then-chief financi=
al officer, were set up to help Enron manage its risk, they were woefully u=
ndercapitalized, and ended up adding to Enron's aggregate risk rather than =
mitigating it. Many of the special-purpose vehicles Enron created were capi=
talized largely through Enron's own equity. When Enron's stock price fell b=
elow certain levels, that triggered huge equity payments to the private ent=
ities. The result: The entities that were set up to help Enron manage its r=
isk exposed Enron's shareholders to even more risk because of the trigger m=
echanisms. Rather than serving the company proper, they ultimately destroye=
d it. Credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's calls such trigger deals "insi=
dious."=20
The question is, was Enron so unique? On Dec. 20, S&P said that four energy=
 traders in particular - NRG Energy (NRG), PG&E National Energy Group (PCG)=
, TXU (TXU) and Williams (WMB) - faced the possibility of damaging trigger =
deals. Dynegy (DYN) and Calpine (CPN) decided to raise cash to shore up the=
ir balance sheets after Enron blew up. Were they frightened by what newly s=
keptical investors might find in their income statements? While there's no =
evidence of Enron-like shenanigans at any of these companies, the existence=
 of equity-diluting trigger deals is troubling.=20
Before Friday, I thought it unfair to tar other companies because of what h=
appened at Enron. Then I saw a document obtained by Staff Editor Matthew Go=
ldstein that undermined many of my assumptions about the case. When Enron w=
as unraveling, the story being told on Wall Street was that no one knew wha=
t was going on, and that, in any event, Enron's depravity existed in a vacu=
um. Now I know that isn't true.=20
According to LJM2 partnership documents from 2000, the cast of characters i=
nvolved in Enron's off-balance-sheet activities is much bigger than previou=
sly thought. Limited partners included Chase Capital, G.E. Capital, J.P. Mo=
rgan Capital, Merrill Lynch (MER), Dresdner Bank, AON, Credit Suisse First =
Boston, Morgan Stanley and First Union Investors, an all-star list of Wall =
Street insiders. Given the porous walls separating equity research from inv=
estment-banking operations, the suggestion that analysts at these firms kne=
w nothing about the LJM partnerships before they blew up simply isn't credi=
ble. On Oct. 22, the day Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission was inquiring about its third-party transactions, CSFB maintained=
 its Strong Buy rating. Were analysts trying to keep Enron's stock high eno=
ugh to prevent other trigger events?=20
Equally troubling, those documents revealed that LJM2's auditor was Pricewa=
terhouseCoopers. That means that at least two of the Big Five accounting fi=
rms had intimate knowledge of the goings on inside Enron or its outside par=
tnerships. (Arthur Andersen was Enron's auditor.) The implications of all o=
f this for the U.S. accounting system are staggering. Enron's off-balance-s=
heet activities weren't the mystery they've been portrayed to be.=20
And that, unfortunately, leads me to wonder how many other Enron-like disas=
ters are lurking in the shadows of corporate America. What's striking is ho=
w long Enron was able to get away with these transgressions without someone=
 blowing the whistle. People at Wall Street's biggest firms had intimate kn=
owledge of these dealings, yet no one said a word. When Jeffrey Skilling, E=
nron's then-CEO, resigned in early August once Enron's stock fell below the=
 trigger level for at least two LJM2 entities - Raptor and Osprey - no one =
said a word. When Enron wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in Oc=
tober, no one said a word. Wall Street can keep a secret far better than an=
yone could have imagined.=20
How many other secrets is it keeping?=20

Worker's concerns about Enron accounting brushed aside
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - A former Enron Corp. manager fired for using a company compu=
ter to post negative messages about his employer on the Internet believed h=
e and his colleagues were misled when Chairman Kenneth Lay touted the stock=
 three weeks before the company began to implode, an attorney representing =
laid off workers said.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington attorney who is representing employees in a =
class-action lawsuit against Enron, said the former manager, Clayton Vernon=
 of Houston, "deeply regrets the circumstances of his departure from Enron.
"He was a loyal employee who believed he and his fellow employees were misl=
ed by the company's top executives and its outside accountants and outside =
legal counsel," Gottesdiener said Monday.=20
Vernon joined Enron in 1999 as a designer of computer-based models to help =
gauge value of Enron's energy trades. During an in-house online chat on Sep=
t. 26 last year, Lay brushed aside Vernon's question about the company's ag=
gressive accounting practices.=20
Vernon inquired about partnerships that allowed Enron to keep millions of d=
ollars in debt off its books while paying millions in fees to executives wh=
o ran them.=20
Lay assured employees participating in the electronic discussion that he or=
 Enron's board of directors wouldn't approve such partnerships or other fin=
ancial vehicles unless convinced by internal officers and then-outside audi=
tor, Arthur Andersen, that they were legal and appropriate.=20
Lay encouraged employees to buy Enron stock and assured them that the compa=
ny's finances and books were in solid shape.=20
"The third quarter is looking great," Lay said. Three weeks later, Enron an=
nounced a $618 million third-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in s=
hareholder equity.=20
Vernon told the New York Times in Monday's editions that he was fired Nov. =
20, the day after posting a message on a Yahoo! message board that criticiz=
ed Lay, calling the chairman "the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been=
 associated with." He was at work and posted the message using an Enron com=
puter.=20
Vernon told the Times that he had no argument over his termination because =
it violated company policy.=20
Vernon, through Gottesdiener, declined to talk to The Associated Press on M=
onday. The attorney said Vernon had a positive annual evaluation last Octob=
er in which his supervisors called him a dedicated employee who was serious=
 about making Enron a successful company.=20
"Clayton Vernon strove to be a model employee," Gottesdiener said.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer declined comment on Vernon's firing because it =
was a personnel issue. He said Enron "absolutely" has a strict policy prohi=
biting personal use of company computers.=20
Palmer said Enron hasn't held any similar internal online discussions since=
 4,500 of 7,500 employees were laid off from the company's Houston headquar=
ters on Dec. 3, the day after Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in history=
. No one among the remaining 3,000 workers is available to operate the elec=
tronic platform used for those chats, Palmer said.=20
"We've also been very busy trying to bring the company out of bankruptcy," =
he said.

Attorneys for Enron Corp. shareholders and workers, who lost billions of do=
llars when the company collapsed late last year, allege that Enron created =
complex, largely hidden financing structures to inflate its revenue and pro=
fit, hide debt from view, delay reporting losses and enrich some executives=
 who ran them.=20
Documents describing one of the largest such structures -- a partnership ca=
lled Whitewing, established by Enron and a still-unidentified party -- illu=
strate how Enron favored outside investors while not fully informing shareh=
olders of billions of dollars of potential liabilities.
The Whitewing arrangement is disclosed in a confidential, 100-page offering=
 to private investors in September 2000 obtained by The Washington Post. Th=
e document describes a process that Enron regularly used to finance growth =
without adding directly to the corporate debt shown on its books. In Novemb=
er, Enron valued Whitewing's assets at $4.7 billion, but some Enron officia=
ls say that figure is significantly exaggerated.=20
Off-balance-sheet transactions are used by many companies. Federal and cong=
ressional investigations into Enron's collapse are trying to determine whet=
her Enron used its labyrinth of partnership structures to hide key informat=
ion about its financial condition.=20
Whitewing's role was to buy an assortment of power plants, pipelines and wa=
ter projects in India, Turkey, Spain and Latin America that Enron had snapp=
ed up through the mid-1990s, when the Houston company was set on becoming a=
 global energy supplier.=20
By 1999, Enron President Jeffrey K. Skilling was refocusing the company as =
a global broker of energy, a trader of financial contracts rather than an o=
perator of energy facilities.=20
Whitewing was responsible for reselling the assets. But Enron also guarante=
ed Whitewing's investors that if the power plants and other assets were sol=
d at a loss, Enron would make up the difference with shares of its common s=
tock, or cash if necessary. As of November, that requirement stood at more =
than $2 billion -- a $2 billion obligation that shareholders didn't know ab=
out.=20
A part of that hidden guarantee to Whitewing investors surfaced suddenly in=
 October, after Enron's credit rating was dropped to near junk-bond level b=
y rating agencies. That triggered a requirement that Enron immediately pay =
$690 million of its obligations to Whitewing. Enron was able to delay the p=
ayment but had to disclose the problem, stunning investors and feeding the =
loss of confidence that led to the company's bankruptcy filing.=20
Such arrangements were "designed to give the safer return to the outside in=
vestors and put substantially more risk on the [Enron] shareholders," said =
Clayton Vernon, an economist and manager at Enron who was fired by Enron af=
ter he wrote an e-mail criticizing Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in October=
.=20
From an accounting and a public-disclosure standpoint, the arrangement was =
"indefensible," said Vernon, who is among the former employees suing Enron.=
=20
Whitewing was the center of an aviary of entities with bird names -- Osprey=
, Condor, Egret, Peregrine and Blue Heron were all linked to Whitewing.=20
Many of the hundreds of other Enron-related partnerships were clustered tog=
ether to carry out different parts of billion-dollar financing deals and gi=
ven colorful but unrevealing names. Jedi, Chewco, Obi and Kenobi Inc. follo=
wed a Star Wars theme. Rawhide, Cactus, Sundance, Ponderosa and Mojave had =
a Western flavor.=20
Whitewing was formed in 1997 as an Enron subsidiary. In 1999 Enron decided =
to move Whitewing off its books, which it accomplished by giving half of th=
e partnership's control to an unnamed investor.=20
The arrangement allowed Enron to escape reporting losses on some assets tha=
t were no longer worth what Enron had originally paid for them, according t=
o some company officials. Such losses would have hurt Enron's stock price, =
which soared to as high as $90 a share when investors believed Enron was su=
cceeding in its shift to becoming a trading firm.=20
In her August letter warning Lay about "accounting scandals," Enron Vice Pr=
esident Sherron Watkins cited "valuation issues with our international asse=
ts" that could be written down in future financial reports.=20
Enron will have to "pony up stock" to Whitewing in 2003, she said, "and tha=
t won't go unnoticed."=20
Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy Inc., whose executives=
 had a brief inside view of Enron during the time his company was consideri=
ng purchasing its Houston rival in November, said in an interview, "All the=
ir trouble was on [the] assets they had gotten into. There were 11 major bu=
sinesses or assets around the world, none of which were performing at the l=
evel that they bought the asset [for].=20
"Then trying to finance those, get them off the balance sheet with some cre=
ative financial tools -- that's come into question."=20
The benefits Enron officials sometimes received from the outside entities d=
isturbed Watson. "You have individuals [at Enron] who actually profit from =
doing these things. That's another level of being out of bounds," Watson sa=
id.=20
Enron officials have declined to discuss specifics about Whitewing beyond w=
hat was disclosed in a filing to regulators in November.=20
The September 2000 partnership document was distributed to U.S. and foreign=
 investors to raise an additional $1.1 billion for Whitewing.=20
The outline of the structure was this:=20
Whitewing was owned jointly by Enron and an unnamed partner. Whitewing borr=
owed the $1.1 billion from private investors in the United States and Europ=
e. The investors received interest-bearing notes from a trust named Osprey,=
 controlled by Whitewing.=20
Whitewing split its revenue between Enron and the other unnamed Whitewing p=
artner. Enron received revenue of $632 million in 2000 and $192 million in =
1999 from Whitewing, Enron's recent filings show.=20
To protect the Osprey investors, whose notes had to be repaid in 2003, the =
offering memo said Enron would contribute shares of common stock to make up=
 a shortfall if Whitewing assets dropped in value.=20
If the Enron shares could not be sold because of stock market conditions or=
 regulatory delays, Enron promised to cover the investors' losses with cash=
.=20
Adding another layer of complexity, Enron created an entity called Condor, =
under Whitewing, to hold a special kind of Enron security that would be con=
verted into shares of Enron common stock if needed to cover the obligation =
to Osprey investors.=20
The most Enron disclosed about Whitewing was in a footnote in its 1999 annu=
al report. It said Enron "could be obligated" to issue shares of common sto=
ck under certain circumstances, which it did not explain.=20
The private-offering memo "prohibits" prospective investors from copying th=
e document or disclosing its terms. The offering was managed by the New Yor=
k firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities -- now part of Credit Suisse=
 First Boston -- Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank and UBS Warburg LLC as co-m=
anagers.=20
Credit Suisse spokesman Pen Pendleton said he could not comment on the tran=
saction because of confidentiality commitments to clients. "This transactio=
n was a private placement," he said. The other three institutions also decl=
ined comment.=20
Investment officials of these firms could not share the offering contents w=
ith analysts at their firms who were advising the public on whether to buy =
or sell Enron stock.=20
Enron advised the Osprey investors -- but not its public shareholders -- th=
at Enron indirectly controlled Whitewing and thus its executives had "signi=
ficant influence" over Whitewing, including decisions on which projects to =
buy from Enron and how much Whitewing would pay.=20
Some of Enron's directors and officers may serve as directors of Whitewing =
Management LLC, the private corporation that controlled Whitewing, the docu=
ment said, and these individuals, not identified in the document, may have =
a conflict of interest. "In addition, certain other conflicts of interest m=
ay exist and may arise" because of the linkages between Enron and Whitewing=
, the document said.=20
In one case, Enron acknowledged such a conflict of interest but said its bo=
ard had approved it. Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fast=
ow, received $30 million in fees and profits from his participation in a gr=
oup of Enron-created outside entities known as LJM, which also invested in =
Osprey.=20
Now, Enron is reevaluating the fair value of Whitewing's assets, and the ou=
tcome of the transactions for shareholders and investors lies in bankruptcy=
 court.

HOUSTON (AP) - The Rev. Jesse Jackson says he will try to pump up laid of E=

Jackson said Enron reported inflated profits despite a system of checks and=

 to its demise and shares that dwindled to less than a dollar after trading=

USA: Profiles of major figures in Enron saga.

01/21/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Following are profiles of some of the major =
figures involved in the growing political and financial saga revolving arou=
nd the collapse of energy trading giant Enron Corp., and ensuing criticism =
of its auditors, accounting giant Andersen.=20
ENRON
KENNETH LAY - Age 59. Chairman and chief executive officer of Enron since i=
ts creation from merger of Houston Natural Gas and Internorth in 1986, exce=
pt for six months when he turned CEO duties over to protege Jeffrey Skillin=
g. Credited, along with Skilling, with transforming Enron from pipeline com=
pany to world's dominant trader of gas and power. A Missouri native who hol=
ds a PhD in economics, Lay worked in Washington for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission and was deputy undersecretary for energy at the Interior =
Department in the Nixon administration. He is a friend of President George =
W. Bush and advised the White House on its energy policy.=20
JEFFREY SKILLING - Age 48. Former CEO who resigned in August 2001, just six=
 months after taking helm of the company he worked 14 years to build. Joine=
d Enron in 1990 after working alongside Lay for four years as a consultant =
from McKinsey and Co. A Harvard Business School graduate, Skilling worked a=
s a banker prior to joining McKinsey. Credited with creating first natural =
gas futures contracts, on which Enron built its empire in the deregulated e=
nergy markets. Long seen as heir apparent to Lay and power behind the thron=
e. His stated explanation for abrupt departure was personal reasons, but la=
ter acknowledged he felt pressure over stock price, which fell throughout h=
is tenure. Denies any wrongdoing and says he considered Enron to be in exce=
llent shape when he left.=20
ANDREW FASTOW - Age 39. Chief financial officer who was ousted in October a=
fter disclosures he had managed off-balance-sheet partnerships that led to =
a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. He earned about $30 million=
 as managing partner, in addition to his Enron salary. His acumen at creati=
ng the off-book deals that kept debts off Enron's balance sheet won him awa=
rds and accolades in financial community but also the attention of SEC inve=
stigators looking at potential conflict-of-interest issues. Is also subject=
 of Justice Department investigation.=20
JEFFREY MCMAHON - Age 41. Chief financial officer who replaced Fastow and h=
as since been Enron's main public face. A certified public accountant, he j=
oined Enron in 1994 as CFO of Enron's European operations. Returned to Unit=
ed States in 1997 and became treasurer under Fastow. Asked to be reassigned=
 in 1999, after reportedly complaining to Skilling about Fastow's partnersh=
ip arrangements and being rebuffed. Headed Enron e-commerce business unit, =
then Industrial Markets unit until being named CFO. Started his career with=
 Arthur Andersen & Co. in Houston, and worked at a midsized natural gas com=
pany before joining Enron.=20
WASHINGTON=20
JOSEPH LIEBERMAN - Sen. Joseph Lieberman has taken the lead in the Senate o=
n criticizing the Bush administration's links to Enron and is holding a hea=
ring on the energy company's collapse. The Democrat from Connecticut is bes=
t known for being chosen in 2000 election as Al Gore's running mate, becomi=
ng the first Jew nominated for vice president by a major party. With his re=
putation for sincerity and integrity, he quickly established himself as a k=
ey asset for Gore's Democratic presidential campaign. Before then, Lieberma=
n was perhaps best known for denouncing President Bill Clinton's affair wit=
h White House intern Monica Lewinsky as morally wrong.=20
HARVEY PITT - Former Wall Street lawyer Harvey Pitt is in charge of the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission, which is Wall Street's top regulator and w=
hich has launched an investigation into Enron. Pitt is a controversial figu=
re because as a private lawyer he once represented major accounting firms, =
including former Enron auditor Arthur Andersen. Since taking the helm at th=
e SEC, critics have accused him of being less aggressive in regulating the =
financial services industry - a charge he denies. He previously had a host =
of high-powered Wall Street clients and once represented Ivan Boesky, who p=
aid a record $100 million settlement to the SEC in 1986 and later pleaded g=
uilty to criminal charges of insider trading.=20
HENRY WAXMAN - Rep. Henry Waxman has been the most active House of Represen=
tatives Democrat in attacking the Bush administration on the Enron case. Th=
e California lawmaker has accused the Enron chairman, Lay, of misleading em=
ployees by telling them he expected the company's stock price to go up just=
 weeks before it started to collapse. Waxman has been a major figure in the=
 House for more than 20 years. In 1981 and 1982, he helped stop the Reagan =
administration from revising the Clean Air Act. He also worked to expand Me=
dicaid for the poor and has been a vocal critic of the tobacco industry. Wa=
xman sits on the Commerce, Health and Environment, Oversight and Investigat=
ions and Government Reform committees.=20
BILLY TAUZIN - Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana has been one of the most aggr=
essive Republicans in investigating the Enron case. He was first elected to=
 Congress in 1980, as a Democrat, before switching sides in August 1995. Th=
roughout his career on Capitol Hill, Tauzin has been intensely involved in =
telecommunications issues. He strongly supported the Telecommunications Act=
 of 1996, has criticized the government for blocking the regional Bells fro=
m the long-distance business and along with his Senate counterpart John McC=
ain wants to allow satellite TV to compete with cable. Tauzin chairs the Ho=
use Energy and Commerce Committee and the Trade and Consumer Protection Com=
mittee.=20
JOHN ASHCROFT - Attorney General John Ashcroft is in charge of the Departme=
nt of Justice, which has launched a criminal probe of Enron. But the conser=
vative Midwest Republican has recused himself from the investigation becaus=
e he received campaign money from the firm. Ashcroft, a former senator and =
a governor of Missouri, was the most controversial of President George W. B=
ush's appointments. He was fiercely criticized in his Senate nomination hea=

tions on the economy, he has worked on bipartisan financial services reform=
 and on the housing reform legislation in 1998. He was often described by R=

--excerpt only--
Enron workers saw CEO Kenneth Lay as a hero and corporate savior, but that =
has quickly changed during Enron's collapse. Keith Olberman interviews form=
er Enron employee Deborah Defforge. Julie Posey is a 37-year-old homemaker =
from Colorado, and she helps the FBI track down child predators on the Inte=
rnet.=20
ANNOUNCER: THE POINT with Keith Olbermann.
From hero to zero. He actually had the nerve to tell them to buy more stock=
. This was a buying opportunity he said. The stock was an incredible bargai=
n.=20
When Enron's big boss told his workers to keep buying the company stock, di=
d he know the meltdown was coming? Tonight, revealing details of what went =
on behind closed doors.=20
Is this the riskiest job in New York? Some insurance companies say yes, and=
 they won't pay. Flash Point, high risk, no coverage.=20
Who is your child really chatting with on the Internet? We'll talk to a mom=
 who could be a sex predator's worst nightmare.=20
THE POINT, now from New York, Keith Olbermann.=20
KEITH OLBERMANN, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening. You heard the phrase the fall gu=
y. Do you know where that comes from? It is the last message of the last gr=
eat American energy scandal, the one before Enron, Teapot Dome. The man who=
 went to prison was President Harding's Secretary of the Interior, Albert J=
. Fall, the fall guy.=20
This brings us to Enron Chairman Ken Lay and whether he's one of those fall=
 guys or if he made all of Enron's employees into them. Today's latest jaw-=
dropping developments from Houston, Ken Lay's personal magnetism may be why=
 so many Enron employees believed things were OK when their own eyes told t=
hem otherwise. CNN's Ed Lavandera now, with the story of two meetings and t=
wo different Ken Lays.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): When Ken Lay walked into a ro=
om, he was usually the center of attention. Many Enron workers saw him as a=
 hero and corporate savior. But during a two-month stretch last year, Lay's=
 popularity crumbled. In several dozen interviews with former and current E=
nron employees, we've learned how quickly public opinion turns.=20
In August, when Chief Financial Officer Jeff Skilling left Enron, Ken Lay c=
alled everyone into a hotel banquet hall to talk about the future. UNIDENTI=
FIED MALE: The minute he started walking up on the stage, everybody got up =
and applauded, because they already knew Skilling had resigned.=20
LAVANDERA: Most people thought that day would mark Enron's return to glory.=
=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd have to say that when they did come out, they were v=
ery direct and very promising, tried to keep the spirits high, and in some =
cases probably even misleading.=20
LAVANDERA: One month later, as Federal investigators started asking more po=
inted questions and earnings reports hinted at bigger problems, Ken Lay cal=
led everyone together again, but this time there would be no standing ovati=
on.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People were just generally concerned about the status of=
 the company, where it was going and what the management was basically goin=
g to do about it.=20
LAVANDERA: As the meeting dragged on, some Enron workers grew impatient and=
 the meeting's tone changed.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We actually had one gentleman who was almost like a heck=
ler. I mean, he kept standing up and asking question after question.=20
LAVANDERA: Then Ken Lay read a question that had been submitted anonymously=
.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I was surprised he actually read it, but he asked Ke=
n Lay literally, are you on crack.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I could see that he was getting rather irritated at the =
gentleman.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of us standing around my computer were like going - =
our jaws just hit the floor, you know.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He read the question and said "no, I'm not" and he got s=
ome laughter.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ken Lay replied, continued reading the card and said "do=
 you think we'll ever trust you again?" And I thought that was - I couldn't=
 believe a person would do that. I figured, oh good thing it's anonymous, y=
ou know, because he's going to be fired.=20
LAVANDERA: This tale of two meetings has created quite a buzz among Enron w=
orkers, as each person struggles to make sense of how one man, one company =
can go from hero to villain almost overnight.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The unfortunate thing is that everyone's looking for a s=
capegoat, and whether there is one or not, I don't know. The biggest or the=
 saddest perspective on it is the loss of all the dollars. UNIDENTIFIED MAL=
E: If they're going to mess around with the company, you know, maybe we sho=
uld be there telling them, "I don't agree with what you're doing. Why are y=
ou doing that?" Or leave and go to another company.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
LAVANDERA (on camera): We've made several attempts to speak with Enron repr=
esentatives about these meetings, but they haven't responded to the calls. =
One employee also tells us that usually these meetings were taped for peopl=
e to watch later. But as almost everyone tells us, those tapes were never m=
ade available to everyone. Ed Lavanadera, CNN, Houston.=20
OLBERMANN: And another set of eyes and ears at the Enron employee meetings =
that Ed described, belonged to an ex-Enron employee. Of course, they're all=
 ex-Enron employees now. Deborah Defforge, she has now lost her job and her=
 stock option. She's working to get severance pay to laid off Enron workers=
 and she joins us now from Houston. Thank you for your time this evening.=
=20
DEBORAH DEFFORGE, FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE: Thank you, Keith. It's good to be =
here.=20
OLBERMANN: Is the story that Ed Lavandera just reported, correct? Were you =
at these two separate meetings? At the first of them, was the entire compan=
y convinced that Ken Lay was Enron's savior?=20
DEFFORGE: Absolutely.=20
OLBERMANN: And what happened by the time of the second one? How much time i=
ntervened between these two meetings?=20
DEFFORGE: The first meeting in August, when Jeff Skilling announced that he=
 was resigning. We did a total standing ovation when Ken Lay came back on b=
oard. The next meeting happened in last September, and at that point everyt=
hing was falling apart.=20
OLBERMANN: So, Ms. Defforge, I guess the thing that makes the headlines out=
 of that story was the report that Mr. Lay actually read this anonymous que=
stion, are you on crack? That actually happened?=20
DEFFORGE: That actually happened.=20
OLBERMANN: What was the response within the company, within the room? I mea=
n, I would imagine that there must have been some emotional visceral respon=
se to that?=20
DEFFORGE: I think a few people pretty much applauded it. A lot of other peo=
ple were taken aback, and he handled it quite well. He made a joke of it an=
d said "maybe I should be" and kind of went on to respond to the question.=
=20
OLBERMANN: This question came in the environment of what we're reading in a=
 couple of newspapers, particularly the New York Times today, that at basic=
ally the same moment that that question would have been asked, there were E=
nron employees being dismissed for negative postings on Internet chat room =
sites about the company. Was a sense of bravery required to make any kind o=
f criticism of Enron during the time we're talking about?=20
DEFFORGE: I'm not sure that anyone knew about those people being let go. I =
know that there were some comments earlier, prior to that, early in the yea=
r that people posting jobs on monster.com or hotjobs.com were being let go =
because of that. So perhaps, that had some tie in to that.=20
OLBERMANN: You have used a horrifying but perfectly accurate word I guess, =
to describe how all of you behaved within the company, lemmings. Were you a=
ll led off the cliff because you believed in Ken Lay? I mean, was it that m=
uch? It sounds like a borderline apple white heavens gate off the cliff, yo=
u know here comes the Haley's Comet, we're all going to get on board kind o=
f thing. Was it that strong a belief in this man?=20
DEFFORGE: Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't know of any other cult that had t=
hat kind of following, maybe Jim Jones or Reverend Moon. But absolutely, we=
 thought he was the best thing there was.=20
OLBERMANN: When did you know that was not the case? When did it really sink=
 in? I mean, people were still buying the stock in the middle of November, =
so the public was certainly behind the curve. How far behind the curve were=
 you personally?=20
DEFFORGE: Probably further than that. There were some questions, of course,=
 and the people that stood up in the October meeting that heckled and they =
weren't really heckling. They were asking honest questions. He just wasn't =
answering them honestly. Probably there was some concern then. Unfortunatel=
y, that was about the same time we were locked out of our 401 (k), so we co=
uldn't do a whole lot beyond that.=20
OLBERMANN: You were in the 401 (k)?=20
DEFFORGE: Yes.=20
OLBERMANN: What are you left with?=20
DEFFORGE: Better than most. I have about 30 or 40 percent of mine still lef=
t.=20
OLBERMANN: And whose fault, in your opinion, is all this? I mean, Washingto=
n, the rest of the country seem to be in full-fledged blame assignment mode=
, people pointing at the SEC, the administration, Arthur Andersen accountin=
g. Where does that finger belong pointed in your opinion?=20
DEFFORGE: First of all, I think it should rest with the top people at Enron=
. I mean, they were the ones that were bilking and lying and cheating and t=
elling everyone, falsifying all the books. Secondly, I think Arthur Anderse=
n is a huge player in here. Vincent and Elkins (ph) is a huge player. The a=
nalysts, the SEC, I mean no one is without fault in this.=20
OLBERMANN: Do you blame yourself for being credulous, for going along with =
the dive off the cliff?=20
DEFFORGE: Absolutely. Absolutely.=20
OLBERMANN: Is that a sense that you have from other of your former co-emplo=
yees?=20
DEFFORGE: Yes I think so, Keith. But unfortunately the thing is that you wa=
nt to believe in the person you're working for. You don't want to have seco=
nd guesses about everything you do. You spend 14 hours of your day in this =
job. There's no reason why you should have to second-guess everything.=20
OLBERMANN: And now you have to go and sue them. How is that going?=20
DEFFORGE: That's worse. That's even worse. I feel horrible about it. The po=
int is that if they had given us what they promised us in terms of severanc=
e, I don't think any of this would be happening.=20
OLBERMANN: Deborah Defforge, all the best in your efforts.=20
DEFFORGE: Thank you.=20
OLBERMANN: Thank you for being with us and sharing this extraordinary trip =
in and out of a cult.=20
DEFFORGE: Thank you, Keith.=20
OLBERMANN: Thank you. Good night.=20
DEFFORGE: Good night.=20
OLBERMANN: Tomorrow night, please join CNN for a full hour look at the fina=
ncial, political, and legal aftershocks of Enron's fall. Watch Lou Dobbs "L=

Role of Andersen lawyer probed.
By PETER SPIEGEL IN WASHINGTON AND ADRIAN MICHAELS IN NEW YORK.

01/22/2002
Financial Times - FT.com

A senior lawyer from Andersen's Chicago headquarters was in the firm's Hous=
ton office at the same time that the company's auditors were shredding cruc=
ial Enron-related documents, an Andersen official has told congressional in=
vestigators.=20
The lawyer, Nancy Temple, has become a new focus for congressional investig=
ators probing the collapse of Enron, once the seventh largest company in th=
e US.
Andersen's corporate leadership has maintained that the two-week concerted =
shredding campaign in late October and early November, when thousands of do=
cuments and e-mails were destroyed or deleted, was limited to officials in =
the company's Houston office "without consultation with others in the firm"=
.=20
The investigators have now been told that Ms Temple, who is in charge of En=
ron-related litigation for Andersen, arrived in Houston on October 16, four=
 days after she sent out an e-mail reminding Houston auditors of the compan=
y's document shredding policy. She sent a similar e-mail to other Chicago-b=
ased officials of Andersen on October 19, according to a copy of the e-mail=
 obtained by the Financial Times.=20
Although congressional investigators do not know the exact dates of Ms Temp=
le's stay, they have been told she was in Andersen's Houston office "very r=
egularly" from October 23, when Enron lead auditor David Duncan called a me=
eting to begin the shredding campaign, to November 9, when the destruction =
stopped. Andersen received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission on November 8.=20
Congressional investigators do not know whether Ms Temple was directly invo=
lved in the document destruction. One Capitol Hill aide said "she appeared =
to be on a different floor but she was there [in Houston].=20
"That's why you don't see any more new e-mails" from Ms Temple in late Octo=
ber and early November, the aide said.=20
Andersen has disciplined eight Houston-based employees, including Mr Duncan=
, but to date no one from its Chicago office has been implicated by Anderse=
n, a move widely regarded as an attempt by the firm to limit the damage to =
Houston. Mr Duncan was fired last week.=20
Ms Temple was scheduled to give a deposition to lawyers from the House ener=
gy and commerce committee on Tuesday in her attorney's Washington office.=
=20
Andersen repeated on Tuesday that no one from its head office had given the=
 go-ahead or helped Houston shred or delete thousands of Enron documents. "=
Based on what we have today, we have no evidence that anyone from Chicago a=
uthorised or was complicit in David Duncan's large document disposal effort=
," an Andersen official said.=20
The revelation of Ms Temple's stay in Houston came during questioning of Mi=
chael Odom, who was Andersen's head of risk management in Houston, by commi=
ttee lawyers on Friday. Mr Odom, who was one of the employees disciplined l=
ast week, had his management responsibilities stripped but remains with And=
ersen.=20

Enron's Law Firm Is in the Crosshairs; Vinson & Elkins' heavy reliance on t=
he work it did for the energy giant is now a potential liability for the la=
w firm
By Mike France in New York, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas and Christopher Pa=
lmeri in Los Angeles

01/22/2002
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Aftershocks from the collapse of Enron (ENE) have rocked the energy giant's=
 auditors, bankers -- and now its attorneys. Houston law firm Vinson & Elki=
ns was the latest to be hit when news broke that it had shrugged off allega=
tions of accounting fraud by whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins.=20
That's an incendiary revelation, for certain. But it may not pose nearly as=
 much of a threat to V&E as some of the other work the firm may have done f=
or Enron -- namely, helping to construct the web of partnerships the compan=
y used to move debt off the balance sheet and providing advice on what exec=
utives should disclose to the Securities & Exchange Commission.
Why are these activities such a big potential problem? Under the law, it is=
 hard to pin the blame on lawyers for financial fiascos. They would have ha=
d to play a role nearly equal to that of the primary perpetrators.=20
Most experts agree that V&E's seemingly dismissive attitude about the Watki=
ns allegations -- months after the transactions she complained about took p=
lace -- probably does not meet the standard for either criminal or civil li=
ability. But that verdict might be different if it turns out that the firm'=
s attorneys also helped Enron devise some of the complex deals that wound u=
p sinking the company in the first place.=20
A CREATIVE ROLE. There are growing indications that may just be the case. I=
n her missive to Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay, Watkins suggested t=
he law firm wrote so-called opinion letters vouching for the legality of so=
me of the deals now under scrutiny. And according to two ex-Enron executive=
s contacted by BusinessWeek, Vinson & Elkins played a creative role in stru=
cturing and managing some of the company's controversial "special purpose" =
partnerships.=20
One former executive in the company's Houston office says employees would a=
pproach V&E lawyers "and say, 'this thing needs to work. How do we make it =
work?'" This source adds that the firm also gave Enron advice on how much i=
nformation it had to disclose about its financial machinations in its 10K a=
nd 10Q reports to the SEC.=20
Legally speaking, the key issue will be whether V&E blessed activities it k=
new to be fraudulent. If so, it could be in trouble, says University of Ill=
inois law professor Ronald D. Rotunda, an expert in legal ethics. "Under th=
ose fact scenarios, they could have real problems," he says.=20
"COMPLETELY PROFESSIONAL." The law firm denies it has done anything wrong. =
Because Vinson & Elkins' conduct is under federal scrutiny, Managing Partne=
r Joseph Dilg declined to discuss the firm's investigation of the letter wr=
itten by Watkins, citing attorney-client privilege, and was only willing to=
 offer a few details about the firm's other work for Enron. He said V&E's p=
rofessional responsibility committee reviewed its work for Enron in October=
 and November and found no improprieties. "Everything that the firm's lawye=
rs who have represented Enron have done has been [accomplished] in a comple=
tely professional, competent, and ethical manner," says Dilg, who is also a=
 key contact for the Enron account.=20
He and fellow partners will undoubtedly find themselves called upon to prov=
e that point. Enron and V&E have enjoyed one of the closest lawyer-client r=
elationships in Corporate America. Both Enron's general counsel, James V. D=
errick Jr., and his top lieutenant, Deputy General Counsel Robert H. Walls =
Jr., are former partners at the law firm. An additional 20 or so V&E attorn=
eys have taken jobs at Enron's legal department over the past decade, Dilg =
estimates.=20
Enron is V&E's single largest customer. In 2001, Enron accounted for more t=
han 7% of V&E's $450 million in revenue. The law firm had several lawyers w=
orking virtually full-time on company business, including some permanently =
stationed in its offices. By contrast, Enron contributed less than 1% to au=
ditor Arthur Andersen's revenues.=20
TRUE SALE OPINIONS. The exact details of V&E's work for Enron are still ske=
tchy. In her letter, Watkins claimed the firm "provided some true sale opin=
ions on some of the deals" related to the so-called Condor and Raptor deals=
. She could not be reached for elaboration. According to one New York corpo=
rate finance attorney, true sale opinions are letters that law firms write =
vouching for the fact that business transactions meet particular legal requ=
irements.=20
So, for example, they might certify that title has passed in a particular d=
eal or that it was conducted between two legally independent parties. Such =
documents would have been important to Enron, since many of its deals took =
place with partnerships in which it held a large stake. V&E declined to dis=
cuss the opinion letters.=20
True sale opinions in the energy sector are always requested by auditors be=
fore they are willing to sign off on the accounting treatment for a particu=
lar deal, according to finance lawyers. They are also requested by rating a=
gencies, which need to assure lenders that both of the participants in a pa=
rticular related-party transaction would be treated independently in the ev=
ent one of them went bankrupt. Otherwise, one party could be left unfairly =
holding the bag for the failure of a company or partnership with which it h=
as no ties.=20
CRUCIAL WORK? According to one former Enron employee, the company might not=
 have been able to pull off many of the transactions now under investigatio=
n without Vinson & Elkins' opinion letters. The company "opinion-shopped fo=
r what it needed," says this source. "If it hadn't gotten the opinion lette=
rs, it couldn't have done the deals."=20
Accusations by embittered ex-employees obviously have to be taken with a gr=
ain of salt. There's still little hard evidence about what V&E did or didn'=
t do for Enron. But if the firm turns out to have worked hand in hand with =
top management, it could be finding itself in the same hot water as the ene=
rgy giant's auditors and bankers.

Enron a Boon to Short-Sellers / Skeptics correctly read signs of sudden col=

Enron Corp. may be the best friend Wall Street's "short-sellers" ever had.=
=20
Some of these professional bears bet against the energy company's stock ear=
ly last year, smelling a fraud. Yet any monetary gain they reaped could be =
of modest value compared with the long-term benefit to their image thanks t=
o Enron's demise.
That's because the principal lessons Enron has taught investors are about t=
he need to question glowing corporate forecasts of sales and earnings, to d=
ig deeper into companies' financial statements, and to think twice before a=
ffording sky-high price-to-earnings ratios to stocks of businesses heavy on=
 hype and light on specifics.=20
Those are the hallmarks of professional short-sellers. "Shorting" of stocks=
 means borrowing and selling shares, hoping the price declines so the loane=
d shares can be replaced at lower cost in the future. Although often revile=
d for the end product of their work, short-sellers may be the last bastion =
of hard-nosed research left on Wall Street.=20
"It's a lot of work to short a stock," said Bill Fleckenstein, a veteran sh=
ort-seller who heads Fleckenstein Capital in Issaquah, Wash. "You have to b=
e right."=20
They aren't always right, of course, but Enron is a prime example of how sh=
ort-sellers' questioning of the conventional wisdom can prove to be spectac=
ularly on target.=20
One of the few voices raised against Enron a year ago was that of James Cha=
nos, a well-known research-intensive short-seller who heads Kynikos Associa=
tes in New York. Chanos publicly questioned other analysts' assumptions abo=
ut Enron's true profitability, and he made the argument that the company wa=
s merely a disguised "hedge fund," a high-risk trading operation that didn'=
t deserve the huge valuation investors had given it.=20
Chanos got little publicity, and most institutional money managers were far=
 more interested in hearing the upbeat pronouncements coming from then-Enro=
n CEO Jeffrey Skilling and from the army of analysts covering the company.=
=20
Still, Chanos' warnings belie the line heard most often on Wall Street toda=
y, as big investors and analysts try to explain why they didn't see Enron's=
 collapse coming. The line is, "We were totally snookered; the company dece=
ived the government, its auditors, and us."=20
Baloney, says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer newslet=
ter in New York and a longtime ally of the short- selling community. "I do =
not buy for one minute" the idea that anyone paying close attention to Enro=
n's finances wouldn't have seen the same warning flags that Chanos did, Gra=
nt argues.=20
"And if it [Enron] was so opaque, why did people own it?" he asks.=20
Led by a handful of professional skeptics, more investors did short Enron s=
tock as 2001 wore on. Those bets rose relatively slowly, and even by Septem=
ber, after Skilling had resigned and the share price was crumbling, a modes=
t 13.8 million Enron shares (less than 2 percent of the total outstanding) =
had been shorted, according to New York Stock Exchange data.=20
In November, as bankruptcy neared, short-selling of Enron stock soared. The=
 big money would have been made by shorting the stock at $80 early in 2001,=
 and holding that bet, rather than shorting it at $10 in November. (The pro=
fit on a short sale, after all, is the difference between the price at whic=
h borrowed stock is sold and the price at which shares are bought back to r=
epay the loan. Enron shares were trading Friday at about 51 cents.)=20
The community of money managers actively researching stocks to short is tin=
y, Fleckenstein said. In all, he estimates there may be less than $1 billio=
n committed to short-selling funds such as his own. The funds' clients typi=
cally are institutional investors and wealthy individuals.=20
Short-sellers have never been a huge group on Wall Street, but they enjoyed=
 a higher profile - and endured substantial public wrath - in the late 1980=
s, after the 1987 market crash. Many of the famous short-sellers of that er=
a were accused of spreading lies about stocks to knock them down and thus p=
rofit from short sales.

MONEY
ENRON SPURS TEXAS-SIZE LEGAL QUAGMIRE ; MORE THAN 150 LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY=
 BEEN FILED IN HOUSTON AGAINST THREE OF THE COMPANY'S TOP EXECUTIVES.

HOUSTON -- Even the lawyers are hiring lawyers.=20
The astounding collapse of Enron Corp. has devastated employees, infuriated=
 shareholders, stung creditors and woken the regulators. Everyone's upset. =
And everyone's headed for court.
"This case is the full employment act for Texas lawyers," said Richard J. Z=
ook, who was the first to file a class-action lawsuit against the now-bankr=
upt energy company.=20
"There will be civil lawyers, criminal lawyers, securities lawyers, regulat=
ory lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers, employment benefits lawyers and trial lawy=
ers," Zook added. "Billions and billions have been lost. It's going be a lo=
ng, detailed and exhaustive search for the guilty parties."=20
So far, 51 lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court in Houston namin=
g former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as a defendant. Fifty-=
six go after former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling. Fifty-three seek dama=
ges from Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Dozens more suits go after the company it=
self.=20
That's not all. Lawyers for Enron's 20,000 creditors are seeking restitutio=
n, and a group of Enron bondholders are suing the company's former auditor,=
 Arthur Andersen LLP, as well as the bonds' underwriters.=20
Samson Investment Co., an oil exploration company that was an Enron partner=
, sued the auditor last week. Enron itself is making noises about suing And=
ersen. Other lawyers are focusing on the brokers who touted the company's o=
nce-golden stock. Wendy Gramm, an Enron board member and the wife of Sen. P=
hil Gramm, R-Texas, already has had 14 suits filed against her.=20
Texas is fond of its superlatives, so not many people here are resisting th=
e notion that the biggest bankruptcy of all time will spur the largest lega=
l quagmire of all time. Yet that opinion is seconded by more distant observ=
ers, who nonetheless caution that the case is still unfolding.=20
"This involves civil actions as well as potentially criminal ones, private =
as well as public entities," said Stanford law Professor Deborah Hensler. "=
And it involves lots of money and has lots of political ramifications. Thos=
e are the ingredients you'd need."=20
It's not only big. It's likely to be endless.=20
"Given the size and scope of the fraud, the number of defendants, the numbe=
r of legal proceedings and the potential of the criminal cases to delay the=
 civil cases, it will take as many as six years to resolve this," predicted=
 San Diego lawyer William Lerach.=20
Lerach, who represents shareholders who claim they lost fortunes because of=
 Enron's deception, rejects any assertions that the only winners will be la=
wyers.=20
"Lawyers always do well, whenever there's a disaster," he said. But he adde=
d that class-action lawyers "only get paid if they make a recovery for the =
class. And they only get paid a percentage of what they recover."=20
All the more reason, then, to spread the legal net as wide as possible. The=
 juiciest target could be Andersen, which stands accused of failing to pres=
ent Enron's true financial picture. The Chicago- based firm has deep pocket=
s and, unlike Enron, isn't shielded by a bankruptcy court.=20
While Enron lawsuits are being launched all over the country -- the bankrup=
tcy case is being heard in New York, while the Samson complaint was filed i=
n Tulsa, Okla. -- by far the greatest concentration is in Houston, in the e=
nergy company's hometown. The cases are so plentiful that questions are sta=
rting to be asked about conflicts of interest, and the lawyers themselves a=
re wondering what their own best interests are. Sooner or later, everyone i=
s going to have to take sides.=20
The tight relationships -- and Enron's big footprint in this town - - is le=
ading to some conflicts. Two of the 18 U.S. District Court judges here, Nan=
cy Atlas and David Hittner, had to recuse themselves from Enron cases. An A=
tlas assistant said the judge wouldn't comment; an assistant to Hittner sai=
d it was because he owned Enron stock.=20
"The problem is, Enron is everywhere and Enron executives are everywhere," =
said Elizabeth Freeman, a lawyer for Enron creditors. "Most of the judges w=
ere practitioners here. They might have represented Enron or an Enron compe=
titor."=20
While the number of lawyers are multiplying, for the moment the number of a=
ctive cases is actually shrinking. That's because they're being consolidate=
d on three tracks: employee benefits, shareholder class actions and so-call=
ed derivative suits, where shareholders sue a corporation's officers to for=
ce them to restore to the company money they allegedly stole from it. The d=
ocket sheet for the class- action suit, Newby et al vs. Enron Corp., now ta=
kes 15 pages to list all the lawyers involved.=20
Yet for all of the frantic legal activity, there's a sense that this might =
only be the beginning.

Federal Judge Approves Sale Of Enron's Energy Trading Ops

01/22/2002
Dow Jones News Service

(This article was originally published Friday)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge approved the sale of Enron Corp.'s (=
ENRNQ) core energy-trading operations to UBS Warburg late Friday - a move t=
he bankrupt company considered crucial to its reorganization efforts.
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Southern District=
 of New York, said the sale is "in the best interest" of Eron and its credi=
tors. The decision capped a contentious eight-hour hearing.=20
The sale of Enron's core operations is the "only mechanism to maintain valu=
e for the wholesale trading business," Judge Gonzalez told a packed courtro=
om.=20
In approving the sale, the judge overruled objections by a handful of credi=
tors, who had argued that the value of trading contracts may suffer because=
 of the deal.=20
The concern: traders who would be transferred to the new business, NETCO, w=
ould use their knowledge of Enron's futures contracts to their advantage in=
 forging similar transactions with creditors' competitors.=20
But Enron's official creditors committee told the court Friday that the ris=
k of this happening isn't significant, as the bankrupt company has terminat=
ed many of these contracts. The trading book is currently valued at $1.3 bi=
llion, compared with $5 billion to $7 billion in the days after Enron filed=
 for Chapter 11 court protection.=20
Other creditors had argued unsuccessfully that the judge should order futur=
e proceeds from the sale to be put into escrow for the benefit of creditors=
 of Enron North America - the unit that holds most of the deal's assets.=20
Reacting to the verdict, Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, =
said that the deal is "the best result for the creditors."=20
"We surely believe the trade business with UBS' balance sheet will be highl=
y successful in the future," he added.=20
Under the deal, the Swiss bank will get 100% of Enron's energy-trading oper=
ations - including its valuable online trading platform - and pay no cash u=
p front. Instead, Enron will be compensated as the business prospers, getti=
ng 33% of pretax profits for at least the first two years. UBS also has the=
 option to buy out the distressed company's profit rights beginning in the =
third year.=20
Additionally, the financial institution will be able to license Enron's tra=
ding software for 20 years, with exclusive rights for the first 10 years.=
=20
Judge Gonzalez said that he was convinced that UBS' deal for Enron's energy=
-trading operations - which generated about 90% of the company's $101 billi=
on in revenue last year - was the "highest value" that could be obtained.=

BUSINESS & TECHNOLOGY
UBS Pumps Life Into New Enron Unit
James T. Madore. STAFF WRITER

01/22/2002
Newsday
ALL EDITIONS
A38
(Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)

The crown jewel of Enron Corp., its energy trading business, is likely to s=
urvive bankruptcy but as part of another company.=20
Energy experts yesterday gave good odds for the success of a new trading en=
tity that consists of employees and computer technology from Houston-based =
Enron and the financial backing of Switzerland's largest bank, UBS AG. The =
new company seeks to restart what had been the world's largest trading oper=
ation for electricity and natural gas, generating about $90 billion, or 90 =
percent of Enron's yearly profit.
The new company, which would be controlled by UBS, gained preliminary appro=
val late Friday from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to begin operat=
ing. It still must receive the go-ahead from federal regulators.=20
Several energy experts described the new business as a recipe for success. =
"Enron's experience and ability to operate online markets has been married =
to a bank with an unquestioned credit rating...100 percent credibility come=
s back immediately," said James L. Smith, a professor of oil and gas manage=
ment at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business in Dallas. "=
In principle, this could work as well as it did before."=20
Enron grew from a small gas pipeline operator to America's seventh- largest=
 corporation largely on the strength of its trading operation based on soph=
isticated computer software. Enron's trip to bankruptcy court Dec. 2 was pr=
ecipitated by financial irregularities involving a string of off-the-books =
partnerships, not its trading division.=20
"But there was a resulting loss of confidence in Enron's ability to stand b=
etween buyers and sellers, which caused the trading business to fall," Smit=
h said. "People didn't believe Enron had the financial wherewithal to back =
the transactions it was processing."=20
UBS does, with assets valued at $701 billion, ranking it among the 10 large=
st banks in the world. However, it remains to be seen if the bank's energy =
trading unit - tentatively called UBS New Energy Trading Co. - will hold on=
 to the 800 or so former Enron traders that it's depending upon to execute =
orders. As a group, they would receive $11 million in bonuses - $5 million =
from UBS and $6 million from Enron - if they remain with the new company fo=
r one year, according to documents filed with the bankruptcy court. About 5=
00 Enron traders were paid $55 million late last year to stay with the stru=
ggling company.=20
"The financial incentive has kept people...Only a few have left," Smith sai=
d. "But it all depends on what happens in the next month. If this new tradi=
ng company attracts big energy customers, then it will be able to pay the b=
onuses that employees have been promised."=20
UBS paid no cash for Enron's most prized asset, agreeing instead to share a=
ny future profit. Enron would receive a 33 percent royalty fee, or about $7=
50 million based on 2000 profit. The deal allows UBS to license Enron's int=
ellectual property, lease its buildings and hire its employees to run the n=
ew trading operation without assuming Enron's debts, which exceed $40 billi=
on.=20
John Costas, chief executive of U.S. subsidiary UBS Warburg, said: "We look=
 forward to re-establishing the business and to providing clients with supe=
rior service."=20
The transaction doesn't include pending commodity trades and derivative con=
tracts that Enron entered into before filing for bankruptcy. These were val=
ued at more than $7 billion but have since fallen to $1.3 billion. And seve=
ral creditors said in court papers that they were concerned that former Enr=
on employees working for UBS would poach the contracts. Bankruptcy Judge Ar=
thur Gonzalez disagreed, saying, "The court has a sufficient degree of conf=
idence that Enron's book of business will not be diminished by the transact=
ion."=20
Besides the contracts, Enron's remaining assets include its energy trading =
operation in Europe, energy consulting services, a utility company in Orego=
n, a power plant in India, four natural gas pipelines that transport 15 per=
cent of U.S. demand, a water company in Bristol, England, and a wind power =
company in California and Europe.=20
"There's less there now than two years ago because they've sold off a lot o=
f businesses," said Smith, the Southern Methodist professor. "But they stil=
l have hard assets that can be used to raise cash to pay creditors."

Enron Creditors Express Skepticism About Proposed Sale of Trading Arm to UB=
S.

01/22/2002
The Oil Daily
(c) 2002 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

Enron's trading arm, which Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg plans to take =
over, is worth something between $40 million and $2.87 billion, according t=
o scenarios presented to creditors.=20
The value depends on future growth and profitability, but the wide range in=
dicates the high degree of uncertainty about the operation's future.
UBS will not pay any money up front in the proposed acquisition, but has in=
stead pledged to give Enron one-third of future profits for a limited perio=
d.=20
Enron's advisor Steven Selin, a managing director at Blackstone, which stru=
ctured the UBS deal on Enron's behalf, told creditors that several scenario=
s had been worked out, and presented them with two.=20
In the case of a no-growth scenario, the unit could be worth a pre-tax $40 =
million-$70 million. If Enron's trading unit manages to grow at the same pa=
ce as it did in the first nine months of 2000, the deal looks completely di=
fferent. Then, the unit could be worth up to $2.87 billion, Selin said.=20
The scenarios did not convince creditors, with 22 objecting to the deal wit=
h UBS at a bankruptcy court hearing Friday in New York.=20
They said the deal is financially risky, and that it is highly uncertain ho=
w much money will actually flow back to bankrupt Enron - and, in the end, t=
o its creditors.=20
"We're trying to show the court that this is a very risky deal," said John =
Wyllems, a lawyer with law firm White & Case, representing creditors.=20
But some creditors took a more skeptical approach, with one noting that, "t=
hose scenario assumptions are based on Enron's numbers, based on auditing b=
y Arthur Andersen."=20
Creditors claimed the value of Enron's trading book, which is kept out of t=
he UBS deal, could depreciate significantly as UBS acquires most of Enron's=
 traders, who have an intimate knowledge of how the book is structured.=20
"Knowing the content of the book is detrimental to the value of the book," =
said David DeRosa, called as an expert witness by creditors. He added that =
any deal with UBS should take the value of the book into account.=20
Some creditors argued, in the corridors of the court, that the trading book=
 is their major concern for objecting to the deal.=20
Enron said it would keep on some traders to unwind the book, and that the p=
ositions in the book have been changing ever since operations ended Dec. 2.=
=20
At the hearing, Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, =
dismissed the arguments of the objecting parties - many of them counterpart=
ies of Enron's trading arm, such as Mirant, Devon, Spinnaker, and Pure Reso=
urces.=20
Bienenstock said they were simply objecting to UBS coming into the market a=
s a new, big player.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has agreed to pay General Electr=

Enron Trying To Keep $7.92M In Funds From Some Creditors

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Distressed Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is trying to lay clai=
m to about $7.92 million in funds, and to keep this cash out of the hands o=
f its creditors - at least for now.
Late Friday, Enron Re, a wholly owned Enron North America unit, asked the U=
.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York to issue a tempor=
ary restraining order that would prevent the parent company's creditors fro=
m taking "actions" on the cash, which is currently being held in accounts w=
ith Merrill Lynch and Citibank N.A.=20
Enron Re - which is in the process of liquidating - argues that because it'=
s incorporated in Bermuda and subject to foreign laws, it should be able to=
 recover the money in order to distribute to its own creditors.=20
Essentially, Enron is trying to get the money back to itself, according to =
court filings, because at least three of Enron Re's five principle creditor=
s are affiliates of the bankrupt company.=20
These Enron entities include Enron North America, Enron Corp., and Risk Man=
agement Trading Corp. The other two creditors are European Finance Re & Har=
rington International Insurance Ltd.=20
The temporary restraining order will allow Enron Re to have "an orderly win=
d-up and liquidation" in Bermuda, it claims. The reinsurance company has li=
ttle or no other assets besides the $7.9 million cash, but has $8.93 millio=
n in liabilities, according to court documents.=20
The reinsurance unit is also asking the New York court, which is six weeks =
into the largest bankruptcy case in corporate history, to prevent Merrill L=
ynch and Citibank from "disposing" of the funds.=20

USA: Lawmaker says set to subpeona Andersen in Enron case.

01/22/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The head of a House of Representatives panel=
 said Tuesday he was set to subpoena testimony if necessary from Arthur And=
ersen LLP, the fired auditors of collapsed Enron Corp. .=20
Making clear Andersen was heading for very rough waters on Capitol Hill, Re=
p. Jim Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, said: "Everything that we've s=
een so far indicates that there was an unusual and urgent sense of need to =
destroy documents at Arthur Anderson," independent of any pressure from Enr=
on.
Enron said Monday it was looking into claims by an executive laid off last =
week, Maureen Castenada, that Enron employees had been shredding documents =
at the company's Houston headquarters as recently as last week despite cour=
t orders to preserve evidence.=20
A lawyer for a class action including Castenada and other former Enron empl=
oyees, William Lerach, said in television interviews he would ask a federal=
 court Tuesday to take extraordinary precautions to protect documents at bo=
th Andersen and Enron.=20
He said Enron may have destroyed hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidenc=
e.=20
"It was a major accounting fraud and now they've been caught destroying the=
 evidence," Lerach said on NBC's "Today" program. "I'd say they've got trou=
ble on their hands."=20
Enron - once the world's largest energy trader - became the the largest ban=
kruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its downfall threw thousands out =
of work, wiped out workers' life savings and hammered investors.=20
He said he would go after stock sale gains by top Enron executives at a tim=
e the company was showing inflated profits of $600 million as well as Ander=
sen's profits.=20
Lerach said he would seek to open a court-supervised depository for Anderse=
n documents. On ABC's "Good Morning America" program, he said it may be nec=
essary to put a U.S. marshal at Enron company headquarters to "make sure th=
ese people behave themselves."=20
Enron's lawyer, Robert Bennett, said in a statement late Monday that the co=
mpany was investigating the reported destruction of documents.=20
In October, Enron issued directives to employees worldwide that all relevan=
t documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation, Bennett sai=
d.=20
"If anyone violated those directives, they will be dealt with appropriately=
," he said.=20
Greenwood, chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that will h=
old hearings into Andersen's document destruction, said: "We've seen no evi=
dence that this came from Enron."=20
"By the time this show is over we'll either have some voluntary agreements =
from Arthur Andersen to testify or there are going to be a lot of subpoenas=
 going out of Washington," Greenwood said on NBC.=20
A spokesman for Andersen, which was fired Thursday as Enron's auditor, did =
not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on whether an agreement=
 had been reached for voluntary testimony.=20
Andersen has admitted destroying a "significant but undetermined" number of=
 electronic and paper documents and correspondence relating to the energy t=
rader's audit.=20
The document destruction by Anderson, which continued after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission began inquiries into Enron's financial statements i=
n late October, is to be the subject of a hearing by Greenwood's panel on T=
hursday.=20
Castenada, identified as director of foreign exchange and sovereign risk ma=
nagement, said she worked across the hall from an accounting office at Enro=
n's headquarters, where she said document destruction took place as late as=
 last week.=20
"After Thanksgiving, there was great interest in the accounting documents s=
tored. They pulled out all the boxes and people had to go through every box=
," she said in an on-camera ABC television interview Monday night.=20
Castenada showed what she said were some of the shredded documents she disc=
overed in an office hallway. She said she had taken one of many such boxes,=
 basically to use as "packing material."=20
In televised images of the shreds, the word "confidential" could be seen al=
ong with snippets of financial transactions dated in December. Also visible=
 were references to secret off-the-books partnerships, such as Jedi, believ=
ed by investigators to have helped bring Enron down.

WASHINGTON -- Congressional investigators in the Enron Corp. probe yesterda=
y pressed for public testimony by a fired auditor who says the Arthur Ander=
sen LLP accounting firm shares the blame for Enron's collapse.=20
Dismissed over the destruction of thousands of Enron-related documents, Dav=
id Duncan told investigators that Andersen had ample information when it ev=
aluated the controversial partnership arrangements at Enron that were a big=
 factor in its bankruptcy. Enron kept hundreds of millions of dollars in de=
bt off the balance sheet for several years.
Mr. Duncan "did not sit there and say 'Enron hid all this information from =
us and therefore we couldn't count right,' " said Representative Jim Greenw=
ood, R-Pa., who heads a House panel investigating the collapse.=20
"It was more of . . . 'we made mistakes.' "=20
Rather than giving a "mea culpa," Mr. Duncan gave "a wea culpa; he did not =
point the finger at Enron," Mr. Greenwood said yesterday, characterizing th=
e comments the fired auditor made last week to congress.=20
Mr. Duncan's lawyers sought to delay his public testimony, scheduled for Th=
ursday before the House oversight and investigations subcommittee, arguing =
that Mr. Duncan needs more time to prepare.=20
But Mr. Greenwood, who chairs the subcommittee, rejected the request, sayin=
g Mr. Duncan "doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for=
 Enron. We're focused on the destruction of documents. We'll subpoena him i=
f we have to."=20
Andersen chief executive officer Joseph Berardino "is saying that the compa=
ny found fault with Duncan's destruction of documents. He [Duncan] needs to=
 defend himself," Mr. Greenwood said.=20
Appearing Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Mr. Berardino criticized Mr. Dunc=
an and defended attorney Nancy Temple, who advised the Houston office by el=
ectronic mail on Oct. 12 about the firm's document destruction policy. That=
 was just four days before Enron announced more than $600-million in third-=
quarter losses and took the first step in disclosing details of the partner=
ships.=20
Mr. Berardino said Mr. Duncan displayed "at the least . . . extremely poor =
judgment" for his part in discarding the documents in October and November.=
=20
Mr. Berardino said Ms. Temple reminded the Houston office of the policy to =
do away with some documents "because accountants are pack rats. . . . We sa=
ve lots of stuff that's not relevant."=20
But Mr. Duncan told investigators "it was unusual" for a company lawyer to =
emphasize the document-destruction policy.=20
Meanwhile, a lawyer for Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and CEO, said Mr. Lay=
 disposed of millions of dollars in Enron stock before the company's collap=
se last year because he needed to raise cash to repay loans, not because of=
 concerns about the health of his company.=20
Attorney Earl Silbert said Mr. Lay had put up shares of his Enron stock as =
collateral for other investments. On at least 15 occasions between February=
 and October last year, Mr. Lay returned shares to the company to repay $4-=
million he had received through a credit line.=20
However, Mr. Silbert also said that Mr. Lay held onto some stock, detailing=
 one transaction in which Mr. Lay exercised options to purchase 68,000 shar=
es of Enron stock on Aug. 21.=20
"He continues to hold that stock today," Mr. Silbert said.=20
In other developments:=20
-- The U.S. State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin Powell=
 referred to Enron's problems regarding a power plant in India in a discuss=
ion with India's foreign minister last April 6. Enron was trying to collect=
 a $64-million debt on the project. According to the State Department, Mr. =
Powell said failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent ef=
fect on other investors.=20
-- Senator Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said accounting firms should be barred =
from providing management consulting services to the companies they audit. =
"These conflicts have led to the kind of hide-the-debt shell game that took=
 place at Enron," said Ms. Boxer, who will introduce a bill to ban the dual=
 role.=20
-- Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said a special counsel should investigate =
Enron rather than the Justice Department's criminal division. Mr. Nader als=
o said Bush administration officials should have alerted the Justice Depart=
ment and the SEC last fall when contacted by Mr. Lay about the company's gr=
owing problems.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. District Court judge assigned to preside ove=
r the civil lawsuits filed against Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), its executives, dir=

This past summer, Judge Melinda Harmon issued an order sending an aspiring =
Houston true-crime writer to jail for several months.=20
Would-be writer Vanessa Leggett was jailed for refusing to turn over notes =
to a federal grand jury investigating a high-profile murder case. Leggett w=

Harmon ordered Leggett released Jan. 5 when the grand jury's term ended. Sh=

Harmon was also the presiding judge in another case involving Andersen's ac=
counting: The Waste Management Inc. merger lawsuits.=20
In August, Harmon issued a ruling in consolidated shareholder suits against=
 two former Waste Management executives. Harmon said the plaintiffs had fai=
led to prove allegations of securities laws violations including insider tr=

 merger.=20
The case was eventually settled.=20
"I think she's going to be a fine judge for this," said Charles Parker, att=

Harmon will be presiding over the more than 60 civil lawsuits pending again=
st Enron becuase Judge Lee Rosenthal recused herself from the cases last we=

Two other judges in the U.S. District Court for the Sourthern District of T=

UK: UPDATE 1-Enron Europe creditors face $900 mln trading loss.
By Stuart Penson

01/22/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Creditors of the failed energy trading arm of st=
ricken U.S. group Enron's European unit face trading losses of around $900 =
million, an industry source close to the company told Reuters on Tuesday.=
=20
In the first firm indication of trading losses resulting from Enron's recor=
d-breaking bankruptcy, the industry source said London-based Enron Capital =
Trade Resources Ltd (ECTRL) had outstanding liabilities of about a billion =
dollars.
Enron Europe's administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), expected to rec=
oup only about $100 million of that exposure from the settlement of ECTRL's=
 outstanding contracts, the source said.=20
PWC declined to comment in detail but a company official, who requested ano=
nymity, said creditors to ECTRL faced a "substantial shortfall" based on cu=
rrent estimates.=20
At the time of its collapse, the company was sitting on around 250,000 open=
 contracts in the forward markets, the official said.=20
Enron traded power and gas in Europe with some 300 counterparties including=
 many of the continent's utilities, oil majors, trading houses and banks th=
at traded in energy.=20
Separately, PWC partner Neville Kahn told Reuters that the auditor planned =
to hold a meeting of around 100 Enron Europe creditors in London on Februar=
y 11 when losses are likely to be outlined. PWC would be writing to credito=
rs imminently, another PWC official said.=20
Houston-based Enron, once the world's largest energy trader, filed for bank=
ruptcy nearly two months ago in the largest collapse in corporate history.=
=20
Enron Europe, based in London, was placed into PWC's administration in late=
 November and 1,100 staff were laid off.=20
PWC had managed to settle with counterparties about 75 percent of in-the-mo=
ney, or profitable, contracts held by ECTRL, Kahn said.=20
"But there are some large trades that will take some time to unravel, it's =
a huge task," he said.=20
Enron commanded about 20 percent of Europe's wholesale electricity and gas =
trading.=20
Part of ECTRL's position in the UK gas market is still being traded from th=
e company's London headquarters, which has retained a skeleton staff of abo=
ut 150.

Dark humour and a line in T-shirts from Enron victim - Ex-employees' websit=
e reveals the real losses.
By David Teather in New York.

01/22/2002
The Guardian
P19
Copyright (C) 2002 The Guardian

John Allario, one of the thousands of Enron employees who lost their jobs w=
hen the energy firm fell into bankruptcy at the end of last year, is trying=
 to find some dark humour in the unfolding saga.=20
Mr Allario, 38, has set up Laydoff.com, a website acting as a forum for wor=
kers who not only lost their jobs but, in many cases, their life savings in=
 the company's collapse.
The site's name is a swipe at Enron's chairman and chief executive Ken Lay,=
 who pocketed millions of dollars from offloading shares over the past few =
years.=20
So far, the site has had 18,000 hits and Mr Allario has sold nearly 500 T-s=
hirts, bearing messages including I got Lay'd by Enron to My boss got a ret=
ention bonus, all I got was this T-shirt. The best seller is the simple Tha=
nks Ken, Jeff and Andy, referring to the directors held to account by worke=
rs for the collapse of the company.=20
Mr Allario, who had worked at EnronOnline, had been with the firm for six a=
nd a half years, and has walked away with $4,500 ( #3,130) before tax - aro=
und three weeks' pay. Shares he held in his pension plans had been worth $1=
08,000 at the peak. He sold them for less than $500.=20
I left feeling pretty angry but that can destroy you, so I'm trying to put =
it into something positive, he said.=20
It's like Of Mice and Men - these guys trawling around the country looking =
for work and one says to the other, 'don't be friendly with your boss - he'=
s not your friend, he's your boss'. I used to work in investment banks, and=
 the focus with Enron and Wall Street is making money, and the system stink=
s.=20
Like other workers Mr Allario is talking to lawyers about potential action =
for redress. Fleming Associates, a Houston-based law firm, is holding a mee=
ting with former employees later this week.=20
There is certainly enough anger among the former Enron workers to support M=
r Allario's website. Many employees' pension plans were tied up in Enron st=
ock, which fell from a peak of $90 to virtually nothing. Janis Farmer, a fo=
rmer administrator who retired last year, is typical. At the time her stock=
 was worth $700,000. She sold it for $20,400.=20
It has become increasingly clear that employees and retirees were sacrifice=
d for their own personal gain, she said.=20
Enron executives let us down, the auditors let us down, Wall Street analyst=
s let us down and the companies lending the money to Enron let us down. But=
 at the end of the day, when the dust settles, who has the greatest pain an=
d greatest losses? We do.=20
Another Enron worker, Roger Boyce, had in excess of $2m invested in Enron s=
tock - now worth about $3,000. When he wanted to sell as the share price pl=
ummeted, he was locked out by the company's management. If we aren't proper=
ly informed about what is going on, how can we make intelligent investment =
decisions?=20
I don't think I was naive. Why wouldn't we believe what the executives were=
 saying and what the Wall Street analysts were saying - that this was a gro=
wth company? We had tremendous trust in Enron, and that has been betrayed.=
=20
One employee, who lost his job in December and asked not to be named, had s=
een the storm coming early last year but did not realise the extent of the =
crisis. He had worked in the broadband unit which was trying to create a ma=
rket for capacity on telephone cables - part of the over-expansion that bui=
lt calamitous debts.=20
As we were coming up to the second quarter we were being put under a lot of=
 pressure to boost revenues. But it just wasn't materialising. We had earni=
ngs of $5m and costs of about $107m. I started to become frustrated when it=
 became apparent there wasn't really a concrete business plan and that ther=
e were unreasonable expectations.=20
There was a culture of aggressiveness in both trading and in the finance de=
partment, and they stepped over the bounds. I'm just surprised there weren'=
t the checks and balances in place. These transactions were going up to boa=
rd level. It wasn't a couple of rogue trades, it was systematic.=20
As for Mr Allario, the level of disaffection among Enron employees has led =
him to think there may be a market out there for a broader website. I was t=
hinking I could sell T-shirts to Boeing employees and turn it into a full s=
ervice site for laid-off workers. I am putting up a 'shredding' T-shirt and=
 I think that will sell well. Andersen's has 84,000 employees worldwide, an=
d it should appeal to them.=20
Laid-off workers wait for a lift outside Enron's office in Houston, Texas, =
last December.

US Treasury Responds To Waxman Request For Enron Info

01/22/2002

(This article was originally published Friday)=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Treasury Department told U.S. Rep. Henry =
Waxman, D-Calif., that it would provide details of its Enron-related dealin=
gs "in an organized, timely and uniform manner" along with all other reques=
ts, according to a letter Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill sent to Waxman Fr=
iday.
Waxman wrote O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans on Jan. 11, asking fo=

e beleaguered energy giant, during 2001. He also asked for more information=
 on potential Enron lobbying activities, and for an explanation for not rel=

Waxman asked for this information by Friday, Jan. 18. O'Neill's late-in-the=

"We are currently devoting our full resources to this endeavor," O'Neill wr=

Many committees and regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over the Enron in=

s from such authorities.=20
"The impact of Enron's demise on its employees and investors is a serious m=

SMARTMONEY.COM: Special Report: Enron Vs. Investors
By Matthew Goldstein

01/22/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

IF ENRON (ENRNQ) is Wall Street's version of Dr. Evil - the arch-villain fr=
om the Austin Powers movies - then the NewPower Holdings (NPW), the deregul=
ated electrical utility that Enron spun off two years ago, looks a little b=
it like a corporate Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's pint-size duplicate.
As much as NewPower executives would like to distance themselves from their=
 wayward founder, it's clear that the two companies are closely tied togeth=
er. At the zenith of Enron's power and influence two years ago, those ties =
were seen in a positive light, and helped smooth the way for NewPower's ini=
tial public offering in October 2000. In particular, the Enron name may hav=
e helped reassure the thousands of individual investors who got a chance to=
 buy shares in NewPower's $579 million IPO, which was one of the last hot s=
tock offerings of the year.=20
But it now appears that investors in the NewPower IPO were walking into a h=
ornet's nest of behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Enron and its mysterious o=
ff-balance sheet sidekick, the LJM2 Co-Investment partnership. And if those=
 investors had known the details of Enron's role, far from being reassured,=
 they probably would've been deeply troubled: Enron, it turns out, was usin=
g complex hedging strategies to reduce its exposure to a drop in the NewPow=
er's stock price. (For more on the workings of LJM2, see The Enron Papers u=
nder code ENRNQ.)=20
In other words, Enron appears to have been seriously worried that NewPower =
- a company that it had created and that it was ushering down the aisle to =
outside investors - would lose significant value, and took steps to protect=
 its $1 billion stake. And that, finance experts say, is highly unusual. "I=
've never heard of people saying, 'How are we going to hedge our ownership =
in...a business you always owned and now you are slowly divesting?'" says K=
enneth Froewiss, a corporate finance professor at New York University's Ste=
rn School of Business.=20
And as it turns out, Enron, which still owns more than 43% of the spinoff, =
had good reason to worry. NewPower did enjoy a 30% pop above its $21 offeri=
ng price on its first day of trading. But the $27 close price of NewPower s=
tock on the day of its IPO was its high-water mark. The stock closed at 42 =
cents on Friday, down more than 98%. The company has never booked a profita=
ble quarter and continues to lose fistfuls of money. With just one million =
residential customers in a smattering of states, NewPower is far from achie=
ving the goal of signing up the 10 million utility customers it had talked =
about around time of the IPO.=20
The irony is that unsuspecting investors were once clamoring to get a piece=
 of NewPower's offering. The deal was something of a showpiece for the two =
big Wall Street investment banks that took NewPower public, Credit Suisse F=
irst Boston and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, which were just about to complet=
e their merger. Immediately after the IPO, the two firms issued a press rel=
ease boasting that the offering "demonstrated their power as a combined fir=
m." And as part of that showpiece, thousands of individual investors who we=
re customers of Donaldson's online brokerage arm, DLJDirect (now CSFBDirect=
), got a chance to buy into the deal. The opportunity looked like a rare bo=
on to retail investors, who are more typically denied early access to such =
offerings, while insiders and favored institutional clients reap most of th=
e benefits.=20
Those online investors, however, could be excused for thinking they were ge=
tting a piece of a good thing. The prospectus boasts that NewPower intends =
"to become the first company to establish a national brand for consumer ene=
rgy and related products and services." At the time of the offering, Enron =
and NewPower were trumpeting a joint marketing agreement with AOL Time Warn=
er (AOL), which gave the fledgling power company an exclusive six-year agre=
ement to try and sell electricity to AOL's 24 million online customers. (AO=
L has since abandoned the agreement.)=20
And then there were those Enron ties. Besides being NewPower's corporate pa=
rent and largest shareholder, the company contributed three of NewPower's d=
irectors, including Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay and Chief Accounting =
Officer Richard Causey. NewPower and Enron even relied on the same big acco=
unting firm, Arthur Andersen, to audit their books.=20
The Enron name certainly seems to have been an important draw for instituti=
onal investors. "We had made some investments with Enron in the past that h=
ad done very well," says James Leech, a senior vice president of the Ontari=
o Teachers pension plan. "There was a respect for their business acumen." T=
oday, the Ontario Teachers' initial $35 million investment in NewPower is w=
orth about $10 million, which translates into a 71% loss on its investment.=
=20
Meanwhile, starting in January 2000, Enron and LJM2 (the Enron off-balance-=
sheet partnership that invested $50 million in the fledgling company) engag=
ed in a sophisticated hedging strategy that "included price-swap derivative=
s, call options and put options" in order to "mitigate market exposures on =
Enron investments, including investments in (NewPower)," according to corpo=
rate filings.=20
For a time, this strategy enabled Enron to convert anywhere from between $1=
00 million to $200 million of its paper wealth in NewPower stock into a ass=
et that could be plopped onto Enron's corporate balance sheet. In 2000, for=
 instance, Enron initially claimed a $39 million net gain on investment fro=
m the sale of NewPower assets, which accounted for roughly five cents of th=
at year's earnings per share. Similar moves with other investments enabled =
Enron to allegedly inflate its profits and hide its debts, practices that u=
ltimately led it to restate its earnings by $600 million and decrease its s=
hareholder equity by some $1.2 billion.=20
But the accounting maneuvers also suggest that Enron executives were concer=
ned about maintaining the value of their NewPower investment, which dates b=
ack to 1997. Its subsidiary, called Enron Energy Services, tried to develop=
 a market for deregulated residential electric power, and that small busine=
ss ultimately became NewPower. At the time of the IPO, NewPower still had f=
ewer than 400,000 customers, limited revenues and a long history of red ink=
. Two years later, it's not doing much better, and its investors are now pa=
ying the price.=20
It's the kind of stuff Dr. Evil would be proud of.=20

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Belgian electricity utility Electrabel SA (B.ELE) co=
nfirmed Monday it wants to take over a Spanish electricity power plant proj=
ect abandoned by Enron.=20
"Electrabel is discussing the Arcos de la Frontera project with Enron," sai=
d Electrabel spokeswoman, Francoise Vanthemsche.
European energy companies have been circling Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) assets s=
ince it collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships u=
sed to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books. But none of the U.S.=
 energy giant's European power stations or building permits have been sold =
off so far.=20
According to Vanthemsche, both technical and legal questions will need to r=
esolved before Electrabel is willing to sign on the dotted line.=20
"We need to be prudent in view of Enron's situation," she said.=20
In July 2000, Enron became the first foreign company to win government appr=
oval to build a power plant in Spain. Work on the 1,200 megawatt cycle gas =
turbine plant, located south of Seville, was due to start in mid 2000. It w=
as expected to cost around EUR450 million.=20
Last summer, Enron signed a long-term contract with Spanish natural gas dis=
tributor Enagas for the delivery of fuel to the plant. The contract, for th=
e regasification and transport of 1.7 billion cubic meters of gas, is due t=
o start in 2004.=20
Accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the court-appointed administrators=

Enron points to need for independent analysts

Analysts must be thrilled. As the war against biased, shabby research was r=
eaching its peak, along came Enron and saved them. Now auditors, not analys=
ts, are Wall Street's favourite whipping boys. Thanks to Arthur Andersen, E=
nron's hapless auditor, the entire accounting profession faces regulation t=
o prevent conflicts of interest.=20
In reality, there were no heroes in the Enron debacle and analysts were no =
exception. As late as October, many months after the Enron began its slide =
to oblivion, 16 out of 17 securities analysts who covered the company had "=
buy" or "strong buy" ratings on the stock. Credit Suisse First Boston kept =
a "strong buy" on Enron until late November, only a few days before its ban=
kruptcy filing. While analysts, like auditors, argue that they can't be exp=
ected to be fraud detectors, you've got to wonder why they maintained their=
 bullish stances so late in the game. Enron just didn't fall off a cliff. T=
he shares peaked at $87.25 (U.S.) in mid-2000 and were in rapid decline by =
last spring. Something was clearly rotten at the world's biggest energy tra=
der well before the market officially learned in the autumn that its financ=
ial statements were meaningless.
Enron came just as investors were beginning to think that analysts were get=
ting better at their jobs after a generally shameful performance during the=
 bubble years. In the late 1990s, all-star analysts, such as Henry Blodget,=
 could propel Internet stocks into orbit simply by saying they deserved to =
be there. The hard, number-crunching analysis to justify the targets was ei=
ther missing or laughable.=20
When the Internet economy came crashing down to earth, investors demanded b=
lood, which was laughable itself. For years, as analysts operated as if the=
y were the marketing arms of their employers' corporate finance departments=
 -- most analysts, in fact, got paid out of that department's profits -- in=
vestors didn't balk because stocks kept rising. When the inevitable happene=
d, analysts were suddenly discovered to be hopelessly conflicted corporate =
shills. The Securities and Exchange Commission got on their case, congressi=
onal hearings into their conduct were held and investors launched lawsuits.=
 Mr. Blodget left Merrill Lynch last year after Merrill settled an arbitrat=
ion case launched by a New York investor who alleged conflict of interest o=
n the analyst's part.=20
In the past year or so, the anecdotal evidence suggests that equity researc=
h has improved somewhat. The number of sell recommendations, historically f=
ewer than 1 per cent of the total number of analysts' recommendations, has =
crept up, although they probably don't exceed 3 per cent.=20
The embarrassment of having put "strong buy" calls on dubious tech and Inte=
rnet stocks seems to be putting pressure on the surviving analysts to do pr=
oper research. Some are getting more imaginative. National Bank of Canada, =
for example, uses a return on capital analysis to help value banks, on the =
belief that the standard return on equity ratio can be too easily manipulat=
ed.=20
Meanwhile, the SEC's fair disclosure rules are putting all analysts on an e=
qual footing and making them work harder. Whisper guidance from the chief f=
inancial officer, which many analysts would use as a crutch, is taboo.=20
Then along came Enron and you wonder whether the quality of research really=
 has improved. At the margins, it probably has. In general, though, researc=
h has a long way to go before it becomes more reliable. The reason it hasn'=
t is simple: Analysts' pay structure, for the most part, remains the same.=
=20
Arthur Andersen got into trouble because of an apparent conflict of interes=
t. Enron was paying it as a consultant as well as an auditor. Theoretically=
, if the auditing side had exposed funny accounting gimmicks, the consultin=
g side would be out of a job for a net loss in income for Arthur Andersen.=
=20
Analysts also have built-in conflicts. Much, perhaps most, of their income =
comes from the corporate finance department. Corporate finance showers the =
analysts with riches if they attract clients who generate fees from underwr=
itings, acquisitions and the like. Analysts know that a bearish report risk=
s alienating a client, which helps to explain why most of them didn't turn =
negative on Enron until it was obvious the company had no hope of recoverin=
g.=20
In the end, the best way to assure a steady improvement in research is to m=
ake analysts truly independent. That means overhauling their pay structure =
to separate them from the corporate finance business. Will it happen? Don't=
 count on it. If another Enron happens, though, analysts may find that regu=
lators will force independence on them.=20

Washington politicians are demanding answers and heads in the Enron debacle=
. State lawmakers are launching suits with the zeal of ambulance chasers in=
 an effort to recover hundreds of millions lost by their pension funds. Pol=
ice are sifting through what's left of the shredded paper trails in search =
of crooks; and the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission =
has suddenly found religion when it comes to auditing.=20
All of the official sound and fury that has erupted in the wake of the wors=
t stock market scandal in modern times is supposed to make us feel good abo=
ut the transparency, strict regulation and basic honesty of the world's bus=
iest capital markets.
Sure, the occasional rotten apple shows up in the American barrel, but look=
 how swift the pursuit is, and how terrible the punishment. People will pay=
, heads will roll and it will never, never happen again. Until the next tim=
e.=20
The sad truth is that Enron is not an isolated exception -- apart from its =
unprecedented size and scale and the fact that every one of the checks and =
balances designed to protect the investing public failed to do the job.=20
The reality is that while the bulk of the players at the vast U.S. capital =
markets table are free of taint, there are plenty of people who play fast a=

even when they get caught, they usually get off pretty lightly. What's a li=
ttle embarrassment, a few legal bills and the occasional small financial pe=
nalty when millions of dollars are at stake?=20
Just the other day, Donald Trump's casino company reached a settlement over=
 what regulators said was misleading information given to the public . . . =
in 1999. The SEC trumpeted the case as the first stemming from a crackdown =
on the growing corporate habit of massaging financial results to make thing=
s look better than they really are.=20
Yet Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts paid no financial penalty -- unlike the i=
nvestors who rushed to buy the stock on the apparent good news. In fact, th=
e company didn't even have to acknowledge that it had done anything wrong. =
It merely promised not to do it again.=20
This, despite the fact that the actions of three senior officers (but not M=
r. Trump, who was chairman at the time) caused the company to violate "the =
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act by knowingly or reckle=
ssly issuing a materially misleading press release."=20
Then we have the developing saga of ImClone Systems.=20
While Enron has been grabbing all the headlines, ImClone is coming up fast =
on the outside. The once hot biotech firm faces a rash of shareholder lawsu=
its and a probe by one of the same congressional committees investigating E=
nron. News of the investigation and other concerns about the company sent t=
he stock tumbling 30 per cent on Friday. Its stock has plunged to $21.15 fr=
om a high of $75.45 just six weeks ago.=20
At issue is whether ImClone misled investors about Erbitux, a potentially p=
romising treatment for colorectal cancer. When its stock was still riding h=
igh, the company learned that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had ref=
used to look at its application to market the drug. The company revealed th=
e FDA's concerns on Dec. 28.=20
The FDA had earlier agreed to a quick review once it accepted the applicati=
on, and analysts expected that the potential blockbuster drug would hit the=
 market by midyear.=20
Further buoying investor optimism was the fact pharmaceutical giant Bristol=
-Myers Squibb had acquired a 20-per-cent stake in the company in September,=
 just to get its hands on the experimental drug. Bristol-Myers, which paid =
$70 a share for its stake, now faces hard questions about the quality of it=
s due diligence. But it's big enough to take care of itself, and it can aff=
ord to wait for results.=20
Biotech is an inherently risky game, but it becomes a lot riskier when inve=
stors don't have access to material information.=20
The FDA's rejection letter revealed that ImClone's testing procedure was fl=
awed and that new clinical trials might be required. The company says it re=
mains confident in the drug and that the FDA's questions concerned data col=
lection. But the fact is that approval might be delayed for a considerable =
time, something investors had a right to know.=20
Another point worth noting about ImClone: The company's chief executive off=
icer, Samuel Waksal, and his brother, Harlan, the chief operating officer, =
picked up more than $110-million (U.S.) from tendering shares to Bristol-My=
ers. Harlan Waksal pocketed another $50-million from share sales in Decembe=
r.=20
Now the Waksals, like Enron's honchos, face a public grilling by a bunch of=
 Washington politicians. This admittedly cruel form of torture may turn out=
 to be the worst punishment meted out to any of them by the supposedly toug=

WASHINGTON - With accounting firm Arthur Andersen mired in controversy over=
 its audit of collapsed trading giant Enron Corp., a U.S. senator announced=
 plans yesterday to introduce a bill to ensure auditors remain independent.=
=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said accounting firms should be =
banned from providing management consulting services for the companies that=
 they audit.
"The American people have a right to expect that the firms that audit the c=
ompanies they invest in are free from conflicts of interest," she said .=20
"These conflicts have led to the kind of hide-the-debt shell game that took=
 place at Enron," added Ms. Boxer, who has also proposed legislation to pro=
tect other U.S. workers from the retirement savings meltdown suffered by En=
ron employees.=20
Enron -- once the world's largest energy trader -- plummeted from Wall Stre=
et's lofty heights to the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec.=
 2. Its downfall threw thousands out of work, wiped out workers' retirement=
 savings and hammered investors.=20
As Enron's auditor, Andersen signed off on accounting practices that hid bi=
llions of dollars in off-balance-sheet debt and led to a US$600-million red=
uction of four years' worth of earnings.=20
Andersen may have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to resolve civil l=
awsuits over the accounting firm's audits of Enron, and its survival might =
be threatened, legal and bankruptcy experts said yesterday.=20
The risk to Andersen would increase if it's indicted or any of its 4,800 pa=
rtners admit criminal wrongdoing for such acts as destroying documents rela=
ted to Enron's audits, experts said.=20
Shareholders, creditors and others who lost US$60-billion in Enron's collap=
se hope that Andersen's "deep pockets" will offer more than the energy trad=
er, which sought bankruptcy protection.=20
"We could be looking at hundreds of millions of potential liability," said =
Stephen Presser, a professor of law and business at Northwestern University=
. "If ever there is a criminal conviction, the civil case becomes a cakewal=
k."=20
Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, sold stock in the company prior to its filing fo=
r bankruptcy protection because he needed cash, not because he wanted to ba=
il out, his lawyer told The New York Times yesterday.=20
Lawyer Earl Silbert told the daily that Mr. Lay had sold his shares at leas=
t 15 times in 2001 in order to repay US$4-million of loans.=20
The acknowledgment "has fueled concern that [Mr. Lay] was exiting his posit=
ion as he was encouraging others to buy," the Times said.=20
According to the daily, in early 2001 Mr. Lay sold shares "on every busines=
s day" making a profit of US$21-million.=20
He stopped selling in July when the value of the stock fell to half its val=
ue.=20
On Sept. 26, Mr. Lay used an Internet chat forum to encourage Enron employe=
es to buy shares as the stock was "an incredible bargain", adding that the =
stock value would increase 800% in the next decade, the Times wrote.

Politically Sensitive Enron Items Pulled Off EBay Friday
By Kathy Chu

01/22/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20
(This report was first published late Monday.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It seemed to be a catchy slogan for a political butt=
on: the words "Watergate," "Irangate" and "Enrongate" emblazoned upon an im=
age of a paper shredder.
At least, that's what Keith Shirey, a button maker and retired California p=
rofessor, thought when he designed this product and listed it on eBay Inc. =
(EBAY) last week.=20
But apparently, the online auction site didn't find these items so humorous=
, because three of Shirey's satirical buttons were yanked off the site Frid=
ay.=20
It was a move that Shirey found difficult to understand, given the prevalen=
ce of jokes about Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) since the company collapsed in early =
December, and filed for the largest bankruptcy in corporate history.=20
Kevin Pursgrove, a spokesman for the online auction giant, said Monday that=
 the company "periodically" removes items when the seller "is using a listi=
ng space for an item to make a social commentary."=20
In a Friday e-mail to Shirey, eBay had noted that "(t)he sale of items offe=
ring social commentary about Enron are not currently permitted for sale on =
eBay at this time."=20
The buttons, according to the company, were "inappropriate for listing."=20
But after being pressed about the company's policies, Pursgrove announced l=
ate Monday that eBay had reversed its decision and plans to notify the sell=
er that these buttons may be relisted.=20
"It was a judgment call," he said. "The person who made the decision at the=
 time (to remove the items) may have believed the language was gratuitous a=
nd inflammatory."=20
It was the description of these items - rather than the products themselves=
 - that prompted the removal, according to Pursgrove.=20
Shirey, to promote the "Enrongate" button, had stated in his listing that t=
here's a "national scandal of the new century." Other buttons designed by S=
hirey and removed from eBay's site last week had Enron's symbol, the letter=
 E, with the middle finger extended or the symbol stamped on an elephant's =
backside.=20
The self-described liberal - who has been designing buttons for the past tw=
o-and-a-half years, offering political commentary about topics ranging from=
 taxation to sweatshops and the post Sept. 11 atmosphere - hopes to get the=
 buttons back for sale on the site as soon as possible. So far, he's unload=
ed about a dozen of them.=20
The eBay spokesman said the buttons will be permitted to reappear on the si=
te "soon," but couldn't give a timeline.=20
"I'm glad they've decided to let me sell them," said Shirey, who makes abou=
t $350 a month from selling various buttons on eBay and on a personal Web s=
ite. "It's devastating not to be able to express yourself."=20
It's not the first time that eBay has censored items from its auction site.=
=20
The company, after the World Trade Center attacks, temporarily banned some =
items that alluded to the events, including a pin designed by Shirey that p=
ortrayed Osama Bin Laden with a red slash across his face.=20
Also, eBay has deleted hundreds of neo-Nazi products listed for sale since =
May, after being alerted to them by the media and the German government.=20
But the company's latest move to ban Enron-related buttons from the site is=
 surprising, and could be a cause for concern if it continues, according to=
 legal experts.=20
"The question is, if eBay is going to begin to exercise editorial control f=
or items like this, you have to wonder, what other things will they try to =
exercise control over?" said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford U=
niversity.=20
There's also another issue.=20
"(Censoring items) is so contrary to eBay's beginning and to their success =
- that it's an open platform," said Megan E. Gray, a lawyer with Baker & Ho=
stetler in Los Angeles.=20

GETTING PERSONAL: 401(k) Woes? Might Be Your Own Fault
By Kaja Whitehouse

01/22/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20
(This column was originally published Friday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) debacle has some people thin=
king "401(k)" is the newest four-letter word.
Actually, though, many employees have no one to blame for their 401(k) prob=
lems but themselves.=20
Washington is abuzz with talk of "reform" of the 401(k) system, with lawmak=
ers using the Enron bankruptcy - where thousands of employees lost large ch=
unks of their nest eggs - as a chance to fiddle with plan designs.=20
To truly free investors of risk, legislators would have to send the 401(k) =
the way of the pension, and that is unlikely. By definition, defined-contri=
bution plans were meant to allow people to save as much as possible and pla=
ce that money in investment funds most suitable to their needs. Pension pla=
ns, on the other hand, promise to pay out a certain amount when workers ret=
ire, depending on how many years they worked for a company.=20
At best, our public officials will cap the amount of company stock in which=
 a person can invest in a retirement plan. But that won't solve other probl=
ems, such as workers' failure to diversify or to switch to more conservativ=
e investments as they age.=20
Call it a consequence of free will. Some people just don't pay enough atten=
tion to how they save for retirement. Here's the best example: The period f=
rom 1999 to 2000 was volatile for markets, but investors did nothing to shi=
eld their retirement savings. Rather, the average asset allocation of 401(k=
) participants remained the same in that period, according to a November st=
udy by the trade groups Employee Benefits Research Institute and the Invest=
ment Company Institute.=20
Despite the newfound attention, it's not a new phenomenon, said Tom Samuels=
, chief investment officer at Stavis, Margolis Advisory Services. About 50%=
 of the people who walk into the Houston firm have "picked an allocation wh=
en they started and let it go on autopilot," he said.=20
Other Options Available=20

Accepting a 401(k) plan should entail taking the time to make sure assets a=
re invested wisely. The 401(k) is a great investment vehicle, "but if it's =
not used properly, it doesn't work," said Thomas Endersbe, a certified fina=
ncial planner with American Express in St. Paul, Minn.=20
People who don't have the time to care for their 401(k) plan should conside=
r other options. A lot of plan sponsors also offer pensions, which are cons=
idered safer because they are backed by federal insurance. "If 60% of your =
retirement income is replaced by a (pension), maybe you can take a more cas=
ual view of your 401(k)," said Janna Gjesdal, associate editor of the Insti=
tute of Management & Administration, a New York research firm.=20
Understandably, some people just might not like the investment options offe=
red by their 401(k) plan, especially if it's too tied up in company stock.=
=20
If your employee match is limited to company stock that you can't convert f=
or some time, as it was for Enron's employees, stay away from investing add=
itional dollars in the company. This may mean forgoing company stock purcha=
se plans that allow workers to buy company shares cheap.=20
Also, when adding up your assets, exclude significant stock holdings until =
the cash is in your hands. This will force you to build up assets in other =
areas.=20
Don't forget Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, as a diversification =
tool. Contribution limits for an IRA are much smaller - $3,000 this year co=
mpared with $11,000 for a 401(k) - but anyone can invest in one, and the in=
vestment options are much wider.=20

Diversify, Diversify, Diversify=20

As with all investment, diversification and asset allocation are key in ret=
irement planning. Stavis, Margolis Advisory's Samuels said his firm has bee=
n dealing with diversity issues in 401(k) accounts long before Enron collap=
sed.=20
The Houston firm often works with employees of area technology companies su=
ch as Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Dell Computer Corp. (DELL), many of w=
hom had to extend their working life because their retirement savings weren=
't diversified.=20
Samuels' clients were often given company shares, but many people also cont=
inued to buy additional shares on their own, he said. His clients weren't b=
arred from selling their stock early like Enron workers were, but they stil=
l saw their retirement plans blow up in smoke when the tech bubble burst in=
 March 2000.=20
"It's psychological," he said. "Everybody wants to be part of a team. And w=
hen you have a team that is on the front lines," it's easy to get caught up=
, he said.=20
And when it's not one stock that investors load up on, it's one type of sto=
ck, financial advisers said. Getting people to diversify away from pure tec=
hnology holdings, for example, has been an ongoing battle, they added.=20
It's a wider problem than most people think. Of 219 401(k) plans studied by=
 the research firm IOMA, 25 had more than 60% of their assets "wrapped up" =
in company stock. In fact, Enron's plan holdings - where 57% were invested =
in its own stock - might be considered well-diversified compared with those=
 at big firms such as Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW)=
 and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), where company stock makes up more than 90% =
of each plan's assets, according to the IOMA survey.=20
One area where legislation might help is in encouraging companies to offer =
investment advice to their employees. Currently, most 401(k) plan participa=
nts go it alone when investing because plan sponsors are fearful of liabili=
ty for advice that leads to losses.=20
The Enron case was a disaster, but it could have a silver lining, said Samu=
els. "It will be very good for people to pay attention to their retirement,=
 and to realize that diversification is not just a word financial professio=
nals throw around."=20

Enron: No Taxes . . .

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

I recently had dinner with a very rich man -- a multimillionaire for sure, =
maybe a billionaire. He described one of his recent deals, how he had taken=
 a small company, added all sorts of doodads to it, done this and done that=
 (pardon the technical terminology) -- and sold it for an astounding amount=
 of money. He then confided his business philosophy: Pay no taxes.=20
As it happens, that's precisely my own business philosophy. Only I have bee=
n unable to implement it. All the years I've been in business, which is to =
say working for a living, I have paid federal, state and local taxes -- and=
 I resent, loathe and even hate anyone who manages not to.
I am talking Enron here. It paid no federal corporate income taxes in four =
of the past five years. It managed that while reporting profits that turned=
 its stock from a stodgy performer to a Wall Street high-flyer, enabling it=
s executives and board members to sell more than $1 billion in stock in tha=
t period. Most of that time, Enron paid nothing to Uncle Sam.=20
How did it manage to do this? Let me count the ways. Enron set up almost 90=
0 subsidiaries in tax havens. I am referring to the Cayman Islands, the Tur=
ks and Caicos, Mauritius and Bermuda, places with nice beaches and banks th=
at ask no questions. Using those secret partnerships we now know about, the=
 company buried its profits under the palm trees, like the pirates of old.=
=20
At the same time, Enron was able to deduct the cost of stock options. So th=
e many millions that Enron's executives and board members received in optio=
ns were deducted for tax purposes. In the year 2000, for instance, a tax bi=
ll of $112 million turned into a refund of $278 million.=20
Enron billed itself as the quintessential American company. It adapted to t=
he new era and the New Economy. It traded in a virtual intangible, energy -=
- by taking electricity from there and selling it here. But it was quintess=
entially American in another way: It talked rugged individualism, but when =
things got tough, the tough didn't get going. They put out their hand.=20
The taxes that Enron did not pay -- that's your money. (You had to make up =
for it.) The $254 million in the Republican-sponsored stimulus plan -- that=
 would have been your money, too, had it become law. It was awfully good of=
 you, Mr. and Mrs. America, to subsidize the stock options that Enron's big=
gies got for their hard work or, in the case of its board, for merely showi=
ng up and asking no questions.=20
What we have here is an updated form of feudalism. Enron supported many cha=
rities and cultural institutions -- but only the ones it chose. It put its =
name on a stadium -- but, again, only the one it chose. It basked in the gr=
atitude it received for such largess -- All hail Enron -- and it felt it ow=
ed nothing to the community at large. This is what taxes are about. You eve=
n support institutions that don't have your name on them -- the welfare dep=
artment, for instance.=20
I am about to get letters of reprimand. Enron did nothing illegal. I know t=
hat. Avoiding taxes was smart -- and, while not commonplace, not unknown, e=
ither. I know that, too. Some other Fortune 500 companies also paid no fede=
ral taxes.=20
In fact, I sense that everything Enron did was legal and that an entire com=
pany can collapse, some people getting very rich and others losing everythi=
ng they had, and no one will ever go to jail. Enron failed because "the eco=
nomics didn't work." So said Joseph Berardino, the chief executive of Arthu=
r Andersen, the accounting firm that ought to make the three monkeys its co=
rporate symbol.=20
But legal is not the same as right. It is simply not right that Enron paid =
no taxes while, just to pick an example, its now-broke former employees did=
. It's not right that an American company -- and oh, how American Enron was=
 -- should act like a drug dealer, laundering its money so that a profit so=
mehow becomes a loss. This is clever accounting, I grant you. It is, howeve=
r, obscene.=20
For so much of what Enron and Arthur Andersen did, the phrase it is not rig=
ht seems apt. And the more you hear the likes of Berardino explain how ever=
ything done was legal and up to the highest ethical standards, the more you=
 understand that this is not a scandal about a single company, but a reflec=
tion of a society in which the rules you think apply to everyone actually d=
on't. Most people pay taxes, but some don't -- and the ones who pay subsidi=
ze the ones who don't.=20
I suppose you can call that a business philosophy. I call it a rip-off.

GEORGE W. CLINTON? IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT BUSH'S ENRON DEFENSE IS `BILL DID I=
T, TOO'

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer also discouraged "comparisons to the wa=
y business used to be done in the White House." He said, "We do our busines=
s a little differently."=20
-- Washington Times, Jan. 13, 2002
Fleischer said the administration's actions had nothing to do with Enron's =
political contributions. He noted that the Clinton administration had acted=
 in a similar manner in Dabhol.=20
-- Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2002=20
You've got to feel for Ari Fleischer. The administration's strategy for con=
taining the political impact of the Enron collapse requires him to contradi=
ct himself on a regular basis.=20
In general, Fleischer is supposed to say that the Bush administration is cl=
early more moral, decent and ethical than the Clinton administration, As a =
result, the rules of investigation and disclosure that Republicans applied =
to the previous administration don't apply to this one. The days of investi=
gation are over.=20
But if it's disclosed that the Bush administration did a favor for Enron, t=
he defense is that the Bush administration did just what the Clinton admini=
stration did and therefore should be held blameless. In the second example =
above, Fleischer is defending assistance the White House gave Enron in a di=
spute with the Indian government over the Dabhol power plant.=20
The Bush administration, you see, should be given a pass because it's so di=
fferent from the Clinton administration, except on days when it should be g=
iven a pass because it's so similar to the Clinton administration.=20
Remember the scorn Republicans used to pour onto what they disdainfully cal=
led the "everybody does it" defense during the various Clinton scandals? Th=
e party's leading moral philosopher, William Bennett, put it forcefully. "T=
he worst argument that's out there," he told Tim Russert in 1998, "the one =
that bothers me the most in the public is `They all do it.' " Bennett argue=
d that "cynicism about politics actually has made people lower the standard=
 for politicians and presidents."=20
But with Enron, the "everybody does it" defense lives again. Wasn't Enron o=
ne of President Bush's leading contributors? Didn't Enron give close to thr=
ee-quarters of its campaign contributions to Republicans? Forget about it. =
"Clearly Enron is a corporation that has given hundreds of thousands of dol=
lars to both parties," the indefatigable Fleischer told The Washington Time=
s.=20
"They are all living in a glass house," Mary Matalin, Vice President Dick C=
heney's counselor, told The New York Times. "How far are they going to go w=
ith guilt by contribution?"=20
Contrast this view with the tough ethical stance taken by Sen. Susan Collin=
s, a Maine Republican, during the 1997 Senate hearings on campaign finance =
abuses in the previous election, the one in which Clinton was re-elected. "=
My Democratic colleagues must show a willingness to go where the evidence l=
eads and to not restrict the committee's ability to gather information," sh=
e said. "They must also resist the temptation to make dissimilar conduct lo=
ok similar in an effort to dismiss serious legal and ethical breaches with =
the time- worn excuse that `everybody does it.' The White House, and others=
 under scrutiny, must be much more forthcoming."=20
At the same hearings, Sen. Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, noted that =
some of his colleagues "have said or kind of implied, `Well, both parties h=
ave kind of pushed the envelope.' Maybe that's true, but I think in this ca=
se, this administration in many, many cases, and some individuals, leading =
to the highest individuals in the White House, have moved beyond pushing th=
e envelope."=20
And here is where the Bush-isn't-Clinton defense kicks back in: There's no =
evidence that what Bush did is in any way comparable to Clinton's abuses.=
=20
Therefore, congressional demands for more information, such as the release =
of the records from Cheney's energy task force, can be dismissed by Fleisch=
er as part of a "fishing expedition." But what about Collins' sensible argu=
ment that the party in power must be willing to go where the evidence leads=
? Does that view apply only when Democrats are in the White House?=20
Let us assume that Democrats as well as Republicans will have to answer for=
 any special favors they did for Enron. Let us further assume that the pres=
ident's defenders are absolutely right and that no abuses of power will be =
discovered in the Bush administration.=20
In that case, the administration should have no problem following the Colli=
ns Principles of full disclosure and cooperation. In the meantime, the Whit=
e House should give poor Ari Fleischer a break and allow him to come up wit=
h a less contradictory set of talking points.

Corruption festered in the dark

Copyright (c) 2002 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.

As reporters systematically uncover the links between Enron Corp., its acco=
untants and virtually every politician with a pulse, the multiplying connec=
tions can obscure as much as they reveal.=20
In many quarters, the story is being portrayed as a simple morality tale of=
 how money corrupts politics. Yet the lesson of Enron's experience in Washi=
ngton is more complex. Money always matters, but it matters most when the m=
edia and public are not watching the decisions money is meant to manipulate=
. If there's a wake-up call here for politicians, there's also a ringing al=
arm for reporters and voters to pay more attention to what their government=
 does. Because, more often than not, such public scrutiny is the only offse=
t to the power of special-interest cash.
Campaign-reform advocates often act as if the way to understand everything =
that happens in Washington is to just follow the money. But money is only o=
ne of several ingredients that produce decisions in Washington.=20
Ideology and even principle matter at least as much. So do electoral calcul=
ations. Big donors win more than their fair share of political disputes. Bu=
t when a problem provokes an unambiguous public demand for action, even the=
 most powerful contributors and supporters can get rolled.=20
If contributions were always the decisive weapon in political arguments, th=
ere would be no Occupational Safety and Health Administration, no Food and =
Drug Administration, no Clean Air Act, no Medicare (which the medical indus=
try adamantly resisted), no ban on assault weapons and no fair lending laws=
. Each time, well-heeled interest groups resisting changes were abandoned b=
y politicians who feared disappointing an engaged public.=20
The same thing happened to Enron last summer. For months, opposition from E=
nron helped block price controls on the wholesale electricity sales that ha=
d become an important profit centre for the company. But when soaring power=
 prices in the West generated enough outrage to prompt Congress to begin se=
riously discussing controls, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rever=
sed itself, swallowed its deregulatory instincts and approved the caps.=20
It's when the media and public aren't watching that money really talks. The=
 Enron scandal illuminates this basic truth of Washington life: the more ob=
scure the issue, the greater the leverage of special interests. Put another=
 way, there's an inverse relationship between the amount of public and medi=
a attention a Washington decision attracts and the ability of special inter=
ests to shape the result.=20
The Enron story underscores this. Today, many in Washington consider the An=
dersen accounting firm's dual role as auditor and management consultant for=
 Enron a conflict of interest. But that didn't seem so obvious when the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission tried to ban such double-dipping toward the=
 end of the Clinton administration. The accounting industry mobilized a hug=
e campaign against a proposal by then-SEC chairman Arthur Levitt to bar acc=
ounting firms from auditing and consulting for the same clients. Last week,=
 USA Today revealed that at least 50 members of Congress wrote the SEC in 2=
000 opposing the rule.=20
Their fervour may have been at least somewhat stoked by the $53.4 million U=
S that, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the accounting ind=
ustry has contributed to candidates for federal office since 1990.=20
The fight over the SEC proposal proved no contest. Most pressure came from =
the accounting industry and its allies; with the media paying little notice=
, there wasn't enough public engagement to offset the industry muscle. Levi=
tt was forced to back down and Andersen was free to wear two hats at Enron.=
=20
Scandals change the balance of power on obscure but critical decisions by w=
idening the circle of interest. For politicians, siding with the demands of=
 a special pleader suddenly carries not only benefits (campaign contributio=
ns) but costs. To stand with Enron now is to stand against workers and reti=
rees who were financially crippled by the company's collapse. That makes th=
e money less persuasive.=20
Scandals can make practices long tolerated suddenly unacceptable. But the b=
etter answer is greater public scrutiny of legislative and regulatory favou=
rs for special interests. Lots of people and institutions failed in the Enr=
on mess. A distracted media and public were among them.

Imagine this scenario: Arthur Andersen refuses to sign off on Enron's off-t=
he-books partnerships. The partnerships make Enron look a lot richer than i=
t really is, but they represent a huge liability that could sink the compan=
y. They may comply with the letter of the law, Andersen bluntly tells the c=
lient, but not the spirit.=20
What would have happened next? Andersen might have lost a client, but would=
 have kept its professional reputation. Enron might have found a more compl=
iant auditor. Or it might have had to disclose the partnerships and restate=
 earnings. Given those more realistic numbers, investors likely would have =
pummeled the stock.
We'll never know, but it's unlikely these two names would be linked in scan=
dal the way they are today. The reality, of course, is Andersen did sign of=
f. Now it's fighting for its professional life and Enron is in bankruptcy c=
ourt.=20
At the heart of the implosion of the nation's 7th largest corporation lie a=
ggressive accounting practices. That's the kind of accounting you get when =
two plus two adds up to four--or whatever total you, the client, would like=
. Accounting isn't just math; it also means making judgment calls about wha=
t the rules allow.=20
Aggressive accounting isn't illegal, but it should be when it tells investo=
rs that red is black. At the very least, investors ought to be made aware o=
f the risks such accounting poses. This goes far beyond Enron and Arthur An=
dersen. They are not the only companies that pushed the accounting envelope=
 in the sizzling 1990s--Sunbeam, Cendant, Waste Management and Rite Aid com=
e to mind. The cover story of the Jan. 21 Business Week calls into question=
 Cisco Systems' own use of aggressive accounting.=20
But this funhouse math has taken a staggering toll on the credibility of th=
e accounting profession. Investor-based capitalism fuels the U.S. economy. =
If investors can't believe the "official" numbers, the whole system is unde=
rmined.=20
In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, the federal government began re=
quiring accounting firms to audit the books of companies that sell shares t=
o the public. They are supposed to serve the public interest--that's the "P=
" in Certified Public Accountant.=20
They are also supposed to be independent. But because they are paid by thei=
r clients, potential conflicts of interest have always existed. Those worse=
ned over the last decade as accounting firms came to rely increasingly on c=
onsulting fees from the same companies that they audited.=20
The past decade was also characterized by a Wall Street boom. Rising stock =
prices were supported by ever-rising quarterly earnings justified by ever-b=
righter prospects ahead. Once the market bubble burst and the economy slowe=
d, the only way for some companies to get those results was to aggressively=
 exploit the rules. To keep their clients happy--and those fees coming in--=
accounting firms were eager to help.=20
Led by the Big 5 firms--Arthur Andersen, KPMG, Deloitte & Touche, Pricewate=
rhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young--the profession for years has argued it can=
 police itself. It has now proved that it can't. Stricter oversight is nece=
ssary. It's time to put the "public" interest back into accounting. There m=
ust be real consequences for firms that fail in that duty.=20
Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt saw the co=
nflict of interest problem looming ever larger and sought to sharply restri=
ct the amount of consulting business accounting firms could perform for the=
ir audit clients. He lost. But he succeeded in forcing disclosure of how mu=
ch companies were paying in fees for consulting and auditing services. That=
 helps identify the scope of the problem.=20
SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt proposed that accounting firms be policed by a pri=
vate oversight board that would operate under the auspices of the SEC. That=
's a good idea, but to make it effective Pitt should push for tighter finan=
cial reporting and more disclosure to investors. The SEC can reduce the amb=
iguities.=20
Potential risks should be clearly spelled out. If a company's fortunes rely=
 on application of critical accounting principles, investors should know th=
at. They should also be told what the financial impact would be if those pr=
inciples were applied differently. All that would help. But if a company is=
 hell-bent on skirting the rules, there is little the regulators can do. Th=
at's where the regulators bow out and the prosecutors step in.=20
The Justice Department has launched a criminal inquiry into the failure of =
Enron. Several congressional panels will be probing. The number of civil la=
wsuits grows by the day. One suspects that the prospect of prison and hefty=
 civil judgments will be far more sobering for the accounting industry than=
 the threat of more rule- making from the SEC.

IS ENRON a big story? The media sure think so. The Washington Post, for exa=
mple, has run 119 stories using the word "Enron" just in the last two weeks=
.=20
But will the collapse of a company in Houston damage the man in the White H=
ouse? The president doesn't seem worried, and his arrogant and careless att=
itude toward disclosure and appointments proves it.
The Post, which turned Watergate from a third-rate burglary into a first-ra=
te impeachment, should not be underestimated. And the rest of the press cor=
ps wants its pound of George W. Bush, too. So maybe the president should re=
assess.=20
Let's consider disclosure first. Reporters naturally want the White House t=
o hand over any document with an "e" in it, but press secretary Ari Fleisch=
er demurs, citing constitutional doctrine. "There is a very important princ=
iple involved here," he said last week.=20
But sometimes the principle must yield to the practical; as Ellen Ratner, a=
 White House reporter who makes no secret of her liberal sympathies, argues=
, "The Clinton White House had to fork over all its records on Hillary's he=
alth care task force and Bill's China coffees, and so now it's Bush's turn =
to fully disclose."=20
Indeed, the problem for the Bush people is that as long as they're holding =
anything back, their critics are free to assert the worst. And so here's a =
prediction - actually, two of them. The White House will eventually reveal =
everything and, when everything is revealed, it won't look so bad. After al=
l, the key energy policy player, Vice President Dick Cheney, is famously ca=
reful. In the unlikely event he sold out to Enron behind the scenes, it's e=
ven more unlikely he left a paper trail proving same.=20
And if uncovered documents simply add minor detail to what's already known =
- that Cheney, for example, lobbied India on Enron's behalf - then it would=
 be up to Bush's war-roomers to barrage the country with reminders that the=
 Clinton White House pressured not only India, but also Bosnia, Croatia and=
 Mozambique at Enron's urging.=20
Two wrongs might not make a right, but in politics they tend to cancel each=
 other out.=20
The second issue, more problematic for the incumbent White House, is appoin=
tments. Mark Racicot, the former governor of Montana, was Bush's pick to be=
 chairman of the Republican National Committee - and a bad choice at that. =
Racicot became controversial immediately because he planned to continue his=
 lucrative Washington lobbying practice, even as he led the GOP.=20
After much criticism - notably from conservative columnist Robert Novak - R=
acicot announced that he would not lobby but would still collect a paycheck=
 from his lobbying firm.=20
Got that? Moreover, Racicot's firm, Houston-based Bracewell & Patterson, ha=
d represented Enron. A bad rap? Guilt by association? Maybe, but that's pol=
itics. Thus the headline in Friday's Chicago Tribune: "New GOP Leader Faces=
 Enron Cloud." And as CNN's Candy Crowley reported from Austin, at Racicot'=
s first news conference as Republican chairman, every question but one conc=
erned Enron.=20
On Fox News's "Beltway Boys" show over the weekend, both "boys" - Morton Ko=
ndracke and Fred Barnes - agreed that Racicot deserved a "down" pundit arro=
w. Barnes, who's about as pro-Bush as any pressie, was nonetheless blunt in=
 his criticism of the choice for party chief: "This is such a bad idea. I d=
on't know why George Bush, the president, insists on it. Anybody can be Rep=
ublican national chairman."=20
Barnes is right on both points. First, the White House controls the party; =
the 165-member Republican National Committee has about as much independent =
authority as the Supreme Soviet under Josef Stalin. And, second, since the =
big political decisions are made by the president's advisers, the GOP top j=
ob requires merely rote speechmaking and money-raising. Which is to say, Bu=
sh could have found a non-tainted non-lobbyist to take up those chores.=20
So while the Republicans are well-positioned on most of the big issues - th=
e war against terror has gone well, and the battle against Democratic tax-i=
ncrease plans is going well - Bush & Co. could yet trip up over Enron-gate.=
=20
And that would be a familiar tale: The commander in chief, having done many=
 things right, wrongly concludes that he can do everything right. Hubris ma=
y be inevitable at the pinnacle of power, but presidents should strive to s=
tave off its symptoms till the second term.

The flowering of the Enron bankruptcy scandal has reintroduced a strange an=
imal to the White House briefing room: the press corps foil.=20
The use of foils, a technique popularized by Clinton press secretaries Mike=
 McCurry and Joe Lockhart, involves the careful selection of questioners fr=
om among the many raised hands to steer the briefing in a direction the pre=
ss secretary desires.
Want to change the subject to foreign affairs? Call on Raghubir Goyal of th=
e India Globe (he'll ask about the perfidies of Pakistan), Jacobo Goldstein=
 of CNN Radio Noticias (a Latin American question is likely) or Connie Lawn=
 (a freelancer with particular interest in the Middle East). Had enough of =
foreign policy and wish to return to domestic matters? Choose Keith Koffler=
 of Congress Daily (he follows the legislative process) or April Ryan of th=
e American Urban Radio Network (she favors socioeconomic questions).=20
Want to end the briefing by turning the whole thing into a circus? You migh=
t choose Russell Mokhiber of the Corporate Crime Reporter (he'll launch int=
o a tirade about greed), or Baltimore radio personality Lester Kinsolving (=
he'll ask about how "the Reverend Mr. Jackson impregnated his mistress and =
used tax-exempt contributions to get her out of Chicago"). Within seconds, =
the wire service reporters in the front row will beg for an end to the brie=
fing.=20
The truly desperate press secretary might call on a certain journalist of u=
nknown affiliation who sits in the back, wears a big hat and shouts unintel=
ligible questions such as: "My name is Miguel Sandoval. I'm a representativ=
e of -- (inaudible) -- News Service. . . . I am a former public school teac=
her who began my career in the -- (inaudible) -- 1946 after returning to fu=
lfill my duty to defeat the -- (inaudible) -- Tokyo during the Second World=
 War."=20
Last week, when press secretary Ari Fleischer was getting peppered with que=
stions about Enron Corp. and its chief, Kenneth L. Lay, Fleischer turned to=
 the Goyal Foil. "Goyal," Fleischer said as others shouted to get his atten=
tion. Fleischer said to the others: "We'll come back. We'll come -- we'll -=
- "=20
The press corps resisted. "Ari?" one called out. "Let me follow that, Ari -=
- "=20
"Hold on," the press secretary commanded. "Goyal, go ahead."=20
Goyal did his usual. "If I may go back to India and Pakistan. . .," he bega=
n.=20
On the day the White House first disclosed that administration officials ha=
d been approached by Enron about its financial troubles, most reporters had=
 only one subject in mind. After a battery of tough Enron questions, Fleisc=
her reached for Goyal as if for a life raft. "As far as the home minister o=
f India's visit," Goyal began. When others tried to jump in, the press secr=
etary asked Goyal if he had a follow-up question. Goyal did, about Pakistan=
i fighter planes.=20
Next, Fleischer turned to sometime-foil Goldstein -- but the Radio Noticias=
 man wanted to know about Enron. Fleischer tried Congress Daily's Koffler i=
n a transparent bid to switch the talk to Congress. Koffler indeed asked ab=
out Congress -- investigating Enron. Even Middle East expert Lawn asked abo=
ut Enron. Finally, Fleischer was saved by an angry Greek journalist who wan=
ted to know why he was not allowed to attend a meeting with the Greek prime=
 minister.=20
"The room can get, out of boredom, into a feeding frenzy," Lockhart notes. =
"The ability to change the subject is an important tool for the press secre=
tary." Lockhart admits to using a foreign journalist as a foil. ("He always=
 had some technical question about Crete.") But his favorite foil was famil=
iar to all: "If you're in a jam, go to Goyal," he says.=20
Will Fleischer acknowledge the use of foils? "No, I will not," he says. "I =
call on all corners of the room." McCurry and Lockhart resorted to foils "b=
ecause of all the scandal coverage. That's not the way of this administrati=
on." Still, Fleischer adds: "I'm not above using a foil. I just haven't had=
 opportunity to do it yet."=20
THE ENRON AFFAIR has also revived one of the White House's most dedicated p=
en pals on Capitol Hill: Henry Waxman, the diminutive but pugnacious rankin=
g Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. The Californian has fi=

heney, two to Enron chief Lay and one each to Bush Chief of Staff Andrew H.=
 Card Jr., economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul=
 H. O'Neill.=20
The letters tend to follow the same no-win format of: "Did you stop beating=
 your wife?"=20
Printing all the letters available on Waxman's Web site produces an inch-th=

Why is he so prolific? Because Waxman is in the minority party. "If you don=
't have the power to issue subpoenas or hold hearings and don't want to mak=
e reckless accusations, what you end up with is writing letters," said Waxm=
an's chief of staff, Phil Schiliro. "That's one thing we can do."=20
Not that it does much good. When Waxman's latest missive arrived at the Whi=
te House last week, a senior Bush aide said, "We just set it aside."

Enron's Fatal Arrogance

George Will argues that at the root of Enron's collapse was a belief by its=
 directors that no-one was supervising them.=20
Jeff Skilling, Enron's chief executive until last August, who less than two=
 years ago said Enron's stock, then at $US80, should sell for $US126, also =
said traditional companies like ExxonMobil ``will topple over from their ow=
n weight''. Today, the unbearable lightness of being Enron (its stock price=
 when trading was suspended on Tuesday was US67cents) proves that the famou=
sly innovative company pioneered a new way to topple.
Eleven months ago, Skilling impatiently told Bethany McLean of Fortune maga=
zine: ``Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People =
who raise questions are people who have not gone through it in detail.''=20
That was exactly wrong. Enron thrived partly on the sloth of Wall Street an=
alysts, who were uninterested in details or were reluctant to admit there w=
ere things they did not understand such as Enron's deliberately opaque and =
possibly illegal relationship with various partnerships run by Enron office=
rs.=20
Problems revealed by Enron's collapse are rooted in recent changes in the U=
S legal, financial and accounting professions. Sandy Williams, a Foley&Lard=
ner attorney specialising in energy matters, believes the trouble began wit=
h an epidemic of aggressiveness in the 1980s, when all three professions be=
gan to think of themselves as ``can do'' people ``problem solvers'' who ``t=
hink outside the box''.=20
But sometimes the box is there for a reason, such as protecting human being=
s from human nature. Sometimes clients need ``can't-do-that'' advisers who =
protect clients from themselves.=20
The increased use of stock options as compensation was, Williams says, supp=
osed to have the salutary effect of getting executives to inhabit the same =
economic universe as shareholders. But the result was a hyper-aggressive ma=
nagement cadre continually trying to impress analysts with ambitious target=
s for the growth in stock values. When the targets were met, the analysts r=
aised the bar, and sometimes the ever-higher expectations could not be met =
without financial and accounting practices that were the equivalent of ster=
oids.=20
Executives pursuing bonuses were fixated on quarterly estimates, as were th=
e analysts who represented brokerages that were chasing investment bank bus=
iness. Analysts give advice away. They are attention-grabbers. So analysts =
sometimes are instruments for pumping up the value of a stock, thereby attr=
acting the sort of huge fees that Enron distributed to Wall Street for fina=
ncial services.=20
Enron's implosion should not, but nevertheless may, have several consequenc=
es, one of them constitutional.=20
Enron's assiduous, not to say promiscuous, cultivation of political parties=
 with contributions bought no Washington help in Enron's crisis. Indeed, Wa=
shington probably was particularly unhelpful because it was wary of percept=
ions arising from Enron's largesse. Nevertheless, this event will be used t=
o justify more government regulation of political giving and spending.=20
Congressional opponents of partial privatisation of Social Security will re=
cklessly use the mismanagement of one company to foment fear of equities ma=
rkets. The mess California made of energy deregulation last year would have=
 been about as costly even if Enron had never existed. However, Governor Gr=
ay Davis's re-election campaign this year will be made easier by blaming En=
ron.=20
Washington's benign neglect of Enron's pleas for help with its credit ratin=
g indicates that something has been learned since 1979. Then, a New York fi=
nancial consultant was asked his opinion of the Carter Administration's pla=
n for a bail-out of Chrysler Corp. The consultant said that the danger was =
not that the bail-out would fail but that it would succeed. Then government=
 policy would be to rescue all ``TBTF'' private-sector entities those suppo=
sedly ``too big to fail''. The consultant was Alan Greenspan.=20
A TBTF policy breeds moral hazard incentives for bad behaviour. Entities th=
at assume there are government safety nets beneath them will take more risk=
s than prudence would otherwise permit.=20
Lenders who recently exposed themselves to large losses in Argentina rememb=
ered the 1995 rescue of reckless lenders to Mexico. It is axiomatic: minimi=
sing the consequences of folly maximises the amount of folly.=20
However, the primary cause of Enron's collapse was not risky behaviour aris=
ing from people's belief in a net under them. Rather, the cause was the gro=
wing arrogance of executives who became confident that no-one was looking o=
ver their shoulders, watching and understanding what they were doing.

Get Tough On Corporate Crime

As the Enron debacle looks more and more like a criminal case and less like=
 a regulatory failure, congressional investigators should consider a new av=
enue of inquiry. Instead of examining possible flaws in federal oversight, =
they might consider stronger penalties for white-collar crime.=20
Ultimately juries will decide whether Enron executives and officials at the=
 firm's auditor, Arthur Andersen, are guilty of crimes. The question for Co=
ngress is how to dissuade other executives from cooking the books in the fu=
ture.
Right now the legal incentives to tell the truth are not that great. Look a=
t some sentences handed out by federal courts in the Southern District of T=
exas, which includes Houston, home to Enron and its top executives. In its =
latest annual report, the U.S. Sentencing Commission describes 162 defendan=
ts convicted of fraud in that district during fiscal 2000. But only 115 of =
those convicts actually received prison time. Twenty-three received probati=
on, and the rest some combination of fines, probation and confinement outsi=
de of prison. (Such confinement can include home confinement. No one enjoys=
 being grounded, of course, but such punishment is unlikely to frighten peo=
ple into ethical behavior.)=20
Of the convicts who were sentenced to prison, 53 received 12 months or less=
, and the average sentence was just 18.2 months. Factoring in the possibili=
ty of early release for good behavior, the likelihood that such convicts ar=
e confined in a minimum security prison, and the possibility of spending th=
e final months of a sentence in a halfway house, we might ask whether the d=
isincentives to commit white-collar crime are strong enough.=20
As you might expect, according to federal sentencing guidelines, frauds tha=
t affect lots of people and cause millions of dollars in losses should resu=
lt in longer sentences than those imposed for small-time scams. So you migh=
t say that an Enron-size case, if prosecuted successfully, will result in a=
 much greater punishment than the average sentence in south Texas. But keep=
 in mind that the average defendant can't afford a legion of lawyers to agg=
ressively negotiate a deal (preferably one that includes a big fine but no =
jail time). And the recent history of financial shenanigans, from Sunbeam t=
o Waste Management, suggests that executives can make most of these problem=
s go away by writing a check.=20
Recently a former chief financial officer at Aurora Foods, after pleading g=
uilty to securities fraud and several related crimes, did actually receive =
a prison sentence of 57 months. But considering that the fraud involved und=
erreporting corporate expenses by $43 million, is that a harsh punishment? =
After all, 57 months is roughly the average prison sentence for federal def=
endants convicted of auto theft.=20
In a series of studies in recent years, the Texas-based National Center for=
 Policy Analysis (NCPA) has shown that a move toward longer prison sentence=
s (made possible by a prison-building boom in Texas) tracks very closely wi=
th a sharp decline in Texas crime during the 1990s. In a December 2000 repo=
rt, NCPA notes that the Texas murder rate fell by 57 percent in the 1990s, =
rape by 26 percent, and the rate of burglary by 48 percent. In each categor=
y, crime rates declined faster in Texas than in the nation as a whole.=20
"Why did the rate of serious crime decrease so fast in Texas?" the report a=
sks. "Certainly a strong case can be made that tougher policies toward crim=
inals played an important part. More people went to prison and stayed there=
 longer. . . . Texas had 704 prisoners per 100,000 population in 1999, comp=
ared to 290 per 100,000 in 1990, a 143 percent increase in imprisonment."=
=20
The Texas experience in the 1990s mirrors a national trend that began in th=
e early 1980s. As sentences became longer, as more aggressive law enforceme=
nt increased the likelihood of punishment, crime rates began a long downwar=
d trend that continues to this day. According to the government's Bureau of=
 Justice Statistics, violent crime rates fell to the "lowest level ever rec=
orded in 2000." The evidence suggests that harsh punishment does deter crim=
e. For those seeking to eradicate corporate crime, it's worth considering w=
hether we should make fraud convictions more costly and painful.=20

The Enron collapse, by far the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history, wil=
l have far-reaching repercussions. Enron was an icon, as was its charismati=
c chairman, Kenneth Lay. Long held to be the epitome of the New Economy and=
 a paragon of corporate governance, the coming to grief of the high-flying =
chairman and his company has raised fundamental questions about the relatio=
nships that exist between Corporate America and the US government. A revolv=
ing door existed between employees of Enron, their auditing and consulting =
firm Arthur Andersen, and their law firm. That door also opened to several =
government offices. An Enron consultant became a White House economic advis=
er while an Enron vice-president became secretary of the army. Harvey Pitt,=
 an attorney for Arthur Andersen and defender of the controversial practice=
 of an accounting firm being allowed to do consulting services, was appoint=
ed by President Bush as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC=
). Enron helped US Vice President Dick Cheney devise an energy plan that wo=
uld benefit the company immensely.=20
With such close relationships between the failed corporation and the govern=
ment, it's small wonder that the charge of crony capitalism has been made, =
and that the US administration tried to intervene on behalf of Dabhol. But =
it's not only the relationship between government and big business that is =
under scrutiny. The independence of auditors is being questioned, and it no=
w appears that Arthur Andersen knew of the state of affairs at Enron well b=
efore it collapsed. Arthur Andersen apparently earned more in consulting fe=
es from the failed energy major than from its auditing work, creating a cle=
ar conflict of interest. Also under the microscope is the relationship betw=
een investment bankers and companies, with some Wall Street firms recommend=
ing a buy on Enron well after their shares had collapsed. The Wall Street J=
ournal has pointed out how some of the world's leading banks and brokerage =
firms provided Enron with crucial help in creating the opaque financial str=
ucture that led to the energy trader's impressive rise but ultimately led t=
o its spectacular downfall.
The trouble is that such incestuous relationships aren't confined to Enron.=
 Lobbying government on behalf of business, for instance, is a well-recogni=
sed practice in Washington. Yet when former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt want=
ed accounting firms to choose between their auditing and consulting practic=
es, the proposal was defeated by senators and Congressmen, who had received=
 money from the accounting industry. With a few honourable exceptions, the =
"independent" directors on most corporate boards are a sham typically handp=
icked by the CEO and loyal to him. And why pick on Arthur Andersen? Ernst &=
 Young and PriceWaterhouseCoopers have both had their share of similar cont=
roversy. Among research analysts, consider Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley De=
an Witter, dubbed the "Queen of the Net" for pumping up Internet firms whil=
e Morgan Stanley was taking in millions in fees on Internet IPOs. And why w=
ere the rating agencies so slow in downgrading the firm?=20
These questions have no easy answers, and it would be naive to believe that=
 these conflicts of interest are accidental. But the US will no longer be a=
ble to preach about crony capitalism or corporate governance to others. And=
 while there's little doubt that we have no dearth of cronyism in India, fo=
r the moment, at least, it is those who supported Enron's Dabhol misadventu=
re who are squirming.
