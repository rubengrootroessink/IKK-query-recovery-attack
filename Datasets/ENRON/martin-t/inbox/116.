CNN: Special Report With Aaron Brown=20
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House,=
 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.=20

We said last night that the collapse of Enron had been largely underreporte=
d. That has now changed, as you will hear tonight, and it is that story, En=
ron that begins our whip around the world. We start at the White House and =
our Senior White House Correspondent John King. John, a headline from you, =
please.=20
JOHN KING, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, because of Enron's poli=
tical connections, the nation's top prosecutor, the Attorney General John A=
shcroft and his chief of staff, today had to recuse themselves from the gro=
wing criminal investigation into the company's bankruptcy. Why? Because Joh=
n Ashcroft took a lot of money from Enron and its chief executives.=20
The administration also, for the first time today, acknowledged the Enron C=
EO called two cabinet members before the company filed for bankruptcy and a=
sked for help. The administration insists it didn't help him and that it di=
d nothing wrong. Aaron.=20
BROWN: John, a lot on Enron tonight. We'll be back with you shortly.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
BROWN: Enron exploded today. It's been a while since the energy company, th=
e trading company, a Fortune 500 giant went bankrupt, costing investors inc=
luding the company's employees billions of dollars.=20
The story has simmered around for a while, overwhelmed by the war, waiting =
its time in the way a good story does, and the time has finally come. Last =
night, we reported the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigat=
ion, and today the case took a political turn as well, a turn that could we=
ll be the first real threat to the Bush Administration.=20
Developments to report, lots of them. We go back to the White House and Sen=
ior White House Correspondent John King. John, good evening.=20
KING: Good evening to you, Aaron. A complicated story anyway because of the=
 facts, even more so because of the politics. If you brought together senio=
r officials in the Bush Administration and said, everyone with ties to Enro=
n raise your hands, a lot of hands would go up.=20
The President knows the CEO quite well. He's an old family friend. So does =
the Vice President and his Chief of Staff. The President's top political ad=
viser is close to Enron, so is his top economic adviser. Several members of=
 the cabinet too. The White House insists though, there has been no questio=
nable behavior. There are though, a lot of questions.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
KING (voice over): Attorney General John Ashcroft is recusing himself from =
the criminal investigation of Enron, as is his Chief of Staff. The reason, =
$60,000 in political contributions from Enron and its top executives in Cam=
paign 2000, when Ashcroft was running for reelection to the Senate.=20
Another reflection of the political stakes in the Oval Office, the Presiden=
t himself announcing two new cabinet level reviews to determine if the gove=
rnment needs stronger disclosure laws to protect shareholders and investors=
 in 401 (k) and other retirement plans.=20
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have great concern for th=
e stories, for those I read about in the stories who put their life savings=
 aside and for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got tra=
pped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings.=20
KING: Energy giant, Enron, first gave a public hint of its financial troubl=
es last October, and then filed for bankruptcy in early December, a major e=
conomic story in any event and a major political story too because Enron an=
d its CEO, Ken Lay, have deep connections to the Bush family and in both po=
litical parties in Congress.=20
BUSH: I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the com=
pany.=20
KING: But Lay did alert top Bush deputies that Enron was in trouble, and as=
ked for help well before the December bankruptcy filing. He called Treasury=
 Secretary Paul O'Neill, and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, in late October =
and O'Neill a second time in early November.=20
Sources say Lay wanted help shoring up the company's bond rating. Aides say=
 Secretaries O'Neill and Evans decided there was nothing the government cou=
ld or should do. The White House says they did not pass the news on to the =
President or any other senior administration officials.=20
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President is pleased with t=
he actions that his cabinet secretaries took. He thinks they acted wisely a=
nd properly.=20
Lay is an old Bush family friend, and he and his company a major donor to b=
oth political parties. In the 2000 campaign cycle alone, Enron and its exec=
utives contributed more than $2.2 million to federal candidates and politic=
al committees; $74,000 went to the Bush Campaign; $1.5 million to other Rep=
ublican campaigns and committees; and $640,000 to the Democrats.=20
Four Congressional committees are also investigating Enron, and Democrats w=
ant more information on the company's contacts with the Bush White House.=
=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
KING (on camera): In hindsight, and there is always hindsight it seems in s=
uch cases, top Bush Administration officials say yes, they wish word of tho=
se contacts between Ken Lay, the Enron CEO, and Bush cabinet secretaries ca=
me out sooner, but they say in the end, any investigation will show this, t=
hat a top Bush fundraiser asked for help and was told no, and that this Pre=
sident now is showing no hesitancy at all in investigating a man who's not =
only a top political supporter, but a long-time family friend. Aaron.=20
BROWN: You could almost hear Democrats smacking their lips a little bit on =
this one. Was the White House, in the briefings today and around the buildi=
ng, defensive about this or did they seem, people seem comfortable that the=
y're OK?=20
KING: Quite defensive about it, Aaron. Some phone calls after the White Hou=
se briefing by officials saying, why so many questions about this? This is =
an administration of unquestioned integrity. Why do you want to know all th=
ese things?=20
But they also understand now, many Democrats in the Congress saw the invest=
igations of the Clinton Administration, subpoenas for documents in cases th=
at the Clintons thought were way out of bounds, no questions should be aske=
d. The Democrats will ask questions about this. So will reporters.=20
The Bush Administration I think got the message today that they have to be =
quicker and more forthcoming in releasing any, any details at all of consul=
tations or conversations with this company. Again, they say in the end, the=
y will be proven that the President did nothing wrong, and that in fact, hi=
s two cabinet secretaries, one Don Evans a very close friend of Ken Lay, sa=
id no when this man asked for help.=20
BROWN: And just one other quick thing, the decision to have a White House -=
- are these White House investigations into Enron, or White House discussio=
ns about disclosure laws dealing with investments and investors generally?=
=20
KING: There are a number of investigations, so it gets confusing. The Justi=
ce Department, even though the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney and m=
ost of his staff in Houston, have recused themselves because of political r=
elationships or other relationships. The Justice Department is having a cri=
minal investigation.=20
The Labor Department oversees pensions. It has a separate investigation int=
o the pension programs. Now there will be two cabinet level taskforces head=
ed by the Treasury Department, that involve other departments including the=
 Securities and Exchange Commission, to see if the government did something=
 wrong here, if you will, if there should be stronger rules that require an=
 Enron, when its finances are going south, to tell its shareholders and esp=
ecially to tell its employees who have so much stock in those 401 (k) plans=
. All the Enron executives who knew about this sold their stock. The employ=
ees lost their life savings. The President wants to know if the government =
needs to make sure that doesn't happen again.=20
BROWN: John, the old wire service reported that you are -- you probably wan=
t to chase the fire that's going on somewhere in D.C.=20
KING: We get those out here.=20
BROWN: Yes, thank you for your work tonight. Senior White House Corresponde=
nt John King. We said that the Enron collapse is both a political story and=
 a business story. It's a complicated story to be sure. Tonight, we're join=
ed by someone who can help us understand both the business and the politics=
 of this. Jim Glassman writes a weekly Washington Post investment column. H=
e's also a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He joins us tonight=
 from New York. Jim, good evening.=20
JAMES GLASSMAN, HOST, TECHCENTRALSTATION.COM: Good evening, Aaron.=20
BROWN: How could so many -- I mean if you looked at all of the mutual funds=
 and all the investment houses that recommended Enron, the stock price shot=
 way up. It looked like a terrific company. How could so many smart people =
have been so dumb?=20
GLASSMAN: They didn't just recommend it, they owned it. I mean companies li=
ke Janus, Fidelity. There are a lot of analysts that have conflicts of inte=
rest, but many of them, who did not, really praised this company to the sky=
. Fortune named it six years in a row, the most innovative company in Ameri=
ca.=20
Basically, what was going on was that Enron was deceiving investors, deceiv=
ing analysts, overstating the profits it was making, hiding some of the loa=
ns that it had taken out, and as soon as this was found out, the company ba=
sically got capital punishment, which in my opinion it deserved. And I thin=
k it's a good lesson to other companies not to deceive investors.=20
Now, the question of whether it did something illegal or not, is another ma=
tter. Just the fact that it was very clearly trying to say that it was in m=
uch better shape than it was. Unfortunately, a lot of little people got hur=
t.=20
BROWN: I want to talk about that, but are you telling me that a company can=
 mislead investors, mislead the public about how much money it's actually m=
aking or how much debt it actually has, and that is not in and of itself a =
crime?=20
GLASSMAN: Well, what Enron was doing specifically about the debt was, it wa=
s reporting that it had $14 billion in debt. It really had about three time=
s that much, and the other debt was pushed off onto other related entities,=
 and it was very, very difficult for any analyst or the public to find out =
about it.=20
Now, it's very difficult to pass enough accounting rules to take care of ev=
ery shenanigan that a company's going to come up with. What you need is a m=
arket and investors who will crack down really, really hard on companies th=
at are being deceptive, if not dishonest, and that's what's happened in thi=
s case. But yes, it's not hard to hide things. It's not hard at all to hide=
 things.=20
BROWN: That's comforting to know for those of us who have money in the mark=

NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered Enron Corp. planned to select one of two suitor=
s to buy its wholesale energy trading operation in an auction expected to e=

The auction was being held in private and the selection of a buyer was expe=
cted to be announced at a bankruptcy court hearing that was originally sche=
duled for 10 a.m., but was delayed until noon.
Trading in Enron shares was delayed Friday morning on the New York Stock Ex=
change as negotiations for a sale continued pending an anticipated announce=
ment.=20
Enron said late Thursday that negotiations for a sale were continuing throu=
gh the night.=20
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early Friday that the=
 talks were continuing and the field had been narrowed to two, but declined=
 to name the suitors. Investment banks that reportedly have an interest in =
buying into Enron include Citigroup Inc. and UBS Warburg.=20
In a related matter, Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he expected to rule Friday =
on a request to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston.=20
Gonzalez will have the final word Friday on any sale that takes place as a =
result of the auction. More than a dozen Enron creditors have filed objecti=
ons to the sale, essentially because they want a better explanation of how =
the proceeds will be divvied up.=20
Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal Gonzalez's ruling.=20
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy me=
rchant, accounting for roughly 25 percent of all trades in a market it help=
ed pioneer. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bet=
s on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, paper, the we=
ather and more than 1,000 other products.

Widening probe of Texas-based Enron could dog Bush as Whitewater plagued Cl=

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - The expanding investigation into the collapse of Enron Co=
rp. and the company's close ties to the Bush administration could quickly t=
urn into a consuming political liability for President George W. Bush in sp=
ite of his currently high approval ratings. And Democrats are pressing hard=
 for just that.=20
At this point, no one is alleging wrongdoing by Bush or top members of his =
administration in the bankruptcy of the Houston-based energy trading compan=
y, a failure that cost thousands of jobs and ravaged the retirement savings=
 of many employees.
But such investigations tend to take on a life of their own. And Democrats,=
 sensing a congressional election-year opportunity, are working hard to tur=
n up the heat.=20
Some Democrats are likening the probe to the Whitewater and campaign fund-r=
aising investigations that plagued former President Bill Clinton.=20
"The reason this is so potentially devastating to Bush is that it brings to=
 life in very real terms the notion that when push comes to shove, he's for=
 the big business special interests and not for the little guy," said forme=
r Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart.=20
The controversy deepened on Thursday with the disclosure by the White House=
 that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, a longtime friend of the president, ca=
lled two of Bush's Cabinet officers - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and C=
ommerce Secretary Don Evans - before the company filed for bankruptcy late =
last year.=20
The disclosure came a day after the Justice Department announced it was ope=
ning a criminal investigation of the energy company's collapse, including w=
hether it defrauded investors by deliberately concealing information about =
its finances.=20
Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received campaign contributions from En=
ron executives during his failed 2000 senatorial bid, stepped aside from th=
e investigation.=20
The collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy ever, is also being probed b=
y the Labor Department and by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which=
 is looking into the company's destruction of possibly key financial docume=
nts; and by five congressional committees.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, leading one of those inquiries, is promising "a sear=
ch for the truth, not a witch hunt."=20
But some Republicans - including White House spokesman Ari Fleischer - used=
 just that term, "witch hunt," on Thursday in describing the widening inves=
tigation.=20
"There's not even smoke here, let alone a fire," said Charles Black, a vete=
ran Republican consultant.=20
"They can keep it going in terms of probing Enron, looking into what happen=
ed to those people who lost their pensions, what happened to the accounting=
. All those are legitimate issues," said Black. "But there's no evidence th=
at any elected officials did anything for Enron."=20
Bush, a former Texas oilman himself, on Thursday told reporters, "I have ne=
ver discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company." And Flei=
scher said that no one in the administration offered to intervene on Enron'=
s behalf.=20
"This is hardly going to be a scandal that brings down President Bush, but =
it will be a nagging problem for the Bush administration for some time to c=
ome," said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.=20
But Sabato said it has all the ingredients to become all-consuming "because=
 the Bush administration is so laden with corporate types and people with t=
ies to the energy industry. It's understandable to the American people. It'=
s the big boys versus the little guys who got hurt."=20
"These things can be an enormous distraction. But by the end of the Clinton=
 administration, we learned that the best thing to do is assign a team to d=
isclose everything, and to keep everyone else out of it," said Paul Begala,=
 a former Clinton political adviser.=20
Lanny Davis, who was special counsel to Clinton from 1996 to 1998, urged De=
mocrats to not take the same low road he claims Republicans took in pursuin=
g the Whitewater and related inquiries.=20
He said so far he sees nothing in the Enron case to link Bush administratio=
n officials to the collapse other than innuendo. "Let's go after the seriou=
s stuff," including why Enron employees were prevented from unloading their=
 Enron stock in their company-managed retirement plans as the share prices =
plunged from over dlrs 80 to under dlrs 1, Davis said.=20

Enron Fall Renews Interest In Electricity Clearinghouse
By Kristen McNamara

01/11/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service=20
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Energy companies' increased concern about exposure t=
o their trading partners following the meltdown of former energy giant Enro=
n Corp. (ENE) has renewed interest in the development of clearinghouses for=
 the North American electricity markets.
It's long been thought that the continent's power markets could benefit fro=
m a formal clearing function, in which a central institution extends financ=
ial guarantees on trades. Impediments that frustrated past efforts remain, =
but Enron's rapid collapse and the tighter credit standards faced by the re=
st of the industry have given clearinghouse backers new ammunition.=20
"The idea was already in people's heads that it was something good to have,=
" said Jim Walker, senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a technology =
research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "The Enron situation made people think we=
 need to get it faster."=20
Enron, formerly the largest wholesale trader of electricity and natural gas=
, filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2. The former titan's fall stunned t=
he industry and led to increased scrutiny of power companies' credit by rat=
ings agencies and trading partners.=20
The U.S. power markets - which Forrester Research estimates traded $446 bil=
lion worth of wholesale electricity in 2001 - lack a central exchange. Most=
 power is traded over the counter, with companies contacting each other dir=
ectly and left on the hook if their counterparty defaults.=20
A clearinghouse would protect against counterparty default and reduce the a=
mount of collateral companies must post to back their trades, analysts said=
. Under such a system, the clearinghouse sets margin requirements and acts =
as counterparty to every trade. It collects fees and in return steps in to =
cover defaults.=20
A number of energy companies, including Sempra Energy (SRE), Williams Cos. =
(WMB), Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) said they welco=
me the idea.=20
"We certainly support that idea and think it would be beneficial and would =
go a long way toward helping to manage the credit risk of the counterpartie=
s," Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said.=20
Clearing For Takeoff=20

Anticipating increased demand for insulation against trading risk, several =
organizations plan to roll out clearing services for electricity markets th=
is year.=20
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy marketplace, h=
opes to offer clearing services to power traders sometime in 2002, spokeswo=
man Nachamah Jacobovits said. Nymex began extending clearing services to th=
e over-the-counter markets for natural gas products in November.=20
"We have accelerated because of the Enron problems," Jacobovits said.=20
IntercontinentalExchange, a fast-growing Internet-based marketplace backed =
by a number of leading energy companies and banks, is also exploring the po=
ssibility of expanding its clearing function to include electricity, Senior=
 Vice President David Goone said.=20
"There's tremendous demand to start coming up with a clearing solution for =
the electricity marketplace," Goone said. "Clearing would allow more partic=
ipants to trade."=20
Because the exchange is still hammering out the details, Goone wouldn't say=
 which electricity products might be covered or when clearing services woul=
d be in place.=20
ICE, which last year bought London's International Petroleum Exchange, the =
world's second-largest energy futures exchange, has an agreement with the L=
ondon Clearing House to provide clearing services for natural gas and crude=
 oil trades done on ICE beginning in the first quarter of 2002.=20
A third company called EnergyClear, based in Houston, plans to launch a cle=
aringhouse for electricity and natural gas in the next three to six months,=
 according to Jimmy Wright, senior vice president of business development.=
=20
Energy companies will own and govern the clearinghouse itself. The Bank of =
New York (BK) and brokers Prebon Yamane and Amerex own a unit that will ope=
rate the clearinghouse.=20
EnergyClear has the technology and regulatory approval to clear trades, but=
 must get its membership and governing rules in place before it can begin o=
perating, Wright said. The effort was stalled as energy companies shifted t=
heir attention to sorting out their exposure to Enron, Wright said.=20
"We lost probably weeks or a month, if not more, of productive time," he sa=
id.=20
The Hard Part=20

Despite the support, analysts said it's difficult to estimate how much busi=
ness a clearinghouse could actually do. Developing a clearing function for =
electricity will be more complicated than for other commodities because of =
the volatility of power prices and the Balkanized nature of the electricity=
 markets - with rules, products and liquidity varying from region to region=
, energy experts said.=20
Nymex tried and failed to create a market for electricity futures - standar=
d products traded on a regulated exchange with clearing and settlement serv=
ices. Electricity futures failed to catch on with energy companies as a ris=
k-management tool, in part because there isn't a national benchmark to use =
as reference point.=20
"As liquidity develops in highly traded benchmark products, they will want =
to have a clearinghouse for those products," Walker said.=20
Thus far, companies have been reluctant to pay for clearing services in the=
 electricity markets, said Ken Nichols, president of NexClear Inc. NexClear=
 spent two years trying to develop an electricity-market clearinghouse, but=
 gave up last summer when it couldn't secure enough money to start up.=20
"The willingness to pay has not been there," Nichols said. "How many more e=
xamples does the industry need to realize the cost of mitigating credit ris=
k?"=20
A standard set of rules governing the trading operations of each region mig=
ht be necessary before a clearinghouse could begin operating, said Joseph O=
ates, vice president for energy management, at Consolidated Edison Co.=20
Federal energy regulators are pushing utilities and grid operators to devel=
op uniform regional markets with standard rules. It's not clear how quickly=
 these could be up and running. But the independent power-grid managers aro=
und the country generally offer clearing and settlement services in the mar=
kets they operate, and those could be expanded as the so-called independent=
 system operators and regional transmission organizations grow.=20
"It is these ISOs, these RTOs that are right in the middle of these markets=
 and probably need to take on the function of not just being the traffic co=
p in these markets but also the referee and auctioneer that makes these mar=
kets work," Larry Makovich, senior director for electric power research at =
the Cambridge Energy Research Associates said.=20

WHITE HOUSE WATCH: Enron Story Heats Up At White House

Dow Jones International News=20

(This article was originally published Thursday)=20
By Alex Keto=20
A Dow Jones Newswires Analysis=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The long-simmering story over the collapse of Enro=
n (ENE) and its political contributions to President George W. Bush heated =
up considerably Thursday with the revelation that Enron Chairman Kenneth La=
y pleaded for help from the administration while his company was going down=
 in flames.
Administration officials turned Lay down, but the news brings the issues of=
 political contributions and political favors into uncomfortably close prox=
imity.=20
For his part, Bush said he was out of the loop.=20
"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company.=
 The last time that I saw Mr. Lay was at my mother's fund-raising event for=
 literacy in Houston. That would have been last spring," Bush said.=20
Bush went on to say he wants to see a full investigation into Enron's bankr=
uptcy, the largest in U.S. history.=20
"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully in=
vestigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn fr=
om the past and make sure workers are protected," Bush said.=20
Nevertheless, the White House appeared to be buffeted by fast-moving events=
 with White House spokesman Ari Fleischer denying at midday there was any c=
onflict of interest in having Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received =
political contributions from Enron as a Senate candidate, oversee a crimina=
l probe of the company's bankruptcy. Less then two hours later, Ashcroft an=
d a top aide recused themselves from the investigation.=20
Shortly after the Ashcroft announcement, Arthur Andersen LLP, the company t=
hat served as Enron's auditors, announced that a "significant" number of th=
e company's documents and records had been destroyed. Both federal and cong=
ressional investigators have been seeking the documents.=20
Fleischer said that during the autumn Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'=
Neill to warn him that Enron was on the verge of collapse, and Lay said the=
 bankruptcy of his company could be as destabilizing as the implosion of th=
e Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in the late 1990s.=20
However, upon investigation, the Treasury Department rejected Lay's argumen=
ts.=20
Later, Lay called Commerce Secretary Don Evans to say "he (Lay) was having =
problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the en=
ergy sector."=20
Evans then called O'Neill but "they both agreed no action should be taken t=
o intervene with their bond holders," Fleischer said.=20
Even before the latest revelations, the White House had confirmed Vice Pres=
ident Dick Cheney or his aides met with Enron officials six times last year=
 to discuss energy issues while the White House was drawing up its energy p=
lan .=20
However, Fleischer said the fact that Lay and others were talking to top of=
ficials isn't in and of itself a crime.=20
"I want to remind you that communication is not a wrongdoing. What took pla=
ce here was, they received phone calls and took no action. The charge has b=
een, did the government take any action? And the answer from these two offi=
cials is no," Fleischer said.=20
"I think it should surprise no one that people in the administration receiv=
e phone calls from people who are either in business or at unions. It happe=
ns everyday," Fleischer said.=20
However, some of Fleischer's assertions were, to be blunt, surprising.=20
To begin with, Fleischer said Thursday morning was the first time that O'Ne=
ill and Evans mentioned to Bush they had been in contact with Lay in the we=
eks just ahead of the company's bankruptcy.=20
In addition, Fleischer said no one in the administration briefed Bush about=
 Enron's woes and he was hard pressed to say how the president learned the =
company had gone belly up late last year.=20
"He learned last fall. And I couldn't tell you if he learned as a result of=
 the media accounts when everybody wrote that Enron had gone bankrupt or th=
rough any other mechanism. He learned last fall," Bush said.=20
However, this explanation appeared to be rather thin considering that Bush =
was fully informed and deeply involved in the financial bailout of the nati=
on's airlines at the same time in part because thousands of jobs were at ri=
sk. Enron employed 20,000 workers.=20
Asked if, in hindsight, the president wished he had been better informed of=
 the developments at Enron and among his top officials, Fleischer said, "No=
."=20
Adding to the White House's discomfort is the fact that Democrats on Capito=
l Hill are gearing up for hearings on Enron. Fleischer warned them against =
going too far.=20
"It's appropriate to take a look into what led to the bankruptcy of Enron a=
nd whether or not anything was done wrong in the process of Enron going ban=
krupt. But if that's a politically charged, a politically motivated effort,=
 then I think the American people are going to say that this is just anothe=
r fishing expedition, another endless investigation, the type that they sou=
red on over the last many years," Fleischer said.=20

Bush Warns Iran Not To Shelter Fleeing Al-Qaida=20

Following reports that Iran may be sheltering small numbers of fleeing al-Q=
aida or Taliban fighters and trying to control Afghanistan's western provin=
ces, Bush bluntly warned Tehran it will be held accountable for any moves t=
o terrorism or terrorists.=20
"Any nation that thwarts our ability to rout terror out where it exists wil=
l be held to account one way or the other," Bush said.=20
"We had some positive signals early - early in this war from - from the Ira=
nians. We would hope that they would continue to be a positive force in hel=
ping us bring people to justice. We would hope, for example, they wouldn't =
allow al-Qaida murderers to hide in their country. We would hope that if th=
at be the case, if someone tries to flee into Iran, that they would hand th=
em over to us," Bush added,=20
Bush also told Tehran to keep its hands off of Afghanistan's fragile govern=
ment and hinted the U.S. response could be sharp.=20
"If they, in any way, shape or form, try to destabilize the government, the=
 coalition will be - will deal with them in, you know, in diplomatic ways, =
initially," Bush said.=20
For what its worth, Iran denied it was either undercutting the Kabul govern=
ment or hiding terrorists.=20
"It has been our policy not to allow terrorist groups such as al-Qaida in I=
ran," Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi told The Associated Press.=20
The U.S. has long considered Iran a major backer of international terrorism=
.=20
Certainly, Abtahi's comments didn't sway Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfe=
ld.=20
"We know that (Afghanistan-Iran) has a porous border and we know people hav=
e moved back and forth throughout history. And we also know they've been mo=
ving back and forth in recent history," Rumsfeld said.=20

POINT OF VIEW: A New Champion For Disclosure: Bush

(This article was originally published Thursday.)=20

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Corporate disclosure found a high-profile champion T=
hursday: the president of the United States.
It's not often that the chief executive of the world's most powerful nation=
 concerns himself with issues such as what public companies should have to =
tell investors. That's what cabinet officers and federal agency heads are f=
or.=20
But President George W. Bush was provoked Thursday to announce the creation=
 of a high-level working group to study disclosure rules to see if they nee=
d to be improved.=20
The reason for this comes down to one word: Enron.=20
In light of the Chapter 11 filing by former high-flying Enron Corp., Bush s=
aid Thursday that he was forming a working group consisting of representati=
ves of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review disclosure rul=
es, Dow Jones Newswires reported.=20
Many of Enron's woes stemmed from lightly reported off-balance-sheet transa=
ctions. Now, it's unlikely that the SEC needs the help of all these other
agencies=20
to get the job done. It embarked, pre-Enron, on a broad effort to
improve and make "current" corporate disclosure of material
developments. This might be a case of too many cooks.=20

But it still has to be counted as a silver lining of the Enron mess that a =
better disclosure regime will now get the crisis-induced impetus often need=
ed to create real change.=20
Assuming this working group brings back a plan that really will make compan=
ies disclose more of their pertinent financials in a timely and understanda=
ble way, Bush will have no choice but to back it.=20
After all, he formed the working group. And it's in his political interest,=
 given his and the administration's relationship with Enron's leaders, to b=
ack some regulatory lessons from the company's downfall and impose a more t=
ransparent regimen of accounting.=20
For its part, the SEC, under Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, should tell its colle=
agues at the other agencies joining the working group that it already has a=
 plan. The SEC then needs to flesh it out in an appropriate way and win the=
 backing of the other agencies.=20
Enron's failure is an opportunity to overcome the business-as-usual objecti=
ons that are bound to rise from a proposal that would significantly alter a=
nd improve the way companies report important developments to investors.=20
Notwithstanding the bureaucratic drag of a working group, the support of a =
popular president for such a usually obscure effort has got to be a big plu=
s in getting something done.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Thursday confirmed its chairman an=
d chief executive, Kenneth Lay, contacted top Bush administration officials=
 to warn that bankruptcy was a possibility for the Houston energy trader.
Earlier Thursday, White House officials said Lay contacted Treasury Secreta=
ry Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans prior to the company's ban=
kruptcy filing in early December.=20
"Lay made phone calls to tell senior government officials about the situati=
on at Enron," an Enron spokesman said. "He told them that we were working t=
o avoid bankruptcy, but it couldn't be ruled out. He didn't ask for anythin=
g. He was giving information."=20
According to the spokesman, Lay thought the officials needed to know of the=
 looming threat of bankruptcy because Enron was one of the nation's leading=
 companies and was heavily involved in national energy markets.=20
Lay wanted them to know so they could "do anything they needed to," the spo=
kesman said, adding that he didn't know when the calls were made.=20
Enron and Lay have been leading contributors to the President George W. Bus=
h, as well as to a long list of Democratic and Republican candidates.=20
When asked if Lay had a personal connection to either Evans or O'Neill, the=
 spokesman said he "had no idea."=20
Prior to his appointment as Commerce Secretary, Evans served as chief execu=
tive of Tom Brown Inc. (TMBR), a Denver natural gas company. A longtime fri=
end of Bush, Evans also served as general chairman of his presidential camp=
aign.=20
Meanwhile, O'Neill headed Alcoa Inc. (AA), a Pittsburgh aluminum company, p=
rior to his appointment.=20
Bush Thursday called for two working groups from his cabinet and other agen=
cies to review matters related to events at Enron. The investigations would=
 be in addition to the criminal investigation launched by the Department of=
 Justice.=20
One group, from the Labor, Commerce and Treasury Departments, will look int=
o Enron's pension rules and regulations. Another group, drawing from the Tr=
easury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion, and the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, will investigate c=
orporate disclosure rules and regulations.=20

US O'Neill Focuses On Regulatory Reform In Enron Review

01/11/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report=20

(This article was originally published Thursday)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Thursday t=
hat he would focus on regulatory reform as part of President George W. Bush=
's newly announced probe of Enron Co. (ENE).
O'Neill told Fox News Channel that he would be part of two task forces stem=
ming from the issue.=20
In the first, he would join Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretar=
y Elaine Chao to look at the impact of recent corporate bankruptcies on pen=
sion benefits.=20
In the second, he would join Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Commo=
dities Futures and Trading Commission Chairman James E. Newsome and Securit=
ies and Exchange Chairman Harvey Pitt in looking into disclosure rules. O'N=
eill said they will determine whether changes are needed "to assure that in=
vestors and markets have all the information they are entitled to have to m=
ake our free-market economy work properly."=20
In ordering the probe, Bush particularly pointed at the loss of pension ben=
efits by employees at Enron, which filed for bankruptcy last month. As Enro=
n's stock collapsed, employees were barred from selling the company's share=
s while the energy trading company was changing pension administrators and =
the accounts were frozen.=20
Asked for specific solutions, O'Neill suggested that the government needed =
to see if 401(k) and other pension accounts need to be locked up when new a=
dministrators come in.=20
"We need to look at that and see if that is a sensible thing to do," he sai=
d.=20
But beyond that, the Treasury secretary refused to be pinned down on possib=
le remedies. "I think we need to do a study and we need to do analysis," he=
 said.=20
"We need to do analysis before we do prescription. It's a pretty good idea =
to figure out what disease exists before we start cutting off arms and legs=
," he added.=20
O'Neill also stressed that this effort is motivated by Bush's concern for E=
nron's employees. The Treasury secretary said the president is "just hurtin=
g a lot for people who apparently accumulated all of their savings in a 401=
(k) plan and then lost it all in a couple of months." -By Paul Rekoff, Dow =

Arthur Anderson is Under the Microscope

DEBORAH MARCHINI, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: As we`ve been reporting this =
morning Arthur Anderson is under the microscope. The accounting firm admitt=
ed yesterday, employee had destroyed key records of its audits of Enron.=20
I`m joined by Howard Schilit, president of the Center for Financial Researc=
h and Analysis, a Washington, D.C. firm that provides research on just such=
 incidences for institutional investors.
Thanks for being here this morning.=20
HOWARD SCHILIT, CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH & ANALYSIS: Good morning.=20
MARCHINI: First, question I have for you is, if documents were destroyed at=
 Arthur Anderson, the firm`s auditors, was a crime necessarily committed?=
=20
SCHILIT: Well, it`s too early to conclude what happened, and what did not, =
why the records were destroyed. But it certainly raises some very serious q=
uestions about the internal controls that the accounting firm. When they we=
re destroyed? It`s certainly a very serious matter.=20
MARCHINI: If these documents were destroyed after the company became the su=
bject of civil and criminal investigations, that would be obstruction of ju=
stice, I presume?=20
SCHILIT: Well, again, I`m an accountant by training, not an attorney. But t=
he role of the auditor is to raise assurance amongst investors in the compe=
tence of the company. And auditors more than any other profession, understa=
nds the importance of documentary evidence, and the work papers are an esse=
ntial part of that.=20
MARCHINI: So, what you`re saying here is that it`s suspicious, they should =
have known better than to do this?=20
SCHILIT: Oh, I think this is a very serious situation, which certainly is g=
oing to be investigated very closely.=20
MARCHINI: Is there any precedent for the destruction of documents in a case=
 like this, where an audit is being questioned?=20
SCHILIT: I have never heard of any situation where work papers have been de=
stroyed. Very often when there had been frauds. And there have been very ma=
jor frauds in the last few years. (INAUDIBLE), for example, in order to pie=
ce together what happened, there were years of documents. And in the case o=
f Enron, it`s going to simply make the investigation much more difficult.=
=20
MARCHINI: Make the investigation much more difficult for both the criminal,=
 the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, I presu=
me?=20
SCHILIT: That`s right.=20
MARCHINI: What are the potential penalties for Arthur Anderson, if it turns=
 out they have broken the law?=20
SCHILIT: Again, that`s more of a legal question. In the case of past invest=
igations by the SEC, and Arthur Anderson in particular has had several of t=
hose recently. One with Waste Management (URL: http://www.wastemanagement.c=
om/) . The other with Sunbeam (URL: http://www.sunbeam.com/) . There are mo=
netary penalties and it could be very substantial.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission may not permit this auditing firm to=
 take on any new clients. So it could be very substantial. Monetary and cer=
tainly individuals involved who may have been obstructing justice, there ce=
rtainly can be criminal penalties.=20
MARCHINI: What are the ramifications for Arthur Anderson`s business? You me=
ntioned the prospect that they might be barred from not taking on any new a=
uditing clients for awhile, if it turns out there`s a criminal violation. B=
ut, they also run a rather large management consulting business. And I wond=
er what this does to their ability to win business now in the free markets?=
=20
SCHILIT: I`m sure it`s very difficult out there. Again, you probably want t=
o speak to people at the company, to find out what their business wins (INA=
UDIBLE) have been. But I`d be very surprised if this were not a very diffic=
ult period for them to keep, and win new accounts.=20
MARCHINI: Understood. Howard Schilit, with the Center for Financial Researc=
h and Analysis.=20

O'Neill: Enron Situation `Just Another Piece Of Business'

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday tha=
t the Enron (ENE) situation was "just another piece of business" to him whe=
n the company's chief executive talked to him about its difficulties.=20
In an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America," O'Neill said it was "quite=
 appropriate" for Enron chief executive Kennethy Lay to talk to him Oct. 28=
 and "give me a heads-up" about its difficulties.
O'Neill said Lay had alerted him to Enron's difficulties to make sure that =
capital markets weren't disrupted.=20
The Treasury secretary said "he never asked me to help him at all." O'Neill=
 said Lay hadn't told him that Enron had overstated its profits and he hadn=
't heard anything from Lay that he hadn't already read in newspapers or see=
n on television.=20
O'Neill said he hadn't then told President George W. Bush about the convers=
ation because Bush was busy with the war on terrorism.=20
The Treasury secretary said "I'm a cabinet secretary. I know what my respon=
sibilities are" and he doesn't have to run across the street to the preside=
nt all the time.=20
O'Neill said Enron may be important but this "was just another piece of bus=
iness." O'Neill said he was also busy with the financial war on terrorism.=
=20
The Treasury secretary said it looks as if Enron was operating within the e=
xisting rules for 401K plans and if that was the case then the government w=
ill have to see if changes should be made in the rules. He said Bush doesn'=
t want employees' 401K plans harmed by such situations.

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said it appears Enron Co=
rp was within the rules in managing its corporate pension affairs.=20
"At first blush it looks like Enron operated within the rules and regulatio=
ns that existed, and still exist today with regard to how they managed thei=
r 401(k) plan," O'Neill said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America.
O'Neill was addressing allegations that top corporate executives were able =
to cash out of stock while most employees' corporate pensions held as fixed=
, untradeable investments in Enron stock.=20
He noted he has been tasked by President George Bush to look at possible re=
forms of the corporate pension system, which currently allows companies to =
limit sales of company stock held within the funds, to prevent further case=
s like Enron, where many employees lost most of their personal savings.=20
Yesterday, O'Neill said employees should ultimately be able to make decisio=
ns on their corporate pension investments, and should have a choice of asse=
ts to invest in.=20

Enron's Auditor Says It Destroyed Documents Related to Case

Enron's auditor says it destroyed documents related to the case. The attorn=
ey general, John Ashcroft, says he can't take part in the investigation.=20
JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Let's go back to the story of Enron for a moment=
. The "Wall Street Journal" this morning, they have said it best -- quote -=
- "The storm cloud hanging over Enron and its long-time auditor, Arthur And=
ersen, just got darker" -- unquote.
The company's auditor says it destroyed documents related to the case. The =
attorney general, John Ashcroft, says he can't take part in the investigati=
on. He has a conflict of interest. Enron executives talked to two members o=
f the president's cabinet just before the company collapsed.=20
CNN's senior correspondent Brooks Jackson joins us now from Washington with=
 a detailed look at the timeline of the fall of an energy giant -- Brooks, =
good to have you with us.=20
BROOKS JACKSON, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Jack. Yes, those de=
velopments, just a flurry of them here in the last 24 hours. You mentioned =
the Arthur Andersen destruction of documents. Potentially the most serious =
new development, the Securities and Exchange Commission took the unusual st=
ep of saying they consider this extremely serious. And, boy, are they right=
, because if any of those documents were destroyed after investigations beg=
an, it could be criminal obstruction of justice.=20
As for Attorney General John Ashcroft's stepping aside, Democrats are sayin=
g he did the right thing in doing that. He got something like $57,000 in ca=
mpaign contributions from Enron for his senate campaign, before he was atto=
rney general. Also, many attorneys in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston=
 are stepping aside. A lot of them have family ties to Enron executives and=
 Enron employees. That's, of course, where Enron is headquartered. Some of =
the family members even lost money in 401Ks down there. So it's -- the Just=
ice Department is still sorting out exactly who is going to be conducting t=
his criminal investigation.=20
Those contacts with the White House -- or rather with the Bush administrati=
on are interesting. Secretary O'Neill got two calls from Ken Lay, the Enron=
 chairman. O'Neill says those were just informational calls. He wasn't aske=
d for any help. But Commerce Secretary Don Evans is saying that he was told=
 by Lay that Lay would welcome any help in preserving Enron's bond rating w=
ith Moody's. Now -- and Lay's attorney is saying that he didn't ask for hel=
p. In any case, no help was forthcoming, and the White House says they were=
n't informed of this and that Lay and -- or excuse me -- that O'Neill and D=
on Evans did the right thing.=20
Latest development today: 51 subpoenas are going out from the Permanent Sub=
committee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate. Lay will get a subpoena. Ot=
her Enron and Arthur Andersen officials will get a subpoena, all of the boa=
rd members for the last several years of Enron, including -- and this is ve=
ry unusual -- wife of U.S. Senator Phil Gramm -- Wendy Gramm, who was on th=
e board and on the audit committee of Enron -- Jack.=20
CAFFERTY: Unbelievable. And of course, lost in all of this discussion -- no=
t yours and mine -- but in the discussion about Enron in general is the fac=
t that so many small investors and employees of the company lost their life=
 savings.=20
Brooks, we've got to move along. I thank you for that report very much -- B=
rooks Jackson joining us from Washington.=20

Failing energy giant Enron's chairman is a long-time major contributor to P=
resident Bush's career and to the Republican party. Adding to all of that, =
the company's accounting firm has revealed its employees destroyed document=
s sought in the investigation.=20
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: And now to the monster fallout from the collaps=
e of energy giant, Enron. The White House admits Enron officials sought the=
 administration's help last fall, shortly before the company collapsed. Enr=
on's chairman is a long-time major contributor to President Bush's career a=
nd to the Republican party. And Attorney General John Ashcroft has disquali=
fied himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of campaign d=
onations he received from the company.
Adding to all of that, the company's accounting firm has revealed its emplo=
yees destroyed documents sought in the investigation. For details on that, =
here's CNN Financial News Correspondent Allan Chernoff.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS (voice-over): Four investigators from th=
e House and Energy Commerce Committee arrived at Andersen offices in Housto=
n yesterday to interview Enron auditors and collect documents. But they wer=
e told there's a problem. Thursday afternoon, Andersen admitted material wa=
s missing.=20
In recent months, individuals in the firm involved with the Enron engagemen=
t disposed of a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper=
 documents and correspondence relating to the Enron engagement. Potentially=
 thousands of documents that were part of Enron audits, according to the Ho=
use Committee. Most of them, electronic, that were deleted in September, Oc=
tober and November, the three months prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing.=20
FRANKLIN VELIE, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: This is a surprising, though, an=
d very disappointing development. You would not ordinarily expect a major l=
oss of documents by an accounting or auditing firm with respect to the affa=
irs of its -- of its client.=20
CHERNOFF: Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Chief Stephen Cutl=
er said, "Destruction of documents is an extremely serious matter," which h=
e pledged, "will be included within the scope of our investigation." As the=
 company's auditor, Andersen had given a thumbs-up to Enron's financial sta=
tements. The SEC and Justice Department are investigating whether those ver=
y statements were used to hide Enron's financial condition from investors.=
=20
JOSEPH BERARDINO, CEO, ARTHUR ANDERSEN: If my firm has made errors in judgm=
ent, we will acknowledge them. We will make the changes needed to restore c=
onfidence.=20
CHERNOFF: Andersen has hired former Senator John Danforth to review the com=
pany's records management policy and ensure that remedial and disciplinary =
actions are taken.=20

Enron's Ken Lay says he only gave Washington a `headsup'
By PETE YOST
Associated Press Writer

01/11/2002
Associated Press Newswires=20
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - Transformed in just one day from the nation's biggest ban=
kruptcy to a major political controversy, some of the players in the Enron =
affair are already giving conflicting versions of who said what to whom.=20
Did Enron's Ken Lay ask for help or didn't he when he called Commerce Secre=
tary Don Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Green=
span in a four-day span in late October?
If Lay didn't ask for anything, why did he call?=20
"To give them a heads-up about the situation at Enron," company spokesman M=
ark Palmer said.=20
"At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government nor did he in=
tend to leave any impression that he was asking for assistance," said Palme=
r.=20
Evans's memory of his Oct. 29 phone call is that Lay said "I would apprecia=
te any support you could give."=20
"I did nothing" and the decision to do nothing "was a no-brainer," Evans sa=
id in a brief interview Thursday with The Associated Press.=20
O'Neill insists Lay didn't ask for anything, but the context of their conve=
rsation is intriguing because the two men discussed another financial disas=
ter in which Greenspan's intervention was very much in evidence, the near-f=
ailure in 1998 of a Connecticut-based hedge fund, Long Term Capital Managem=
ent.=20
Greenspan's spokesman, Dave Skidmore, declined to say whether Lay asked for=
 anything.=20
Evans said the context for the call from Lay was the ongoing review of Enro=
n's financial status by Moody's, the bond-rating firm.=20
A severe lowering of Houston-based Enron's bond rating would mean that $3.9=
 billion in company debt would come due. Enron would have to pay what it ow=
ed in cash if it could not pay in stock, which was plummeting in value.=20
Palmer, the Enron spokesman, says he doesn't know whether the Moody's revie=
w was the subject of the Lay-Evans conversation but that the company was co=
ncerned because the bond-rating firm was taking a long time "and we were wa=
nting a decision."=20
In the end, Moody's dropped Enron's rating, creating still more trouble for=
 the world's largest energy trader as it headed toward collapse. The compan=
y went to bankruptcy court on Dec. 2.=20
Lay spoke to Evans the day after a Sunday, Oct. 28, phone call with O'Neill=
 and a phone call the previous Friday with Greenspan.=20
"The chairman did nothing in response to the call. It would have been inapp=
ropriate," said Skidmore, the Greenspan spokesman.=20
Skidmore refused to discuss the contents of the Greenspan call, but in one =
of Lay's two conversations with O'Neill, the discussion turned to the case =
of the Connecticut hedge fund that had been in danger of failure until Gree=
nspan and other Federal Reserve officials pressured several large financial=
 institutions to bail it out.=20
Fed officials feared severe harm to the country's financial system if Long =
Term Capital Management had been allowed to crumble. It nearly tanked durin=
g the Asian financial crisis in the fall of 1998.=20
O'Neill "expressed his concern about the experience that Long Term Capital =
went through when Long Term Capital went bankrupt," said White House spokes=
man Ari Fleischer.=20
In an interview with CNBC, O'Neill said that after one of their conversatio=
ns, "I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak with =
the Enron people, which he did, so we could satisfy ourselves that the Enro=
n affairs were not going to have a negative impact on the U.S. capital mark=
ets."=20
So why did Lay make the flurry of calls if he didn't want anything?=20
He "just felt an obligation to give them information important to the marke=
ts and perhaps to the government," said Palmer.=20
While the information may have been important, the only action resulting fr=
om it appears to have been a decision by the two Cabinet secretaries not to=
 tell President Bush. With Lay at the helm, Enron and its executives had be=
en George W. Bush's most generous campaign donors over the course of two Te=
xas governor's races and the presidential campaign.=20
When did Bush find out of the conversations between Lay, Evans and O'Neill?=
=20
"This morning," Fleischer said Thursday.=20

Revelations about Enron, dealings with Bush officials, raise prickly questi=
ons
By MARCY GORDON
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires=20
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - A cascade of revelations about the bankrupt Enron Corp. a=
nd its dealings with Bush administration officials is raising questions abo=
ut potential conflicts of interest as the Justice Department investigates t=
he politically connected company.=20
The White House revealed Thursday that Enron officials sought the administr=
ation's help last fall shortly before the energy-trading company melted dow=
n along with the life savings of many of its employees. Several administrat=
ion officials - and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan - received tele=
phone calls from the Enron chairman, Kenneth Lay.
Enron's auditing firm, whose work is under investigation by federal regulat=
ors, disclosed that its employees had destroyed a "significant" number of d=
ocuments - which a congressional source said was thousands of pages - relat=
ed to Houston-based Enron.=20
In another startling development in a day brimming with them, Attorney Gene=
ral John Ashcroft disqualified himself from Justice's criminal inquiry into=
 Enron's conduct. The energy-trading company donated thousands of dollars t=
o Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000. In Houston, Enron's hometown, U.S. At=
torney Michael Shelby announced that his entire office disqualified itself =
from the investigation because he and other local prosecutors "have family =
relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankr=
uptcy."=20
Bush, who counts Enron among his biggest political contributors, pledged to=
 pursue aggressively the investigation into whether the company defrauded i=
nvestors, including 401(k) plan holders, by concealing vital information ab=
out its finances.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said. "But what anybody's going to =
find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the=
 Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure th=
at workers are protected."=20
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday: "On first blush it looks like =
Enron operated within the rules and regulations ... with regard to how they=
 managed their 401(k) plan, and if they did, then we need to look and see i=
f there are appropriate changes we could make." He was interviewed on ABC's=
 "Good Morning America."=20
Bush said he saw Lay twice last year, but they did not discuss Enron's fina=
ncial problems. Lay sought help last fall from Commerce Secretary Don Evans=
, Bush's chief political fund-raiser and confidant, and contacted O'Neill a=
bout the firm's financial problems, O'Neill and Evans said Thursday. Enron =
also revealed that Lay called Greenspan, the independent Fed chairman, abou=
t the company's problems.=20
Lay denied that he sought help from the officials. Enron said Lay's calls t=
o O'Neill, Evans and Greenspan were simply to give them a "heads-up" about =
Enron's problems.=20
"He felt an obligation to let them know what was going on," Enron said in a=
 statement. "At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government, =
nor did he intend to leave the impression that he was asking for assistance=
."=20
Dave Skidmore, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, said Lay contacted Gree=
nspan on Oct. 26, and "the chairman did nothing in response to the call. It=
 would have been inappropriate." Skidmore would not characterize the conver=
sation. Lay also first reached out to Evans on Oct. 26. The two eventually =
spoke three days later. The first of Lay's two conversations with O'Neill w=
as Sunday, Oct. 28.=20
Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressiona=
l investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmi=
re even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the =
war against terror.=20
"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col=
lapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders=
 who ultimately lost their life savings," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.=
=20
Firing back, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid "partisa=
n witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions." Democrats ho=
pe to make a political issue out of the administration's many ties to Enron=
.=20
The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once pose=
d to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.=20
Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer sa=
id no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired law=
yers.=20
And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater: missing do=
cuments.=20
The big accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, no=
tified investigators that it had destroyed a "significant" number of docume=
nts related to the company. Andersen said it didn't know whether its direct=
ive to preserve documents demanded by government investigators was violated=
.=20
At the Securities and Exchange Commission, already investigating Andersen's=
 auditing work for Enron, Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said destruct=
ion of documents was "an extremely serious matter" but would not deter the =
SEC from pursuing its probe.=20
As for the company's contacts last fall, administration officials said Lay =
told Evans on Oct. 29 that he would welcome any support to help the company=
 deal with a bond-rating firm that was considering downgrading Enron. Enron=
's credit rating was critical because, if lowered, $3.9 billion in debt wou=
ld come due. Of that amount, $2.4 billion previously had been hidden in par=
tnerships that were created to keep debt off Enron's books.=20
In a brief interview, Evans said Lay told him: "I would appreciate any supp=
ort you could give." Evans said Lay was not more specific. In response to t=
he plea, Evans said, "I did nothing."=20
Evans said he didn't tell the president about the call because "I didn't th=
ink he needed to know."=20
In one of two conversations with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in w=
hich the Federal Reserve pressured several large financial institutions to =
bail out a Connecticut hedge fund, Fleischer said.=20
The calls to Evans and O'Neill came after investors and the public learned =
of the extent of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct=
. 16.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of conjecture about its fin=
ances.=20
Other Enron-Bush administration ties:=20
-Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and indivi=
dual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign. Enron also gave=
 hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in =
Texas. Independent analyses show that Enron employees donated almost $800,0=
00 from 1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. Most we=
nt to GOP causes.=20
-Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides six times last year b=
efore release of the administration's energy plan. A Cheney spokeswoman sai=
d he last talked with Lay in June, and never about Enron's financial status=
.=20
-Senior Bush adviser Karl Rove owned Enron stock at the beginning of Bush's=
 term but sold it because of federal ethics rules. Economics adviser Larry =
Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron for serving on a company board last year.=
=20
-Marc Racicot, whom Bush has appointed chairman of the Republican National =
Committee, was a lobbyist for Enron last year. Racicot said he will do no m=
ore lobbying work after he takes the GOP's top job.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The head of a quasi-public, statewide trash authorit=
y is defending the agency's $220 million deal with the now-bankrupt Enron C=
orp., following stepped-up criticism by a state Senate leader.=20
The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority held a news conference Thursda=
y to rebut comments by Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford, a =
candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor.
CRRA President Robert E. Wright said the agency did nothing wrong in the en=
ergy distribution deal with the Houston-based energy giant that declared ba=
nkruptcy last month.=20
"There's no information that will show it was anything but a very, very goo=
d deal for CRRA," Wright said. "I thought we had discussed this with him, b=
ut if Senator Jepsen wants it explained again, it will be explained again."=
=20
Jepsen, who first questioned the CRRA-Enron relationship last month, called=
 a news conference at his Capitol office Thursday to repeat his criticism.=
=20
"It's incomprehensible to me they put all their eggs in one basket," Jepsen=
 said.=20
Jepsen has questioned why the state made a $220 million upfront, lump-sum p=
ayment in the deal with Enron. The company formed in 1985 and grew into the=
 nation's seventh-biggest company in revenue by buying electricity from gen=
erators and selling it to consumers.=20
Enron's collapse will force CRRA to raise by as much as 60 percent the cost=
 charged to towns to dispose of trash, Jepsen said.=20
Wright disputed Jepsen's cost estimate. "I can't see that under any circums=
tances," he said.=20
Jepsen has called the CRRA-Enron deal the largest loss of public money in C=
onnecticut history. State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigat=
ing.=20
The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it had begun a criminal investig=
ation of Enron Corp.=20
In Connecticut, United Illuminating Co. announced last week it replaced Enr=
on as the utility's energy supplier, signing a $600 million power supply ag=
reement with Dominion Resources.=20
CRRA, which accepts recyclable trash from 70 towns, struck a good deal with=
 Enron for the use of a 90-acre site in Hartford, Wright said. The site inc=
ludes a trash-to-energy plant.=20
The deal with Enron was part of a complex transaction that also involved Co=
nnecticut Light & Power Co., which owned the 90-acre site in Hartford's Sou=
th Meadows area.=20
Under the state's electricity deregulation law, CL&P was mandated to divest=
 all its power-generating assets, including the South Meadows property.=20
To divest, CL&P had to buy its way out of a contract to buy steam power fro=
m CRRA. That contract had 11 years left. The buy-out price was $280 million=
.=20
Using state bond funds given to power companies to help them buy out of con=
tracts and divest holdings under deregulation, CL&P sent $220 million to En=
ron and $60 million to CRRA.=20
The money given to Enron was payment for the company taking over the obliga=
tions of the steam purchasing contract with CRRA that CL&P relinquished.=20
CRRA used part of its $60 million to buy the 90-acre site, clean pollution =
from the site and insure the property.=20
Wright, responding to Jepsen's criticism that CRRA made a mistake by failin=
g to require Enron to post collateral or other security, said such a practi=
ce does not exist in the industry.=20
He refused to rule out the possibility that CRRA will seek a bailout from t=
he state.=20
"We'd be crazy to say no to anything," he said.=20
Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John Rowland, said the governor is not wo=
rried that CRRA's financial loss will jeopardize the state's finances.=20
"He's confident that CRRA has a plan to work its way out of this situation,=
" he said.=20

Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S.: Unit remains solvent: Part of p=
ackage to sell trading business, Milnthorp says

CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading oper=
ations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a=
 buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executiv=
e of the Canadian unit said yesterday.=20
Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be "critical" to a deal to sell=
 Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in =
the company.
The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than=
 $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts=
 -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.=
=20
If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a =
white knight of its own, he said.=20
"We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's =
part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada=
 would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous e=
xpressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time."=
=20
Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six poten=
tial buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part =
of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The=
 auction was expected to continue into the evening.=20
In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing =
for today to approve the sale.=20
Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power unt=
il it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled a=
fter disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt o=
ff its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.=20
Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Ju=
stice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admi=
ssion yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP=
, that a "significant but undetermined" number of documents related to the =
company had been destroyed.=20
Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation "has nothing to do with Enron Canada."=
=20
The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent a=
nd re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an=
 Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major a=
sset.=20
Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell =
Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum produ=
cts, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and=
 a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 4=
9% stake in a new partnership called "Netco," short for New Energy Trading =
Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of E=
nron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.=20
Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after =
last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of=
 confidence in the market.=20
"To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet tha=
t creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. Th=
at's been one of the key criteria through the auction process," he said.=20
Enron Canada's remaining employees are "trying to manage the estate and try=
ing to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid," he sai=
d.=20
The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sunda=
nce B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.=20
Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., t=
he largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and =
BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.

Enron files destroyed, auditor says: White House tries to insulate Bush fro=

WASHINGTON - The White House moved quickly yesterday to contain growing que=
stions about the collapse of energy trader Enron, hoping to insulate George=
 W. Bush, the U.S. President and former oil executive, from any political f=
allout from the scandal.=20
Seeking to get out in front of the story, the White House yesterday acknowl=
edged that senior administration officials received calls for help from Enr=
on as the company went into a death spiral that ended with its bankruptcy o=
n Dec. 2.
Mr. Bush called Enron's fall "deeply troubling" and ordered Paul O'Neill, h=
is Treasury Secretary, to review U.S. pension and disclosure rules to preve=
nt a repeat of the Enron situation, in which employees' pensions were destr=
oyed as the company fell.=20
Among a series of other developments, John Ashcroft, the U.S. Attorney-Gene=
ral, recused himself from the criminal probe into the largest bankruptcy in=
 U.S. history because Enron had given him US$25,000 for his failed bid last=
 year to keep his U.S. Senate seat.=20
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed that a significant number o=
f documents and electronic files related to Enron had been destroyed.=20
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the United States and its larges=
t energy trader, was ruined when the company announced on Nov. 8 it had ove=
rstated earnings by US$638-million from 1997 to 2000. The company's share p=
rice fell from more than US$90 to less than a dollar, wiping out the retire=
ment savings of about 20,000 employees who were forbidden to sell their hol=
dings.=20
Meanwhile, many of the company's senior directors, including Kenneth Lay, E=
nron's chairman and chief executive, became fabulously wealthy when they ca=
shed in large chunks of their shares before the stock price cratered.=20
Houston-based Enron and its executives have been the largest political dono=
rs during Mr. Bush's political career, giving him more than US$623,000, acc=
ording to the Center for Public Integrity.=20
Almost US$2-million more was given to the two leading political parties, al=
though Republicans got 73% of the total.=20
Enron has ties to Republicans such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, whose wi=
fe, Wendy, is a company director, Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, and D=
ick Armey, the House majority leader.=20
Mr. Bush's senior advisor, Karl Rove, came under fire last year for not sel=
ling his Enron shares quickly enough under federal conflict of interest gui=
delines.=20
Mr. Lay met six times with Dick Cheney, the Vice-President, when he was put=
ting together Mr. Bush's national energy policy.=20
Despite Enron's links to Washington, there has been no evidence it received=
 special favours.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," Mr. Bush said yesterday. "But what anybody's goin=
g to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such a=
s the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make su=
re that workers are protected."=20
The President said he had never discussed Enron's situation with Mr. Lay an=
d said the last time he had seen the disgraced executive was in Houston las=
t spring.=20
The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal probe and the Departmen=
t of Labor is investigating the firm, as are four committees from both the =
U.S. Senate and the House.=20
Nonetheless, the Enron quagmire is threatening to suck in Mr. Bush, who has=
 enjoyed near-record popularity ratings because of his wartime leadership.=
=20
"It's now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to coll=
apse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders =
who ultimately lost their life savings," said Henry Waxman, a Democratic co=
ngressman from California.=20
Mr. Bush's press secretary warned Democrats against "partisan witch hunts, =
endless investigations or fishing expeditions."=20
Ari Fleischer said Mr. O'Neill and Don Evans, the Commerce Secretary, had b=
oth been contacted by Mr. Lay as his company began to go under. Both men ag=
reed to take no action to intervene and protect the company's bondholders a=
nd Mr. Bush was not notified of the phone calls, Mr. Fleischer said, reject=
ing the suggestion that the President had intentionally been kept "out of t=
he loop."=20
Enron closed yesterday at 67 cents, down 12 cents on the New York Stock Exc=
hange.

ARTHUR Andersen, auditors to Enron, admitted last night it destroyed thousa=
nds of internal documents in the run-up to the disgraced energy company's $=
70 billion collapse and could now face prosecution.
It told US lawmakers and watchdogs that staff had "disposed of a significan=
t" amount of paperwork relating to its work for Enron, for which it was pai=
d more than $1m a week.=20
This includes emails and documents requested by the US Justice Department a=
nd the Securities and Exchange Commission as their investigation into Ameri=
ca's biggest ever bankruptcy gains momentum.=20
Andersen is ordering an inquiry into the shredding party, which occurred "i=
n recent months", according to the accountancy firm.=20
Senator Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, =
said: "Anyone that destroys records to try to subvert our investigation sho=
uld be prosecuted."=20
Michael Donovan, a Philadelphia lawyer who is mounting a class action lawsu=
it against Andersen on behalf of investors was shocked. "Auditors save ever=
ything," he said.=20
Last month, Andersen's chief executive Joe Berardino turned on his biggest =
client, accusing Enron of withholding key financial information that made d=
oing a proper audit on the business impossible.=20
He also admitted that Andersen, one of the biggest accountancy firms in the=
 world, had made "honest errors" in its assessment of Enron's financial str=
ength.=20
As embarrassment mounts for George Bush because of his close links to Enron=
 and friendship with chairman Kenneth Lay, the President ordered a review o=
f US pension laws.=20
More than 20,000 employees saw their pension funds, often largely invested =
in Enron shares, devastated by the company's plunge into bankruptcy.=20
"In light of the most recent bankruptcy, there needs to be a full review of=
 disclosure rules to make sure that the American stockholder is protected,"=

WASHINGTON -- Reports of missing Enron Corp. documents and secret White Hou=
se meetings have deepened the political intrigue surrounding the launch of =
a criminal probe into the largest corporate failure in U.S. history.=20
The Bush administration scrambled yesterday to distance itself from the Enr=
on debacle as the collapsed company's auditors disclosed that key documents=
 have gone missing and White House officials confirmed the company unsucces=
sfully sought an 11th-hour rescue.
The case is already drawing comparisons to the Whitewater scandal, which do=
gged former president Bill Clinton and triggered a $50-million (U.S.) inves=
tigation by a special counsel into the failed Arkansas real-estate venture.=
=20
Enron's legal and financial problems have also raised questions whether the=
 Bush administration can conduct an objective investigation into one of its=
 largest and most loyal political contributors.=20
Late last year and with the Houston-based company teetering on the brink of=
 failure, chairman Kenneth Lay -- a key campaign donor to President George =
W. Bush and other top Republicans -- talked to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Ne=
ill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans about a possible rescue, the White =
House disclosed yesterday. U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney has acknowledged=
 he met with top Enron officials a half-dozen times last year as he was pre=
paring the Bush administration's energy policy.=20
Mr. Lay's appeals were rejected, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told r=
eporters.=20
Meanwhile, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen =
LLP, disclosed yesterday that some of its employees destroyed a "significan=
t but undetermined" number of paper and electronic documents related to the=
 company.=20
Officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also pro=
bing the Enron bankruptcy, said Arthur Anderson's destruction of documents =
is an "extremely serious matter."=20
Federal law-enforcement agencies and congressional investigators are seekin=
g the documents as part of their inquiries into the bankruptcy of the giant=
 energy-trading company. The destroyed documents include electronic files a=
nd other documents related to its audit of Enron. Also yesterday, Attorney-=
General John Ashcroft said he has stepped down from the criminal investigat=
ion launched by his department after acknowledging that he took a campaign =
donation from Enron during his failed 2001 U.S. Senate bid in Missouri.=20
Mr. Lay and Enron contributed a total of $57,499 to Mr. Ashcroft's campaign=
, according to the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity. The Justic=
e Department insisted Mr. Ashcroft has taken the high road by stepping asid=
e as the sweeping nationwide probe gets under way.=20
"The Attorney-General has not been involved in any aspect of initiating or =
conducting any investigation involving Enron," the Justice Department said =
in a statement.=20
The investigation is being conducted by U.S. Attorneys in New York, Houston=
, San Francisco and elsewhere.=20
Mr. Bush, who received hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions fr=
om Mr. Lay and other Enron executives for his presidential bid, pledged to =
get to the bottom of the stunning collapse.=20
"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully in=
vestigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn fr=
om the past and make sure workers are protected," Mr. Bush said, making his=
 first public comments on the case.=20
Mr. Bush said he never discussed Enron's financial problems with Mr. Lay. T=
he President said he last saw Mr. Lay in Texas at a spring fundraiser for a=

Enron threatens to taint Bush --- Auditors say they destroyed many company =

The White House revealed yesterday that Enron Corp., an energy firm closely=
 tied to U.S. President George W. Bush, sought the administration's help sh=
ortly before collapsing with the life savings of many workers. The company =
denied it sought such help.=20
In a separate disclosure, the company's auditors said they destroyed many E=
nron documents in the months before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion subpoenaed the firm.
In the rapid swirl of events, each raising questions about potential confli=
cts of interest, Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself from t=
he criminal inquiry into Enron's conduct. The company donated thousands of =
dollars to Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000.=20
Bush, who counts Enron as one of his biggest political contributors, pledge=
d to aggressively pursue the investigation into whether the Texas-based fir=
m defrauded investors, including pension contributors, by concealing vital =
information about its finances.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay.=
 "But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully i=
nvestigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn =
from the past and make sure that workers are protected."=20
Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressiona=
l investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmi=
re even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the =
war against terrorism.=20
"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col=
lapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders=
 who ultimately lost their life savings," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.=
=20
Firing back, Bush spokesperson Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid "part=
isan witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions."=20
Democrats hope to make a political issue out of the administration's many t=
ies to Enron.=20
The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once pose=
d to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.=20
Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer sa=
id no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired law=
yers.=20
And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater affair: mis=
sing documents.=20
The firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, notified investig=
ators that it had destroyed a "significant but undetermined" number of docu=
ments related to the company. After the Securities and Exchange Commission =
subpoenaed the accounting firm, it issued an instruction to preserve docume=
nts, it said.=20
As for Enron's contacts last fall, administration officials said U.S. Comme=
rce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill received calls =
from Lay seeking help for his company.=20
Lay told Evans he would welcome any support in helping the company deal wit=
h a bond-rating firm that was considering downgrading Enron, administration=
 officials said.=20
Enron's credit rating was critical because if it was lowered, $3.9 billion =
(U.S.) in debt would come due. Of that amount, $2.4 billion previously had =
been hidden in partnerships that were created to keep debt off Enron's book=
s.=20
Evans quoted Lay as saying, "I would appreciate any support you could give,=
" and said Lay was not more specific. "I did nothing," Evans said of his re=
sponse to the plea. "It was a no-brainer." Evans, one of Bush's oldest frie=
nds, said he didn't tell the president about the call. "I didn't think he n=
eeded to know," he said.=20
In one of two conversations with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in w=
hich the U.S. Federal Reserve Board pressured several large financial insti=
tutions to bail out a Connecticut hedge fund.=20
Lay, for his part, said his calls to O'Neill and Evans were merely to give =
them a "heads up" about Enron's problems. "He felt an obligation to let the=
m know what was going on," Enron said in a statement. "At no time did he as=
k for any assistance from the government nor did he intend to leave the imp=
ression that he was asking for assistance."=20
The calls came after investors and the general public learned of the extent=
 of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct. 16.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of speculation about its fi=
nances.=20
Administration officials dismissed suggestions that Evans or O'Neill should=
 have disclosed Enron's troubles as soon as they were brought to their atte=
ntion last fall. That might have given more notice to investors about to lo=
se their savings.=20
"This is not the first bankruptcy and will not be the last bankruptcy" in A=
merica, Fleischer said.=20
Other aides said Enron's problems were well known at the time of the teleph=
one calls, and the administration's duty was to make sure troubles at Enron=
 didn't have a broader economic impact.=20
Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and individ=
ual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign, making the compa=
ny one of his biggest financial supporters. In addition, Enron gave tens of=
 thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas.=20
Independent analysts show that Enron employees donated nearly $800,000 from=
 1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. The bulk went =
to GOP causes.=20
With criticism mounting, Bush announced a review of federal rules on pensio=
n security and financial disclosure by companies.=20
"There have been a wave of bankruptcies that have caused many workers to lo=
se their pensions and that's deeply troubling to me," Bush said. 'It is now=
 clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but =
did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultim=
ately lost their life savings.'=20

Threat to Bush in Enron inquiry.

President Bush moved rapidly yesterday to distance himself from the collaps=
ed Enron Corporation as speculation grew that the bankruptcy of the giant e=
nergy trading company could turn into his administration's most dangerous s=
candal.=20
Hours after the justice department announced it was setting up a nationwide=
 team of prosecutors as part of a criminal inquiry into Enron, the White Ho=
use ordered a review of rules affecting pension rights and corporate disclo=
sure. Mr Bush told reporters he had not seen Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay,=
 since last spring and had never discussed the company's financial problems=
 with him.
Enron, the seventh ranked company on the Fortune 500, collapsed last month =
- the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history. About 6,000 workers were lai=
d off, many also losing their pensions because they subscribed to a retirem=
ent plan based on Enron shares, which dropped from $90 ( #62) to pennies in=
 a year. The list of creditors runs to 54 pages but senior executives were =
able to sell their stock before the price plummeted.=20
The company is believed to be the largest donor to Mr Bush's campaign funds=
 over the course of his career, and Mr Lay is an old Texas friend of the pr=
esident. He was named as one of the president's energy advisers last year.=
=20
The links between the administration and the company operate on many levels=
. Marc Racicot, Enron's Washington lobbyist, was named last week as chairma=
n of the Republican national committee. The president's chief economic advi=
ser, Lawrence Lindsay, and the trade negotiator Robert Zoellick were advise=
rs to the company.=20
Vice-president Dick Cheney, who also has strong links with the oil industry=
, is known to have met Mr Lay in April to discuss energy policy. And staff =
from Mr Cheney's energy taskforce met Enron executives at least six times, =
with one meeting only six days before the company's troubles became public =
in October. The administration, however, insists that the meetings covered =
only policy matters and not Enron's financial position.=20
The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, was peppered with questions yeste=
rday about whether Mr Bush and Mr Cheney were aware of the situation and if=
 not, why not.=20
"Conversation is routine between people in this country and government," he=
 said at the daily briefing. "There's a difference between corporate contac=
t and wrongdoing."=20
Mr Fleischer said that Mr Lay called the treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, =
and the commerce secretary, Don Evans, before the company's downfall to war=
n them. The two cabinet members "agreed no action should be taken to interv=
ene".=20
Enron, whose interests extend to ownership of Wessex Water in Britain, is m=
ainly in the business of creating markets between buyers and sellers of ene=
rgy. The investigations already launched have highlighted the company's use=
 of offshore entities, apparently to hide its debts.=20
A justice department investigation on this scale into a single entity is th=
ought to be unprecedented, and officials said it was an indication of the c=
ase's potential significance.=20
Congressional Democrats, conscious of the efforts poured into the largely a=
bortive investigation into Bill Clinton's property dealings at Whitewater, =
are beginning to crank up their own investigations.=20
"Enron makes Whitewater look like peanuts," the syndicated columnist Bill P=
ress said.=20
The affair has also called into question the role of energy and financial r=
egulators in the US. And it has done nothing for the reputations of Wall St=
reet analysts who advised clients to put money into the company.

Andersen back in hot seat ; Accounting giant says Enron audit papers destro=
yed
Delroy Alexander, Tribune staff writer

01/11/2002
Chicago Tribune=20
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)=20

A Chicago-based accounting giant that has faced significant embarrassments =
recently now may face unprecedented scrutiny.=20
Andersen took center stage in a potential scandal Thursday after disclosing=
 that its employees had destroyed a "significant" number of documents relat=
ed to the sudden collapse of Enron Corp.
For a company that has weathered damaging disclosures over its audits of Ho=
uston-based Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., the latest brouhaha co=
uld be a further threat to credibility.=20
"This is a deeply troubling development. It should never have happened," sa=
id Billy Tauzin (R-La.), whose House Energy and Commerce Committee is inves=
tigating Enron's collapse. "Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stup=
idity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subver=
t our investigation should be prosecuted."=20
Observers said destruction of the files made no sense, and that the records=
 might have provided clues for investigators probing the Enron case, the la=
rgest bankruptcy in U.S. history.=20
"I have never in my life heard of people in an accounting firm doing someth=
ing like this," said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission. "People in these accounting firms are well-edu=
cated professionals and supposedly well aware of their professional respons=
ibility to the public."=20
For its part, Andersen said in a statement that its company policy "require=
d in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents." =
However, officials added that the firm is still "working to gather the fact=
s and determine appropriate disciplinary actions" against employees.=20
Several observers suggested that the missing files likely were noticed only=
 after the SEC issued subpoenas in mid-December calling for Andersen to han=
d over documents related to its Enron audits.=20
Andersen said the documents were discarded months before it received the su=
bpoenas. "After receiving the SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction =
to preserve documents. At this time, we have not been able to determine whe=
ther that instruction was violated," the firm said.=20
Andersen said that millions of Enron documents still exist and that it had =
successfully retrieved some of the deleted electronic files. It is continui=
ng efforts to "fully learn and understand all the facts related to this iss=
ue," according to the statement.=20
Auditors typically keep records for years, experts say. Most top accounting=
 firms keep records for more than seven years after work is completed, in c=
ase of lawsuits.=20
It also is customary for audit firms to scan and file client documents at a=
 central electronic database or warehouse, according to analysts. Once that=
 is completed, original hard copies are often destroyed.=20
Policy suspended=20
Andersen said it had "suspended its current records management policy effec=
tive immediately and instructed all partners and personnel to retain all ex=
isting documents until further notice."=20
Furthermore, Andersen said it has asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to r=
eview its policies and recommend potential improvements.=20
Andersen has been in the spotlight before for its audits.=20
In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it =
neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Houston-ba=
sed Waste Management Inc. Andersen and the waste hauler also paid $220 mill=
ion in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits relating to the case.=20
Last year, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle class- action liti=
gation brought on behalf of shareholders of another client, Sunbeam Corp., =
which had misstated its financial results during the 1990s.=20
However, the record payout for audit problems remains $335 million paid by =
Ernst & Young to Cendant Corp. shareholders in 1999.=20
Public concern over the veracity of audits has heightened since Enron's deb=
acle, with regulators focusing on Andersen's performance.=20
The news is a blow not only to Andersen, but also to the profession, which =
said it would come up with new rules to help regulate itself after Enron's =
problems emerged.=20
Just last week, the self-regulatory process was called into question after =
rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche gave Andersen's auditing practice a c=
lean bill of health.=20
Problems for claim=20
The news may also present problems for Andersen's claim that it was misled =
by Enron executives, experts said.=20
In mid-December, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, told the fir=
st congressional hearing into the collapse that it warned Enron about "poss=
ible illegal acts," saying the energy-trading giant withheld crucial data a=
bout its complex finances.=20
Some observers warned that the credibility of that claim may now have been =
damaged as a result of the missing documents.=20
"Essentially, they've already claimed that management committed a fraud on =
them," said Mark Cheffers, a former PriceWaterhouse auditor who now runs Ac=
countingMalpractice.com, a liability training Web site that caters to 20,00=
0 accountants.=20
"Evidence that documents have been destroyed that relate to the very events=
 that are under investigation represents a terrible blow for the defense th=
at management misled them," he added.

Andersen gap starts shredding trust all around
David Greising

Chicago Tribune=20
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)=20

Now the Enron debacle has its own 18 1/2-minute gap.=20
The famous gap arose during the Watergate investigation when part of a trou=
blesome Richard Nixon conversation was "accidentally" erased from a White H=
ouse tape.
Enron's auditor, Chicago-based Andersen, disclosed its own smelly blank spa=
ce Thursday. Andersen employees created a huge gap when they destroyed thou=
sands of files that arose from Andersen's Enron audits.=20
File shredders and computer delete keys went into overdrive from September =
to November of last year. Strange coincidence. That's the period of Enron's=
 straight-line depreciation from world's largest energy trader to nation's =
largest bankruptcy.=20
Think the Watergate comparison overreaches? Well, I doubt a president will =
fall because of it. Shredded documents at an accounting firm hardly mean sc=
andal will reach the oval office.=20
As scandals go, this looks more like a Teapot Dome. About oil and money fir=
st, and politics second.=20
Even so, at this early stage, the Enron case has stronger connections at hi=
gher levels than the scandal that started as a "third-rate burglary."=20
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and a top aide stepped out of the criminal investi=
gation because Ashcroft got $60,000 in Enron contributions during his 2000 =
senate campaign. The entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston recused itsel=
f because of family and professional ties to Enron.=20
Other administration officials took Enron money, too. President Bush heads =
the list, with $2 million in donations from Enron Chairman Ken Lay and comp=
any employees since 1993.=20
Money buys access. We'll find out over time if it bought improper influence=
.=20
Ken Lay last fall contacted Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Se=
cretary Don Evans as Enron broke down around him. He reportedly asked O'Nei=
ll about a possible government-orchestrated bailout like the one that limit=
ed damage from the collapse of Long Term Capital Management.=20
Enron didn't get a bailout. But there surely will be other influence questi=
ons as the Enron saga unfolds.=20
For example, what emerged from Lay's private meetings with Vice President C=
heney during development of the administration's energy policy? What did La=
y want from Cheney, anyway--extra room in the strategic petroleum reserve w=
here Andersen could store damaging Enron documents?=20
An administration's first instinct is to minimize the scandal and deflect a=
ttention.=20
The Bush White House chose to spin this scandal as a possible oversight fai=
lure, and a sign regulations can't keep up with an increasingly complex eco=
nomy.=20
"This is not about Enron," Treasury's O'Neill told Lou Dobbs on CNN. "This =
is about making sure that the rules and regulations that govern the way our=
 economic system works are worthy of the conditions in the market today."=
=20
Nice try. But it won't work any better for O'Neill than it did for Andersen=
 chief Joe Berardino, who tried a similar argument late last month when he =
first stepped into the sights of one of the congressional committees invest=
igating the Enron mess.=20
I'd say Berardino and O'Neill are reading from the same playbook. Except, a=
ny playbooks Andersen had probably have been shredded by now.=20
There are loopholes in oversight, particularly in the mostly self- regulate=
d accounting industry. But O'Neill and Berardino are dead wrong. This scand=
al certainly is about Enron.=20
It's about thousands of employees who have lost their jobs and pensions. In=
vestors who have lost their money.=20
Executives who dumped their stock just before the scandal hit.=20
And that's just for starters.=20
Andersen already was at the heart of the scandal. And with Thursday's revel=
ations, it's clear that the Bush administration will be knee-deep in discus=
sing--or maybe denying--its Enron questions for a good long time.=20
Here's another memorable Watergate reference: The toothpaste really came ou=
t of the tube Thursday.=20
It's never going back in. For President Bush's administration and for Chica=
go's Andersen, the key question now is how big a mess it will make.=20

EXPERTS SAY WILLFUL INTENT TO DECEIVE IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN FINANCIAL FR=
AUD PROSECUTION A TOUGH CHORE

Government attorneys face major obstacles in their investigation of Enron C=
orp., legal experts say, and while prosecution is possible, it could take m=
any months to find evidence of crime.=20
The Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other au=
thorities are examining the collapse of Enron, an energy conglomerate that =
entered bankruptcy late last year. Enron had failed to disclose heavy debts=
 it had taken on through a complex series of partnership agreements, leadin=
g investors to believe the company was financially strong.
Despite Enron's spectacular downfall, experts say it is extremely hard to p=
rove criminal wrongdoing when corporate executives engage in deceptive acco=
unting practices.=20
"Criminal liability requires a willful attempt to deceive," said Jeffrey Go=
rdon, a professor at Columbia Law School. "Financial fraud cases are very d=
ifficult to prosecute because it is difficult to prove to a jury that the i=
rregularities were willful in their intent to deceive."=20
While prosecutors may find it tough going to develop a case against Enron e=
xecutives, the government does have vast resources to tap. The high-profile=
 nature of Enron's failure -- and the fact that executives sold $1 billion =
worth of stock before the company announced its accounting problems -- mean=
s investigators are likely to use every tool to determine what happened and=
 who is responsible.=20
Even in the absence of criminal charges, the Justice Department's moves cou=
ld have a strong impact in Washington, embroiling the Bush administration a=
nd others with ties to Enron in a firestorm of damaging disclosures.=20
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company in terms of its stock capi=
talization, was the leading market-maker in energy. It bought power from ge=
nerators and sold it to consumers. It also traded in coal, fiber-optic band=
width, plastic and other commodities.=20
The Justice Department is interested in partnerships Enron set up, allegedl=
y to keep debt off its balance sheet and out of the eyes of investors. Enro=
n recently admitted it had overstated profits by $580 million beginning in =
1997.=20
"They created limited partnerships where Enron was the master partner in co=
ntrol of the money," said Rob Plaza, a stock analyst with Morningstar. "The=
n using Enron stock as collateral, they went out and found investors" to le=
nd the partnership money.=20
The money went to Enron; but the debt remained, at least in Enron's way of =
accounting, with the partnership. Plaza said the arrangement, disclosed onl=
y late last year, was typical of Houston- based Enron's corporate behavior.=
=20
But that does not mean Enron executives are guilty of any crime, and if the=
y are, that the government can prove it to a jury.=20
"There may not be a clear rule of law" that applies to any particular accou=
nting scheme, said Douglas Baird, a professor at the University of Chicago =
Law School. "These aren't very well defined offenses."=20
Baird spoke in general and not specifically of Enron. It is rare for a corp=
orate executive to be led away in handcuffs, even in major instances of fra=
ud.=20
A new problem for investigators emerged yesterday. Chicago-based Andersen, =
which had audited Enron, said it cannot find a "significant but undetermine=
d number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence relating" to =
Enron.=20
One securities lawyer said the loss of the Enron documents could hobble the=
 government's case.=20
"If Andersen were withholding documents and they were sloppy, that makes it=
 harder for the government to use them as a witness," said Brad Bennett, an=
 SEC criminal defense lawyer in Washington, D.C. "The defense lawyers for E=
nron could use the loss of the documents to suggest that Andersen was part =
and parcel of the conspiracy."=20
But John Coffee, a Columbia University Law School professor who testified b=
efore Congress on the Enron case, said the government can still use Anderse=
n.=20
"The source of testimony most damaging to Enron would be Andersen, "Coffee =
said. "Andersen has said there were errors, and that they made only honest =
mistakes."

The investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. widened Thursday as the =
company's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, admitted destroying an untold numbe=
r of documents relating to the Houston energy firm while the White House di=
sclosed that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay last fall contacted two Cabinet off=
icers about the firm's pending bankruptcy.=20
As the White House sought to contain election-year political damage from th=
e company's extensive ties with the Bush administration, Atty. Gen. John As=
hcroft and the entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston recused themselves =
from a newly opened criminal investigation into Enron's failure.
Ashcroft had received campaign contributions from Enron during his unsucces=
sful re-election bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Missouri. In Houston U.S. =
Atty. Michael Shelby said many prosecutors in his office, including himself=
, "have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by =
the Enron bankruptcy."=20
For the first time, the White House disclosed that Lay, a close friend of t=
he president, had called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secre=
tary Don Evans last fall to confirm that Enron "was heading into bankruptcy=
." He also raised the prospect that the collapse could have major financial=
 implications around the world, similar to those from the demise of a 1998 =
hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.=20
O'Neill told CNN that in the conversations on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 Lay did no=
t seek government assistance despite making reference to the investment com=
pany, which was the subject of a private bailout engineered by the Federal =
Reserve Board. O'Neill said he and Evans agreed that the administration sho=
uld not come to Enron's rescue. The two Cabinet officers did not tell Bush =
of their conversations, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.=20
Enron revealed that Lay also called Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan=
 about the company's problems. In a statement, the company said Lay "felt a=
n obligation" to let Greenspan, O'Neill and Evans know about Enron's diffic=
ulties and did not seek government aid.=20
Bush said he was unaware of the precarious state of the company that had he=
lped bankroll his Texas and presidential careers.=20
"I never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial positions of the company," Bu=
sh said Thursday in the Oval Office after ordering a review of pension disc=
losure rules to protect workers in other companies.=20
The president said he saw Lay twice last year.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," he said. "But what anybody's going to find is tha=
t this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bank=
ruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers =
are protected."=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, a move that proved finan=
cially devastating for employees who lost billions of dollars when the comp=
any prohibited them from selling Enron shares in their retirement accounts =
as the shares' value plummeted.=20
Auditor's destruction policy=20
Chicago-based Arthur Andersen, which is also the subject of congressional a=
nd government probes, said a "significant but undetermined" number of elect=
ronic and other documents related to its auditing of Enron had been destroy=
ed or deleted. It said its company policy "required in certain circumstance=
s the destruction of certain types of documents."=20
Even though Andersen said it had retained millions of documents on Enron, t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission called the destruction of documents "=
extremely serious." The SEC is investigating Andersen's conduct in connecti=
on with Enron's failure.=20
Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Commit=
tee, which also is investigating Enron, said thousands of documents had bee=
n destroyed. His spokesman, Ken Anderson, said that anyone who destroys rec=
ords "to try to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted."=20
The White House sought to get out in front of a story that seems likely to =
grow larger and more threatening to the administration. Congress returns Ja=
n. 23 and will begin a series of hearings into the Enron collapse and its e=
ffect on workers.=20
Democrats have begun using the word "scandal" in connection with Enron and =
its connections with the Bush administration.=20
James Jordan, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, f=
undraising arm of the party for the upcoming 2002 Senate elections, said De=
mocrats will emphasize that the Bush administration had close political tie=
s with Enron, whose executives were cashing in their stock as many of the c=
ompany's workers were losing their lifetime savings.=20
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who has been pushing the White House to discl=
ose more about its contacts with Enron, said the administration could have =
done more to help the company and its workers.=20
"The White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did no=
thing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately =
lost their life savings," he said. "I am deeply troubled that the White Hou=
se stood by and let this happen to thousands of families."=20
White House sympathy=20
At the White House, Bush also expressed his sympathy for the plight of the =
families.=20
"The administration is deeply concerned about its effects on the economy. W=
e are also deeply concerned about the effects on the lives of our citizenry=
," he said.=20
The new disclosures about Lay's contacts with O'Neill and Evans, who was Bu=
sh's campaign chairman in 2000, and the destruction of documents at Arthur =
Andersen created new political fodder for several panels investigating Enro=
n. A Senate investigations subcommittee planned to issue subpoenas Friday f=
or documents at Enron and Arthur Andersen, as well as from directors and ex=
ecutives of Enron.=20
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the panel, said: "Because these are =
document subpoenas, the criminal investigation will have no effect on our i=
nvestigation at this time. Hearings of the subcommittee will be scheduled a=
fter the subcommittee's review of the documents."=20
Ashcroft's recusal, along with that of his top aide, David Ayers, who was h=
is campaign manager in the 2000 Missouri Senate race, also could lead to fa=
llout the administration would find undesirable. Ashcroft received $57,499 =
from Enron and its executives in that race, according to the Center for Res=
ponsive Politics.=20
Pressure is beginning to build for appointment of a special prosecutor to l=
ook into the case. Although the independent counsel law expired in 1999 aft=
er the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the attorney general has wide=
 discretion to name a special counsel.=20
Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said=
 an outside counsel is needed now.=20
"With Ashcroft's involvement and now recusal, and with President Bush's rel=
ationship with Ken Lay, there are real concerns about the Department of Jus=
tice being able to handle the investigation," Noble said.=20
White House spokesman Fleischer said Bush trusts the Justice Department to =
handle the case.=20
"The Department of Justice has conflict-of-interest rules, and if there is =
anything that the attorney general is aware of that would trigger it, the p=
resident knows he will take responsible action," he said.=20
In seeking to control political damage from Enron's collapse, Fleischer sai=
d the American people don't have the tolerance to endure "a partisan witch =
hunt." He said that Enron contributed to Democratic and Republican candidat=
es.=20
Enron generous to GOP=20
The Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan campaign-finance watchdog g=
roup, said top Enron executives contributed nearly $800,000 to Bush, the Re=
publican and Democratic Parties and members of Congress. Only one-tenth of =
that money went to Democrats, the center said.=20
During his daily briefing, Fleischer was placed on the defensive as questio=
ns mounted about the broadening investigation into how the world's largest =
buyer and seller of natural gas fell into financial ruin. He downplayed the=
 telephone calls to O'Neill and Evans, saying it was not uncommon for admin=
istration officials to be asked for help for a struggling company or indust=
ry.=20
"Bankruptcies happen in our economy," he said. "It's not uncommon for peopl=
e who are in the community, business community or in the labor community, t=
o talk to a Cabinet secretary to tell the financial status of their busines=
s."

Government attorneys face major obstacles in their investigation of Enron C=
orp., legal experts say, and while prosecution is possible, it could take m=
any months to find evidence of crime.=20
The Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other au=
thorities are examining the collapse of Enron, an energy conglomerate that =
entered bankruptcy late last year. Enron had failed to disclose heavy debts=
 it had taken on through a complex series of partnership agreements, leadin=
g investors to believe the company was financially strong.
Despite Enron's downfall, experts say it is hard to prove criminal wrongdoi=
ng when corporate executives engage in deceptive accounting practices.=20
"Criminal liability requires a willful attempt to deceive," said Jeffrey Go=
rdon, a professor at Columbia University Law School. "Financial fraud cases=
 are very difficult to prosecute because it is difficult to prove to a jury=
 that the irregularities were willful in their intent to deceive."=20
While prosecutors may find it tough going to develop a case against Enron e=
xecutives, the government does have vast resources to tap. The high-profile=
 nature of Enron's failure--and the fact that executives sold $1 billion wo=
rth of stock before the company announced its accounting problems--means in=
vestigators are likely to use every tool to determine what happened and who=
 is responsible.=20
Even in the absence of criminal charges, the Justice Department's moves cou=
ld have a strong impact in Washington, embroiling the Bush administration a=
nd others with ties to Enron in damaging disclosures.=20
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company in terms of its stock capi=
talization, was the leading marketmaker in energy. It bought power from gen=
erators and sold it to consumers. It also traded in coal, fiber-optic bandw=
idth, plastic and other commodities.=20
The Department of Justice is interested in partnerships Enron set up, alleg=
edly to keep debt off its balance sheet and out of the eyes of investors. E=
nron recently admitted it had overstated profits by $580 million beginning =
in 1997.=20
"They created limited partnerships where Enron was the master partner in co=
ntrol of the money," said Rob Plaza, a stock analyst with Morningstar. "The=
n using Enron stock as collateral, they went out and found investors" to le=
nd the partnership money.=20
The money went to Enron, but the debt remained, at least in Enron's way of =
accounting, with the partnership. Plaza said the arrangement, disclosed onl=
y late last year, was typical of Houston- based Enron's corporate behavior.=
=20
"Almost everything was a closely guarded secret," Plaza said. "You had a co=
mpany of sharks. In their culture, they pushed everything to the limit."=20
But that does not mean Enron executives are guilty of crime, and if they ar=
e, that the government can prove it to a jury.=20
"There may not be a clear rule of law" that applies to any particular accou=
nting scheme, said Douglas Baird, a professor at the University of Chicago =
Law School. "These aren't very well-defined offenses." Baird spoke in gener=
al and not specifically of Enron.=20
Rarely are corporate executives led away in handcuffs, even in major cases =
of fraud. Many of the insider trading convictions of the 1980s, for example=
, were overturned on appeal.=20
But Baird said prosecution becomes more likely when deceptive accounting pr=
actices hurt many people, involve large sums of money and yield huge profit=
s to conspirators.=20
A new problem for investigators emerged Thursday. Chicago-based Andersen, w=
hich had audited Enron, said it cannot find a "significant but undetermined=
 number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence relating" to E=
nron.=20
One securities lawyer said the loss of the Enron documents could hobble the=
 government's case.=20
"If Andersen were withholding documents and they were sloppy, that makes it=
 harder for the government to use them as a witness," said Brad Bennett, an=
 SEC criminal defense lawyer in Washington, D.C. "The defense lawyers for E=
nron could use the loss of the documents to suggest that Andersen was part =
and parcel of the conspiracy."=20
But John Coffee, also a Columbia University Law School professor, who testi=
fied before Congress on the Enron case, said the government can still use A=
ndersen.=20
"The source of testimony most damaging to Enron would be Andersen," Coffee =
said. "Andersen has said there were errors, and that they made only honest =
mistakes. If they said, `We were lied to by the various officers we relied =
on'--that kind of testimony would be very strong and the kind of testimony =
needed to prove criminal intent. It already has been said to a degree by An=
dersen in congressional testimony."=20
Coffee acknowledged that Andersen would look a "little strange" if unable t=
o find the Enron documents. "But Andersen accountants had long face-to-face=
 meetings with Enron executives that may buttress their assertions about po=
tential misrepresentations.=20
"The jury could sit there and say both Enron and Andersen are crooks and st=
ill believe Andersen was lied to," Coffee said.

THE NATION Ashcroft Recuses Himself From Probe Into Fallen Energy Giant Inv=
estigation: Enron's vast connections in D.C. and Texas have created an obst=
acle to the Justice Department's inquiry.

WASHINGTON -- Enron's many financial and political ties to the Bush adminis=
tration and other government officials are already complicating a nascent c=
riminal probe by the Justice Department into the bankrupt energy company.=
=20
And Enron's entrenched network of connections at the White House and on Cap=
itol Hill--forged by political contributions, lobbying and personal ties--a=
re making it difficult for politicians to keep at arm's length the growing =
furor engulfing the company.
The most obvious example is Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announcement Thursda=
y that he and his chief of staff, David Ayres, are recusing themselves--rem=
oving themselves from any involvement in what will surely be one of the Jus=
tice Department's highest-profile criminal investigations of the year.=20
The reason: Ashcroft and Ayres didn't want anyone to think that they--or th=
e Justice Department--would go easy on Enron because the company's chief ex=
ecutive, Kenneth L. Lay, other Enron employees and the company's political =
action committee had contributed more than $57,000 in 2000 to Ashcroft's fa=
iled senatorial campaign, which Ayres managed.=20
Ashcroft insisted that he has not been involved in any aspect of the Enron =
investigation. He said his deputy, Larry Thompson, would take his place if =
and when high-level consultations are needed.=20
In Houston, Enron's hometown, U.S. Atty. Michael T. Shelby recused not only=
 himself Thursday but also his entire office of federal prosecutors, who we=
re expected to play a prominent role in the criminal investigation.=20
In Shelby's case, the recusals came for the opposite reason: Too many prose=
cutors--himself included--had friends and family members who had worked for=
 Enron and had suffered numbing financial losses when its stock price plumm=
eted.=20
"We might be viewed as being overly aggressive because we know people, and =
in some cases are married to people, who lost substantial amounts of money =
as a result of the collapse of the company," Shelby said in an interview. "=
In my case, it's my wife's brother who works there."=20
Whether they fear being perceived as going too easy or too hard on Enron, t=
he prosecutors' ties to the company could well hamper the investigation in =
its early stages, some Justice Department officials and outside legal exper=
ts said Thursday. Because of the likelihood of conflicts in the Houston off=
ice, the Justice Department this week convened a task force out of its Wash=
ington headquarters in an effort to determine whether any laws were broken =
as the company collapsed late last year, shredding billions of investor dol=
lars and costing thousands of jobs.=20
"This investigation needs to go forward, and it needs to go forward in an e=
xpeditious and focused way," Shelby said. "And there needs to be a seamless=
 transition between this office and the Department of Justice."=20
Enron has long sought to be influential in Texas and Washington, and it has=
 succeeded through political contributions to both parties, extensive lobby=
ing and personal ties.=20
Although few, if any, elected officials have said they will recuse themselv=
es from the congressional investigations into the Enron collapse, many have=
 connections to the company.=20
The most obvious example is Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the senior Republican=
 on the Senate Banking Committee, which is investigating the Enron matter. =
Gramm's wife, Wendy, has served on Enron's board of directors.=20
And Enron has deep links to President Bush and others in his administration=
.=20
It was disclosed Thursday that Lay called two Cabinet members, Treasury Sec=
retary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, late last year to =
discuss the company's financial problems. O'Neill, through a spokeswoman, a=
cknowledged being an acquaintance of Lay's. Evans, a former oil company exe=
cutive, has long-standing connections to the Texas political and business w=
orlds as well.=20
Overall, Enron's political action committee and the company's employees and=
 directors contributed a total of $5.7 million to candidates and the two po=
litical parties--73% of that to Republicans--in the last seven election cyc=
les, according to an analysis conducted by the Center for Responsive Politi=
cs. Bush received $113,800 for his presidential campaign, Gramm received $9=
7,350, and Texas' other Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, received =
$99,500.=20
Enron's employees and directors have given $623,000 to Bush during his poli=
tical career, according to the Center for Public Integrity.=20
Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, served on an Enron advi=
sory board and, according to documents the White House made public last yea=
r, received $50,000 from the company before he joined the administration a =
year ago.=20
Karl Rove, Bush's senior advisor, delayed selling his significant portfolio=
 of Enron stock for several months after taking office, to avoid having to =
pay capital gains taxes on his profits, and met with Lay while holding the =
stock.=20
Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, soon to become chairman of the Republican=
 National Committee, was recently a lobbyist for Enron.=20
Some Democrats plan to take up the issue of the Bush administration's conne=
ctions to Enron as the various investigations progress.=20
"The White House has to do a complete disclosure of all the contacts admini=
stration representatives had with Enron," said Phil Schilero, chief of staf=
f to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).=20

THE NATION Destruction of Records 'Unusual,' Experts Say

The disclosure Thursday by Andersen, the accounting firm, that it destroyed=
 a "significant" number of documents of client Enron Corp. in recent months=
 came as a surprise to the accounting industry, which typically keeps such =
records for years even though there aren't strict rules regulating an audit=
or's paperwork storage.=20
Anderson's action "is unusual," said Jonathan Hamilton, editor of the Publi=
c Accounting Report, a trade publication. "Usually in the case of an ongoin=
g client relationship, you find it useful" to keep nearly all documents, he=
 said.
And if there's even a hint that the accounting firm or its client might be =
involved in litigation down the road, "the general rule is that you keep ev=
erything," Hamilton said.=20
In November, Houston-based Enron said it had inflated profits by $586 milli=
on since 1997. The energy company is operating under bankruptcy court prote=
ction and is under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, an inq=
uiry expected to focus on possible accounting fraud.=20
The company also is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion and several congressional committees.=20
The SEC's director of enforcement, Stephen Cutler, said in a statement that=
 the destruction of Enron-related documents and electronic files by Anderse=
n, formerly known as Arthur Andersen, are "an extremely serious matter" bec=
ause documents "are an essential ingredient in our investigations."=20
But he didn't say whether Andersen's action was illegal, and the SEC declin=
ed further comment. Andersen said it still has "millions of documents relat=
ed to Enron" but that its policy for record storage--a policy that Andersen=
 said it has now suspended--required that some documents be destroyed.=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which issues guidelines for how a=
ccounting firms should audit a company's books, doesn't offer set rules for=
 saving documents, said spokeswoman Sheryl Thompson. Another trade group, t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, recommends that acco=
unting firms keep documents for as long as they serve the needs of the firm=
.=20
But that guideline is open to broad interpretation, and the storage of docu=
ments varies from firm to firm.=20
Even so, most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least three =
to four years, Arthur Bowman, editor of the industry newsletter Bowman's Ac=
counting Report, told Reuters.=20
None of the other big accounting firms could immediately be reached for com=
ment, but industry insiders said some firms have a standard practice of kee=
ping records for a minimum of six years.=20
Hamilton said it's not the first time that an accounting firm has raised qu=
estions by destroying corporate documents.=20
"It's come up from time to time in the profession, especially when we had t=
he dot-com shakeout," he said.=20
The collapse of many high-technology companies sparked shareholder lawsuits=
 that led to accounting firms saying they had destroyed the auditing docume=
nts in certain cases "because they're not our client anymore," Hamilton add=
ed.

WASHINGTON -- Enron chairman Kenneth Lay reached out to two of President Ge=
orge W. Bush's cabinet officers when the Houston-based energy company was c=
ollapsing, the White House disclosed yesterday as the Justice Department op=
ened a criminal investigation of Enron's bankruptcy.=20
Bush, who received significant campaign contributions from Lay and other En=
ron executives, said he himself has never discussed Enron's financial probl=
ems with its embattled corporate chairman. The president said he last saw L=
ay in Texas at a spring fund-raiser for former first lady Barbara Bush's li=
teracy foundation.
Lay also was among a group of some 20 business leaders who came to the Whit=
e House early in the Bush administration to discuss the state of the econom=
y, Bush said.=20
Many Enron employees lost their life savings when the company filed for ban=
kruptcy Dec. 2.=20
"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully in=
vestigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn fr=
om the past and make sure workers are protected," Bush said.=20
But Lay did seek the ear of other top-level administration officials last f=
all.=20
According to White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, Lay telephoned Trea=
sury Secretary Paul O'Neill amid Enron's collapse "to advise him about his =
concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to me=
et those obligations."=20
Lay also told O'Neill that Enron "was heading to bankruptcy," Fleischer sai=
d.=20
O'Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury spokes=
woman Michele Davis. It was on Oct. 16 that Enron made its stunning disclos=
ure of a $638-million US third-quarter loss.=20
In a separate phone call to Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Lay similarly wor=
ried that the company might have to default on its obligations. He brought =
to the secretary's attention "that he was having problems with his bond rat=
ing and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector," Fleischer sa=
id.=20
After that conversation, Evans spoke to O'Neill "and they both agreed no ac=
tion should be taken to intervene with their bond holders," Fleischer said.=
=20
The firm that audited the books of collapsed Enron Corp., Arthur Andersen L=
LP, disclosed yesterday that a "significant but undetermined" number of doc=
uments related to the company had been destroyed.=20
Andersen's auditing work for Enron, which entered last month into the large=
st corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history, is being investigated by the Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission.=20

Outlook: Enron/pensions

01/11/2002
The Independent - London=20
FOREIGN
15
(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)=20

THE US President, George W Bush, has ordered a review of US pension regulat=
ions following the collapse of Enron. One of the most disturbing aspects of=
 the insolvency was that employees had more than half their pension fund as=
sets invested in Enron shares, which are now worthless.=20
Worse, due to an administrative change in the scheme, employees were preven=
ted from divesting their Enron holdings during a crucial 10 day period of b=
ad news in late October and early November when the stock lost nearly a thi=
rd of its value. Forget the now active criminal investigation into false ac=
counting at Enron. The real scandal is that as directors piled out of the s=
tock they had been so active in promoting, their downtrodden staff were loc=
ked in to face the music.
Many employees have thus suffered a double blow of both losing their jobs a=
nd the great bulk of their retirement nest egg. In Britain's last big corpo=
rate scandal, Robert Maxwell stole from the pension fund in order to prop u=
p his ailing business empire, but in the end no one suffered as badly as En=
ron employees seem likely to. Nearly all the stolen Maxwell millions were e=
ventually recovered, and job losses were minimal.=20
The lax audit, banking and management practices that allowed the Maxwell sc=
andal to happen were much mocked on the other side of the Atlantic at the t=
ime, in apparent disregard of the mote in America's own eye. Indeed, in rec=
ent years it has become fashionable to praise the 401k pension plans that s=
anction such reckless investment in the employer's own stock. Many respecta=
ble British voices have been heard to lobby for the same thing here.=20
Not much danger of that now. As it happens, Enron is by no means the worst =
case of incest in the pension fund. Coca-Cola, General Electric and McDonal=
d's all have more than 75 per cent of their 401k pension plans invested in =
their own stock, and jolly proud of it they were too until the Enron collap=
se so painfully demonstrated the downside of having all your eggs in one ba=
sket. On this side of the Atlantic, where on the whole we are much more cau=
tious about the way our pension money is invested, it's hard to understand =
how such a high risk strategy could ever have been allowed.=20
In part it's cultural. US companies actively encourage employees to buy int=
o every aspect of the sales pitch. And although the 401k plans are meant to=
 empower employees to make their own decisions on where their pensions are =
invested, in practice they tend to offer only a very limited range of optio=
ns, prominent among which is naturally the company's own stock. In Enron's =
case, the employers' pension contribution was made not in cash, as it is in=
 Britain, but stock. For every dollar invested, there would be 50 cents of =
Enron stock. Again this is pretty much standard practice across a large num=
ber of big US corporations.=20
A painful period of adjustment is now in prospect as new laws are introduce=
d limiting exposure to any one asset to, say, 10 per cent of the total. The=
 excesses of the last bull market are not so easily buried, it would seem.

ENRON MESS GETS MESSIER DONOR ASKED WHITE HOUSE TO HELP WARD OFF BANKRUPTCY
DANA MILBANK AND PETER BEHR, THE WASHINGTON POST

01/11/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette=20
REGION
A-1
(Copyright 2002)=20

Bush administration officials yesterday disclosed that the top official of =
Enron Corp., one of President Bush's biggest campaign donors, sought help f=
rom the administration to avoid bankruptcy in the weeks before the giant en=
ergy concern collapsed last year, wiping out the pensions of thousands of w=
orkers.=20
Enron chief executive Kenneth L. Lay had conversations about his company's =
dire finances with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary D=
on Evans, telling Evans, Bush's former campaign manager, that he would welc=
ome help stopping a private credit-rating agency from downgrading Enron deb=
t -- an event that could force Enron into bankruptcy. Administration offici=
als said yesterday that Evans did not intervene. Enron's bankruptcy, filed =
on Dec. 2, is the largest in U.S. history.
Also yesterday, Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, informed the government t=
hat employees at the accounting firm had destroyed a "significant" number o=
f Enron-related documents -- thousands of records, according to congression=
al investigators. The Securities and Exchange Commission took the unusual s=
tep yesterday of saying it is widening its investigation of Enron Corp. to =
include the destruction of records.=20
As the controversy grew yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft and one o=
f his top aides recused themselves from the Justice Department's just-annou=
nced criminal investigation into Enron's collapse. Ashcroft's political com=
mittees had received $57,499 in the last election cycle. The entire U.S. at=
torney's staff in Enron's hometown of Houston also recused themselves becau=
se of Enron ties.=20
The drumbeat of developments significantly expanded the controversy over En=
ron and its ties to the administration at a time when the White House has b=
een seeking to limit the political damage. Earlier this month, the White Ho=
use disclosed that the energy task force met six times with Enron officials=
 but said the company's finances were not discussed.=20
Until yesterday, the White House spokesman had said he had no knowledge of =
contacts between Bush officials and Enron about the events leading to its d=
emise. The White House said O'Neill and Evans, who was Bush's campaign mana=
ger, did not notify Bush until yesterday of their contacts with Lay about E=
nron's trouble.=20
Bush yesterday commissioned task forces to provide recommendations to refor=
m pension laws "to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their li=
fe savings as the result of a bankruptcy" and "to analyze corporate disclos=
ure rules and regulations."=20
On Capitol Hill, Republicans joined Democrats in calling for probes into En=
ron. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will hold hearings on Jan. 2=
4 and the Senate Commerce Committee will begin hearings on Feb. 4. The Hous=
e Energy and Commerce Committee, whose investigators discovered that Anders=
en had destroyed Enron documents, will also have hearings in "early Februar=
y," a committee spokesman said yesterday.=20
The White House faces increased pressure from Congress to disclose all meet=
ings its energy task force had with energy industry officials when it devel=
oped the administration's energy policy last year. Congress's General Accou=
nting Office said that it would decide within the month whether it would ta=
ke the administration to court over its refusal to provide information on w=
hich groups it met with to develop the energy policy.=20
Lay, whose name appeared on early lists of possible Bush Cabinet secretarie=
s, was one of the Bush "Pioneers" who raised at least $100,000 for the pres=
idential campaign. According to the Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog=
 group, Lay contributed $44,000 to Bush's presidential campaign, part of $2=
20,700 in contributions to Bush's presidential efforts by top Enron executi=
ves. Between 1999 and 2001, Enron made $1.9 million in unregulated soft-mon=
ey contributions, mostly to Republicans.=20
The president yesterday said he "never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial=
 problems of the company." Bush added that his "administration will fully i=
nvestigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy to make sure we can learn fr=
om the past and make sure that workers are protected."=20
Administration officials said Lay discussed Enron's plight with O'Neill on =
Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, and Evans on Oct. 29. On Oct. 16, Enron reported a $638=
 million loss and the first in a series of damaging errors in its accountin=
g.=20
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called O'Neill "to advis=
e him about his concern about the obligations of Enron." Lay suggested the =
case of Long-Term Capital Management LP could be a model. In 1998, that fir=
m, a hedge fund, benefited from a government- coordinated bailout by other =
financial institutions after losing more than $4 billion in derivatives, a =
complex securities transaction.=20
"Long Term Capital was unable to meet its obligations and headed to bankrup=

ial.=20
O'Neill said he considered his two conversations with Lay to be "business a=
s usual." O'Neill told CNN: "I get calls every day from the big players in =
the world. Enron was the biggest trader of energy in the world."=20
In addition, Fleischer said Lay brought to Evans' attention "the problems w=
ith the obligations and the bankruptcy. He was having problems with his bon=
d ratings and was worried about its impact on the energy sector." Commerce =
spokesman Jim Dyke said Lay indicated "he would welcome any support the sec=
retary thought was appropriate" persuading Moody's Investor Services not to=
 downgrade Enron's debt. Evans talked to his general counsel and conferred =
with O'Neill over lunch on Oct. 29 and decided not to take action, Dyke sai=

At the time Lay approached Evans, Moody's Investors Service was considering=
 downgrading the credit rating on billions of dollars in Enron debt, an act=
ion that was certain to drive Enron's stock down further and cut deeply int=
o its trading business, financial analysts had warned. On Nov. 28, Moody's =
and other rating services did downgrade Enron's bond to junk status, forcin=
g it into bankruptcy.=20
Enron's attorney, Robert Bennett, said Lay believed he had an obligation to=
 alert the administration to Enron's increasingly precarious condition and =
the possibility that the nation's largest energy trader could fall into ban=
kruptcy. "He asked them for nothing," Bennett said.=20
Federal and congressional investigators are probing whether senior Enron ex=
ecutives exaggerated its profits and concealed rapidly- mounting debts thro=
ugh a labyrinth of hundreds of investment partnerships and offshore corpora=
tions, thus making the company appear stronger than it really was.=20
Andersen's disclosure of destroyed records, which led the firm to hire form=

be a new priority.=20
"This a deeply troubling development," House Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin=
, R-La., said of the lost documents. "Anyone who destroyed records simply o=
ut of stupidity should be fired. Anybody who destroyed records to try and s=
ubvert our investigation should be prosecuted."=20
Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee first requested t=
he records on Dec. 13. But Enron's lawyer, Bennett, said Enron was unaware =
that Andersen was destroying records. "The first they heard of it was today=
," Bennett said, after checking with a senior Enron executive.

DEMOCRATS ASK: WHAT DID BUSH KNOW, AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?

The exploding Enron saga presents all the elements of earlier Washington sc=
andals, including carefully phrased denials and accusations of improper inf=
luence. And in a matter of hours yesterday, it sent the White House into a =
full-scale effort to contain the potential damage to President Bush at a ti=
me when he wants to focus on the war on terrorism and the flagging economy.=
=20
The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from=
 a torrent of bad news about the fall of the Houston energy conglomerate.
Although no one has suggested that Bush has done anything wrong, the connec=
tions between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close. The company=
's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, has been a close friend of Bush for many years=
, and Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more to Bush over his=
 political career than anyone else -- an amount exceeding $550,000.=20
Those connections were made vividly clear yesterday when the White House di=
sclosed that Lay sought government aid last fall from Treasury Secretary Pa=
ul O'Neill and from Bush's best friend and presidential campaign chairman, =
Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.=20
The day began with Bush expressing sympathy for Enron employees whose retir=
ement accounts were wiped out by the collapse of the company's stock, and e=
nded with calls from Congress for a criminal investigation of the company's=
 auditors for destroying documents.=20
Throughout the day, White House officials denied that Bush had been aware o=
f the company's precarious finances or had ever been asked to come to Enron=
's rescue.=20
But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were already beginning to ask of the preside=
nt, "What did he know and when did he know it?" And questions were being ra=
ised about whether the criminal inquiry should be led by a special counsel =
rather than by the Justice Department, because Attorney General John Ashcro=
ft received $57,499 in campaign contributions from Enron and Lay, according=
 to the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
Ashcroft and his chief of staff recused themselves from the criminal invest=
igation that will attempt to determine whether the company or its executive=
s committed fraud before Enron went bankrupt. But critics still questioned =
whether the department, which includes many other political appointees, cou=
ld independently investigate the company.=20
Scandal pieces in place=20
Just as Enron's collapse was stunning because it occurred so quickly and so=
 completely, the latest disclosures have reawakened Washington's now-famili=
ar scandal machinery, which had remained practically dormant since Sept. 11=
. Washington may once again face months, if not years, of yet another inves=
tigation of the White House featuring the volatile mix of money, influence,=
 access and politics.=20
All the elements of a classic political scandal are here: A Texas corporati=
on, led by Bush's most generous campaign contributor, files the largest ban=
kruptcy petition in American history. A handful of Enron executives are abl=
e to sell $1 billion worth of the company's stock before its collapse, but =
thousands of employees are barred from selling, losing their life's savings=
 and their retirement accounts.=20
And just this week, the White House disclosed that Enron executives, and it=
s chairman, had meetings and discussions with Cabinet members, White House =
officials and Vice President Dick Cheney before and during the corporation'=
s implosion.=20
On top of everything else, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, =
Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed yesterday that a "significant but undetermin=
ed" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.=20
"This is the perfect storm," said Phil Schiliro, the press secretary for Re=
p. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif. "It's the biggest bankruptcy in American corpo=
rate history -- a bankruptcy where a small number of executives enriched th=
emselves to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars while thousands of =
employees were left with worthless stock. And in 2001, Enron is the most in=
fluential company in Washington. When you piece it all together, there are =
many questions that need to be answered."=20
Bush said yesterday that he had never discussed Enron's financial woes with=
 Lay, who has supported Bush politically since his unsuccessful campaign fo=
r Congress in 1978. Bush said he last saw Lay in Texas at an April 30 fund-=
raiser for former first lady Barbara Bush's literacy foundation. At the tim=
e, Enron's share price was nearly $60 a share; its closing price yesterday =
was 67 cents per share.=20
Both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have pledged to work togethe=
r to get to the bottom of the matter. But some Democratic officials express=
ed glee that questions about White House influence- peddling seemed to be e=
merging as a major political story of 2002.=20
"If their goal was to give this story a head of steam, they have succeeded,=
" Jennifer Palmieri, the press secretary of the Democratic National Committ=
ee.=20
Five separate congressional committees have sent out subpoenas on the Enron=
 matter. The first of many congressional hearings expected this year is sch=
eduled for Jan. 24 by the Senate Government Affairs committee, which is cha=
ired by Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., who may be thinking of running for pre=
sident in 2004.=20
Several congressmen demanded again yesterday for the White House to release=
 records of all its contacts with Enron executives, including phone message=
s and e-mails.=20
"In contrast to the six contacts the White House disclosed," Waxman said, "=
I suspect there were dozens of conversations between administration officia=
ls and Enron representatives during the past year. The public and Congress =
should have this information, especially since it is now clear the White Ho=
use had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try =
to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their li=
fe savings."

THE NATION Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records Finance: The admission a=

 help from two Cabinet members, the White House reveals.

WASHINGTON -- The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that it de=
stroyed a "significant" number of documents related to its audit of Enron C=
orp., as the White House disclosed that Enron's chief executive contacted B=
ush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was collapsing.=20
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans said th=
ey listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay's description of the firm's di=
re financial problems last fall but took no action.
Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enron's sudden failure--one =
that has financial, legal and political overtones. The disclosure by Anders=
en, until recently known as Arthur Andersen, prompted outrage in Congress a=
nd could complicate federal investigations into the massive bankruptcy.=20
Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed of a "significant but und=
etermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence" rela=
ting to Enron. Investigators could not immediately say what documents were =
destroyed. A company spokesman said the matter is under review and would no=
t say whether the destruction was accidental or intentional. The company sa=
id millions of documents related to Enron still exist.=20
A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that "potentially=
 thousands of records" were destroyed in September, October and November. I=
nvestigators plan to meet with the head of Andersen's Houston office next w=
eek and question him on the matter.=20
Despite the administration's efforts to distance itself from the Enron fias=
co, the company's huge political footprint continued to create problems. At=
ty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and the entire U.S. attorney's o=
ffice in Houston, where Enron is based, recused themselves from the crimina=
l probe of the company because of potential conflicts of interest.=20
Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed 2000 Sen=
ate campaign, and the U.S. attorney in Houston said many on his staff have =
family members who could be affected by the Enron bankruptcy.=20
The fallout touched the White House, as President Bush ordered senior offic=
ials to recommend reforms of the pension system and to examine federal rule=
s governing corporate disclosures. Investigators are probing whether compan=
y officials withheld financial information from investors who, along with e=
mployees in the company pension plan, suffered huge losses in the firm's co=
llapse.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of the Enron executive, a gene=
rous donor to Bush's political campaigns. "But what anybody's going to find=
 is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enr=
on bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that w=
orkers are protected."=20
The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice Departmen=
t launched a criminal probe of the company, investigating, among other matt=
ers, whether Enron knew of problems but failed to disclose them. In congres=
sional testimony last month, the head of Andersen said he had warned Enron =
that the company might be guilty of "possible illegal acts" for withholding=
 financial information from auditors--an allegation Enron denied.=20
Andersen's destruction of records drew angry reactions from members of Cong=
ress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor.=20
Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) of the House Energy and Commerce Commi=
ttee called the loss "deeply troubling" and vowed to investigate.=20
"It should never have happened," Tauzin said. "Clearly this is a very serio=
us matter. Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be f=
ired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert our investigati=
on should be prosecuted."=20
"The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire tawdry aff=
air seems destined to grow," said Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, the top=
 Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "The seriousness of t=
his matter cries out for further investigation."=20
Stephen Cutler, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforc=
ement division, called the record destruction an "extremely serious matter"=
 but added that it "will not deter us from pursuit of our investigation and=
 will be included within the scope of our investigation."=20
The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting regulat=
ions to hide debt. In addition, Congress is looking into Andersen's interpr=
etation of accounting rules that allowed Enron to exclude losses at several=
 partnerships from its reporting. Enron and Andersen dispute who is to blam=
e for the faulty accounting.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million and disclos=
ed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Nov. 8, it announced =
it had overstated its earnings by $586 million during the last four years, =
sending the company's stock tumbling from more than $90 a share a year earl=
ier to less than a dollar. The meltdown cost more than 4,000 employees thei=
r jobs and destroyed the retirement savings of employees with company-spons=
ored savings plans.=20
Because, as the company said, the retirement plan was changing administrato=
rs, those employees were locked out of selling their shares at the time the=
 stock began its most precipitous descent. However, many executives managed=
 to sell their shares just before the stock's plunge.=20
The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec. 2.=20
At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called O'Neill a=
nd Evans separately, reporting "his concerns about whether or not Enron wou=
ld be able to meet its obligations."=20
O'Neill said in the two calls he received--on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, according=
 to an aide--Lay expressed concern about the implications for the capital m=
arkets and also that a possible downgrading of the company's credit rating =
might ruin a pending merger prospect.=20
Lay did not ask for anything specific, O'Neill said. "As secretary of the T=
reasury with responsibility for the U.S. capital markets, I get calls every=
 day from the big players in the world" warning about important financial e=
vents, he told CNN.=20
But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison with =
Long Term Capital Management, a large investment firm that was saved from c=
ollapse in 1998 by a federally orchestrated private bailout.=20
Lay "expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt, it would affect the c=
redit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management problems a few years=
 earlier affected the credit markets, that it would have ripple effects thr=
oughout the whole banking sector," she said.=20
Davis said O'Neill never discussed a bailout or any other kind of aid for E=
nron.=20
Evans said Lay was hoping for high-level "support."=20
Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush of the calls=
 and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday morning.=20
Fleischer said Evans and O'Neill handled the matter appropriately. Communic=
ation "is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was they received phone ca=
lls and took no action."=20
However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the calls show that the =
administration had advance word of Enron's collapse and did nothing to prot=
ect shareholders or employees.=20
Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric, "what people have b=
ecome so used to in Washington, which is a politically charged, politically=
 motivated effort to blame one party or to look only at one party." Enron, =
he said, has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to both parties.=20
Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his company's financial problems=
 and had not seen him since last spring, when they met at a Houston theater=
 where the president's mother was the sponsor of a book-reading fund-raiser=
 by celebrity authors.=20
Lay was a so-called pioneer in Bush's presidential campaign, which meant he=
 committed to raising at least $100,000.=20
Lay also personally contributed more than $275,000 to the Republican Nation=
al Committee during the 2000 election cycle, part of overall donations from=
 company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded $1.1 million. Enr=
on gave $100,000 to help pay for Bush's inauguration. In that cycle, Enron =
employees and directors gave $530,000 to the Democratic National Committee;=
 Lay made no personal contributions to the DNC.=20
In calling for an examination of the pension rules, Bush said he directed O=
'Neill, Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine "the effects of =
the current law on hard-working Americans and to come up with recommendatio=
ns of how to reform the system to make sure that people are not exposed to =
losing their life savings as the result of a bankruptcy, for example."=20
In addition, he said that O'Neill, along with the SEC, the Federal Reserve =
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study corporate disclosu=
re rules and regulations in light of the Enron bankruptcy.=20
"There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure that the =
American stockholder, or any stockholder, is protected," Bush said.=20
Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's larg=
est energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled 1 in 4 wholesale deal=
s for electricity, gas and other energy products.=20
The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence the way C=
alifornia structured its energy markets and how the state steered through i=
ts electricity crisis. It became a target of attacks from politicians, regu=
lators and consumer activists for its aggressive business tactics.=20

WORK FOR CONGRESS ISSUES DEMAND ATTENTION ON SEVERAL FRONTS

REGION
A-14
(Copyright 2002)=20

Congress is scheduled to return to its duties in Washington on Jan. 24 afte=
r a month off. Its agenda is filling up rapidly with urgent business.=20
The first item on the agenda is to complete work on an economic stimulus pa=
ckage, dropped because of a stalemate before Christmas. National economic i=
ndicators are sufficiently mixed as to suggest that such a bill would still=
 serve a useful purpose, even though it should have been passed before Cong=
ress adjourned for the holidays for more timely impact. Unemployment contin=
ues to rise, by another 0.2 percent in December to 5.8 percent, the highest=
 it has been since 1995.
Hearings are being scheduled for next month to look into the failure of the=
 U.S. intelligence community regarding Sept. 11. Its budgets amount to $30 =
billion annually. Yet it failed to detect the scheming that terrorists were=
 carrying out under America's nose for probably a year before the attacks.=
=20
A third useful piece of business that needs to be addressed urgently -- giv=
en that 2002 is a congressional election year -- is campaign finance reform=
, currently stuck in the House. Republican and Democratic Congressional Cam=
paign committees have both reported fund- raising in eight figures already =
for the 2002 campaign.=20
Continued foot-dragging, for example, on the Shays-Meehan bill banning soft=
 money leads past more elegant arguments to only one conclusion -- that our=
 representatives like to have access to as much unlimited "soft" money as p=
ossible to use in persuading the voters to re-elect them. Failure to pass c=
ampaign finance reform legislation is, in fact, a very good reason not to r=
e-elect them.=20
The Post-Gazette also welcomes congressional plans to conduct hearings to s=
hed light on the collapse of Enron, America's seventh- largest company befo=
re its fall. Matters that need to be made clear include Enron's corporate a=
nd individual executives' campaign contributions -- an accounting of how mu=
ch, to whose campaign and the timing of various gifts and whether they corr=
elated to the progressive collapse of the company.=20
In advance, there seems nothing wrong in Enron executives making recommenda=
tions to Bush administration energy policy-makers. It would be normal to co=
nsult a company of that size in such a market. The problem would be if thos=
e recommendations were accepted and thus contributed to what turned out to =
be Enron's deception of stockholders and the market.=20
The special task force that the Justice Department is putting together will=
 look closely into that and other important subjects. It will investigate w=
hether Enron's top executives engaged in criminal activity by selling off $=
1 billion of their Enron stock held in 401(k) retirement plans in advance o=
f the declaration of bankruptcy - - while forbidding lower-level employees =
to sell theirs. Congressional examination of these issues can suggest wheth=

Companies: U.S. Task Force Will Pursue Enron Investigation --- Criminal Pro=
be to Target Possible Accounting Fraud
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter

The U.S. Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a c=
riminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected t=
o center on possible accounting fraud.=20
The investigation will be run by the department's criminal division coordin=
ating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and els=
ewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation i=
n early December.
Enron, the U.S.'s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed fo=
r bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its in=
vestors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with priv=
ate partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its ma=
rket value plunge recently to about $540 million (606 million euros) from m=
ore than $77 billion last year.=20
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating E=
nron since October, and the Justice Department could both file cases allegi=
ng violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally mi=
sled investors about its financial condition. Several congressional committ=
ees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enron's collapse.=20
Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the=
 Justice Department. "It has been the posture of the company to fully coope=
rate with government investigations," said Robert Bennett, an attorney with=
 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. "At th=
e end of day, I'm pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that=
 many of the things said and written (about Enron) aren't true."=20
Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a U.S. =
bankruptcy-court judge to temporarily block Enron's intended sale of its en=
ergy-trading business, until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entir=
e company.=20
The court approved an auction process on Dec. 19 that was to have resulted =
in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as Friday.=20
Bidders for pieces of Enron's energy-trading business, which still has a st=
aff of about 1,000 people, include Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, peopl=
e familiar with the matter have said.=20
But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely=
. The list includes institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE =
Capital Corp. as well as power-trading rivals such as Mirant Corp., El Paso=
 Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc., a unit of Utilicorp United Inc.=20
Aquila said it doesn't oppose the sale, per se, but wants guarantees that E=
nron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has b=
een made about how it will be split among creditors.=20
Mirant in its pleadings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern Dis=
trict of New York, said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked "sig=
nificant material information that is essential . . . to make an informed d=
ecision regarding the wisdom of the transaction."=20
The materials lack a minimum bid, which "begs the question," Mirant said, "=
as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether th=
e debtors are preparing to sell at any price." Challengers also questioned =
who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale.=20
Enron's energy-marketing unit, which includes its once-mighty EnronOnline I=
nternet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products until recently an=
d generated roughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. =
It also was responsible for the bulk of Enron's 2001 revenue of $101 billio=
n.

Companies: White House Confirms Contact With Enron Chief --- Fleischer Says=
 Lay Rebuffed; Auditor Destroyed Documents
Dow Jones Newswires

WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has confirmed that Kenneth L. Lay, ch=
airman and chief executive of Enron Corp., contacted two top officials last=
 autumn and warned that the Houston energy trader was headed toward bankrup=
tcy, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.=20
He noted the government rebuffed Mr. Lay's appeal for help with Enron's fin=
ancial situation. Mr. Fleischer previously told reporters Wednesday he wasn=
't aware of anyone in the White House who discussed Enron's finances.
Separately, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP said in a statement Thursday =
that individuals at the firm "disposed of a significant but undetermined am=
ount" of documents relating to its work for Enron. The documents, which inc=
lude e-mail correspondence, had been sought by federal law-enforcement offi=
cials.=20
Arthur Andersen said it has notified the Justice Department, which has laun=
ched a criminal investigation into Enron, as well as the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission. Enron was one of Andersen's largest clients, generating $=
25 million (28.1 million euros) a year in audit fees and $27 million of fee=
s for consulting.=20
Arthur Andersen has asked former Sen. John Danforth to conduct "an immediat=
e and comprehensive review" of the company's policies on document handling =
and recommend improvements.=20
The company said the destruction of the Enron documents occurred "in recent=
 months" by individual employees involved in auditing Enron.=20
Michael Donovan, a Philadelphia attorney whose firm has filed a class-actio=
n lawsuit against Arthur Andersen on behalf of Enron shareholders, said doc=
ument destruction by an audit firm is shocking.=20
"Auditors save everything," including all work papers for audit clients, he=
 added.=20
Meanwhile, Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff, David Ayr=
es, recused themselves from the Justice Department's investigation of Enron=
, citing "the totality of the circumstances of the relationship between Enr=
on and the Attorney General."=20
The department's statement Thursday didn't elaborate further, but the Cente=
r for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign-finance filings, sa=
id Enron and Mr. Lay made more than $50,000 in campaign contributions towar=
d Mr. Ashcroft's bid for re-election to the Senate in 2000.=20
Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson will oversee the investigation in Mr=
. Ashcroft's absence, the Justice Department said.=20
Mr. Ashcroft's recusal is another indication of the company's ties with the=
 Bush administration. Enron also contributed to President Bush's election c=
ampaign, and the White House has acknowledged that Vice President Richard C=
heney or his aides met six times with Enron representatives on energy issue=
s last year, with the final meeting held six days before the company's fina=
ncial condition was revealed.=20
Earlier Thursday, President Bush said he wants to see a thorough investigat=
ion into the sudden collapse of Enron, and has ordered a review of the U.S.=
 laws governing pensions. The president's comments came during a hastily ar=
ranged event in the Oval Office as the political heat mounted over Enron's =
collapse.=20
Mr. Fleischer said: "What was told to me this morning was [Treasury] Secret=
ary Paul O'Neill said that he had been contacted by Mr. Lay in the fall of =
last year, and Mr. Lay brought to the secretary's attention his concerns ab=
out whether or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations. And he expr=
essed his concern about the experience that Long-Term Capital Management we=
nt through when the hedge-fund firm went bankrupt.

Enron affair explodes around White House

FINAL

(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)=20

THE ENRON affair exploded around the Bush presidency last night, as his adm=
inistration's top legal officer was forced to remove himself from the newly=
 launched criminal investigation and the accounting firm that audited the f=
ailed energy giant's books admitted it had destroyed thousands of documents=
 relating to the case.=20
Yesterday, the White House shifted into full scandal defence mode. Mr Bush =
intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering the Treasury=
 Department to review federal pension regulations. He also denied he had ev=
er discussed the company's difficulties with Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman =
and a long-time friend and benefactor of the President.

THE LAUNCH of a Justice Department criminal investigation into Enron, the e=
nergy conglomerate, has turned the biggest financial collapse in US history=
 into a major, and probably long-lasting, embarrassment to President George=
 Bush and his administration.=20
Yesterday, with the White House visibly shifting into defensive scandal mod=
e, Mr Bush intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering t=
he Treasury Department to review federal pension regulations.
An especially shocking aspect of the Enron debacle has been the way in whic=
h senior executives were able to cash up to $1bn (pounds 700m) of Enron sto=
ck and stock options in the 18 months before the company began to unravel l=
ast autumn - while many employees, obliged to hold stock in pensions scheme=
s, in some cases saw these schemes virtually wiped out.=20
Already civil suits have been filed against 29 Enron directors and senior e=
xecutives, charging that they sold shares while knowing the company was in =
dire trouble. The main focus of the government probe, however, will be the =
collapse itself - whether Enron committed criminal offences in concealing d=
ebt and misstating its financial position.=20
It was disclosure of unreported debts shielded by secret partnerships run b=
y senior Enron executives, and its October admission that it had overstated=
 its profits by $586m in the previous four years that created the crisis of=
 investor confidence that drove Enron into bankruptcy at the start of Decem=
ber.=20
In the process, what was once the seventh-largest US corporation saw its sh=
ares plunge from $85 to under $1 apiece, wiping out the value of many of it=
s employees' retirement funds. The Justice Department investigation, bringi=
ng together the work of federal prosecutors in California, New York and Enr=
on's home base of Houston, will examine whether Enron in the last few years=
 was no more than a giant fraud.=20
In the short term, the investigation could take some of the sting out of th=
e Congressional hearings due to start next month into the collapse. Schedul=
ed witnesses, including Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and other senior exec=
utives, are likely to be the object of the federal investigation, so, under=
 threat of criminal indictment, they may be able to say little to interroga=
tors on Capitol Hill.=20
Even so, the once-close relationship between Mr Lay and the President will =
be subjected to ever-fiercer scrutiny. Questioned by reporters at a White H=
ouse ceremony yesterday, Mr Bush denied he had ever discussed Enron's finan=
ces with Mr Lay, and said had not seen him since last May, at a charity eve=
nt in Texas organised by his mother.=20
Mr Bush said he had "great concern" for the people who had entrusted their =
money to Enron, and then "for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regu=
lation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy." But he tried to distance him=
self from the fellow Texan he used to call "Kenny Boy," saying it was his p=
redecessor, not he, who had appointed Mr Lay to the Texas Governor's Busine=
ss Council.=20
But the real target for Democrats will be major political donations Enron m=
ade to Texas Republicans. Mr Lay and his company also gave more than $100,0=
00 to Mr Bush's election campaign.=20
It has emerged that shortly before the collapse last autumn, Mr Lay spoke b=
y phone with the Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, and Paul O'Neill, the Treas=
ury Secretary, to warn them of Enron's problems.

THE AMERICAS - Lifetime's savings lost in a corporate scandal.

Few have been hit harder by Enron's bankruptcy than Tom Padgett.=20
The 59-year-old, who was only six months away from retiring, saw his assets=
 fall from $615,000 to $11,000.
He was a victim of Enron's questionable accounting to hide debts. The energ=
y trading company, a favourite of investors and analysts, filed for the lar=
gest corporate bankruptcy in US history in December.=20
Thornton House, 51, and his wife, Barbara House, 54, had $430,000 in retire=
ment savings tied up in Enron. Mr House worked for the company for 20 years=
 until 1993. Ms House left in 1991 after 13 years with the company.=20
"Both of us lost a chunk," Mr House said. "We believed in the company. We b=
elieved in Ken Lay (Enron's chairman and chief executive). We were all dupe=
d by them.=20
"I may have to go back to look for work. Now there are 4,000 former Enron e=
mployees looking for these jobs."=20
The problems centred on Enron's 401(k) employee retirement programme. 401(k=
) accounts are employee-directed investment accounts that companies help fu=
nd and administer.=20
Enron's programme, worth about $2.1bn a year ago, was 60 per cent invested =
in the company's own stock, and employees were prevented from selling even =
as shares plummeted.=20
President George W. Bush has now promised that in the investigation he orde=
red yesterday the Treasury Department will "come up with recommendations on=
 how...to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life saving=
s".=20
In an effort to prevent another scandal of this magnitude, a working group =
on financial markets, which includes members of the Securities and Exchange=
=20
Commission, Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures =
Trading Commission, will review disclosure rules to make sure the American =
stockholder is protected.=20
All this comes too late for Enron's employees. Robin Harrison, counsel in t=
he 401(k) plan participants class action lawsuit, said: "The people who wor=
ked for the company the longest are the people the most hurt. They have the=
 least amount of time to recoup their lost savings."=20
However, pension fund reform could be the silver lining to the company's co=
llapse. In particular, industry experts hope that the Bush administration a=
nd Congressional investigations will change the law that exempts company sh=
ares from the diversification rules applied to all other retirement account=
 holdings.=20
"They can look all they want at making more disclosure to employees, or exh=
orting them to diversify, but the bottom line is the way the law is structu=
red, it encourages companies to load people up on company stock," said Eli =
Gottesdiener, one of the attorneys representing Enron's 401(k) participants=
.=20
"People will not police themselves because they want to show loyalty by loa=
ding up on company stock. It's another disaster waiting to happen and it ne=
eds to be stopped. There is only one way to do it."=20
Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine have already introduced l=
egislation that would cap the amount of company stock in pension funds at 2=
0 per cent.=20
Another important reform would be to prevent companies from setting restric=
tions on when and how much company stock employees can sell from their reti=
rement plans, said David Certner, director of federal affairs at AARP, the =
non-partisan retirees lobbying group. In Enron's case, employees could not =
sell until they were 50.=20
"Everything Enron put in had to go into company stock," Mr Padgett said. "T=
he lesson is, 'Don't trust your company'."=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS
A Familiar Capital Script
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/11/2002
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The rapidly exploding Enron inquiry presents element=
s reminiscent of earlier Washington scandals, including carefully phrased d=
enials and accusations of easy access. And in a matter of hours today, it s=
ent the White House into a full-scale effort to contain the potential damag=
e to President Bush at a time when he wants to focus on the war on terroris=
m and the flagging economy.=20
The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from=
 a torrent of bad news about the fall of Enron, the Houston energy conglome=
rate.
Although no one has suggested that Mr. Bush has done anything wrong, the co=
nnections between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close. The com=
pany's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, has been a close friend of Mr. Bush for ma=
ny years, and Mr. Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more mone=
y to Mr. Bush over his political career than anyone else, an amount exceedi=
ng $550,000. Mr. Lay contributed an additional $100,000 for the Bush inaugu=
ral committee.=20
Those connections were made vividly clear today when the White House disclo=
sed that Mr. Lay discussed his company's precarious financial condition las=
t fall with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and sought assistance from M=
r. Bush's best friend and presidential campaign chairman, Commerce Secretar=
y Donald L. Evans.=20
Throughout the day, White House officials denied that Mr. Bush had been awa=
re of the company's troublesome finances or had ever been asked to come to =
its rescue.=20
But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were already beginning to ask of the preside=
nt, ''What did he know and when did he know it?'' And questions were being =
raised about whether a criminal inquiry into Enron's collapse should be led=
 by a special counsel rather than by the Justice Department, because Attorn=
ey General John Ashcroft received $57,499 in campaign contributions from En=
ron and Mr. Lay, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
Mr. Ashcroft, as well as his chief of staff, recused themselves from the cr=
iminal investigation, which will try to determine whether the company or it=
s executives committed fraud before it went bankrupt. But critics still que=
stioned whether the Justice Department, which includes many other political=
 appointees, could independently investigate the company.=20
Just as Enron's collapse was stunning because it occurred so quickly and so=
 completely, the latest disclosures have reawakened Washington's scandal ma=
chinery, which had been practically dormant since Sept. 11. The capital may=
 once again face months, if not years, of yet another investigation of the =
White House featuring the volatile mix of money, influence, access and poli=
tics.=20
Elements of a classic political scandal are here: A Texas corporation, led =
by Mr. Bush's most generous campaign contributor, files the largest bankrup=
tcy petition in American history. A handful of executives are able to sell =
$1 billion worth of the company's stock before its collapse, but thousands =
of employees are barred from selling, losing their life's savings and retir=
ement accounts.=20
And just this week, the White House disclosed that Enron executives, and th=
e company chairman, had meetings and discussions with cabinet members, Whit=
e House officials and Vice President Dick Cheney before and during the corp=
oration's implosion.=20
On top of everything else, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, =
Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed today that a ''significant but undetermined'=
' number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.=20
''This is the perfect storm,'' said Philip M. Schiliro, the chief of staff =
for Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. ''It's the bigg=
est bankruptcy in American corporate history, a bankruptcy where a small nu=
mber of executives enriched themselves to the tune of hundreds of millions =
of dollars while thousands of employees were left with worthless stock. And=
 in 2001, Enron is the most influential company in Washington. When you pie=
ce it all together, there are many questions that need to be answered.''=20
President Bush said today that he had never discussed Enron's financial woe=
s with Mr. Lay, who has supported Mr. Bush politically since his unsuccessf=
ul campaign for Congress in 1978. Mr. Bush said he last saw Mr. Lay in Texa=
s at an April 30 fund-raiser for the literacy foundation of the former firs=
t lady Barbara Bush. At the time, Enron's price per share was nearly $60; i=
ts closing price today was 67 cents.=20
On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats alike have pledged to work toget=
her to get to the bottom of the matter. Some Democratic officials also expr=
essed glee that questions about White House influence peddling seemed to be=
 emerging as a major political story of 2002.=20
''If their goal was to give this story a head of steam, they have succeeded=
,'' Jennifer Palmieri, the press secretary of the Democratic National Commi=
ttee, said of the White House's handling of the Enron matter. ''I think the=
y are very spooked by this.''=20
Five Congressional committees have sent out subpoenas on the matter. The fi=
rst of many hearings expected this year is set for Jan. 24 by the Senate Go=
vernmental Affairs Committee, which is headed by Senator Joseph I. Lieberma=
n, Democrat of Connecticut, who may be thinking of running for president in=
 2004.=20
Several congressmen demanded again today that the White House release recor=
ds of all its contacts with Enron executives, including telephone and e-mai=
l messages.=20
''In contrast to the six contacts the White House disclosed,'' Mr. Waxman s=
aid, ''I suspect there were dozens of conversations between administration =
officials and Enron representatives during the past year. The public and Co=
ngress should have this information, especially since it is now clear the W=
hite House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing =
to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost t=
heir life savings.''=20
Political operatives and advocates of campaign finance reform said the Enro=
n matter's staying power would depend in large measure on how the administr=
ation handled it in the coming days and weeks.=20
''The Enron scandal clearly moved to a new stage today,'' said Fred Werthei=
mer, president of Democracy 21, a public policy group, ''and it has reached=
 a point where it will now demand serious national attention.''=20
Just as the Congressional committees and the news media are gearing up for =
what promises to be an inquiry that could last months, if not years, the pr=
incipals have hired lawyers with golden tongues and lengthy experience in d=
ealing with scandals.=20
David Boies, a leading trial lawyer, represents Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's f=
ormer chief financial officer. W. Neil Eggleston, a prominent Washington la=
wyer, represents Enron's outside directors.=20
And Robert S. Bennett, the Washington lawyer who represented President Bill=
 Clinton in the Paula Jones matter, is now Enron's lead Washington lawyer.=
=20
Mr. Bennett said today that he welcomed the criminal inquiry because it wou=
ld ''bring light to the facts.'' But he also warned that the Congressional =
inquiries could easily degenerate into a ''circus atmosphere.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON CONTACTED 2 CABINET OFFICERS BEFORE COLLAPSING
By ELISABETH BUMILLER

01/11/2002
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The White House disclosed today that Kenneth L. Lay,=
 the chairman of the Enron Corporation and one of President Bush's biggest =
political contributors, telephoned two cabinet officers last fall, and one =
of them said Mr. Lay had sought government help with its dire financial con=
dition.=20
Both said they declined to offer government aid.
In a day of rapid-fire developments, Attorney General John Ashcroft excused=
 himself from all matters involving Enron because of campaign contributions=
 he received from it.=20
In addition, Enron's auditors said they had destroyed numerous company docu=
ments and electronic communications. [Page C1.]=20
The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had created a nationwide t=
ask force to conduct a criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron, a=
n energy trading company with close ties to Mr. Bush and many top administr=
ation officials.=20
Today, the entire United States Attorney's office in Houston recused itself=
 from the investigation, saying many of its approximately 100 lawyers, incl=
uding the chief prosecutor, Michael T. Shelby, had family or other relation=
ships with people affected by Enron's filing on Dec. 2 for reorganization u=
nder Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law.=20
The White House moved quickly to contain the damage. The White House spokes=
man said Mr. Bush was made aware of the phone calls to the cabinet members =
only this morning during an Oval Office meeting.=20
''What you have here is a case where a contributor called up and asked for =
something but did not get it,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House press s=
ecretary.=20
Yet the two cabinet secretaries who received calls from Mr. Lay described s=
omewhat different conversations. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said th=
at Mr. Lay had indicated he would welcome any government help with its bond=
 ratings, while Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the Enron chairman =
requested no assistance at all.=20
Enron officials disputed the White House version of events this evening and=
 said Mr. Lay was not asking for assistance from the Bush administration in=
 calling Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, Mr. Bush's presidential campaign chairm=
an and chief fund-raiser. Enron officials also said Mr. Lay had called Alan=
 Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to alert him to the compan=
y's problems.=20
Mr. Lay was simply informing the government about the possible bankruptcy f=
iling of the nation's seventh largest company, Enron officials said, as has=
 been the practice of executives of other large companies whose collapse co=
uld affect worldwide financial markets.=20
''He did not ask for anything,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman.=20
Enron's troubles and its numerous links to the Bush administration threaten=
ed to consume the president's time and attention even as he enjoys high app=
roval ratings for his conduct of the war on terrorism.=20
As morning newspapers announced the expanding Justice Department investigat=
ion today, Mr. Bush summoned reporters to the Oval Office to declare that h=
e had instructed his economic advisers to develop a plan to protect workers=
' pensions from similar corporate failures. Thousands of Enron employees lo=
st their life savings and much of their retirement accounts when the compan=
y's stock became virtually worthless last November.=20
Enron's auditor, the giant accounting firm Arthur Andersen, then said that =
it had destroyed a ''significant'' volume of documents related to Enron. Th=
e firm said it was still gathering information about the episode before dec=
iding if it would discipline the employees involved.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating both Enron's=
 collapse and Andersen's conduct, said its inquiry would be expanded to inc=
lude the destruction of documents, in addition to looking into whether it h=
ad created off-the-books private partnerships that disguised the true finan=
cial condition of the company.=20
Almost simultaneously, Attorney General Ashcroft said he was recusing himse=
lf from oversight of the criminal investigation of the company's collapse b=
ecause of his relationship with Enron. Common Cause reported today that a c=
anvass of federal election records showed that Mr. Ashcroft had received a =
total of $54,499 from the company and Mr. Lay for his 2000 Senate campaign.=
=20
Enron, which pioneered deregulation of the nation's power business and grew=
 to be one of the world's largest energy companies before its sudden fall, =
has long nurtured close ties to Mr. Bush. But in the Oval Office today, the=
 president went to some length to distance himself from Mr. Lay, who he sai=
d had been a supporter of Governor Ann Richards of Texas when Mr. Bush defe=
ated her in 1994.=20
''And she named him the head of the Governor's Business Council,'' Mr. Bush=
 said. ''And I decided to leave him in place, just for the sake of continui=
ty. And that's when I first got to know Ken and worked with Ken.''=20
Mr. Bush said that he had never discussed the financial problems of Enron w=
ith Mr. Lay and that he had last seen him in the spring, at a fund-raising =
event in Houston. Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush had not talked to Mr. Lay sin=
ce the spring.=20
It was Mr. Fleischer who first told reporters this morning, almost as an af=
terthought at a sparsely attended early news briefing, that Mr. Lay had cal=
led both Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans last fall to alert them about the compan=
y's financial straits.=20
Officials at the Treasury and Commerce Departments said Mr. Lay had spoken =
to Mr. O'Neill about Enron's condition on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 and had spoken=
 to Mr. Evans on Oct. 29. Although Mr. Lay had maintained until late Octobe=
r an optimistic public face about Enron's future, on Oct. 16 the company re=
ported a third-quarter net loss of $618 million. On the same day, Moody's I=
nvestors Service announced that Enron's long-term debt obligations were on =
review.=20
The dates of the calls and the announcements of the bad financial news abou=
t the company are significant. If Mr. Lay had made the calls earlier in Oct=
ober, before the state of the company was widely known, the Bush administra=
tion would have been aware of the true condition of Enron while Mr. Lay was=
 promoting a different story on Wall Street.=20
In an interview on CNBC tonight, Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Lay had not asked for=
 a government bailout or other intervention to save the company.=20
''He called me to advise me that Enron's problems were mounting and to offe=
r access for our technical people to talk with his technical people about t=
he contracts that they had that were causing them problems,'' Mr. O'Neill s=
aid. ''I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak wit=
h the Enron people, which he did, so that we could satisfy ourselves that t=
he Enron affairs were not going to have a negative impact on U.S. capital m=
arkets.''=20
Asked whether Mr. Lay asked for government assistance, Mr. O'Neill said ''A=
bsolutely not.''=20
On the same CNBC program, Mr. Evans said Mr. Lay had told him that Moody's =
Investors Service was likely downgrade its rating of the company's debt.=20
Mr. Lay then said that if there was anything Mr. Evans could do to help the=
 company deal with Moody's ''we would welcome that.'' But, Mr. Evans added,=
 Mr. Lay did not ask him specifically to intervene with Moody's.=20
''I listened to him and listened to their condition and listened to the iss=
ues he wanted to raise,'' Mr. Evans said. ''Subsequent to that I talked to =
Secretary O'Neill and told him I had the call. It was a pretty easy decisio=
n to make. I don't think there was anything for us to do. Secretary O'Neill=
 agreed with me there was not so we didn't do anything.''=20
A Commerce Department official said today that in Mr. Lay's call with Mr. E=
vans, ''there was no information discussed that wasn't already in the publi=
c domain.''=20
Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Bush was first told this morning in the Oval Of=
fice by Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans that Mr. Lay had made the calls to them a=
nd that they had not been willing to intervene to help. The president then =
told Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, according to Mr. Fleischer's account, ''You=
 did the right thing.''=20
Mr. Fleischer said the president expressed no surprise, regret or annoyance=
 that he had not been informed of the calls from Mr. Lay until more than tw=
o months after they occurred.=20
''Bankruptcies happen in our economy,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''And it's not =
uncommon for people who are in the community, business community or in the =
labor community, to talk to a cabinet secretary to tell them about the fina=
ncial status of their business and it ends there.''=20
Democrats on Capitol Hill moved immediately to question the White House sta=
tements. ''It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was lik=
ely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and sh=
areholders who ultimately lost their life savings,'' said Representative He=
nry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is his party's senior member on =
the House Government Reform Committee.=20
Mr. Fleischer said that he hoped that any Congressional inquiry would be ev=
en-handed and that if it became ''a one-party witch hunt, I think the Congr=
ess is going again to remind the country on why people soured and tired of =
those types of partisan investigations.''=20
Mr. Lay and Enron executives have given more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush's va=
rious campaigns, and Mr. Lay also gave $100,000 to Mr. Bush's inaugural com=
mittee.=20
But Mr. Lay does not appear to have been a frequent recent visitor to the W=
hite House, based on publicly available records. He visited the White House=
 only twice during the first five months of Mr. Bush's presidency, accordin=
g to Secret Service access control records obtained by The New York Times u=
nder the Freedom of Information Act. The first visit occurred on Feb. 22, 2=
001, the day Enron officials met with the staff of Vice President Dick Chen=
ey's energy task force.=20
The second visit, the records show, was on April 17, the day Mr. Lay and ot=
her Enron officials met with Mr. Cheney for about a half-hour. Enron offici=
als freely discussed the meeting last year with reporters, providing a copy=
 of the memorandum on electricity issues the company presented to Mr. Chene=
y.=20
One month later, Mr. Cheney's energy policy task force issued its final rep=
ort. In the section on deregulation of the electricity markets, the report'=
s recommendations resembled much of what Enron had advocated. They also tra=
cked with policies advocated by Mr. Bush during the 2000 presidential campa=
ign.=20
Mr. Cheney, in an interview last year, denied that Enron had improperly inf=
luenced the task force's deliberations, saying the task force would ''make =
decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy,'' not what ''En=
ron thinks.''

Audit Nightmare: Arthur Andersen Says It Disposed of Documents That Related=
 to Enron --- `When' Is a Key Question For Accountants in Wake Of the Clien=
t's Collapse --- Ex-Senator Hired for Review

The storm cloud hanging over Enron Corp. and its longtime outside auditor, =
Arthur Andersen LLP, just got darker.=20
In the latest revelation in the collapse of Enron, Arthur Andersen disclose=
d to federal agencies investigating the energy trading firm that individual=
s at the accounting firm in recent months disposed of "a significant but un=
determined number" of documents related to its work for Enron.
The terse announcement left many questions unanswered. Who disposed of the =
documents and how? Why? Did it happen after investigations began?=20
In any event, the disclosure appeared likely to further damage the already-=
tarnished reputation of the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm. The Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating Enron, said destruc=
tion of documents is "an extremely serious matter."=20
Andersen officials were called late last year to testify to a congressional=
 committee about why the firm failed to detect the financial woes that cont=
ributed to Enron's downfall. The Justice Department said this week that it =
had formed a task force to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron. A depa=
rtment spokesman wouldn't say whether the agency knew of document destructi=
on or whether Andersen was a target of criminal investigation.=20
Andersen's disclosure will increase pressure on the firm to fully disclose =
its handling of the Enron account. Dec. 12 congressional testimony by Josep=
h F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive officer, ma=
y have mischaracterized part of one Enron deal and understated Andersen's k=
nowledge about it, people familiar with the matter say. Andersen says the t=
estimony was truthful but based on incomplete information.=20
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday he had no knowledge that=
 the Bush administration got advance word from Andersen of the document des=
truction. But President Bush called for a government review of the Enron ca=
se, amid disclosure that Enron chief Kenneth Lay lobbied two cabinet secret=
aries for help as the company was nearing bankruptcy court. Mr. Lay also co=
ntacted Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan around the same time, a Fed=
 spokesman confirmed.=20
Yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he had recused himself from =
the Justice Department's investigation of Enron, citing a conflict of inter=
est. In addition, the Justice Department said much of the U.S. attorney's o=
ffice in Houston would be recused because of family ties.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on Andersen's document=
 disposal, other than to say that the accounting firm's announcement was th=
e first Enron had heard about it. The spokeswoman added, "We are not aware =
of the shredding of any documents that are part of any inquiry, investigati=
on or litigation matter."=20
For Andersen, the Enron mess could hardly come at a worse time. In recent y=
ears, the firm has approved the financial statements of a series of its hig=
h-profile corporate clients, including Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management I=
nc., that later proved to be false. Andersen paid tens of millions of dolla=
rs in damages to each company's shareholders, without admitting wrongdoing =
in either case. The deepening investigation into Enron could make it harder=
 for Andersen to attract new clients and seems sure to distract top executi=
ves for a time.=20
Andersen said it asked former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, "t=
o conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records manag=
ement policy" and to "advise the firm to ensure that all appropriate remedi=
al and disciplinary actions have been taken."=20
While Andersen has defended its audits of Enron, critics say the firm faile=
d to identify a number of questionable accounting practices by Enron that c=
ontributed to its abrupt downfall. Once the dominant player in energy tradi=
ng, the Houston company had to file for bankruptcy-court protection after a=
 series of disclosures.=20
Enron had transactions with certain partnerships that were run by its own o=
fficers -- including its chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow=
 -- but that were treated by Enron as separate. It offered only murky and f=
ragmented information about the partnerships. One of them, whose existence =
Enron didn't disclose for four years, was part of an arrangement that infla=
ted earnings by several hundred million dollars.=20
And Enron's debt level was much higher than it revealed, thanks to the part=
nerships, which allowed Enron to keep some debt off its books. In November,=
 a restatement by Enron of its financial results -- which Andersen had appr=
oved as accurate -- resulted in lowering Enron's reported earnings for the =
prior four years by $586 million, or 20%. Enron said its previous financial=
 statements for those years could no longer be relied upon.=20
Among issues investigators now will doubtless probe is how many and which E=
nron-related documents were destroyed, and who destroyed them. Andersen sai=
d "individuals" had disposed of "a significant but undetermined number of e=
lectronic and paper documents and correspondence." It added, "Millions of d=
ocuments related to Enron still exist, and the firm has successfully retrie=
ved some of the deleted electronic files. The firm is continuing retrieval =
efforts through electronic backup files, and is continuing in its efforts t=
o fully learn and understand all the facts related to this issue."=20
Another issue will be when the documents were destroyed. The firm said it h=
ad a policy -- now suspended -- that "required in certain circumstances the=
 destruction of certain types of documents." Many big corporations have sim=
ilar policies specifying how long employees must retain certain categories =
of records.=20
Under prevailing regulations, auditors are required to "adopt reasonable pr=
ocedures for safe custody" of their working papers and should keep them for=
 long enough "to satisfy any pertinent legal requirements of records retent=
ion." People with knowledge of the Justice Department's Enron probe said An=
dersen didn't destroy any audit working papers.=20
The destruction of documents would be especially troubling to investigators=
 and regulators if some of it occurred after they had begun their inquiries=
 into Enron's downfall. That would raise the question of whether the action=
 was designed to thwart investigators. Andersen said it had confirmed that =
certain Enron-related documents were destroyed "during the months before" t=
he SEC issued a subpoena to Andersen. It said it hadn't determined whether =
any were destroyed after the subpoena, but said it had told personnel after=
 the subpoena arrived to preserve Enron-related documents.=20
Andersen's revelation about document disposal could raise embarrassing ques=
tions for Deloitte & Touche LLP, which this month released results of a "pe=
er review" of Andersen's system of accounting and auditing quality. The rev=
iew -- which focused on the firm's practices generally and not on its handl=
ing of Enron -- concluded that Andersen's system of accounting and auditing=
 quality provided "reasonable assurance of compliance with professional sta=
ndards."=20
A Deloitte official said that the firm's peer review of Andersen included a=
n evaluation of the firm's Houston office, which handled Enron's audits, bu=
t that Deloitte wasn't permitted to include Andersen's audit work for Enron=
 because of pending litigation. Neither Deloitte nor Andersen would comment=
 on whether the review would be reopened.=20
The unfolding Enron saga could have a detrimental effect overall on Anderse=
n, which employs 85,000 people in 84 countries and last year had U.S. reven=
ue of $9.3 billion. As with all accounting firms, Andersen's ability to att=
ract and retain audit clients depends on having a sterling reputation. The =
more its reputation comes into question, the more likely it becomes that in=
vestors will view an audit opinion by Andersen with skepticism, prompting s=
ome clients to switch to other auditors.=20
There is no evidence that has happened so far. Asked whether Andersen has b=
een told by any clients that they are switching to other auditors, spokesma=
n David Tabolt said, "Some have been concerned. Some have been supportive. =
I just don't think that we know yet how people are going to react, but we c=
ertainly hope that people will be understanding." More than a dozen compani=
es that use Andersen as their auditor declined to comment on whether they m=
ight review their relationship.=20
Andersen also has taken heat over its audit of the Baptist Foundation of Ar=
izona. Arizona state authorities are seeking as much as $600 million in res=
titution from the firm. They are also seeking to place Andersen on probatio=
n in the state, which could include restrictions and heightened monitoring.=
=20
Two of the Andersen auditors involved have invoked their Fifth Amendment pr=
otections against self-incrimination in civil suits brought in that case. T=
hey include one who also was Andersen's lead engagement partner for Lincoln=
 Savings & Loan, the failed thrift once headed by Charles Keating.=20
Andersen has said it is cooperating with Arizona officials investigating it=
s audits for the foundation, which filed for bankruptcy protection two year=
s ago, shortly after Andersen left the account in mid-1999.=20

White House Reveals Enron Contacts
By RON FOURNIER
AP White House Correspondent

Copyright 2002 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House revealed on Thursday that Enron Corp., an=
 energy firm closely tied to President Bush, sought the administration's he=
lp shortly before collapsing with the life savings of many workers. In a se=
parate disclosure, the company's auditors said they had destroyed many Enro=
n documents.=20
In the rapid swirl of events, each one raising questions about potential co=
nflicts of interest, Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself fr=
om the criminal inquiry into Enron's conduct. The company donated thousands=
 of dollars to Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000.
Bush, whose own political career has benefited from Enron contributions, pl=
edged to aggressively pursue the investigation into whether the Texas-based=
 firm defrauded investors, including 401(k) plan investors, by concealing v=
ital information about its finances.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of Enron chairman Kenneth L. L=
ay. "But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will full=
y investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can lea=
rn from the past and make sure that workers are protected."=20
Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressiona=
l investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmi=
re even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the =
war against terrorism.=20
"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col=
lapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders=
 who ultimately lost their life savings," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.=
=20
Firing back, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid "partisa=
n witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions." Democrats ho=
pe to make a political issue out of the administration's many ties to Enron=
.=20
The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once pose=
d to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.=20
Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer sa=
id no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired law=
yers.=20
And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater: missing do=
cuments.=20
The firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, notified investig=
ators that it had destroyed a "significant but undetermined" number of docu=
ments related to the company.=20
As for the company's contacts last fall, administration officials said Comm=
erce Secretary Donald Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill received ca=
lls from Lay seeking help for his company. Lay told Evans he would welcome =
any support in helping the company deal with a bond-rating firm that was co=
nsidering downgrading Enron, administration officials said.=20
In the conversation with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in which the=
 Federal Reserve pressured several large financial institutions to bail out=
 a Connecticut hedge fund.=20
Administration officials said O'Neill and Evans took no action to help Enro=
n.=20
On two other occasions, Lay called to discuss an Enron energy project in In=
dia and did not mention Enron's financial troubles, officials said.=20
The calls came after investors and the general public learned of the extent=
 of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct. 16.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of speculation about its fi=
nances.=20
Administration officials dismissed suggestions that Evans or O'Neill should=
 have disclosed Enron's troubles as soon as they were brought to their atte=
ntion last fall. That might have given more notice to investors about to lo=
se their savings.=20
"This is not the first bankruptcy and will not be the last bankruptcy" in A=
merica, Fleischer said.=20
Other aides said Enron's problems were well known at the time of the teleph=
one calls, and the administration's duty was to make sure troubles at Enron=
 didn't have a broader economic impact.=20
Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and individ=
ual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign, making the compa=
ny one of his biggest financial supporters. In addition, Enron gave tens of=
 thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas.=20
Independent analysts show that Enron employee donated nearly $800,000 from =
1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. The bulk went t=
o GOP causes.=20
With criticism mounting, Bush summoned economic advisers to the Oval Office=
 and announced a review of federal rules on pension security and financial =
disclosure by companies.=20
"There have been a wave of bankruptcies that have caused many workers to lo=
se their pensions and that's deeply troubling to me," Bush said.=20
Bush offered the broad outlines of his six-year relationship with Lay, sayi=
ng he had seen the businessman twice this year.=20
"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,=
" Bush said. Fleischer said he knew of no White House aides who had.=20
Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides six times last year be=
fore the release of the administration's energy plan.=20
Senior adviser Karl Rove, owned Enron stock at the beginning of Bush's term=
 but sold it under federal ethics rules. Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron =
for serving on a company board last year.=20
Four congressional committees are investigating Enron matters. In one inqui=
ry, Senate investigators are issuing 51 subpoenas for documents from Enron'=
s current and former directors and senior managers and from its auditing fi=
rm.

The Enron Investigations

The New York Times=20
Page 20, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

Washington is suddenly awash with investigations into the demise of Enron, =
as well it should be. The failure of the politically powerful energy tradin=
g company is the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history. Give=
n the company's close ties to the Bush administration, and its generous cam=
paign contributions to members of Congress, only an exacting and unflinchin=
g set of investigations can assure the country that Enron executives are no=
t receiving special treatment from the government. So far, the White House =
is taking the right steps. We trust its determination will not flag in the =
months ahead, even if embarrassing questions come up about Enron's ties to =
the administration.=20
The Justice Department decision to create a special task force to determine=
 whether to bring criminal charges against Enron or its officers appears to=
 be a recognition of both the complexity and the importance of this case. S=
uch task forces, based in Washington but involving prosecutors around the c=
ountry, are usually reserved for potential crimes of national import, and t=
his is certainly that. Thousands of unsuspecting Enron employees lost much =
of their retirement savings while company officials enriched themselves by =
dumping their stock before the plight of the company became known.
Placing the investigation directly under the control of the Justice Departm=
ent's criminal division, however, can invite political interference by top =
administration officials. President Bush must ensure that that does not hap=
pen. Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff properly recused=
 themselves from Enron-related matters yesterday because Mr. Ashcroft recei=
ved large contributions from the company while he was in the Senate. The co=
mpany, long a prophet of deregulating energy markets, and its employees con=
tributed about $800,000 to political candidates in the last two years.=20
Enron, based in Houston, has been the most generous corporate benefactor of=
 George W. Bush throughout his political career. The president is now under=
standably eager to distance himself from the company, its scandal and its c=
hairman, Kenneth Lay. The White House announced yesterday that Mr. Lay had =
telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Ev=
ans last fall to inform them of his company's difficulties. Mr. Lay seemed =
to hint in these conversations at the possibility of government relief. The=
 two cabinet members say they offered no assistance, but the planned Congre=
ssional hearings into the Enron scandal should explore the timing and conte=
nt of these and all other contacts between the administration and Enron.=20
President Bush has directed Mr. O'Neill and others to review regulations af=
fecting company pension plans and financial disclosures with an eye toward =
averting any future Enron-like debacles. Mr. Bush, however, must do more to=
 show that he understands the full import of the Enron collapse. He should =
order Vice President Dick Cheney to be forthcoming with the details of the =
dealings Mr. Cheney's energy task force had with Enron executives last year=
. The White House disclosed earlier this week that Mr. Cheney or members of=
 his task force had met with Enron officials six times. But so far, Mr. Che=
ney has not offered detailed information about the agenda of each meeting. =
He must now do so, in recognition that this is no longer about whether to s=
uccumb to the pestering of partisan Democrats on Capitol Hill. It is about =
reassuring millions of American investors whose confidence in the integrity=
 of financial markets has been shaken.=20
Enron is the latest and most spectacular case of a financial implosion that=
 involved accounting irregularities. Many other seeming high fliers eager t=
o impress Wall Street and prop up their stock prices have had to restate er=
roneous earnings statements, raising questions about the oversight of the a=
ccounting profession. Arthur Andersen, Enron's supposedly independent audit=
or, announced yesterday that a significant number of its Enron-related docu=
ments had been destroyed. Andersen's failure to question the appropriatenes=
s of Enron's dealings with off-the-books partnerships run by its own office=
rs should figure prominently in the Justice Department's and Securities and=
 Exchange Commission's investigations.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PENSIONS
Bush Promises a Look at Employee Risks, but Experts Say Solutions Won't Be =
Easy
By DANIEL ALTMAN

01/11/2002
The New York Times=20
Page 4, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

Reacting to the destruction of the retirement savings of thousands of emplo=
yees of the Enron Corporation, President Bush said yesterday that the admin=
istration would start looking at ways ''to make sure that people are not ex=
posed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy.''=20
But without changes in law and corporate behavior, the White House may have=
 a hard time reaching that goal.
Many Enron employees lost their retirement savings because the savings were=
 tied up almost exclusively in company securities. Over half the funds in E=
nron's 401(k) plans for employees were invested in Enron's own shares.=20
That situation is by no means unique, said J. Mark Iwry, a former benefits =
tax counsel at the Treasury Department. Survey data suggest that more than =
30 percent of assets are invested in company stock at those companies that =
allow their stock to be included in their 401(k) plans. And in companies li=
ke Enron, where management has some influence over how employee savings are=
 invested, slightly over half the assets on average are in company stock.=
=20
Why, given the seemingly obvious benefits of diversification, would workers=
 still end up putting so many nest eggs in the same basket?=20
By law, companies must offer several options for 401(k) plans. But unlike t=
raditional pension plans, which cannot put more than 10 percent of their as=
sets in any one company, the rules governing 401(k) plans do not set limits=
. And many companies give their employees big incentives to buy shares with=
 their 401(k) contributions. Companies often match employee contributions o=
nly with stock and impose limits on how soon the shares can be sold.=20
Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill said yesterday that he would cons=
ider ways to give American workers, more than 40 million of whom have money=
 in 401(k) plans, more freedom to make investment decisions.=20
But Brigitte Madrian, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago=
, said holders of 401(k) plans generally show little initiative. Most peopl=
e stick with the default 401(k) plan set up by their company, even if that =
plan invests solely in the company's shares. And employees are unlikely to =
keep close tabs on their retirement savings, despite the possibility of a s=
udden collapse like Enron's. ''Most people aren't in the habit of tracking =
their 401(k) investments on a daily basis,'' she said.=20
The reasons employees buy their own companies' shares may go beyond company=
 rules. People may simply be more confident in their employers than in the =
rest of the market. James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy a=
t the American Benefits Council, said that even though Enron employees had =
opportunities at certain times to diversify their savings, many still chose=
 to invest heavily in the company's stock because of their loyalty to Enron=
 and its past success.=20
Sometimes, colleagues' confidence is enough. ''Some employees felt social p=
ressures to put even their own money into company stock,'' Ms. Madrian said=
. Those workers, she said, suffered the most when Enron's value crumbled.=
=20
Legislation has intensified such trends, according to Mr. Iwry. He cited ta=
x deductions on dividend payments for shares bought through employee stock =
ownership plans. Such plans can also offer shares at a discount.=20
Mr. Iwry warned that measures taken to encourage diversification by employe=
es might discourage companies from making matching contributions. A bill ha=
s already been introduced in the House that would limit the portion of a 40=
1(k) plan that may be held in a company's own shares to 10 percent.=20
''Legislative changes and regulatory changes can improve things,'' said Eri=
c Lofgren, director of the benefits group at Watson Wyatt, a consulting fir=
m, ''but they have to be really careful. It is possible for them to do more=
 harm than good.''=20
Mr. Lofgren said education could encourage diversification. ''The risk of l=
ack of diversification,'' he said, ''is certainly something you want to com=
municate to anyone who has the option of going into one stock.''=20
Mr. Delaplane said he also preferred educational steps by companies over le=
gislation. He said some of the damage from Enron's collapse might have been=
 avoided if its employees had received personal financial advice from indep=
endent consultants.=20
But such advice might not have taken account of the fact that Enron, for wh=
at it says were administrative reasons, did not allow employees to sell the=
ir stock in the 401(k) plan for a critical period when the stock price was =
falling. Top executives, by contrast, did not face the same restrictions on=
 the shares they owned outside the 401(k) plan and those they had acquired =
through stock options.=20
Though 401(k) plans may receive the bulk of the attention in the Enron case=
, at least one authority on retirement saving hopes that Mr. Bush will cons=
ider the issue more broadly. ''The biggest need is to try to expand the cov=
erage of the pension system,'' said James Poterba, an M.I.T. economics prof=
essor. ''That typically means trying to find ways to get smaller firms and =
lower-wage firms to adopt more systematic retirement arrangements.''=20
Mr. Bush also promised to focus attention more broadly on disclosure of fin=
ancial information.=20
And Edmund L. Jenkins, chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board=
, said: ''It is important that we have transparency of information for inve=
stors. It's a natural reaction to a situation such as Enron's for questions=
 to be asked in this area.''=20
But ''until we know what happened,'' Mr. Jenkins added, ''it's hard to know=
 what to address.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE AUCTION
Enron's Energy Trading Business Draws Several Potential Buyers
By JONATHAN D. GLATER and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

01/11/2002
The New York Times=20
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

Lawyers for the Enron Corporation negotiated late into the night yesterday =
as they tried to extract the best deal from companies interested in buying =
its once-mighty energy trading business.=20
Several lawyers for companies monitoring the auction held, as part of Enron=
's bankruptcy proceedings, at the Midtown Manhattan offices of the law firm=
 of Weil, Gotshal & Manges said that at various points in the evening, diff=
erent bidders seemed to be ahead, but that the negotiations were too close =
to call.
Citibank and UBS both submitted bids this week, BP was bidding for some por=
tions of the business, and lawyers for Enron said that other companies had =
submitted informal bids this week.=20
''The auction is continuing and is expected to go on possibly all night,'' =
Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, said in a statement relea=
sed late last night to placate reporters. ''We hope to have a conclusion an=
d announcement Friday morning.''=20
Enron's flagship energy trading business bought and sold energy-related com=
modities like gas and electricity as well as more complex financial product=
s to hedge against energy market risk. Included in the businesses for sale =
was its Internet trading operation, EnronOnline. Since Enron filed for bank=
ruptcy on Dec. 2, the trading business has honored outstanding contracts bu=
t has not originated new transactions, according to its lawyers.=20
Any deal for the trading operations would not be final. Today, a federal ba=
nkruptcy judge is scheduled to approve the transaction, but several credito=
rs have objected to different aspects of the sale in recent weeks. Lawyers =
for Enron said that if the hearing needs to be postponed, it will be.=20
It is unclear how much of a competitor the new trading business will be. Fo=
r one thing, analysts and industry experts said that the trading business, =
to be operated by a joint venture with a new investor, would probably be mo=
re cautious than Enron was.=20
''Enron's operations will probably be more conservatively run within the ne=
w structure, with another major investor being a major shareholder,'' said =
Gordon A. Howald, an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais. The culture at a fi=
nancial institution like Citibank or UBS is different from that at Enron, w=
hich at its heyday had a reputation for tolerating very high levels of risk=
, he said.=20
''Enron, for example, was involved in a significant number of commodities t=
hat were not necessarily very liquid -- coal, metals,'' he said. By serving=
 as a market-maker, Enron risked having to make good on a deal that another=
 company failed to complete, at great potential cost.=20
Any buyers, Mr. Howald said, ''would have to seriously consider whether the=
y would want to take on that added risk.''=20
Bidders have not necessarily proposed paying cash for Enron's trading opera=
tion, said Martin J. Bienenstock, a lawyer at Weil Gotshal, which represent=
s Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings. Rather, the buyer would provide nece=
ssary financial backing and take an ownership stake in a joint venture that=
 would own the trading business, which includes more than 500 employees and=
 the software, computers and necessary facilities.=20
Over all, energy trading appears to have become more conservative since Enr=
on's collapse. Traders are scrutinizing the financial health of their tradi=
ng partners much more closely, said one executive involved in risk manageme=
nt at a major energy company that operates its own trading business.=20
The executive, who insisted that his name not be used in an article discuss=
ing Enron, said that some traders now require more collateral or have ''tri=
ggers'' in contracts, requiring other parties to provide more collateral un=
der certain circumstances.=20
''The whole industry is running itself differently,'' said Paul Patterson, =
an analyst who covers the energy industry for ABN Amro in New York. But the=
 changes in trading practices did not cause Enron's demise, he added. ''Wha=
t you really had was a run on the bank,'' he said.=20
The new trading business, for now known only by its acronym Netco, for New =
Energy Trading Company, will therefore not instantly become an energy tradi=
ng powerhouse. It will have to regain the confidence of other energy trader=
s.=20
Mr. Howald, the analyst, said that recovery would not come quickly. ''It's =
going to take a long time to get anywhere close to the volume they traded i=
n the past,'' he said.

Failing Enron sought help at White House

Washington --- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay telephoned Treasury Secreta=
ry Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans last fall to warn them the=
 nation's largest energy trader was headed for trouble and to seek their he=
lp, the White House disclosed Thursday.=20
It was the first public indication that high-level Bush administration offi=
cials knew the seriousness of the Houston-based company's financial woes be=
fore Dec. 2, when it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, wiping o=
ut the retirement savings of many of its employees.
In another development, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Art=
hur Anderson LLP, said its employees had destroyed "a significant but undet=
ermined" number of documents related to Enron. The accounting firm had alre=
ady been criticized for failing to detect irregularities.=20
Also Thursday, Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from a wide-r=
anging criminal investigation of Enron by the Justice Department, which he =
heads. Various news reports said Enron and Lay contributed thousands of dol=
lars to Ashrcroft's unsuccessful Senate re-election campaign in 2000.=20
Meanwhile, President Bush announced the creation of a group to reform discl=
osure rules regarding pensions. Many Enron employees saw their 401(k) retir=
ement savings evaporate after company officials banned them for a period of=
 time from selling their plunging company stock.=20
"Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of Enron's chairman and one of=
 his=20
biggest political backers. "But what anybody's going to find is that this a=
dministration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, =
to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are prot=
ected."=20
Bush said he and Enron's chairman did not discuss the company's financial s=
ituation.=20
"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,=
" Bush told reporters in the Oval Office. "The last time that I saw Mr. Lay=
 was at my mother's fund-raising event for literacy in Houston, that would =
have been last spring. I do know that Mr. Lay came to the White House early=
 in my administration along with . . . 20 other business leaders to discuss=
 the state of the economy."=20
Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay call=
ed Treasury Secretary O'Neill in the fall expressing concern about Enron's =
financial health and fears that the company's problems could affect financi=
al markets.=20
Fleischer said Lay brought up Long-Term Capital Management, one of the larg=
est hedge funds in history and whose 1998 collapse was softened when 14 ban=
ks agreed to a bailout at the behest of the Federal Reserve. Asked if Lay w=
anted a bailout, Fleischer said: "I don't characterize it one way or anothe=
r."=20
"What was told to me this morning was Secretary O'Neill said that he had be=
en contacted by Mr. Lay in the fall of last year and Mr. Lay brought to the=
 secretary's attention concerns about whether or not Enron would be able to=
 meet its obligations, and he expressed his concern about the experience of=
 Long-Term Capital," Fleischer said.=20
O'Neill assigned a deputy to review the Long-Term Capital case and conclude=
d that a comparison "was not apt," Fleischer said.=20
Lay called O'Neill on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 after Enron reported an eye-poppin=
g $618 million third quarter loss.=20
"Lay mentioned to the secretary that this might impact credit markets," Tre=
asury Department spokeswoman Michele Davis said.=20
O'Neill, in an interview on CNN, said Treasury looked at the question of wh=
ether Enron's troubles posed a threat more broadly to U.S. credit markets a=
nd concluded it did not.=20
He dismissed suggestions that Enron was seeking a federal bailout.=20
"If he wanted a giveaway from the government, he surely wouldn't have calle=
d me," O'Neill said. "I don't know when we're inclined to make bailouts . .=
 . for companies that have gotten themselves in trouble."=20
Lay called Commerce Secretary Evans on Oct. 26, in the days before Moody's =
Investor's Services was deciding whether to downgrade the Enron's credit ra=
ting. Evans returned the call on Oct. 29, the day after Lay called O'Neill.=
=20
Evans told CNN that Lay said, "If there's any kind of support you could giv=
e us we would welcome that." Evans said he and O'Neill conferred and determ=
ined that no federal government response was in order.=20
Later, Evans told reporters at the White House that he did not discuss the =
decision with President Bush.=20
"I didn't think he needed to know," said Evans. "It was a pretty easy decis=
ion."=20
Enron's financial woes became public Oct. 16, when the company reported the=
 $618 million loss. The next day, the Securities and Exchange Commission an=
nounced it was beginning an inquiry into transactions involving partnership=
s run by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was ousted lat=
er in October.=20
In possibly the only positive development for Enron on Thursday, U.S. Distr=
ict Judge Lee Rosenthal refused to freeze more than $1 billion in Enron ass=
ets in response to a lawsuit filed against company executives by Amalgamate=
d Bank and others. The lawsuit charges Enron executives profited illegally =
by selling millions of shares before the company collapsed.=20
The Justice Department announced a wide-ranging criminal probe of Enron's f=
inancial transactions Wednesday --- one of several investigations under way=
.=20
On Thursday, Ashcroft recused himself, citing "the totality of the circumst=
ances of the relationship between Enron and the attorney general," accordin=
g to a Justice Department statement.=20
Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, raised $57,499 for his failed 2000 Senate =
campaign from Enron; Lay gave $25,000 of the total. The Ashcroft Victory Co=
mmittee raised another $25,000 in soft money directly from Enron, according=
 to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.=20
Four congressional committees are investigating Enron matters.=20
Those probes likely will be hampered by Andersen's announcement that electr=
onic files and other documents related to its audit of Enron had been destr=
oyed.=20
Andersen, in a statement, said its company policy "required in certain circ=
umstances the destruction of certain types of documents."=20
Millions of Enron documents still exist, the accounting firm said, and it h=
as retrieved some of the deleted electronic files.=20
Andersen said it has asked John Danforth, former Missouri attorney general =
and U.S. senator, to conduct a review of the company's records management p=
olicy.=20
Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Commit=
tee, which is among those investigating Enron's actions, called the destruc=
tion of documents "a deeply troubling development."=20
"Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired," Tau=
zin said. "Anyone who destroyed records to try and subvert our investigatio=
n should be prosecuted."=20
Enron has deep political ties to Bush and key members of his administration=
.=20
The Bush presidential campaign received $74,200 in contributions from two d=
ozen top current and former Enron executives and board members in the 2000 =
election cycle.=20
Lay also personally contributed $122,500 to Bush's campaigns for governor o=
f Texas, according to a study by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrit=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE BANK
Ties to Enron Leave Banker in an Awkward Spot
By RIVA D. ATLAS

01/11/2002
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company=20

Enron's collapse leaves Marc Shapiro of J. P. Morgan Chase in a difficult p=
osition.=20
As a vice chairman who oversees finance and risk management at the bank, Mr=
. Shapiro has had to repeatedly explain how the venerable New York institut=
ion came to have so much at stake. At last tally, the bank provided $2.6 bi=
llion to Enron, the giant energy trading company that fell into bankruptcy =
last month. The relationship went beyond traditional loans to a variety of =
complicated financings, including futures contracts involving offshore comp=
anies and debt backed by Enron's receivables.
Disclosures about the extent of that exposure have left J. P. Morgan's inve=
stors wondering if top management was fully aware of its Enron position bef=
ore the company's demise. Even now, questions persist about whether there a=
re more surprises to come for J. P. Morgan's investors.=20
Not only does Mr. Shapiro have to answer for the financial decisions, but h=
e has to navigate a web of ties to Enron. A native of Houston, Enron's home=
town, and a former chief executive of Texas Commerce, Mr. Shapiro has long =
moved in circles with Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive. Mr. Lay was =
once a member of the board of Texas Commerce, a bank that was acquired by a=
 predecessor of J. P. Morgan in 1987.=20
Mr. Lay has had ''a long professional relationship with Marc Shapiro and co=
nsiders him a very good friend,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman.=20
A relationship with Enron was, until recently, quite prized on Wall Street,=
 Mr. Shapiro said in a conference call with analysts last month. ''It is di=
fficult to remember that four to five months ago, Enron was a very solid in=
vestment-grade company with a very positive reputation,'' he said. ''We and=
 lots of other people had that belief.''=20
Even though $2.6 billion would be a manageable loss for Morgan, Mr. Shapiro=
, 54, may have more at stake personally. He was in the running for the top =
job at Morgan, which went to William B. Harrison Jr., 58. The Enron debacle=
 -- as political pressures mount and criminal inquiries commence -- could p=
rove to be an embarrassing coda on a highly successful career.=20
J. P. Morgan and the banks it acquired have led more than a third of Enron'=
s bank financings since 1991, according to estimates by the Loan Pricing Co=
rporation, a New York research firm. Citigroup led an estimated 45 percent =
of Enron's loans. The lending relationship probably helped J. P. Morgan gai=
n other Enron business, including the role of merger adviser on the company=
's ill-fated plan to be acquired by Dynegy.=20
Recent lawsuits disclose that the bank engaged in some complicated financin=
gs on Enron's behalf.=20
On Dec. 11, J. P. Morgan filed a lawsuit demanding that Enron turn over $2.=
1 billion in assets tied to a financing that was backed by Enron receivable=
s. J. P. Morgan has said that it is owed less than $100 million of this tot=
al, because it arranged the loan and then sold the rest to other investors.=
=20
A week later, the bank surprised investors by disclosing that it was owed n=
early $1 billion from a group of insurance companies that had backed commod=
ity contracts between J. P. Morgan and Enron. The insurers have refused to =
pay.=20
After it filed suit against the insurers in late December, J. P. Morgan sai=
d that its exposure to Enron totaled $2.6 billion. That was $1.7 billion gr=
eater than implied in a press release in November, as Enron's financial dif=
ficulties became apparent.=20
For many analysts, it was not the size of the exposure, but the sharp revis=
ion that unnerved them. ''J. P. Morgan has lost some credibility in its ris=
k-management warning systems,'' wrote David Hendler, an analyst with Credit=
Sights, a research firm that tracks the debt markets. ''We are not confiden=
t that the latest disclosures will be the final ones.''=20
The Enron situation is a rare embarrassment for Mr. Shapiro, who is well re=
garded by competitors and investors for his facility with numbers as well a=
s his frankness. At just 29, he became chief financial officer of Texas Com=
merce.=20
Mr. Shapiro did not have direct responsibility for loans to Enron but appea=
rs to have taken an interest in the company's struggle for survival. On at =
least a couple of occasions last fall, he helped along rescue discussions, =
within the bank and with Dynegy executives, according to executives at J. P=
. Morgan and at Dynegy.=20
According to a recent article in The New York Observer, Mr. Shapiro called =
a J. P. Morgan investment banker in November and asked him to help the comp=
any find a savior. But according to officials at J. P. Morgan, that request=
 was made not at the urging of Mr. Lay but of a Morgan banker in Houston wh=
o worked directly with Enron and who knew Mr. Shapiro.=20
Mr. Shapiro said such occasional involvement should not be surprising, or s=
uspicious. ''As a leading financial institution, our executives have valuab=
le relationships with many business leaders,'' he said. ''But that doesn't =
mean there's any difficulty in doing the right thing for our firm. You do w=
hat you need to do to protect the interests of the institution.''=20
Mr. Shapiro is probably taking a personal interest in the case, said Debora=
h Fiorito, who handles communications for Dynegy and who worked for Mr. Sha=
piro at Texas Commerce. ''Marc's interest in this transcends many levels,''=
 she said. ''He cares a lot about what happens to Houston. You can't say en=
ough about the impact of this on the city.''=20
Mr. Lay served on the board of Texas Commerce because he was a major custom=
er of the bank and because he had stature among Houston business executives=
.=20
''I respected Ken Lay very much,'' said Ben Love, the longtime chief execut=
ive of Texas Commerce who hired and mentored Mr. Shapiro and asked Mr. Lay =
to join the bank's board. ''I am dumbfounded like everyone else'' about Enr=
on's collapse, he said.=20
Mr. Shapiro's ties to Mr. Lay extended beyond the board of Texas Commerce. =
The men were involved in Houston politics and civic affairs, and they have =
served on a committee to help burnish the image of the University of Housto=
n.=20
However ugly and embarrassing the Enron debacle may be, Mr. Shapiro emphasi=
zed to analysts last month that it was unlikely to cripple the bank. Of the=
 $2.6 billion in loans outstanding to Enron, about a fourth, $620 million, =
is unsecured. Even if the bank loses all of the unsecured amount, that repr=
esents less than 1 percent of J. P. Morgan's $460 billion in corporate loan=
s, derivatives, obligations and commitments at the end of the third quarter=
.=20
''The way the information came out was unusual, but there was nothing sinis=
ter about it,'' said Thomas K. Brown, who runs Second Curve Capital, which =
invests in bank stocks. ''They just bungled. We all want neat answers, but =
in the world we live in, arrangements with large corporations are increasin=
gly complex.''=20
Mr. Brown, who said he thought ''the world of Marc Shapiro,'' suggested tha=
t Mr. Shapiro's reputation would weather the Enron debacle. ''Bankruptcies =
of this size don't happen every day,'' he said.

Fall of an Energy Giant: Enron's Advisers Seek Higher Bids For Energy Unit
By Mitchell Pacelle and Jathon Sapsford

Representatives of Enron Corp. and its creditors were still negotiating yes=
terday evening in an effort to coax the highest possible offer for parts of=
 the company's once-powerful wholesale trading unit.=20
As of yesterday evening, the company hadn't yet selected a winning bid from=
 multiple bidders. Among the bidders are two banks, Citigroup Inc. and UBS =
AG, and BP PLC, the London-based oil company. The company's advisers spent =
the day yesterday pressing bidders to improve their original offers.
Enron's advisers and creditors consider it a priority to try to get the ene=
rgy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, up and=
 running again. Enron's advisers had been aiming to find a creditworthy par=
tner willing to take a 51% stake in the trading unit, which trades dozens o=
f products and once accounted for the bulk of Enron's revenues.=20
The details of the bids submitted by Citigroup and UBS haven't been disclos=
ed.=20
BP has said it offered $25 million for only the computer settlement support=
 systems of the Enron unit, but that it hadn't submitted a bid for control =
of the whole unit. A BP spokesman reiterated yesterday, however, that if th=
e bidding process set up by the bankruptcy court "doesn't work out, we did =
express an interest in negotiating without commitment for other things."=20
The earliest Enron is expected to disclose a decision -- if it reaches one =
-- is at a hearing on the matter scheduled for New York federal bankruptcy =
court this morning. It remained unclear yesterday evening whether a deal wo=
uld be cemented in time to present to the court. Alternatively, it is possi=
ble that Enron will ask the court for more time to negotiate, or announce t=
hat it had found none of the offers acceptable, one person involved in the =
process said.=20
The effort to sell a controlling stake in the unit could be further complic=
ated by the attempt by more than a dozen creditors to temporarily block the=
 sale of the energy-trading business. Those creditors, which include Royal =
Bank of Scotland and power-trading rivals, have asked for guarantees that E=
nron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has b=
een made about how it will be split among creditors.=20
Until recently, Enron's energy-trading unit, which includes its EnronOnline=
 Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products and generated r=
oughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. Trading all b=
ut dried up in the wake of the company's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

JUDY MARTIN reporting:=20
Enron went on the auction block with its trading operations for good reason=
. Fitch credit analyst Ralph Pelleichia says this may be the only way for t=
he company to re-enter the trading business following bankruptcy.=20
Mr. RALPH PELLEICHIA (Fitch Credit Analyst): Prior to bankruptcy, the whole=
sale trading business generated approximately 75 percent of the earnings in=
 cash flow. So this is--is and would be a major contributor for the company=
 and an opportunity for the company to prevent liquidation.=20
MARTIN: At least two heavy-hitters, Citicorp and UBS Warburg, reportedly su=
bmitted bids for the company's most successful electricity and gas trading =
operations. But Pelleichia says the stigma of Enron's reputation for earnin=
gs overstatement lingers.=20
Mr. PELLEICHIA: Whoever they deal with would have to be financially strong =
with great credibility.=20
MARTIN: Regardless of the challenges, Enron made a lot of money in energy m=
