Enron Accountants May Be Placed On Leave by Board

Enron Corp.'s board is expected to put the company's two top accounting off=
icers on administrative leave this week in reaction to an internal report t=
hat says neither did his job adequately, sources close to the matter say.=
=20
The men, Chief Accounting Officer Richard A. Causey and Chief Risk Officer =
Richard B. Buy, reviewed Enron's creation of several outside partnerships r=
un by Enron officers and, records indicate, judged them beneficial to Enron=
. They also reviewed subsequent transactions with those entities. Recent di=
sclosures that these partnerships greatly enriched a handful of Enron emplo=
yees at Enron's expense contributed to the Houston energy concern's collaps=
e into bankruptcy proceedings in December.
Neither man nor an attorney representing them responded to requests to comm=
ent yesterday.=20
To date, there is no evidence that Messrs. Causey or Buy invested in any of=
 the Enron-related partnerships or personally reaped any financial windfall=
 from them. The men were scheduled to testify Thursday before one of severa=
l congressional committees investigating Enron's downfall.=20
Before joining Enron in early 1991, Mr. Causey was an accountant for Arthur=
 Andersen in Houston and had "primary responsibility for the Enron engageme=
nt," according to his company biography. Mr. Buy, before joining Enron in 1=
994, was a vice president at Bankers Trust, assigned to energy lending and =
trading in Houston and New York.=20
In his current role at Enron, Mr. Causey was supposed to make sure that Enr=
on's accounting practices adhered to industry standards and that its Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission disclosures were full and complete. Mr. Buy, a=
s chief risk officer, has had primary responsibility for "quantifying and c=
ontrolling risks in both Enron's trading activities and investment opportun=
ities," according to his company biography.=20
Instead, Mr. Causey has "presided over" accounting decisions that go "well =
beyond aggressive," according to the Enron internal report prepared by a sp=
ecial, three-person committee of the board. Mr. Buy, according to that same=
 report, "saw his role more narrowly" than appropriate and "did not affirma=
tively carry out . . . a careful review of the economic terms" of transacti=
ons between Enron and the related-party entities.=20
Board minutes reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that Messrs. Causey =
and Buy frequently told the board that there were adequate controls in plac=
e to protect the company's interests as it transacted business with the off=
icer-controlled partnerships, including ones run by Enron's former chief fi=
nancial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
For example, in a meeting of the board's finance committee on Oct. 6, 2000,=
 Mr. Causey joined then-chief executive Jeffrey Skilling in discussing the =
"benefits to the company" of being able to transact business with the LJM p=
artnerships set up by Mr. Fastow, according to minutes of that meeting. Pre=
viously, Mr. Fastow had told the board that all transactions with the vehic=
les he ran would be reviewed by Messrs. Causey, Buy and Skilling in order "=
to mitigate any potential conflicts."=20
J.C. Nickens, an attorney representing both men, couldn't be reached to com=
ment yesterday. But in an interview last week, he said his clients are blam=
eless. Referring to Mr. Causey, Mr. Nickens said that "my client would say =
the accounting for these partnerships was appropriate . . . that the deals =
were structured and accounted for with professional advice of people on his=
 staff and Arthur Andersen," which was Enron's auditing firm.=20
All told, the Fastow-related partnerships engaged in more than two dozen tr=
ansactions with Enron that left the company, in many cases, holding the bag=
. The Enron special committee, in its report, which was released during the=
 weekend, said that in some cases Enron settled some of its partnership ven=
tures for far less money than what the committee felt was fair value. This =
suggests that the interests of the officer-controlled partnerships may have=
 been put ahead of those of Enron.

Former Enron Chairman Lay's Whereabouts Unknown
2002-02-05 08:32 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Kenneth Lay, former chairman of Enro=
n Corp., won't appear at a House hearing this morning after his attorney re=
fused to accept a subpoena compelling him to appear, CNN said.
     Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, said there wasn't enough time because La=
y had returned to Houston and Silbert didn't know where to find him, CNN sa=
id.
     This morning the Senate Commerce Committee plans to vote to issue a su=
bpoena for Lay to testify on Feb. 12. House and Senate committee members ha=
ve said they hope Lay won't take the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify =
on the grounds it may incriminate him.
     Lay backed out of appearances yesterday and today before the Senate Co=
mmerce Committee and a House Financial Services subcommittee. Silbert infor=
med both panels that Lay wouldn't appear because of "inflammatory'' comment=
s made by members of the committee that he said were prejudicial to his cli=
ent.
     Yesterday the House panel voted to subpoena Lay to appear at 10 a.m. t=
his morning.
     A board-sponsored investigation released this weekend said Enron execu=
tives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,0=
00 partnerships. Those transactions caused Houston energy dealer to file th=
e largest bankruptcy reorganization on Dec. 2.
     The company's failure led to at least 4,500 job losses in Houston and =
1,100 in the U.K. and wiped out millions of dollars of retirement savings f=
or Enron employees, whose investments were tied up in the company's stock.

Powers Testimony

     Yesterday Lay resigned from the board of the company he founded in 198=
5, saying it was in the "best interests'' of former and current Enron emplo=
yees and "other stakeholders,'' according to a statement distributed by PR =
Newswire.
     In testimony yesterday before the House panel, William Powers Jr., the=
 head of the Enron's special investigation Committee, said Lay and the rest=
 of the board failed to halt ``a systematic and pervasive attempt'' by mana=
gement to deceive investors about the energy dealer's finances.
     "What we found was absolutely appalling,'' Powers said.
     Powers' 203-page investigative report found Enron executives enriched =
themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,000 partnerships=
. Enron had said it overstated earnings by $586 million since 1997 by faili=
ng to disclose partnerships used to hide loans and losing ventures.
     Powers also said today that Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, coul=
dn't have performed an independent audit of Enron because it was paid $5.7 =
million by the company to help set up the partnerships.
     "If they helped structure the transactions, they already are going to =
hold views of the transactions,'' he told the House Financial Services subc=
ommittee on capital markets.
     Andersen was paid $25 million in audit fees by Enron and $27 million f=
or non-audit services in 2000. Senate and House Democrats are introducing b=
ills that would prohibit auditors from also providing some consulting servi=
ces to the same client.

Lawmakers Will Subpoena Kenneth Lay --- Ex-Chief of Enron Resigns From Comp=
any's Board, Citing Various Inquiries
By Michael Schroeder

WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers say they will issue a subpoena to compel Kenneth La=
y, former chairman of Enron Corp., to appear before committees investigatin=
g the collapse of the Houston energy trading giant.=20
Enron director William Powers told a House Financial Services subcommittee =
that a recently completed review by the board concluded that Enron's top ma=
nagers, including Mr. Lay, outside auditors and directors, all contributed =
to the company's downfall. Mr. Lay had canceled his much-anticipated appear=
ance before a Senate panel, saying that the hearings would be prosecutorial=
.
Separately yesterday, Mr. Lay announced his resignation from the Enron boar=
d, saying that because of the many investigations being conducted that invo=
lve him, his continued role on the board has "become a distraction" as the =
company works to emerge from bankruptcy-court proceedings.=20
Meanwhile, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) ca=
lled for a special prosecutor to replace the Justice Department in its crim=
inal investigation of Enron. And Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission, pointed a finger at the Financial Accounting Standar=
ds Board, the independent rule-setting body, for long delays in updating ru=
les, including a request by the SEC more than a decade ago to reconsider ne=
w accounting rules for off-balance-sheet special-purpose entities. Enron us=
ed these partnerships extensively, which contributed to the company's downf=
all.=20
Mr. Powers's testimony was seized on by committee members to press their pr=
oposals for additional oversight of auditors, stock analysts and rating age=
ncies. Lawmakers are debating whether severe shortcomings in financial repo=
rting can be addressed by new SEC rules or legislation.=20
Mr. Hollings's comments are a signal that the high level of partisanship on=
 the Enron debacle among congressional Democrats is likely to intensify as =
more hearings are held in the coming weeks. The Bush administration's exten=
sive ties to Enron made it a "cash-and-carry government," he said at a news=
 conference.=20
Mr. Hollings also said that the Justice Department couldn't be relied on to=
 conduct an objective investigation, given the Enron connections of several=
 department officials, including Attorney General John Ashcroft. Mr. Ashcro=
ft recused himself from the probe, citing the large campaign contributions =
he had gotten from Enron in his 2000 Senate campaign.=20
Justice Department officials responded that appointing a special prosecutor=
 is unnecessary. "No conflict of interest exists. No person involved in pur=
suing this investigation has any conflict, or any ties that would require a=
 recusal," the department said in a statement.=20
Mr. Hollings also said he had doubts about the objectivity of the Enron int=
ernal review, conducted by a special committee of the company's board led b=
y Mr. Powers. Mr. Powers "is a very fine gentleman, but he's a member of th=
e board," he said.=20
The senator, who canceled his panel's hearing yesterday after Mr. Lay decli=
ned to testify, said members would vote today to issue a subpoena.=20
Mr. Lay also said he wouldn't appear at a scheduled House subcommittee hear=
ing today. In response, the Financial Services Committee chairman, Rep. Mic=
hael Oxley (R., Ohio) attempted yesterday afternoon to serve Mr. Lay a subp=
oena through his attorney Earl Silbert. Peggy Peterson, Mr. Oxley's spokesw=
oman, said that Mr. Silbert said he "didn't know the whereabouts of his cli=
ent."=20
Mr. Silbert didn't return a phone call or answer an e-mail seeking comment.=
=20
The subpoenas can't compel Mr. Lay to testify, however. Sen. Byron Dorgan (=
D., N.D.) acknowledged that Mr. Lay could use his Fifth Amendment right to =
refuse to answer questions when he does appear under subpoena. Two other En=
ron executives who lawmakers want to talk with about the company's collapse=
 have already told lawmakers they plan to do this.=20
In testimony before Rep. Richard Baker's subcommittee, Mr. Powers said that=
 he found "appalling" problems at Enron. The University of Texas Law School=
 dean outlined the main findings of his report, focusing on the firm's use =
of complex off-the-books partnerships that enriched key employees, includin=
g Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. "Virtually everyone, from the boar=
d of directors on down," understood the company was using partnerships to o=
ffset investment losses with its own stock.=20
Mr. Powers, whose objectivity has been questioned because of Enron contribu=
tions to his university's law school, faulted the board of directors, sayin=
g it "failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight." During the h=
earing, numerous lawmakers said they were incredulous that the board never =
raised any red flags.=20
"Whether the Powers report is appropriately balanced or not, given the limi=
ted information on which the report is based, it does establish a basis on =
which to conclude . . . that the rules aimed at requiring disclosure were s=
o misused that they were warped into a black bag from which no information =
was able to escape," Mr. Baker said.=20
Several lawmakers, including Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.), called for legis=
lation or new regulations to address accounting and disclosure weaknesses t=
hat the Enron scandal has uncovered.=20
Mr. LaFalce also complained that the Bush administration authorized only a =
4% SEC budget increase to $480 million for the next fiscal year. He said he=
 favors tripling the SEC's budget.=20

Kenneth Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, yesterday resigne=
d from the company's board, two days after publication of a damning interna=
l report on the energy trader's ill-fated deals with partnerships.=20
The report, which criticised officers, directors and advisers of the compan=
y, has raised the legal stakes in the race to apportion blame for Enron's c=
ollapse.
In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr Lay said his involvement had =
"become a distraction" from achieving the goal of a successful reorganisati=
on of the bankrupt company.=20
Two congressional committees moved yesterday to subpoena Mr Lay, compelling=
 him to appear as early as next week. He unexpectedly withdrew from hearing=
s this week after congressmen said the report suggested Enron executives ha=
d broken the law.=20
The report analyses in detail some of the deals Enron conducted with off-ba=
lance-sheet partnerships. It concludes that many were carried out simply to=
 flatter Enron's accounts and that Mr Lay, and other senior officers, bore =
ultimate responsibility for the failure of oversight.=20
Dynegy, facing a $10bn suit from Enron after pulling out of its abortive re=
scue bid last year, said yesterday the report showed Enron's demise was "se=
lf-inflicted" and justified its decision to withdraw from the takeover.=20
Shareholders and employees seeking compensation from Enron directors and of=
ficials said the report also could provide ammunition for lawsuits against =
investors who financed Enron's off-balance-sheet partnerships.=20
Limited partners in the special-purpose vehicles took on little risk and re=
ceived disproportionately large returns, according to the report.=20
Investors in one of the partnerships, LJM2 Co-Investment, included funds or=
 units run by Merrill Lynch (which also led the placement of stakes in LJM2=
), JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and other blue-chip companies.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, head of a Washington law firm involved in one suit agains=
t Enron and Andersen, its former auditor, declined to say whether limited p=
artners would now be sued. But he said lawyers for employees and shareholde=

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW
SENATE PANEL SAYS IT WILL SUBPOENA EX-CHIEF OF ENRON
By STEPHEN LABATON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

02/05/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 -- After Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief e=
xecutive of Enron, refused to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee =
this morning, Republicans and Democrats on the panel said they would vote T=
uesday to issue a subpoena to compel his appearance.=20
Mr. Lay, who severed his final tie to Enron this evening by resigning from =
its board, had infuriated lawmakers by canceling his appearance at the last=
 minute, saying through his lawyer that Congressional hearings planned for =
this week had taken on a prosecutorial tone.
''We decided that we really had no choice but to issue a subpoena,'' Senato=
r Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said at a news conference this =
afternoon. Mr. Lay, he said, ''should not have expected it would ever be a =
walk in the park'' to testify at a Congressional hearing.=20
Lawmakers in the House said this evening that they had notified Mr. Lay's l=
awyer, Earl J. Silbert, that they intended to issue a subpoena, and were to=
ld that he did not know where his client could be found. Mr. Lay had been s=
cheduled to testify in the House on Tuesday, but he also backed out of that=
 date.=20
Mr. Silbert did not respond to requests for comment tonight, but Congressio=
nal aides and other lawyers involved in the case said they expected that Mr=
. Lay, if subpoenaed, would again refuse to testify, and invoke his Fifth A=
mendment right against self-incrimination.=20
Tonight, Mr. Lay issued a brief explanation of why he had decided to remove=
 himself from the company he founded 16 years ago, expanded into one of the=
 nation's largest energy concerns and watched helplessly as it spiraled out=
 of control.=20
''I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization,'=
' he said. ''Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of whic=
h have focused on me personally, I believe my involvement has become a dist=
raction to achieving this goal.''=20
Mr. Lay's silence before Congress is a remarkable turnabout for a corporate=
 executive who not long ago was a highly courted figure in Washington, a fi=
nancial patron of many public officials, a guest of both Democratic and Rep=
ublican presidents and a top contender for a cabinet position in the admini=
stration of the first President Bush.=20
Now he is facing a multitude of investigations by Congress, the Justice Dep=
artment and the Securities and Exchange Commission. A report issued on Satu=
rday night by three outside directors of Enron, which has filed for bankrup=
tcy protection, concluded that he bore overall responsibility as its leader=
, but that he appeared to be largely oblivious to the details of questionab=
le transactions. The report was based in part on interviews with Mr. Lay an=
d foreshadows his defense to the inquiries.=20
The day witnessed the first extensive testimony by a member of Enron's boar=
d about the company's demise. William C. Powers, the chairman of the specia=
l committee on Enron's board that issued the report, told a Congressional p=
anel that his inquiry had uncovered ''a systematic and pervasive attempt by=
 Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition.''=20
''The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting =
errors were the result of failures at many levels and by many people,'' sai=
d Mr. Powers, the dean of the University of Texas School of Law. ''A flawed=
 idea, self-enrichment by employees, inadequately designed controls, poor i=
mplementation, inattentive oversight, simple and not-so-simple accounting m=
istakes, and overreaching in a culture that appears to have encouraged push=
ing the limits.''=20
Mr. Powers termed his findings ''absolutely appalling.'' He added, ''There'=
s no question that virtually everyone, from the board of directors on down,=
 everyone understood that the company was seeking to offset its investment =
losses with its own stock.''=20
Fresh signs of the political implications of Enron's demise were evident in=
 a capital that has quickly become captivated by the matter. At a news conf=
erence this afternoon, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democ=
rat who heads the Commerce Committee, sharply criticized the Bush administr=
ation for its ties to Enron and its top executives.=20
''I've never seen a better example of cash-and-carry government than this B=
ush administration and Enron,'' he said. ''Specifically, everyone knows how=
 the Bushes got the cash, whether while he was governor using the planes of=
 the largest contributor; as president in his campaign the largest contribu=
tor; to the Republican committee running the convention and the inaugural c=
ommittee and everything else like that.''=20
Mr. Hollings, following some House Democrats, called on the administration =
to appoint a special counsel to lead the criminal investigation into Enron'=
s collapse. He cited the company's ties to nearly a dozen top officials in =
the administration and Attorney General John Ashcroft's excusing himself fr=
om the case because he had received campaign donations from Enron.=20
The Justice Department said it saw no reason for such a counsel. ''No confl=
ict of interest exists,'' its statement said. ''No person involved in pursu=
ing this investigation has any conflict or any ties that would require a re=
cusal.''=20
Mr. Hollings gamely deflected a question about his own campaign contributio=
ns from the company. Asked whether he had received donations from Enron, he=
 replied: ''I sure did, but I got 3,500 over 10 years, but our friend Kay B=
ailey Hutchison, she got 99,000. Heck, I'm the chairman of the committee. T=
hat wasn't a contribution. That was an insult.''=20
Republicans, meanwhile, continued to denounce what they called corruption a=
t Enron while noting that the company had ties to Democrats.=20
''Clearly Enron was a very politically active corporation, and I think that=
 makes this a more interesting story,'' said Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, t=
he Illinois Republican who is the ranking minority member on one of the sub=
committees examining the affair. ''But the fact of the matter is that at ro=
ot I think this is a corporate scandal. I don't believe that anyone in the =
Bush administration was aware that there was what appears to me to have bee=
n a pyramid scheme going on in Enron.''=20
After noting that the administration of President Bill Clinton also promote=
d some of Enron's business interests, he added, ''There's a very famous pic=
ture of Ken Lay with the previous president as well as the current presiden=
t.''=20
At a House financial services subcommittee hearing today, Harvey L. Pitt, t=
he chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that if facts d=
escribed in the Enron report as characterized by one lawmaker proved correc=
t, ''that would be fraud.''=20
He said his agency was re-examining a broad range of regulations as a resul=
t of Enron's problems. ''I am committed and the commission is committed to =
re-examining every assumption, every rule, and regulation, in light of Enro=
n,'' he said.=20
Specifically, he said, the agency was reviewing disclosure and financial re=
porting requirements, the role of audit committees and the oversight of acc=
ounting firms. He said that the agency was closely examining other companie=
s that have shifted their liabilities off their books and that he believed =
that corporate executives ought to face ''personal exposure'' for violating=
 disclosure rules.

Enron Corp. founder Kenneth L. Lay resigned from the company's board of dir=
ectors yesterday, two days after an investigative report found him signific=
antly responsible for the company's demise.=20
In a letter of resignation cutting his last ties to the company, Lay said: =
"I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from [bankruptcy] reor=
ganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which=
 are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a d=
istraction to achieving this goal."
Lay was supposed to testify voluntarily yesterday before a Senate committee=
, but he canceled the appearance Sunday. His attorney said members of Congr=
ess had prejudged Lay before hearing his testimony.=20
Lay and other directors were pointedly criticized in a report released Satu=
rday by a special committee appointed by Enron's board and headed by Willia=
m Powers Jr., dean of the University of Texas Law School.=20
Powers told members of the House Financial Services Committee yesterday tha=
t the failure of Lay and other directors to police accounting and ethics vi=
olations at Enron was "appalling." Disclosures of executives' self-dealing =
and false financial statements by Enron shattered its credibility with inve=
stors and customers, forcing it into bankruptcy.=20
For Lay, the departure ends a tumultuous year at the company he founded 16 =
years ago. He stepped down as chief executive a year ago, turning the post =
over to his prote{acute}ge{acute} Jeffrey Skilling. While Lay kept the chai=
rman's position, he was planning to expand his activities outside the count=
ry. Then Skilling's unexpected resignation in August, as Enron's financial =
problems were growing, forced Lay to take up the chief executive's duties o=

His assurances last summer that Enron was in good shape has been condemned =

es also face ongoing federal securities and criminal investigations.=20
Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive Jan. 23 under pressure from cr=

Thomas Roberts, Enron's outside lawyer in the bankruptcy case, received Lay=
's resignation.=20
"This was Ken Lay's decision," Roberts said. While it is difficult for a co=

to resign.=20
Roberts said Enron was sorry Lay did not feel comfortable testifying yester=
day. "The company would have liked him to tell the company's story and his =

Lay has been working at an office at Enron's Houston headquarters but is cu=

, said last week that except for their home, "everything is for sale."=20
The financial implications of Lay's resignation as chairman and chief execu=

Lay steps down from Enron's board of directors=20
Irate lawmakers working on subpoenas=20
By JULIE MASON=20

Feb. 5, 2002, 12:43AM
WASHINGTON -- Former Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay resigned from the company=
's board of directors Monday, as irate lawmakers prepared subpoenas that wo=
uld force him to appear on Capitol Hill.=20
Lay, who resigned as chairman last month, severed final corporate ties with=
 Enron, saying his problems had become a distraction to the company's effor=
ts to emerge from bankruptcy.=20
"Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focuse=
d on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction =
to achieving this goal," Lay said in a statement.=20
The move came during a chaotic day in Washington as lawmakers, stung by Lay=
's abrupt cancellation of highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill, too=
k steps to compel the embattled former executive to appear.=20
"I understand it would be difficult to come and testify, but he should not =
have expected it would ever be a walk in the park," said Sen. Byron Dorgan,=
 D-N.D.=20
Lay withdrew less than 24 hours before he was to appear Monday at the Senat=
e Commerce Committee. He also pulled out of a hearing set for today before =
the House Financial Services Committee.=20
In response, the House committee voted unanimously to authorize its chairma=
n to subpoena Lay, and the Senate panel is poised to do the same today.=20
The Senate panel tentatively set Feb. 12 as the new day to hear from Lay, w=
hile the House committee's new date was undecided.=20
Earl Silbert, Lay's attorney in Washington, D.C., said Monday night he is a=
ware that Lay may be subpoenaed by the House Financial Services Committee a=
nd suggested to the committee that Lay could testify on Feb. 12 or 13.=20
According to news reports Silbert said he did not know where Lay was when h=
e was contacted by the committee about him, but he meant that he did not kn=
ow where Lay was when the committee staff was speaking to him.=20
"I knew he had left D.C.," Silbert said.=20
Kelly Kimberly, Lay's newly hired spokeswoman, said Lay returned to Houston=
 from Washington, D.C., Monday morning.=20
Lawmakers said they are not inclined to barter immunity for Lay's testimony=
, and it was unclear whether Lay would invoke his Fifth Amendment right aga=
inst self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions.=20
Far from backing down from the heated rhetoric that Lay's attorneys blamed =
for his withdrawal, angered lawmakers, again lashed out at Enron and its fo=
rmer chairman for failing to appear as promised.=20
"We have not arrived at any preconceived notions here, but I will tell you =
it sure appears to me that this company was on the financial equivalent of =
steroids," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. "They inflated those short-term prof=
its and pumped themselves up to the detriment of the long-term health of th=
ousands of families in my home state."=20
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate committee, criticized =
the Bush administration for its ties to Enron and called for a special pros=
ecutor to oversee the criminal investigation.=20
"I've never seen a better example of cash-and-carry government as this Bush=
 administration and Enron," Hollings said.=20
Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from prosecuting the case, d=
isclosing that he took campaign contributions from Enron for a failed 2000 =
Senate bid.=20
Hollings criticized the subsequent choice of Deputy Attorney General Larry =
Thompson to head up the investigation, noting that Thompson once worked in =
a law firm that represented Enron.=20
"In other words, it should be independent," Hollings said.=20
"Of course, finding someone in this town independent of Enron is easier tha=
n finding bin Laden, I can tell you that," he said ironically.=20
The Justice Department rejected the call to replace Thompson with a special=
 prosecutor.=20
"No person involved in pursuing this investigation has any conflict, or any=
 ties that would require a recusal," Justice Department officials said.=20
Lay, who it was hoped would finally break months of silence on the collapse=
 of his one-time empire, was to be the star attraction in a week of intense=
 hearings in both the House and Senate.=20
Instead, his lawyers cited "prosecutorial" tones in the public remarks of l=
awmakers preparing to question Lay, in explaining his withdrawal.=20
Committee members generally scoffed at Lay's response, noting that their ad=
versarial tone has remained largely consistent since he agreed in December =
to testify.=20
"The problem for Mr. Lay is that some of the autopsies have already been do=
ne on Enron," said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. "If Mr. Lay wants to corre=
ct some of the damning impressions that are coming out of these documents, =
he ought to come before the American people."=20
Lay's decision not to appear came the day after a special committee of Enro=
n's board released a 218-page report criticizing company executives, audito=
rs, lawyers and board members for allowing improperly created partnerships =
to inflate Enron's earnings, hide its debt and wrongfully enrich a handful =
of insiders.=20
The report also cited Lay for bearing significant responsibility in the com=
pany's collapse.=20
Lay resigned as chairman and CEO of Enron Jan. 23, saying he could not run =
the company effectively while facing investigations and lawsuits into Enron=
's collapse.=20
His resignation from the board closes 16 years of service at Enron, leaving=
 his diminished stock ownership the only remaining link to the company.=20
He retired as chief executive in February 2001, but resumed the position wh=
en his successor, Jeff Skilling, quit in August.=20
Lawmakers said Monday that Skilling is still expected to cooperate. Former =
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, also scheduled to testify, has notif=
ied lawmakers he will not answer questions.=20
In a brief statement on Lay's resignation from the board, Enron said, "We r=
egret that circumstances have led to this. We wish Ken the best."=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE PARTNERSHIPS
Deal at Enron Gave Insiders Fast Fortunes
By KURT EICHENWALD

They called it Southampton Place. To most people in Houston, it was the nam=
e of a neighborhood known for expensive homes and influential residents.=20
But to a small group of executives at the Enron Corporation, it meant somet=
hing far different: the opportunity to obtain millions of dollars of cash, =
fast, with the money coming from the company's own coffers.
Details of the lucrative investments in Southampton, a limited partnership =
involved in dealings with Enron partnerships, were disclosed Saturday in a =
report released by a special committee of the Enron board. For directors an=
d former employees, the details have proved to be some of the most emotiona=
lly charged disclosures in the lengthy report: a small group of insiders ma=
de millions in profits in secret deals with some of the partnerships that u=
ltimately brought the company to its knees.=20
Two of the investors were able to transform $5,800, the price of a used car=
, into more than a million dollars each in just two months, according to th=
e report. Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron and=
 engineer of many of the partnership transactions, transformed a $25,000 co=
ntribution from a family foundation into $4.5 million in the same matter of=
 weeks.=20
The deals in early 2000, which involved at least half a dozen Enron employe=
es, violated the company's conflict of interest requirements. Last fall, wh=
en the first inklings of Southampton emerged, every senior executive invest=
ing in the deal who had not already been fired for a role in the partnershi=
p problems was terminated. Until then, the report says, no top officials of=
 the company knew anything about -- let alone approved of -- the insider de=
al that had come from Mr. Fastow's finance division.=20
The investment was arranged by Mr. Fastow and another Enron employee, Micha=
el Kopper, who both live in Southampton Place in Houston. Investigators wor=
king for the board committee worked to figure out why the two executives of=
fered the lucrative opportunity to other corporate insiders, but were unabl=
e to find an answer.=20
Now, legal experts say, that same question is certain to be examined by Fed=
eral prosecutors investigating the Enron debacle.=20
Investigators will look for a quid pro quo arrangement in which something o=
f value was expected from the investors in return for the lucrative opportu=
nity to participate in such a profitable deal, said Stephen Meagher, a form=
er federal prosecutor in San Francisco who handled white-collar cases.=20
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declined to comment. Mr. Kopper did not return a=
 telephone message left at his home.=20
The small group of other investors included only people who were involved i=
n partnership transactions with Mr. Fastow. Mr. Kopper, like Mr. Fastow, al=
so invested $25,000, through a partnership he called Big Doe -- apparently =
a nod to the potential profits from the investment.=20
The other investors included Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former Enron treasurer =
who helped set up some Enron partnership deals with Mr. Fastow, and Kristin=
a Mordaunt, a lawyer who worked for Mr. Fastow before becoming general coun=
sel of the company's broadband division. Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt were t=
he executives who each put up $5,800 for a return of $1 million.=20
Two other employees put up smaller amounts, and received thousands in retur=
n.=20
Henry F. Schuelke, a lawyer for Mr. Glisan, did not return a phone message.=
 Ms. Mordaunt's phone number could not be found in a computer search. Howev=
er, according to the report, she informed the committee that she never aske=
d for and never provided anything in return for the Southampton investment.=
 Mr. Glisan also told the committee that Mr. Fastow never asked him for any=
 favors or other consideration in return for the Southampton investment.=20
For some legal experts, the Southampton transaction sounds eerily similar t=
o a central part of the investment scandal at the investment house Drexel B=
urnham Lambert Inc. more than a decade ago. There, the man in charge of Dre=
xel's junk bond operation, Michael R. Milken, offered lucrative interests i=
n a partnership called MacPherson Investment Partners L.P. to a group of mu=
tual fund managers. Some of those managers, who invested their mutual funds=
 in other Drexel deals, were subsequently convicted on charges that they ha=
d accepted bribes in exchange for decisions they made for their funds.=20
With the Enron executives having fiduciary obligations to the company's sha=
reholders, legal experts said, investigators will try to determine whether =
anyone appeared to modify their actions because of the investment opportuni=
ty.=20
The MacPherson case clearly has a role as precedent in this instance, said =
Mr. Meagher, the former prosecutor.=20
Kenneth J. Vianale, the main prosecutor in the MacPherson cases, declined t=
o comment, citing a conflict; his firm has already brought class actions ag=
ainst Enron on behalf of shareholders.=20
According to the report, both Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt played roles in n=
egotiating with Mr. Fastow's partnerships on behalf of Enron after they rec=
eived their returns on the Southampton investment. That month, Mr. Glisan b=
ecame treasurer of Enron, and was intimately involved that year in a series=
 of partnership deals that played a major role in bringing down the company=
. Ms. Mordaunt was involved in at least one transaction with a Fastow partn=
ership on behalf of Enron after her investment.=20
The Southampton Place partnership traces back to a $10 million investment b=
y Enron in March 1998 in Rhythms Netconnections Inc., a privately held Inte=
rnet service provider. Enron's stake, 5.4 million shares originally priced =
at $1.85 each, proved to be enormously profitable, at least for a while.=20
A little more than a year after Enron purchased its stake, Rhythms went pub=
lic at $21 a share and closed on the first day of trading at $69. Soon Enro=
n's stake was worth some $300 million, according to the committee's report.=
=20
But the company could not cash in its stake because the terms of its invest=
ment prohibited selling the stock until the end of 1999. The prices of Inte=
rnet stocks were extremely volatile, and the changes in value of Rhythms sh=
ares showed up on the company's income statement, because of how Enron was =
accounting for the shares.=20
Senior executives wanted to limit those swings in value.=20
That is where the partnerships came in. Mr. Fastow and Mr. Glisan, who woul=
d later be appointed Enron's treasurer, arranged a series of transactions s=
upposedly to hedge the risk in the Rhythms investment.=20
The complex transactions involved a number of related partnerships. But ult=
imately the deals required Enron to contribute both stock in Rhythms and it=
s own stock to the partnerships. The report said Mr. Fastow indicated to ot=
her Enron executives that he had no financial interest in the transactions.=
=20
In 2000, when Enron decided to sell its Rhythms stake, the complex series o=
f transactions had to be undone, a process known as unwinding.=20
During the negotiations on the unwinding, Mr. Fastow proposed that Enron pa=
y $30 million to one partnership involved He did not reveal at that time th=
at the partnership was secretly owned by Southampton, which had just been e=
stablished.=20
The fact that Enron executives were profiting off this deal at the expense =
of their employer raised serious concerns for the committee.=20
''We have not seen any evidence that any of the employees, including Fastow=
, obtained approval from the chairman and C.E.O. under the code of conduct =
to participate financially in the profits of an entity doing business with =
Enron,'' the report says. ''While every code violation is a matter to be ta=
ken seriously, these violations are particularly troubling.''

Legal Liability for Enron Debacle May Be Determined by 1997 Memo
By John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Legal liability in the Enron Corp. debacle could depend, in part, on who kn=
ew about an innocuous-looking, two-page memorandum dated Dec. 30, 1997, inv=
olving one of the now-controversial outside partnerships run by company exe=
cutives.=20
Enron's collapse into bankruptcy proceedings late last year, caused in larg=
e part by the existence of those partnerships, is now the focus of congress=
ional hearings and criminal and civil investigations. The company's downfal=
l also has subjected the nation's corporate-accounting practices to unprece=
dented scrutiny.
The memo was signed by two Enron executives at the time, Jeremy Blachman an=
d Michael Kopper. It included plans for how to distribute about $6.6 millio=
n from one limited partnership, known as JEDI, to another limited partnersh=
ip, known as Chewco Investments. Chewco has received widespread attention r=
ecently as one of the partnerships whose questionable accounting treatment =
helped bring Enron down. Chewco was run and partly owned by Mr. Kopper, who=
 resigned last year as a managing director of the Houston energy-trading gi=
ant.=20
The memo shows Mr. Blachman was signing on behalf of an Enron unit that was=
 serving as general partner of JEDI, and Mr. Kopper was signing on behalf o=
f Chewco. The memo was on JEDI letterhead and addressed to Chewco Investmen=
ts.=20
The final destination and purpose of these funds has become the center of a=
 controversy between Enron and its longtime auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, as=
 well as a focus of inquiries by federal investigators probing the Enron co=
llapse. Late last year, Enron and Andersen officials said their discovery o=
f the use of that money in relation to Chewco had required Enron to retroac=
tively reduce reported earnings back to 1997 by nearly $400 million, or mor=
e than 10%. This reduction produced the lion's share of a broader financial=
 restatement that helped force Enron to seek bankruptcy-court protection on=
 Dec. 2.=20
In Dec. 12 congressional testimony, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Bera=
rdino, said the 1997 handling of the Chewco/JEDI financial arrangements inv=
olved "possible illegal acts." He said that in 1997, crucial information ab=
out the financial arrangements had been withheld from Andersen by Enron off=
icials.=20
Yesterday, an attorney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. Mr. Blachman, wh=
o is currently a managing director at an Enron unit, didn't return phone ca=
lls seeking comment. It isn't clear whether Mr. Blachman played anything mo=
re than just a minor role in the Chewco matter. A report issued over the we=
ekend by Enron's board of directors investigating Enron's executive-run par=
tnerships indicates that Mr. Blachman, when interviewed recently, couldn't =
recall details of the Dec. 30 document.=20
Mr. Berardino's testimony added to questions of who knew what and when in r=
egard to Chewco. The partnership was created in 1997 to purchase from Enron=
 for $383 million an interest in JEDI, which is an acronym for Joint Energy=
 Development Investments. Enron had helped form JEDI in 1993 and operated i=
t as a separate entity to invest in energy projects. By selling Chewco an i=
nterest, Enron was able to keep treating JEDI as independent, which meant k=
eeping more than $700 million in JEDI-related debt off Enron's balance shee=
t.=20
Enron was only able to do this transaction because Chewco was considered an=
 independent entity under accounting rules, which required that the entity =
have outside equity equal to at least $11.5 million, or 3%, of its $383 mil=
lion in assets. Andersen has acknowledged that it reviewed Chewco in 1997 a=
nd found that two small limited liability companies, known as Big River Fun=
ding and Little River Funding, had put in enough outside equity to meet tha=
t requirement. Mr. Kopper, besides his connection to Chewco, also shows up =
as signatory for Big River and Little River on its bank-loan documents.=20
As it turned out, however, more than half the outside equity investment was=
 in effect guaranteed by the $6.6 million due from JEDI to Chewco being dep=
osited in accounts as collateral against bank loans, which Big River and Li=
ttle River had taken out to invest in Chewco. This collateral deposit meant=
 Chewco never had enough true outside equity to be treated as independent. =
Thus it should have been folded into Enron, along with JEDI, in 1997. Ander=
sen has said it wasn't told in 1997 about the collateral arrangement.=20
The 1997 memo talks of sending the $6.6 million to reserve accounts on beha=
lf of Little River and Big River. Yesterday, an Andersen spokesman said "th=
is is more confirmation of the fact that Enron didn't provide critical info=
rmation regarding Chewco to Andersen." An Enron spokesman declined to comme=
nt. One person familiar with the matter said that in 1997 Enron officials w=
ere telling bankers involved in the Chewco-related loans that Andersen had =
reviewed and approved of the now-suspect collateral transaction. The board =
report released over the weekend said that Andersen work papers indicated t=
hat the accounting firm had access to cash-flow records from JEDI including=
 the now-suspect $6.6 million distribution. However, the report added, it d=
idn't know if Andersen had done anything to trace the disbursements from JE=
DI.=20
And it still isn't known who at Enron or Andersen saw or had access to this=
 1997 memo over the past four years. If individuals knew about the arrangem=
ent and its potential financial impact on Enron, they could be guilty of vi=
olations of the law, says one federal investigator looking into the matter.=
=20
A Nov. 2, 2001, memorandum prepared by an Andersen official said that the a=
ccounting firm was called on Oct. 26 by an Enron official named Rodney Fald=
yn who "advised that he had learned that Chewco may not have the requisite =
equity" and asked about the possible accounting impact of that situation. T=
hat was the same day that The Wall Street Journal disclosed the existence o=
f Chewco and its connection to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Faldyn declined to comment y=
esterday.=20
Over the next several days, Enron and Andersen began reviewing Chewco, acco=
rding to the Andersen memo. On Nov. 2, Andersen received a set of Chewco-re=
lated documents from the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, which had =
just been hired to help Enron's board of directors do its investigation of =
the partnership arrangements. That investigative report, released over the =
weekend, was extremely critical of Chewco and similar partnerships as well =
as of top Enron officials.=20
The Dec. 30, 1997, memo was part of the Wilmer Cutler packet of documents, =
said the Andersen memo. It isn't clear where the law firm obtained the Chew=
co-related documents. William McLucas, the firm's lead attorney on the Enro=
n investigation, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.

Enron Report Could Bolster Criminal Case Probe: Panel's allegations of fina=
ncial subterfuge increase likelihood of indictment, legal experts say.

A report claiming that Enron Corp. executives used partnerships to enrich t=
hemselves and mask the company's troubled finances makes it increasingly li=
kely that prosecutors will bring criminal fraud charges, legal experts said=
 Monday.=20
The report, released late Saturday by a special committee of Enron board me=
mbers, said the partnerships appeared in some cases to be used for financia=
l subterfuge rather than for legitimate business purposes.
If investigators can show that Enron officials intentionally deceived inves=
tors, it would mark a significant new development in the case, according to=
 attorneys experienced in corporate fraud.=20
Enron executives would have a stronger defense had the report found that th=
ey simply made bad business decisions, attorneys said. Instead, the report =
charged that the now-infamous partnerships at the heart of Enron's collapse=
 often served no "bona fide economic" purpose.=20
"This report makes it more likely that there will be a criminal indictment,=
" said Christopher Bebel, a partner at Shepherd Smith & Bebel in Houston.=
=20
"It looks like the government's going to have an easier time establishing i=
ntent, because now we've learned additional details about the efforts at co=
ncealment of the truth as the scheme was unfolding," Bebel said. "And we're=
 learning about the extent to which members of top management profited."=20
The report detailed a culture of corporate mismanagement and inside dealing=
. It pointed the strongest criticism at Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former ch=
ief financial officer, saying that he and several subordinates reaped tens =
of millions of dollars in profit at the expense of the company and its shar=
eholders.=20
Fastow could not be reached for comment.=20
Some legal authorities cautioned that it was not certain criminal charges w=
ould be brought.=20
Though the report contains strident allegations, the three-member panel ack=
nowledged that it did not have the full picture. Some key people refused to=
 cooperate, and the panel lacked access to important documents.=20
Though the report appears to strengthen the government's hand in bringing p=
otential fraud charges, Enron executives still have a variety of defenses a=
vailable, some authorities said.=20
Enron executives could argue that the partnerships were created and run wit=
h the full backing of lawyers and others upon whom they relied for expert a=
dvice, said Ira Lee Sorkin, a New York defense attorney who previously was =
at both the U.S. attorney's office in New York and the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission.=20
Sorkin noted that as a defense, Enron executives could claim that lawyers, =
accountants and others signed off on the deals.=20
Still, many experts said the report contains clearly damaging information t=
hat lowers the hurdle to bringing a criminal case.=20
Simply put, the difference between a civil case and a criminal one is inten=
t, attorneys said. Prosecutors would have to prove that a defendant purpose=
ly broke the law as opposed to simply having acted "recklessly."=20
With Enron, prosecutors could argue that Fastow and others were making mill=
ions while manipulating the company's books, experts said.=20
"If the evidence is as strong as this report seems to make it, then I'd thi=
nk it's a pretty strong case," said Paul Fishman, a New York lawyer who han=
dles white-collar crime cases.=20
The report also hands the Justice Department extra ammunition with which to=
 pursue its case, Fishman and others said. One major strategy in the invest=
igation is to coax insiders to cooperate with information about the wrongdo=
ing of others.=20
The report may convince some people that it's better to cooperate before ot=
hers do and they lose offers of leniency.=20
"There may be enough in [the report] that it may scare the pants off someon=
e," Fishman said.=20
If the allegations in the report bear out, the government could charge frau=
d on several levels, said Brian O'Neill, a partner at O'Neill, Lysaght & Su=
n in Santa Monica.=20
If the company was shuffling its finances while borrowing money from financ=
ial institutions, that could be bank fraud, he said. If it used the mail or=
 electronic means to deceive investors, that could be mail or wire fraud.=
=20
The headline-garnering nature of the Enron debacle could itself increase th=
e likelihood of criminal charges being brought, said Henry Hu, a securities=
-law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.=20
"This case has so gripped the attention of the general public that the fail=
ure to bring a criminal prosecution, if the facts warrant it, could undermi=
ne confidence in the financial markets," Hu said. "The message it would sen=
d is that [criminal wrongdoing] doesn't matter: 'Even in an egregious situa=
tion, we won't prosecute criminally.'"

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: WALL STREET
Varied Roles Cause Some Conflicts, Brokers Say
By PATRICK McGEEHAN

02/05/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Investors may have been astonished to learn that the Enron Corporation allo=
wed its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, to wear two hats.=
 But Wall Street insiders could have shrugged and said, ''Is that all?''=20
On Wall Street, the biggest and most successful firms routinely play a vari=
ety of roles and simultaneously serve several, and often conflicting, inter=
ests. In some cases, the same firms that privately sold shares in the compl=
ex partnerships that Enron kept off its balance sheet also lent Enron money=
 and recommended Enron's stock and bonds to the public.
A report by a special committee of Enron's board found that the accounting =
for those partnerships -- some of which were run by Mr. Fastow while he was=
 chief financial officer -- was one cause of the company's collapse. Congre=
ssional investigators are asking whether the company's auditor, Arthur Ande=
rsen, was blinded to that conflict by the consulting fees Enron was paying =
it.=20
While the large accounting firms rush to eliminate their apparent conflicts=
, executives on Wall Street are standing behind the securities laws that ha=
ve perpetuated theirs. Unless Congress or securities regulators tell them o=
therwise, the big securities firms intend to continue raising money for cor=
porations by selling stocks, bonds and shares in partnerships to the full s=
pectrum of investors, from the most sophisticated millionaires to the novic=
es.=20
''There are inherent conflicts of interest in this business,'' said James W=
iggins, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest broke=
rage firm. ''It's a question of how you manage them.''=20
Like many major firms on Wall Street, Merrill helped to finance Enron's rap=
id rise. The firm managed sales of the company's bonds, lined up buyers for=
 one big partnership run by Mr. Fastow and even collected a fee for advisin=
g another company on its purchase of a utility that Enron sold.=20
At times, including last fall, Merrill's stock research department advised =
brokerage customers to buy Enron's stock. Donato J. Eassey, an analyst who =
followed Enron for Merrill until December, was recommending the stock after=
 Merrill successfully sold $349 million of shares in LJM2, a partnership cr=
eated by Enron executives, through a private offering. Several Merrill inve=
stment bankers, including Thomas Davis, now a vice chairman of the firm, bo=
ught shares of that partnership for themselves, though their interest was n=
ot disclosed to Merrill's customers. So far, they have recovered slightly m=
ore than 90 percent of the money they invested, according to a person close=
 to the partnership.=20
There is no evidence that Merrill's investment bankers or executives ever c=
onsidered these various roles an unacceptable conflict of interest. To the =
contrary, Merrill's two top executives reassured the firm's employees last =
week about the firm's role in selling LJM2.=20
In an internal memorandum on Jan. 30, Merrill's chief executive, David H. K=
omansky, and its president, E. Stanley O'Neal, said: ''We placed it private=
ly with a limited number of qualified institutional and individual investor=
s who received full disclosure about its structure. Co-investment by Merril=
l Lynch and some of our qualified employees is common in these kinds of pla=
cements and does not represent a conflict of interest. Indeed, it directly =
aligns our interests with the sophisticated investors who join us in puttin=
g their capital at risk.''=20
If Merrill's bankers, as agents of Enron, gathered any information about En=
ron that was not available to the company's shareholders or bondholders, th=
ey would have been barred from sharing it, experts in securities law said. =
That information belongs to the client and is available to the investment b=
ankers under strict terms of confidentiality.=20
''Investment bankers are not going to blow the whistle on transactions bles=
sed by the company's lawyers and accountants,'' said Joseph McLaughlin, a p=
artner with the law firm of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood. ''You can't release=
 the information without the company's permission.''=20
If bankers learned something negative in preparing to manage a private plac=
ement for a public company, he said, ''what that calls for is a frank discu=
ssion with the company'' to encourage its executive to disclose the informa=
tion publicly.=20
But if the company chooses not to tell investors everything -- as Enron cle=
arly did not -- that arrangement can leave the securities firm in an awkwar=
d position. Its analysts and brokers may be promoting stocks that they woul=
d not like so much if they knew what some of their co-workers in the invest=
ment-banking department knew.=20
Securities firms long ago became comfortable with the potential for such co=
nflicts. They have been playing the dual roles of corporate underwriter and=
 financial adviser for decades.=20
''Conflicts of interest in the financial industry are as inevitable as deat=
h and taxes,'' said John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University.=
 ''You can't wholly purge them.''=20
The most likely moves to deal with those conflicts, Mr. Coffee and other ex=
perts said, will be to insulate analysts even more from their investment-ba=
nking counterparts. Rather than allowing the two sides to share more inform=
ation, regulators will probably try to limit the bankers' ability to influe=
nce the analysts' ratings and views on securities that their firms underwri=
te.=20
Beyond that, Wall Street executives are likely to resist calls for change. =
It is an industry with codes of conduct that do not prevent an investment b=
ank from representing both the buyer and the seller in a merger. ''It's tak=
en an incredible perfect storm to force the auditing industry to change,'' =
Mr. Coffee said. ''I don't think we're going to see Wall Street fundamental=
ly change how it behaves.''

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Lawsuits may widen to hit partners=
hips SPECIAL-PURPOSE VEHICLES.
By JOSHUA CHAFFIN, STEPHEN FIDLER and ANDREW HILL.

Plaintiffs in suits against Enron directors and advisers are examining whet=
her to widen their case for compensation to include investors who backed th=
e energy trader's off-balance-sheet partnerships.=20
People involved in some of the class-action suits on behalf of employees an=
d investors in Enron say a damning special report to the Enron board may pr=
ovide ammunition for a wider case against the banks, funds and individuals =
that funded the special-purpose vehicles.
The report, published at the weekend, analyses in detail many of the deals =
Enron conducted with the partnerships. It concludes that many "had little e=
conomic substance" and were carried out simply to flatter the Enron account=
s.=20
Limited partners in the special-purpose vehicles took on little risk and re=
ceived disproportionately large returns, according to the report.=20
The investigation by three Enron directors does not go into detail about ho=
w the partnerships were pitched to investors by Andrew Fastow, Enron's form=
er chief financial officer, and Michael Kopper, another Enron employee. But=
 other documents obtained by the Financial Times make clear that potential =
partners were aware of the inherent conflicts of interest.=20
Those documents - relating to LJM2 Co-Investment, one of the main partnersh=
ips - show the rapid deal making, high rates of return and the promise of a=
n inside track on Enron's strategy were all touted as attractions.=20
The internal report points out that in 20 transactions with Enron, "the LJM=
 partnerships rarely lost money ... even when they purchased assets that ap=
parently declined in value after the sale" and in spite of the fact that "e=
ach transaction theoretically involved a transfer of risk".=20
Among investors in LJM2, according to partnership documents, were funds or =
units run by Merrill Lynch (which also led the placement of stakes in LJM2)=
, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Dresdner Bank, Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse=
 First Boston, Wachovia and CIBC. GE Capital had a small stake, as did insu=
rers and individual investors.=20
"We invested $10m," Lehman said. "We did it not simply for the relationship=
, but because we thought it would be a good investment."=20
Lehman declined to comment on the possibility of a suit against partners in=
 LJM2, but one institution involved said it was more likely that partners w=
ould now sue Enron.=20
The special report details for the first time the involvement of CSFB and N=
ational Westminster Bank, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland, in LJM Cayman=
 (LJM1). Mr Fastow raised $7.5m from each of two limited partners ERNB and =
Campsie which, the report says, were associated with CSFB and NatWest respe=
ctively.=20
Some of those approached by Mr Fastow were intrigued by the high returns pr=
omised, but eventually deterred by the fact that the chief financial office=
r and other Enron employees were running the vehicles. Calpers, the Califor=
nian pension fund that invested in other Enron-backed entities, turned down=
 LJM2 for those reasons, according to a Los Angeles Times report.=20
One private equity investor said he knew Mr Fastow's presence guaranteed "a=
n edge". But this was also disconcerting because of the apparent conflict o=
f interest.=20
"If these are legitimate deals, then why does Enron need Andy? Why not a th=
ird party?" he had wondered.=20
When the investor raised these concerns with Mr Fastow, the Enron executive=
 replied that the board had approved, and so there was no problem. The inve=
stor declined to join the partnership. "The whole team were Enron guys. The=
re was not one of them who was a member of the partnership. There was somet=
hing unusual about that," he said.=20
Eli Gottesdiener, head of a Washington law firm involved in one suit agains=
t Enron and Andersen, its former auditor, declined to say whether limited p=
artners would now be sued. But he said employees' and shareholders' lawyers=
 would probably "use the report to assist them in casting the net as widely=
 as possible".=20
Among the most egregious transactions involving partnerships was one relate=
d to an entity called Jedi.=20
The internal report confirmed that for much of the 1990s, Enron was reporti=
ng as income gains appreciation in its own shares. From 1993 to the first q=
uarter of 2000, Enron reported as income gains the appreciation of 12m Enro=
n shares contained in Jedi, which it controlled jointly with Chewco, an ent=
ity formed by Mr Kopper.=20
Workpapers from Andersen indicated that Enron recorded $126m in Enron stock=
 appreciation in the first quarter of 2000, but in the third quarter of tha=
t year this practice ended.=20
In the first quarter of 2001, Enron did not record its share of the loss in=
 value of Enron shares held by Jedi - amounting to some $90m.=20
Enron accountants said they were told by Andersen that since gains were not=
 being recorded as income, losses should not be either. "We do not understa=
nd the basis on which Enron recorded increases in value of Enron stock held=
 by Jedi in 2000 and prior years, and are unable to reconcile that with adv=
ice apparently provided by Andersen in 2001 concerning not recording decrea=
ses," the report said.=20

Enron workers' benefits reportedly raided=20
$15 million allegedly spent elsewhere=20
By KRISTEN MACK=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Feb. 5, 2002, 12:43AM
A former senior accountant at Enron told CBS News that the company took at =
least $15 million from legally protected worker-benefits accounts and spent=
 it elsewhere.=20
During an interview aired on CBS-TV's Evening News Monday, Robin Hosea said=
 that immediately after joining Enron as a benefits specialist in 2000 she =
noticed the money was being spent in other departments.=20
"The money that comes out of benefits accounts that is not directly to pay =
for employee benefits is illegal," Hosea said. "It was a large amount of mo=
ney and also a large number of items."=20
The Chronicle was unable to reach Hosea Monday night.=20
She said her records showed unexplained payments totaling almost $15 millio=
n by the end of 2000, part of which went to monthly payments to outside con=
sultants.=20
Last May, Hosea said she questioned her superiors about the payments and wa=
s told "that it was a payment to friends of executives and to leave it," sh=
e told CBS.=20
That summer, Hosea took disability for knee surgery.=20
Days before Enron declared bankruptcy, Hosea told CBS that she contacted fe=
deral officials at the Department of Labor about her concerns.=20
Since then, Hosea said, an Enron supervisor has told her to keep quiet. She=
 also said she gets regular phone threats.=20
Hosea was laid off from Enron in December.=20
"Those sound like serious allegations," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer.=
=20
Monday night, Palmer said there was no way of checking the truth of her cla=
ims.=20
"If the Department of Labor is looking into this, we should wait until thei=
r investigation is complete to find out what the facts are," Palmer said.=

Enron Witness Points to Lay; Lawmakers Told of 'Fundamental Default of Lead=

Enron Corp.'s collapse was the result of a "a systemic and pervasive attemp=
t" to inflate profits and hide losses, not of a few rogue employees breakin=
g company rules, a member of Enron's board of directors told a House panel =
yesterday.=20
The testimony from William C. Powers Jr., dean of the University of Texas L=
aw School and an author of a scathing report about the energy trading compa=
ny released over the weekend, will make it even more difficult for Enron's =
former leaders to deflect blame for the company's stunning collapse to lowe=
r-level employees or its auditor, Arthur Andersen.
"What we found was appalling," said Powers, chairman of the Enron board's s=
pecial investigative committee. "And there was a fundamental default of lea=
dership and management. Leadership and management begin at the top, with th=
e CEO, Ken Lay."=20
Powers testified before a House Financial Services subcommittee after Lay b=
acked out of a pledge to appear before a Senate panel yesterday. Lay then r=
esigned from Enron's board, closing out his involvement in a company he hel=
ped to form in 1986.=20
Lay changed his mind because of "inflammatory language" surrounding the cas=
e and his perception "the hearing will be prosecutorial," his attorney said=
. Lay resigned as chief executive late last month under pressure from the c=
ompany's creditors.=20
The Powers report concluded that Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey K. =
Skilling were largely responsible for a "fundamentally flawed" decision to =
let Andrew S. Fastow, the company's chief financial officer at the time, se=
t up and run Enron-funded partnerships that made him tens of millions of do=
llars and allowed Enron to hide huge losses and debts. Enron finally was fo=
rced to disclose those losses in mid-October, sparking a crisis of confiden=
ce among investors, lenders and customers that sent what was the nation's s=
eventh-largest corporation spiraling into bankruptcy court within seven wee=
ks.=20
Fastow received at least $30 million from running partnerships -- a fact th=
at was never reported to shareholders. One of his colleagues, Michael J. Ko=
pper, got at least $10 million from an initial investment of $125,000. Othe=
rs received up to $1 million or more for doing virtually nothing, Powers sa=
id.=20
In other testimony, Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission, told the House panel he cannot guarantee that other "Enrons" -=
- companies with massive accounting irregularities -- won't emerge. "It is =
my hope there are not other "Enrons out there," Pitt told lawmakers. "But I=
'm not willing to rely on hope."=20
Within hours after Lay's testimony was to have begun, leaders of the Senate=
 Commerce Committee and its subcommittee on consumer affairs said they inte=
nd to subpoena Lay to testify next Tuesday. Committee Chairman Ernest F. Ho=
llings (D-S.C.) said the full committee would meet today to vote on authori=
zing the subpoena.=20
Hollings also said the Justice Department should appoint an outside special=
 prosecutor to handle the case because Enron was a major contributor to Pre=
sident Bush's campaign and had ties to an array of administration officials=
. He cited, among other things, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft's decisio=
n to recuse himself because of Enron campaign contributions.=20
The Justice Department released a statement saying it "sees no reason to ap=
point a special counsel to investigate the Enron matter" because "no confli=
ct of interest exists."=20
In the House, Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the subcommittee t=
hat heard testimony yesterday, said the panel also would seek authority to =
subpoena Lay. "Those who chose to ignore their responsibilities and enrich =
themselves while bringing harm to others shall have no safe harbor," he sai=
d in a statement that opened a hearing about Enron yesterday afternoon.=20
Baker later said Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, told him Lay would invoke th=
e Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify if subpoenaed. But Baker said he ex=
pected to submit written questions to Lay, through his attorneys.=20
"Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or crim=
inal conduct," Silbert told the panel.=20
Powers declined to answer some of the House subcommittee's questions, inclu=
ding those asking him to speculate about criminal wrongdoing or the need fo=
r a special prosecutor. He used his appearance to underscore the damning fi=
ndings of the Enron board's three-month investigation of the company's use =
of partnerships.=20
He described incorrect accounting in deals from the third quarter of 2000 t=
o the third quarter of last year that were hidden from the public.=20
"As a result of these transactions, Enron improperly inflated its reported =
earnings for a 15-month period . . . by more than $1 billion," he said. "Th=
is means that more than 70 percent of Enron's reported earnings for this pe=
riod were not real."=20
The company misused its stock to "hedge" losses from investments, he said. =
Normally, hedging involves getting an outsider to take on the risk of a dea=
l, for a fee. If an investment loses value, that outsider loses.=20
But Powers said Enron "was essentially hedging with itself" by promising in=
vestors in the Raptor partnerships that they would receive Enron stock if t=
he assets in the partnerships fell in value. That depended on Enron's stock=
 continuing to climb in value. When the asset values and Enron's stock both=
 fell, the Raptor partnerships could not meet their obligations. "This is p=
recisely what happened in late 2000 and early 2001," Powers said, but Enron=
 hid the problem and "gave the false impression that Raptors had enough mon=
ey to pay Enron what they owed," he said.=20
"Let me say that while there are questions about who understood what, conce=
rning many of these very complex transactions, there's no question that vir=
tually everyone, from the board of directors on down, understood the compan=
y was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock," he said.=
 "This is not the way it is supposed to work."=20
He told the lawmakers, "Whenever this many things go wrong it is not just t=
he act of one or two people."=20
Pitt, in his testimony, repeated his call for a new regulatory body to gove=
rn the accounting profession and stressed the need to modernize financial d=
isclosure rules and corporate accounting systems. And he lamented the impac=
t of Enron's fall on regular people who trusted the company, such as employ=
ees who lost most or all of their 401(k) retirement savings because they we=
re heavily invested in Enron stock.=20
"It is these Americans whose faith fuels our markets, who have no lobby and=
 no trade associations, whose interests are, and must be, paramount," he sa=
id. "I am appalled at what happened to them as a result of Enron's collapse=
."=20
Pitt said the SEC would work with Congress to determine which areas of refo=
rm could be addressed by rules and which would require legislative action. =
He did not outright reject several suggestions, including a mandated term l=
imit for audit firms, that the accounting profession vehemently opposed whi=
le he represented it as a lawyer in private practice.=20
He also pledged to review how audit firms are paid and said the SEC was wor=
king with lawmakers to address concerns related to conflicts of interest am=
ong securities analysts, many of whom were urging investors to buy or hold =
Enron stock until just before it sought bankruptcy protection.=20
Key figures in the creation of the partnerships have been invited before Co=
ngress on Thursday, but not all of them will actually testify.=20
Fastow's attorney has said he will appear before the House Energy and Comme=
rce Committee, but aides there said he is expected to exercise his Fifth Am=
endment right against self-incrimination. Kopper has been subpoenaed but ha=
s informed the committee he will refuse on Fifth Amendment grounds.=20
But an attorney for Skilling reiterated yesterday that Skilling will testif=
y as scheduled. Skilling also was criticized in the Powers report, which de=
scribed him as a man who prided himself on total involvement in management =
oversight but who appeared to have little or no oversight of the partnershi=
ps.=20
Former Enron treasurer Jeffrey McMahon, now the company's president, is exp=
ected to testify. He complained about the partnership structure to Skilling=
, warning of serious conflicts of interest, according to the report. An Enr=
on lawyer who raised questions about the partnerships, Jordan Mintz, is als=
o planning to testify, according to his attorneys.=20
Arthur Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino previously testified th=
at Enron officials committed "possible illegal acts" by not disclosing that=
 a partnership that caused huge losses lacked enough non-Enron investment t=
o be separated from Enron's financial statements.=20
Powers said Andersen initially cooperated in his investigation but pulled o=
ut after Enron fired it last month, citing Andersen's admission that employ=
ees in its Houston office had destroyed large numbers of documents related =
to the Enron audit.=20
Andersen announced over the weekend that it had hired former Federal Reserv=
e chairman Paul A. Volcker to lead a sweeping review of its business practi=
ces. Dean McMann, who heads a Houston-based accounting consulting firm, sai=
d that suggested to him that the firm's problems may be greater than previo=
usly realized.=20
"They had to hire a watchdog to watch over a watchdog," he said.=20
In federal bankruptcy court, meanwhile, a number of creditors filed objecti=
ons to a motion submitted in by Enron last month that would authorize certa=
in Enron insurance carriers to make payments to lawyers representing curren=
t and former Enron officials in lawsuits and government investigations.=20
The officials include Skilling. An attorney for Skilling submitted a statem=
ent supporting the Enron request.=20
The objecting creditors included the Florida State Board of Administration,=
 which in its filing called Enron's request for an initial $30 million to p=
ay advance expenses and legal fees "another effort on Enron's part to prote=
ct the wrongdoers who caused billions of dollars of losses . . . and to pro=
vide them with further financial benefits."=20

Last Halloween, amid revelations of accounting misdeeds at Enron Corp., Wil=
liam C. Powers Jr. called a friend with some unexpected news.=20
Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, had agreed to join the =
troubled energy company's board of directors -- and to lead a probe into it=
s byzantine financial dealings.
"I asked him, 'Why would you want to jump on a sinking ship?' " recalled Ri=
chard Hogan, a Houston lawyer.=20
Indeed, many wondered. Texas newspapers questioned his ties to Enron -- the=
 law school had raised $250,000 from Enron and Enron's general counsel was =
on the board of the law school.=20
Yet in just three months the relatively unknown academic, with little backg=
round in securities law, oversaw the production of a withering report on th=
e management practices at Enron and the actions of its auditor, Arthur Ande=
rsen.=20
The extraordinary 218-page report detailed questionable financial partnersh=
ips and activities that are providing a blueprint for more than a dozen con=
gressional and executive branch investigations.=20
Powers testified at a hearing yesterday before a subcommittee of the House =
Financial Services Committee. In the wake of former Enron chief executive K=
enneth L. Lay's refusal to testify, Powers became an unlikely star witness,=
 sitting solemnly in a rumpled dark-blue suit, with sandy hair brushed acro=
ss his forehead.=20
His testimony was as blunt as the report. "What we found was absolutely app=
alling," Powers said.=20
And he spared no one, not even the board that had asked him to make the stu=
dy, presumably in the hopes of salvaging the company's reputation. "Within =
Enron, the checks and balances simply broke down. The oversight broke down =
at the board level, at the senior management level and in the finance depar=
tment," he told lawmakers.=20
Powers, 55, declined comment through a spokeswoman. But interviews with fri=
ends and colleagues say his handling of the investigation reflected his ble=
nd of low-key intelligence and earthy pragmatism.=20
"He's an extraordinarily quick study," said Steven Goode, an associate dean=
 at the Texas law school and a friend of Powers's since they joined the fac=
ulty in 1977. "He grasps things more quickly and more deeply than anyone I =
know."=20
Goode, who shares a motorboat with Powers and Powers's wife, Kim Heilbrun, =
a real estate lawyer, said Powers has a razor-sharp and curious mind. Books=
helves in the modern Austin home where Powers lives with his wife and three=
 of his five children are filled with audiotapes from the Learning Co. on s=
ubjects including American literature, the New Testament and physics.=20
Despite 23 years of teaching at the law school in Austin and two as its dea=
n and chief fundraiser, Powers has not developed a national reputation outs=
ide of the law school community and the relatively small group of lawyers w=
ho focus on reforming product-liability laws. Powers has written dozens of =
articles and several textbooks on the subject.=20
"He's not a pretentious person," said Houston lawyer and multimillionaire J=
oe Jamail, a member of the Texas law school's board of trustees and a lawye=
r representing Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins. "He just does not get out=
 and beat his own chest."=20
Friends say Powers has been working 100-hour weeks to balance the duties of=
 the Enron probe with that of running a law school. Raymond Troubh, a New Y=
ork financial consultant who serves on the three-member Enron investigating=
 committee, said the group worked long hours, with conference calls stretch=
ing until midnight and beyond.=20
Staffers from the Washington law firm Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering and the ac=
counting giant Deloitte & Touche did much of the hands-on work. But the thr=
ee-member committee, which also includes Herbert Winokur, head of a private=
 investment firm, played a large part in guiding, rewriting and revising th=
e Enron report, Troubh said.=20
Although Powers has been teaching full time for two decades -- earning a di=
stinguished-teaching award from the university -- he has maintained an acti=
ve legal practice, arguing before the Texas Supreme Court and the 5th U.S. =
Circuit Court of Appeals.=20
Powers colleagues say that although he lacks a background in derivatives, h=
e does have a reputation for being able to sort through confusing corporate=
 dealings. For instance, he was hired by workers to cut through the complex=
 structure of an oil company after an explosion at a refinery in Corpus Chr=
isti, Tex., left some severely burned.=20
The firm, Coastal Corp., maintains that the factory is owned by a subsidiar=
y, Coastal Refining & Marketing Inc., and that Coastal Corp. has no legal r=
esponsibility to pay the $120 million awarded by a court. The case is on ap=
peal.=20
"Bill was able to help us pierce through the corporate structure to get to =
the real guts of what's going on," said Hogan, the Houston lawyer whose fir=
m employs Powers as a consultant. "He's very good at taking a snapshot of t=
hings from 30,000 feet up and seeing things clearly."=20
Powers earned a degree in chemistry from the University of California at Be=
rkeley in 1967, then joined the Navy and served for three years in the Pers=
ian Gulf. He then attended Harvard University's law school, where he edited=
 the law review.=20
By one account, Powers came to the attention of Enron through Harry Reasone=
r, the managing partner of Vinson & Elkins and a trustee on the University =
of Texas Law School Foundation.=20
Enron general counsel James Derrick served on the law school foundation's b=
oard of directors and on the alumni association board. Derrick resigned fro=
m the two boards after Powers joined Enron's board. Because the law school =
received contributions from Enron and Vinson & Elkins, Powers has been crit=
icized in recent weeks for agreeing to head the probe.=20
The jabs, including an editorial in the Austin American-Statesman that reco=
mmended Powers step down in favor of a more independent evaluator, have tak=
en their toll.=20
"All of the innuendos are quite embarrassing to him," said Troubh. "I didn'=
t see one iota of partiality in one direction or another. He was a determin=
ed, impartial chairman."=20
Longtime friend Goode said Powers was most upset that the "unfair personal =
attacks" came in the days before Powers released his report, which conclude=
d that Enron executives failed to oversee key partnerships and covered up $=
1 billion in losses in 12 months.=20
The Feb. 2 report also had harsh words for Vinson & Elkins, the auditing fi=
rm Arthur Andersen and Enron's board of directors, saying they failed to mo=
nitor self-dealing among company executives.=20
"The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting e=
rrors were the result of failures at many levels and by many people," the r=
eport said. "Our review indicates that many of those consequences could and=
 should have been avoided."=20

LONDON -- Efforts to salvage value from the wreckage of Enron Corp.'s overs=
eas interests are showing signs of progress.=20
A shortlist of bidders has been drawn up for Wessex Water, a utility in sou=
thwest England that is one of the largest international assets of the faile=
d energy-trading company. People familiar with the situation say the list i=
ncludes Italian energy company Enel SpA; Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holding=
s Ltd. of Hong Kong; and a consortium composed of General Electric Co.'s GE=
 Capital arm, Royal Bank of Scotland and Abbey National PLC.
The sale is expected to take another six to eight weeks to complete. A pers=
on familiar with the bidding said Wessex is likely to fetch more than GBP 1=
 billion ($1.4 billion).=20
Spokesmen for GE Capital, Royal Bank of Scotland, Abbey National and Enel d=
eclined to comment. A spokesman for Cheung Kong wasn't immediately availabl=
e for comment.=20
Separately, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm appointed last year=
 as administrator of Enron's European arm, expects to raise $500 million to=
 $750 million through other transactions, including asset sales and complet=
ion of futures trades. That money would go toward the claims of thousands o=
f creditors and trading partners of Enron Europe and its units, said Tony L=
omas, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London. Enron Europe owes abou=
t $1 billion to its parent, Enron Corp., and Enron Europe's obligations to =
other parties are likely to total more than $1 billion, Mr. Lomas said.=20
Enron Corp. bought Wessex in 1998 to be the cornerstone of a new global wat=
er division, called Azurix. Enron's plan at the time was to transform the g=
lobal water industry in the same way it revolutionized natural-gas markets,=
 by taking advantage of deregulation to squeeze inefficiencies out of utili=
ties formerly managed by governments. But the strategy didn't work out as p=
lanned, at least partly because of Enron's failure to create a successful o=
nline marketplace to trade water.=20
Even so, Wessex Water is considered one of the best-run utilities in Britai=
n and one of only a handful of sizable water assets up for grabs anywhere i=
n the world. "If you are looking to make an entry into the global water mar=
ket, then the U.K. is one of the few parts of the world where you can do th=
at on a meaningful scale," said Andrew Wright, an analyst at UBS Warburg in=
 London. The sale has been complicated, however, by strict regulatory const=
raints that prevent companies from owning, or holding a stake in, more than=
 one U.K. water company. While more than a dozen potential bidders expresse=
d interest in Wessex, many of these dropped out at an early stage.=20
Even if a sale is completed, it would require the approval of British regul=
ators.=20
At least one of the bidders on the shortlist, the GE Capital-led consortium=
, has made an offer that would involve refinancing the water company with d=
ebt, which would then be paid off by revenue, say people familiar with the =
situation. This so-called securitization technique has been used frequently=
 in the past to acquire assets with stable cash flows.=20
Enel's interest in Wessex suggests an about-face for the Italian-government=
-controlled company, which last year pulled out of a race to acquire Britai=
n's Southern Water. Analysts believe Enel is pursuing Wessex as part of a b=
roader push to diversify out of its core electricity operations and into ot=
her utility sectors. Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, an infrastructure=
 company controlled by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, is believed to be=
 seeking a foothold in the European market.=20
Separately, PricewaterhouseCoopers has scheduled a series of meetings in Lo=
ndon next week with creditors of Enron Europe and its subsidiaries.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE ENRON COLLAPSE - Enron Direct pay-outs decided.
By MATTHEW JONES.

02/05/2002

(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Administrators for Enron Europe have determined approximate payment levels =
for creditors of Enron Direct, the first business to be sold after the US p=
arent group's collapse in December last year.=20
PwC, the administrators, said between 55p and 73p in the pound would be pai=
d back to creditors, depending on the tax liability of the company, a small=
 energy retailer sold in December to Centrica of the UK.
Enron Direct's total debts are #132m ( $188m), of which #105m is owed to an=
other Enron subsidiary. The largest external creditors are listed as Univer=
sal Utilities, owed #2.5m, Western Power Distribution, owed #2m, and Scotti=
sh and Southern Energy, owed #1.3m.=20
Creditors of Enron Direct are likely to receive among the highest payments =
of Enron's creditors, because it was a relatively straight-forward business=
 with some assets.=20
Other businesses, such as Enron Power Operations Limited, a company with 4,=
000 creditors that set up services contracts for other Enron units, are exp=
ected to recoup less of their losses.=20
PwC sent preliminary reports on five Enron subsidiaries to thousands of cre=
ditors over the weekend. The complexity of deals within the trading and ser=
vices businesses, which represent the bulk of Enron Europe's debts, mean it=
 will be months before their creditors know the full extent of liabilities.=
=20
Tony Lomas of PwC said trading staff were still working through 250,000 ind=
ividual trades with about 1,000 counterparties. Those contracts "in the mon=
ey" would realise at least $150m, but losses were expected to be many times=
 greater.=20
Overall, administrators estimate they will realise $500m to $750m of value,=
 but this will be swamped by "many billions of dollars" of debts. Creditors=
 include most of the financial institutions operating in the City of London=
, the worst exposed of which include JP Morgan Chase, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubi=
shi and Aegon, the Dutch insurer.=20
The first creditors' meetings for the European businesses will be held next=
 week in London. Enron Direct creditors will meet administrators on Tuesday=
, while those of four other trading and services companies will meet on Fri=
day.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: ACCOUNTING
Ernst & Young Latest Auditor Moving to Alter Some Practices
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

02/05/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The accounting firm Ernst & Young announced yesterday that it would stop se=
lling information technology services to companies it audits and that it wo=
uld no longer serve as internal accountant and external auditor at the same=
 company.=20
The move by Ernst & Young comes as several competitors are announcing new l=
imits on the range of services they will provide to a client. On Sunday, Ar=
thur Andersen, the accounting firm that audited the Enron Corporation, anno=
unced that it was creating a special oversight board with broad powers to c=
hange how the firm does business. KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers both anno=
unced last week that they would support similar changes.
Ernst & Young's announcement leaves Deloitte & Touche as the only Big Five =
accounting firm standing by the practice of providing consulting services t=
o companies it audits.=20
In a statement last week, Deloitte acknowledged that its policy was perceiv=
ed as a problem by investors, but said, ''The public interest would be serv=
ed by lowering the level of hyperbole in the debate and carefully consideri=
ng potential unintended consequences of any proposed reforms.''=20
James S. Turley, Ernst & Young's chief executive, said in a conference call=
 with reporters yesterday that it was important for the large accounting fi=
rms to adopt clear positions on the question of which services auditors can=
 provide to clients. Investors, regulators and lawmakers have been calling =
for a review of the many services accounting firms provide since the collap=
se of Enron and its filing for bankruptcy protection. Enron's auditor, Arth=
ur Andersen, provided both consulting and audit services and also served at=
 times as an internal and external auditor.=20
''It's obviously a challenging time for the profession,'' Mr. Turley said. =
''Over the last few weeks it became very clear to me that several of us nee=
ded to stake out positions and just get on with things, relative to the sco=
pe of services.''=20
Mr. Turley said he favored the creation of an independent disciplinary orga=
nization unrelated to the accounting industry's trade association, a propos=
al similar to one made last month by the chairman of the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission, Harvey L. Pitt. But he also suggested that regulators cre=
ate a crisis-response team that would react to situations like Enron's bank=
ruptcy filing by recommending rapid changes to accounting standards.=20
Mr. Turley said that providing consulting services to companies audited by =
Ernst & Young did not in fact create conflicts of interest and that a prohi=
bition against doing so would probably not prevent an Enron-style implosion=
.=20
Rather, he said the public perception of a conflict had to be addressed. In=
 any event, he said, giving up technology consulting would not be a serious=
 hardship because the firm sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini, a Eu=
ropean consulting firm, in 2000.=20
Ernst & Young will, however, feel the effects of no longer serving as both =
internal and external accountants for its clients, Mr. Turley said. From 20=
 to 25 clients receive both services, and the internal audit work generates=
 several hundred million dollars a year for the accounting firm.=20
Ernst & Young would not disclose exactly how much it earns from clients whe=
re it is both internal and external auditor. The firm could lose some clien=
ts when it changes its policies, but it could just as easily pick up client=
s from other accounting firms making similar changes. Not to take such step=
s might keep the accounting industry from recovering its credibility, Mr. T=
urley warned. That in turn could cause it to lose its best people.=20
''The profession could become one where existing professionals don't want t=
o stay in it,'' he said, and students would not want to work as accountants=
.=20
The same concerns are behind an e-mail message sent yesterday by James G. C=
astellano, chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountan=
ts, to members of that organization.=20
Mr. Castellano wrote that ''Enron's collapse has eroded our most important =
asset: public confidence,'' and reported that the association's board had a=
pproved a resolution supporting measures similar to those adopted by Ernst =
& Young, Andersen and others.=20
Mr. Castellano also advised the group's members that in the next few weeks =
the association would take out advertisements in national publications to t=
ry to restore confidence in the accounting profession and attract recruits.=
=20
''The profession's heightened visibility,'' Mr. Castellano wrote, ''makes t=
his an opportune time to convey our messages regarding its viability, dynam=
ism and high standards.''

Dynegy charges Enron has only itself to blame=20
By BILL MURPHY=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Feb. 4, 2002, 9:33PM
Enron has only itself to blame for going bankrupt after Dynegy called off a=
 proposed merger in December, Dynegy's lawyer said Monday.=20
Enron is suing for $10 billion, saying Dynegy's failure to live up to the d=
eal, signed Nov. 9, caused it to go bankrupt.=20
"Enron planted the seeds of its death spiral years before it turned to Dyne=
gy seeking a bailout," said Dynegy's response, filed Monday in New York ban=
kruptcy court.=20
At a news conference in Houston, Daryl Bristow, Dynegy's lawyer, said the d=
eal specifically allowed Dynegy to back out if it learned that key informat=
ion on which it was based was incorrect.=20
After about 10 days of research, Bristow said, Dynegy learned Enron had bee=
n concealing debt in off-the-book accounts and had been grossly misleading =
about profits and liquidity. When it told Enron it would back out, he said =
Enron responded by cutting its asking price in half.=20
Dynegy called off the deal Nov. 28 after determining there was no way to sa=
ve Enron, Bristow said.=20
"Everyone knew there had been a major and a disastrous financial change," B=
ristow said. "Enron brought this on its own head. Dynegy only tried to salv=
age the situation."=20
Bristow repeatedly cited the report of an Enron internal investigation, rel=
eased Saturday, that assailed the company's executives, auditors, lawyers a=
nd board members for letting improperly created partnerships inflate compan=
y profits, conceal its debt and wrongfully enrich several insiders.=20
During negotiations, Enron informed Dynegy its core energy-trading business=
 was sound, but Bristow said Enron had suffered a massive cash drain in the=
 week after the merger was announced.=20
Enron paid more than $1 billion to cover margin calls -- a demand that it r=
epay money borrowed to buy stocks -- in its trading unit.=20
Bristow said Dynegy will argue that the Enron suit should be transferred fr=
om the New York City court to federal district court in Houston.=20
Dynegy alleges Enron engaged in fraud, but it did not file a countersuit be=
cause Enron has no assets, Bristow said.=20
Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lawyer, said, "If they are afraid to assert the=
 fraud claim (in a countersuit), you have to wonder how good their defense =
is."=20
He said he has not read Dynegy's court filing and could not discuss it in d=
etail.=20

WASHINGTON -- Laid-off Enron Corp. workers, who traveled to Washington in h=
opes of confronting Ken Lay, said they were angry Monday that their former =
chairman backed out of his promise to testify before Congress.=20
"He should have been here. He should have said something," said Gwen Gray, =
who worked in Enron's human resources department for three years before the=
 company filed for bankruptcy last year. "He knows what's going on. He coul=
d explain a lot of things that we don't know the answers to now because he =
didn't show up."=20
Lay, who resigned as the Houston company's top executive last month and fro=
m the company's board Monday, had been scheduled to testify before the Sena=
te Commerce and House Financial Services committees, the first of several h=
earings on Capitol Hill this week looking into Enron's collapse.=20
On Sunday, Lay abruptly reversed course and said he would not testify.=20
The decision came one day after University of Texas Law School Dean William=
 Powers released his report on the company's activities.=20
Powers, who testified before the House panel Monday, said his investigation=
 found that Enron's management attempted to misrepresent the company's fina=
ncial condition.=20
In his written testimony, Powers said there was a default of leadership and=
 management that began at the top and included Lay.=20
Enron, once the world's largest energy trader, filed the country's largest =
bankruptcy on Dec. 2 after admitting it overstated its profits by hundreds =
of millions of dollars since 1997. In addition to at least 10 congressional=
 inquiries and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, th=
e Labor Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron and =
its executives face a federal criminal probe and several class-action lawsu=
its filed by employees and stockholders.=20
The company's former employees say they were misled about its finances and =
were briefly kept from selling Enron stock from their 401(k) retirement pla=
ns last fall as the price was falling. Now, they want their money back.=20
In letters to congressional committees, Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, said =
his client rejects allegations that he did anything wrong as his company sp=
iraled toward bankruptcy. But Silbert said he advised his client against te=
stifying after coming to the conclusion that lawmakers had already made up =
their minds and would not give Lay a fair hearing.=20
The Senate committee plans to vote today on whether to subpoena Lay; the Ho=
use panel also is considering a subpoena.=20
The small group of former workers, accompanied by the Rev. Jesse Jackson an=
d members of his Rainbow/PUSH organization, met with lawmakers, urging them=
 to pass legislation to help workers recover money lost from their retireme=
nt plans. Several laid-off workers sat in on the House panel's hearing.=20
Debbie Perrotta, a Kingwood resident who was a senior administrative assist=
ant at Enron for five years, said she was not surprised that Lay changed hi=
s mind about testifying.=20
Perrotta, scheduled to testify today before the Senate Governmental Affairs=
 Committee, said she held out little hope of confronting Lay about Enron's =
collapse. If she ever gets the chance, she said she will ask:=20
"Why the deceit? Why the lies? And if you knew there was something going on=
, that we were losing money, why did you continue to take bonuses?"=20
Perrotta said she also lost her family's health insurance and about $40,000=
 in Enron stock in her 401(k).=20
In her testimony today, she said, she'll try to explain to lawmakers why th=
e employees put trust in the company.=20
"We loved Enron," she said. "Enron was a great company."=20
The workers had hoped to sit behind Lay in the hearing rooms so that when T=
V cameras recorded his testimony, they also would show former employees.=20
"We need to see him face to face, and let him look at our faces," Perrotta =
said. "He needs to know how many lives they've destroyed."=20

MANAGING YOUR CAREER
Saving Your Career After Earning a Name As a Whistle-Blower
By Joann S. Lublin

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ENRON EXECUTIVE Sherron Watkins never intended to become a whistle-blower b=
y helping expose the practices that triggered her company's financial colla=
pse.=20
When Jeffrey Skilling, president of the Houston energy concern, abruptly qu=
it in August, Enron officials set up a special letter-collection box so emp=
loyees could anonymously vent their worries. Ms. Watkins, vice president fo=
r corporate development, wrote an unsigned, one-page note to then-Chairman =
Kenneth Lay. "Has Enron become a risky place to work?" her letter asked, af=
ter questioning its irregular accounting methods.
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scand=
als," she continued. "My eight years of Enron will be worth nothing on my r=
esume."=20
Nothing may be further from the truth. Ms. Watkins's subsequent experience =
suggests that whistle-blowing need not blow your career. Informers about wo=
rkplace misdeeds can minimize career damage if they enjoy a strong reputati=
on for honesty, management experts and former whistle-blowers say.=20
Ms. Watkins, 42 years old, has been lauded for her courage since a House co=
mmittee investigating Enron released an expanded version of her letter last=
 month. Her reluctant internal disclosure "is going to be terrific for her =
career. It shows profound integrity and discretion," says Hal Reiter, CEO o=
f New York recruiters Herbert Mines Associates.=20

THOUGH MANY whistle-blowers get forced out after going public, Enron's mess=
 offers Ms. Watkins some job security. Even so, blowing the whistle within =
Enron "wasn't an easy thing to do," says Philip Hilder, a Houston attorney =
representing Ms. Watkins and speaking on her behalf.=20
Shortly after writing the letter, Ms. Watkins accepted a colleague's sugges=
tion to divulge her identity and meet with Mr. Lay, where she detailed her =
concerns. That session prompted the company to invite a law firm's investig=
ation. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.=20
Why didn't Ms. Watkins protect co-workers by alerting the SEC, asks Jeffrey=
 Wigand. He is the research executive who blew the whistle on alleged wrong=
doing by his former employer, Brown & Williamson Tobacco. He became an educ=
ator at one-tenth his former $300,000 salary. Keeping complaints in-house "=
minimizes your career damage . . . as well as minimizes your integrity," he=
 believes.=20
Ms. Watkins didn't contact securities regulators because she was challengin=
g accounting practices approved by Enron lawyers and accountants, Mr. Hilde=
r replies.=20
Jerry Giordano understands the dilemma. In 1981, the then 37-year-old marke=
ting director caused an internal ruckus but didn't inform authorities when =
he found what he says were unlawful pricing practices at a small West Coast=
 industrial-products manufacturer. To make old products appear new, he says=
, the maker repackaged them, falsified engineering specifications and order=
ed him to pitch them before salespeople. An ex-Federal Trade Commission off=
icial advised him the small business wouldn't likely be prosecuted.=20
Mr. Giordano confided his dilemma to a friend he had worked for at a defens=
e contractor. The former boss had commended his integrity when he exposed h=
idden cost overruns at their former company. Both left for other jobs. "He =
created a job for me" at his new employer, he says.=20
Good thing. Before he could resign, he was fired for sending a memo to coll=
eagues about the company's packaging practices that concluded "being indict=
ed looks bad on your resume." Mr. Giordano, now the 58-year-old CEO of Crit=
erium-Mooney Engineers, civil-engineering consultants in Portland, Maine, w=
ould gladly hire Ms. Watkins. "She did the right thing by going to the top,=
" he says.=20
At the moment, Mr. Hilder says, Ms. Watkins isn't thinking about whether he=
r internal whistleblowing might harm her career. "If the time ever comes wh=
en she needs to seek employment, she will rest on her abilities," the attor=
ney insists.=20

BARBARA PROVUS, a principal of Chicago recruiters Shepherd Bueschel & Provu=
s, is skeptical. "Very few companies really want a corporate conscience," s=
he says.=20
Renwick T. Nelson learned that lesson after exposing allegedly deceptive li=
fe-insurance sales practices at Prudential Financial. He gave a sworn anony=
mous statement to Florida's attorney general in 1996 before he switched job=
s at Prudential, from top marketing-practices officer to a $300,000-a-year =
post as a compliance officer. But he was fired in March 1997, according to =
his Dec. 5 testimony in a Miami federal court case stemming from the allega=
tions.=20
Following his dismissal, Mr. Nelson sent out numerous resumes -- and never =
got any interviews. He has a hunch why. "Senior management in the corporate=
 world seems to think they are owed complete loyalty and whistle-blowing in=
dicates that you may be loyal to something else," he says.=20
Since July 2000, the 57-year-old has been a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in T=
onga, happily teaching business writing on the South Pacific island. What c=
areer guidance would he offer Ms. Watkins? "She will feel isolated and vili=
fied, but ultimately she will know that what she did was right. Nothing can=
 diminish that knowledge."=20

"The trouble with Enron," said Baldwin, an investigative reporter, "is that=

HOUSTON -- We have tears, we have penthouse apartments, we have a surfboard=
 from Nevis and a couple of kegs. We have shredded documents and a funky ar=
t exhibit and a U.S. congressman talking about sending folks to the pokey. =
There has been a suicide by a former top executive. Some of the other execu=
tives are in hiding, perhaps because a female executive with a memo has the=
m pretty much terrified. Not to mention that damning report released by the=
ir own board of directors over the weekend.=20
We even have Jesse, Johnnie and Al.
Oh, and a bunch of chuck wagons coming to town.=20
Welcome to Houston, post-Enron, where the city known for both its diverse a=
rray of strip clubs and its top-notch rodeo is now best known for one parti=
cular company with a tilted "E" logo. A logo that folks around here -- who =
still manage to have a sense of humor about all this -- have taken to calli=
ng the "crooked E."=20
Just in the past week, Jesse Jackson has hit town and compared former Enron=
 chairman Kenneth Lay to Job. Al Sharpton showed up to promote Johnnie Coch=
ran's lawsuit at a town meeting. And Linda Lay cried while talking to Lisa =
Myers on the "Today" show, prompting Houstonians who have heard about the L=
ays' numerous properties -- including a penthouse apartment in the best par=
t of town -- to write angry letters to the Houston Chronicle.=20
These days, the enclosed skyway that connects Enron's gleaming, reflective-=
glass building at 1400 Smith St. to its parking garage has been nicknamed "=
The Bridge of Sighs." Television reporters and print journalists stalk the =
garage, desperate for information about the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. hist=
ory.=20
Those traders still employed by Enron "celebrated" the day the company's st=
ock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by bringing in a keg. Onc=
e used to free-flowing champagne and ski weekends in Beaver Creek or getawa=
ys to Hawaii, they just thought it was the appropriate thing to do. Across =
the street, in a building that used to serve in part as an Enron annex, ex-=
employees shuffle into a federally funded employment assistance office, onl=
y to find Enron's now-infamous company posters ("respect" reads one, "integ=
rity" another) still hanging on the walls.=20
Behind the building, a passerby stops and points as a truck bearing the log=
o "Shredco" -- the company Enron hired to shred its documents -- is waved i=
nto the delivery bay more than a week after Enron came under fire for docum=
ent shredding.=20
Houston -- the fifth-largest city in the country -- has taken its share of =
grief. There is the shirt-soaking humidity, of course, and the bad air qual=
ity. Men's Fitness magazine has named it America's "fattest city" two years=
 in a row.=20
But don't treat the place too badly, because there's also lots to love. The=
re was always NASA to be proud of, and some pretty fine restaurants, and a =
couple of basketball teams (the Rockets and the Comets) that have won a few=
 championships. There's the annual rodeo -- biggest and best in the world, =
Houstonians like to say. The regular folks, like the ones who lost their En=
ron-invested pensions, are some of the nicest you'll find anywhere.=20
Hey, even the Astrodome, once one of baseball's ugliest stadiums, has been =
replaced with a new ballpark that is helping revitalize Houston's downtown.=
 Nowadays, though, some local residents hope the team will change the name.=
=20
After all, the ballpark is called Enron Field.=20
In tony River Oaks, you'll find multimillion-dollar mansions, Houston's mos=
t exclusive country club and bags of old, old, old money.=20
And a little new money, like the stuff that Lay -- and several other Enron =
executives -- made off stock deals.=20
The apartment where the Lays still live in Houston is in a building called =
the Huntingdon, the city's poshest building, at the intersection of Kirby a=
nd San Felipe. On this particular late-January morning, the Houston Chronic=
le's op-ed page is filled with letters from angry individuals who watched L=
inda Lay give that interview on "Today," during which she defended her husb=
and, and cried, and tried to explain to the masses that her family is suffe=
ring, too. She talked about personal bankruptcy, and putting three of the f=
amily's four Aspen properties on the market.=20
It didn't help, though, that Mrs. Lay gave her interview in the living room=
 of one of her luxurious Houston homes. Or that the apartment she and her h=
usband own is worth $7.1 million, encompasses nearly 13,000 square feet and=
 has 6 1/2 bathrooms.=20
"Linda Lay says they have lost everything except their home," A.M. Shelton =

ilies. Cry for them, Linda, not for yourself."=20
And where are those people?=20
Well, some of them are across the street from Enron's headquarters trying t=
o find a new job.=20
"Respect and integrity -- I'm okay with that," says Linda Walker, looking u=
p at the Enron poster hanging over her desk at the employment office. "We j=
ust need to get some black paper to cover up that 'E.' "=20
Until the day the bankrupt company laid off more than 4,000 employees -- a =
day those employees now call "Black Monday" -- Walker worked for Enron Ener=
gy Services in its executive offices.=20
"I was an executive assistant under Lou Pai," she says.=20
From across the desk, JoAnn Matson interrupts her.=20
"Don't say that name, Lou Pai!" she says, making a face.=20
"The truth will set me free!" Walker hollers, then she pauses, frowns.=20
"And where is Lou Pai, anyway?"=20
Lou Pai is now known as the Enron executive who made the most -- $353 milli=
on over the past three years -- on sales of Enron stock. And Walker and Mat=
son, along with Joyce Barrett, a third former Enron employee, are working t=
emporary jobs at the WorkSource office at 3 Allen Center. This particular s=
pace used to be home to offices in Enron's engineering and construction div=
isions. Now it holds a training center for workshops, a computer center whe=
re the out-of-work can refine re{acute}sume{acute}s and research corporatio=
ns, and private offices for interviews.=20
Barrett was once in charge of Enron's amusingly named "redeployment office"=
 -- which is where the company sent employees it had just fired.=20
"I gave them the good news after the bad news," she explains.=20
The good news was the terms of their settlement, and an assignment to tempo=
rary office space where they had a phone, a desk and a computer while they =
looked for new employment, often ending up in another division of the compa=
ny.=20
When Barrett was let go, though, there was no severance, no redeployment, n=
o good news.=20
"I left before they could tell me," says Walker, who lost her entire 401(k)=
 and would have been eligible for $60,000 in severance under non-bankruptcy=
 circumstances. "I left at about 9:30, and I was crying so hard I could har=
dly drive."=20
These days, Walker sees many of her former colleagues, and many of the peop=
le who had been in the redeployment program at the time of the bankruptcy f=
iling, come into the WorkSource office. They always seem surprised, she say=
s, to see her there. They thought that she, at least, would have been one o=
f the lucky ones. One of the ones who remained employed.=20
"What they don't understand," she says, "is that when they went away, I wen=
t away. Without them, there was no need for me."=20
These days, Barrett is trying to bring in recruiters to interview potential=
 employees at WorkSource. And trying -- with the help of Walker and Matson =
-- to keep her sense of humor.=20
"I know that we had several floors of this building," Walker says, when ask=
ed how many Enron offices used to be housed at 3 Allen. Then she stops.=20
"Listen to me, saying we!" she says, raising her voice. "Let me start over.=
 I know that they had. . . ."=20
Matson interrupts.=20
"That's right," she says. "Look, you have to remember, we're divorced now."=
=20
And the three women chuckle at the thought.=20
The Enron Code of Ethics was a product of a trip to the toilet. There is, D=
rew Crispin admits, a bit of symmetry to that.=20
This is the lobby of 3 Allen Center, down the bank of elevators from the Wo=
rkSource office. Here, Crispin runs a coffee stand called the Coffee Bar II=
, which used to be visited by Enron employees. Not any longer. Almost no on=
e from Enron works in this building anymore.=20
To honor their memories, though, Crispin -- with a big assist from several =
ex-Enron employees -- has put up a makeshift art exhibit on the walls of hi=
s stand.=20
"Enron: A Term of Art (1995-2001)" is the exhibit's name, and its contents =
are all meticulously labeled, with placards just like the ones found in man=
y galleries.=20
There is, for example, the surfboard one employee received on a company jun=
ket to the Caribbean island of Nevis. ("On loan from the private collection=
 of Mark Courtney," the label reads). The item is called "Hang 10 K." There=
 is a bolt placed on red velvet and covered with glass -- a memento given t=
o staffers when Enron completed a $2.6 billion deal involving the Houston P=
ipe Line Co. Its official title? "Bolt Before Screwed." Then there is the p=
lastic dome containing shredded money, aptly labeled "Not a Shred of Eviden=
ce."=20
"A bunch of people who used to work at Enron were sitting around one night,=
 drinking beers and talking about how all these little mementos were the on=
ly things they have left from Enron," Crispin says, "so they decided to do =
something about it."=20
The Code of Ethics, Crispin's personal contribution, was discovered in a bo=
x by the elevators right after Black Monday. Crispin had gone up to an Enro=
n floor ("it has the closest public bathroom," he explains), and he peeked =
into a cardboard box left by the elevators -- a box full of unemployment in=
formation and job-seeking advice that Enron left out for the people it had =
let go. The book was on top of the pile.=20
Crispin named it "Res Ipsa Loquitur." As in, the thing speaks for itself.=
=20
Bring on the Dixie Chicks, the chuck wagons, the trail riders and ZZ Top.=
=20
It's time for the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and, people hope,=
 some sense of normalcy to arrive in this town.=20
That is, if you consider massive traffic tie-ups as Fords and Hondas negoti=
ate their way around cowboys on horseback (and, occasionally, the stuff the=
 animals leave behind) on all of Houston's major freeways to be normal.=20
The trail riders -- hundreds of them -- began their journeys to Houston as =
long as two weeks ago, and they are expected to converge upon Memorial Park=
 on Friday, in time for "Go Texan" weekend and Saturday's big parade. Some =
left from Louisiana, another group from Mexico, most from spots scattered a=
round Texas.=20
Meanwhile, out near Reliant Park -- named for the other major energy compan=
y in Houston -- tents are going up in the parking lots that separate the Re=
liant Astrodome from Reliant Stadium (still under construction, it will ope=
n with the debut of the NFL Houston Texans next fall) and Reliant Arena and=
 Reliant Hall. Forklifts are taking livestock pens out of storage. The stag=
e is being prepared for a blockbuster lineup of concerts, featuring the lik=
es of Destiny's Child and Bob Dylan.=20
"To try and explain the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo to people in anoth=
er part of the world is hard," says Leroy Shaffer, an assistant general man=
ager of the massive production. "We're every bit as important to Houston as=
 Mardi Gras is to New Orleans or the Rose Bowl is to Southern California."=
=20
Many major Houston corporations sponsor the show, which is entirely nonprof=
it -- all the proceeds go to charity, specifically education programs. Reli=
ant Energy and Continental Airlines, for example, are sponsors. Enron was n=
ot. The company had a luxury box reserved, but with a five-year waiting lis=
t for boxes, it was immediately resold.=20
"Our show won't be impacted at all," Shaffer says.=20
The events span nearly three weeks, starting with the barbecue competition,=
 which begins Thursday. The Dixie Chicks open the concert series next Tuesd=
ay. The cowboys swing into action the same day.=20
More than a million visitors are expected.=20
After all, this is Texas, and nothing can stop a good Texas rodeo.=20
"Does it have a sharp edge or round edge?"=20
It is "power hour" at the Enron Boys & Girls Club -- all the children are r=
equired to spend the first hour after school in the learning center, gettin=
g help with their homework. A little girl with thick brown hair and a purpl=
e T-shirt is trying to learn her shapes -- spheres vs. cones, pentagons vs.=
 triangles -- with the help of Blanca Martin, the education director.=20
The children gather around circular tables, some with math problems, some w=
ith science homework, many desperate for assistance because their parents c=
annot speak or read English, and they barely know the language themselves.=
=20
Elmo and Cookie Monster and Big Bird sit on a shelf at one end of the room,=
 next to a row of brightly colored storybooks. On the opposite wall, an Enr=
on logo hangs above a map of the United States, and between a row of circus=
 elephants decorated with numbers 1 through 14.=20
This center, located in Houston's struggling second ward, east of downtown,=
 opened Nov. 29, three days before Enron declared bankruptcy. The building =
was renovated by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Houston out of its capit=
al development fund, with the understanding that Enron would pay operating =
costs for 10 years -- to the tune of $2.4 million.=20
Less than a month after Enron collapsed, having made just one payment, for =
$60,000, to the center that bears its name, local businessman Michael Holth=
ouse quietly agreed to cover the deficit. Holthouse, a member of the Boys &=
 Girls Club board, is a philanthropist with his own foundation (the Holthou=
se Foundation for Kids) and he has long been a big supporter of the organiz=
ation.=20
"We were one of the fortunate ones here," says John Havard, the president o=
f the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Houston. "It only took us three or four=
 weeks to make up for what we had lost."=20
Still, the "crooked E" remains on most of the walls of the building, and th=
e sign proclaiming the building "Enron Boys & Girls Club of Greater Houston=
" remains on display outside. The logo is on the scoreboard in the gymnasiu=
m, over the computers in the technical center, above the glass doors that m=
ark the main entrance.=20
There is a second dedication planned for Feb. 6. At 3 p.m. the club will re=
move all the Enron logos from the building and take down the outside sign. =
They will be replaced with ones bearing the insignia of Holthouse's foundat=
ion, an expense Holthouse is footing. Already the Enron logo that once grac=
ed the center of the basketball court has been sanded away. "The Holthouse =
Foundation for Kids" was painted in its place. During the transition, the c=
enter of the court was blocked off by cones, and the kids were unhappily co=
nfined to playing half-court ball.=20
The rest of the signs, though, are coming down with ceremony.=20
"You'd be amazed at how many people want to come," says Amber Pressley, the=
 director of public relations and marketing. "It seems everyone has an inte=
rest in seeing those logos come down."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: MEMORABILIA
A Debacle Chronicled in Kitsch
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Feb. 3 -- This city, already rich in museums and art galleries, go=
t a new minigallery last week: an exhibit of commemorative plaques, T-shirt=
s and expensive gewgaws from the Enron Corporation.=20
At a coffee bar.
In a building occupied largely by Enron.=20
''Enron: A Term of Art (1995-2000)'' is drawn from the collections of curre=
nt and former employees of what was formerly one of the word's most admired=
 companies. And anyone who says the age of irony is over has missed the pos=
t-Enron age.=20
The names given to each objet d'kitsch provide wry commentary: a bovine sta=
tuette is titled ''A Bunch of Bull'' and a framed copy of the 2000 annual r=
eport is entitled ''It Takes Skill(ing?) to Decipher.''=20
Particularly striking is a ''deal toy'' commemorating a transaction involvi=
ng the company's paper trading business. It is a small dome filled with shr=
edded money and entitled ''Not a Shred of Evidence.''=20
The objects show the company's almost fetishistic affection for trinkets, t=
oys and plaques. There is a large bolt on a wooden base, issued after a $2.=
6 billion pipeline deal in 2001, and a voodoo figure distributed at a 1999 =
Enron legal conference in New Orleans.=20
An Enron T-shirt parodies the company's ever-changing organizational charts=
, with the title ''Enron's Formula for Success,'' and boxes labeled ''Lots =
of Boxes,'' ''Lots of Arrows,'' ''Lots of Luck'' and ''Structure and Lots o=
f $$.''=20
The idea for the exhibit arose among current and former employees of the co=
mpany who met regularly at a local watering hole, said Drew Crispin, owner =
of the Coffee Bar in 3 Allen Center. The group was laughing about the fact =
that many Enron objects had appeared on eBay and were fetching high prices,=
 and jokes began to fly about what a ''museum of bankruptcy'' might look li=
ke.=20
After they scrounged through their closets and garages for a few days, the =
parody art exhibit was born. ''It was like the old Mickey Rooney movies -- =
let's put on a show!'' Mr. Crispin said. Most visitors are amused, though o=
ne older gentleman ''said 'harrumph' and walked away,'' he said. Many custo=
mers go back into the Enron offices and return with friends.=20
Mr. Crispin, who is an Enron shareholder, said this was not his first foray=
 into social commentary. ''I did it back in the 60's,'' he said, ''but I do=
n't remember much of that.''

Decoding Enron

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

As the evidence of financial abuses at Enron grows, the more it looks as th=
ough the company was an intricate Ponzi scheme designed to enrich top execu=
tives and defraud stockholders. That, at least, is the impression left by a=
 scalding examination of the company's operations prepared by a special com=
mittee of Enron's board of directors. The report, issued over the weekend, =
suggests that rather than being a thriving corporation brought down by acco=
unting shenanigans, Enron at its core may have been a corporate mirage crea=
ted to deceive the public while enriching insiders. Enron's leadership come=
s across as having been more concerned with managing the stock price, and p=
rofiting from it, than with running a real company.=20
The report reviews the dealings between Enron and scores of partnerships se=
t up by company officers. Ostensibly meant to hedge the risk associated wit=
h some of the company's investments, these partnerships really served to ta=
ke debt off Enron's balance sheet, inflate the company's earnings and enlar=
ge the bank accounts of the executives who created them.
The partnership transactions ''served no apparent business purpose for Enro=
n,'' the report says. They did, however, enable Enron to improperly claim $=
1 billion in profits in the year before the company's implosion, and genera=
ted bountiful but illegitimate revenues for those involved, particularly An=
drew Fastow, the chief financial officer at the time. Top Enron officers ma=
de even more money during that period by unloading stock that they were goi=
ng to such lengths to inflate.=20
The report strongly suggests that crimes were committed, though it stops sh=
ort of making concrete allegations of securities fraud. The Justice Departm=
ent and the Securities and Exchange Commission will determine in the days a=
head whether prosecution is warranted. Given the complexity of Enron's fina=
ncial manipulations, and growing signs on Wall Street that widespread accou=
nting abuses may be eroding investor confidence, the White House and Congre=
ss should consider providing prosecutors with additional resources to inves=
tigate such cases. Securities fraud cases are hard to prove, and there is a=
lways a temptation to settle for assessing civil fines. Federal prosecutors=
 must pursue the Enron case vigorously.=20
The possibility of criminal prosecutions does not absolve Congress and fede=
ral regulators of their duty to reform the overall financial system. Regard=
less of whether crimes are ultimately proven, Enron's conduct already provi=
des a primer on how current financial disclosure rules and accounting stand=
ards fail to protect investors adequately. No one should be lulled into bel=
ieving that this was simply a case of sound rules being broken.=20
Kenneth Lay, the former chairman of Enron, passed up an opportunity to shed=
 more light on the case when he called off a planned appearance yesterday b=
efore the Senate Commerce Committee. The cancellation followed his wife's t=
elevised assurances last week that her husband had done nothing wrong and w=
as eager to set the record straight. The committee will vote today on wheth=
er to issue a subpoena to force his appearance, as it should. He and his fe=
llow Enron executives have a lot of explaining to do.

Editorial
Enron's Culture of Corruption

02/05/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL
A14
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

THE WEEKEND'S revelations about Enron make it tempting to see the scandal a=
s an epitaph for the 1990s bubble. The firm seems to have assembled the var=
ious strains of hubris found in different corners of the country: the techn=
ological vanity of Silicon Valley mixed with the financial alchemy of Wall =
Street, the influence-peddling of Washington fused with the ten-gallon bras=
hness of Texas. Not content with earning hundreds of thousands of dollars, =
Enron's senior executives cooked the books so that they could pocket millio=
ns. Not content with having created a wonderful new market in energy deriva=
tives, they lied and cheated to create an illusion of impossibly fast earni=
ngs growth. Contemplating Enron's self-destructive arrogance, Sen. Byron Do=
rgan has spoken quite accurately of "a culture of corporate corruption."=20
In time, historians may indeed choose Enron as a kind of symbol of the 1990=
s, much as Michael Milken's junk-bond empire has come to stand for the exce=
sses of the preceding decade. But for now the cultural dynamics of the scan=
dal ought not be the focus in Washington. The architects of Enron's corrupt=
ion will be punished in due course by the justice system, and there's nothi=
ng to be gained by spinning a broader morality tale that might amplify the =
anti-corporate rhetoric of the globalization protests. The right focus for =
Congress and the administration is to fix the rules that allowed Enron's cu=
lture to evolve in the first place.
That means, first and foremost, fixing the audit system. The report on Enro=
n released over the weekend pointed the finger at three groups of people --=
 the managers and board members as well as the accountants -- but it is the=
 third group whose behavior is most reformable. Capitalism works on the ass=
umption that managers will do all they can to boost profits, much as footba=
ll assumes players' aggression. Up to a point, company boards can impose di=
scipline on managers, but directors who meet only infrequently can no more =
be relied upon to spot foul play than a ref without line judges. This is wh=
y the key constraint must come from auditors. These are the experts who get=
 paid millions of dollars to certify that corporate accounts are accurate.=
=20
The Enron story shows how badly auditors neglect this mission. According to=
 the weekend's report, few managers at the company knew the extent of Enron=
's phony bookkeeping; the board, while knowingly approving some dangerous t=
ransactions, was also partly in the dark. But Arthur Andersen, the auditor,=
 knew all about the off-balance-sheet partnerships because it had been paid=
 $5.7 million for advice about them; it must also have known about the illu=
sory profits created by the advance booking of estimated future earnings, b=
ecause it signed off on those accounts. In 2000 alone, Andersen's experts w=
ere paid $25 million to understand Enron's finances. But because of the loo=
seness of the laws that define auditors' responsibilities, they did not fee=
l obliged to share their insights with the ordinary investors whom they are=
 meant to serve. If this scandalous laxity had not existed, the hubris of E=
nron's managers would not have mattered. A culture of corruption cannot dev=
elop if tough watchdogs are in place.
