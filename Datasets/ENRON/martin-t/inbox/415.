Ok .. the latest and greatest on the cell phones.  Basically, no new news.  Will keep you posted, though.

No word yet on when the phones will get terminated.....As for the rates, they are going to essentially remain the same, even for terminated employees, as in they will still get bonus minutes.  The 10% off, however, for the corporate phones will not be there.
Do you want me to fax you a rate sheet?

Hi, Alysia.  Do you know when (or maybe approximately when) the cancellation of the corporate phones will take place?  Also, just to make sure I understand correctly, are the corporate rates the same as the personal rates?
 
Thanks!!
Laura
