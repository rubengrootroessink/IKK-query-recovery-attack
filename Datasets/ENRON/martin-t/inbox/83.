Lawyers agree on order to safeguard documents=20

Jan. 23, 2002, 12:35AM
Attorneys for Enron shareholders agreed late Tuesday on a proposed restrain=
ing order to safeguard financial documents and investigate their destructio=
n by employees of the company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
Also on Tuesday, FBI agents began an initial investigation into claims that=
 as recently as Monday Enron employees were still shredding documents.=20
More than a dozen lawyers representing scores of plaintiffs hammered out th=
e agreement after being told earlier in the day by U.S. District Judge Meli=
nda Harmon to draft a temporary restraining order they could agree on.=20
The lawyers will submit the order to Arthur Andersen this morning for revie=
w. Harmon will make her decision today.=20
The proposed order calls for plaintiffs' attorneys to have full access to a=
ll Enron-related documents at Andersen offices or some centralized location=
.=20
The attorneys also want Harmon to allow them to expedite the discovery proc=
ess and depose, among others, Enron Chairman Ken Lay and Andersen's lead au=
ditor for the Enron account, David Duncan, who was fired last week after sh=
redding of documents at the company's Houston office became public.=20
"Arthur Andersen tells us unilaterally what's going on and we won't allow t=
hat to stand," said Bill Lerach, an attorney for Amalgamated Bank, a plaint=
iff in the suit against Enron officials.=20
The attorneys had filed various motions with Harmon, seeking, among other t=
hings, the assignment of U.S. marshals to protect documents at Enron and An=
dersen, establishing a court-supervised repository for all documents, and a=
llowing computer specialists to try to retrieve deleted electronic data.=20
During Tuesday's hearing, Lerach told Harmon that former Enron executive Ma=
ureen Castaneda had said she saw documents being shredded as recently as la=
st week, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that be=
gan in October.=20
Lerach said Castaneda is only one of a handful of former Enron employees wi=
th similar accounts of document shredding and other information.=20
"There is no question (Enron) destroyed documents," Lerach said while stand=
ing near a box brimming with shredded paper Castaneda gave him.=20
"These people began shredding when they knew regulators would soon be comin=
g after them."=20
New York-based Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that lost $17 million=
 in Enron stock. In its lawsuit, Amalgamated alleges that 29 Enron executiv=
es and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock over three years know=
ing that the stock was overvalued.=20
Enron attorney Ken Marks said in court that once the allegations about the =
shredding surfaced, company officials went to the finance department to inv=
estigate and found shredded paper in a trash bin. Authorities were then con=
tacted, including the SEC, Justice Department and FBI.=20
Marks said Enron officials are unsure what documents were destroyed and tha=
t there may be an "innocent" explanation for the shredding.=20
"People may have gotten rid of duplicates," Marks said. "We are treating th=
is matter with the utmost seriousness."=20
Marks said during Tuesday morning's hearing that FBI agents already had sec=
ured the two finance department floors at Enron's downtown office.=20
But FBI spokesman Bob Doguim said that two agents arrived at the building o=
nly late Tuesday and had not been sent there at Enron's request.=20
"We're conducting a logical preliminary investigation," Doguim said.=20
In a statement, Enron officials announced that after the shredding allegati=
ons surfaced, immediate steps were taken to preserve the "site where the al=
leged document destruction took place" and that Enron would cooperate fully=
 with federal investigators.=20
Andersen officials admitted recently that documents were shredded after the=
 SEC began its investigation. Last week, Andersen said, it fired Duncan in =
the wake of disclosures that he had ordered the destruction of thousands of=
 documents.=20
Andersen's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said at Tuesday's hearing that the firm =
promptly "self-reported" the shredding.=20
Hardin assured Harmon that the "shredding is over" at Andersen and that the=
 firm could be trusted to preserve Enron documents.=20
Hardin also said Andersen has begun to collect laptops, Palm Pilots, 3,000 =
backup computer tapes of existing documents and other materials relevant to=
 the Enron case.=20
Hardin also questioned the timing of Lerach's public announcement about pap=
ers being shredded at Enron just hours before Harmon was to make her ruling=
.=20
Lerach responded that the publicity had forced Enron's subsequent cooperati=
on with investigators.=20

WASHINGTON -- Problems with two Arthur Andersen witnesses in the unfolding =
probe of Enron Corp. forced congressional investigators to issue subpoenas =
Tuesday night for a hearing on the destruction of evidence.=20
The House Energy and Commerce Committee subpoenaed Andersen CEO Joseph Bera=
rdino, fired auditor David Duncan, attorney Nancy Temple and risk manager M=
ichael Odom.=20
While the demands for testimony from Temple and Odom are regarded as "frien=
dly," Berardino and Duncan are throwing up roadblocks, said committee spoke=
sman Ken Johnson.=20
"Mr. Duncan's attorneys have indicated he will in all likelihood invoke his=
 Fifth Amendment constitutional right" against self-incrimination, Johnson =
said.=20
A wave of congressional hearings into the collapse of Enron start Thursday =
with testimony on document destruction scheduled by the oversight and inves=
tigations subcommittee of the Energy Committee.=20
Andersen fired Duncan last week, saying he orchestrated the destruction of =
thousands of documents after learning the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n was investigating Enron's books. Duncan has since been cooperating behind=
 the scenes with congressional investigators.=20
Johnson said House officials regard it as inconsistent for Duncan to provid=
e detailed information to the committee while refusing to testify publicly.=
=20
"There are many things he told the committee that we believe he can repeat =
under oath without incriminating himself, and we expect him to do so," John=
son said.=20
Robert Giuffra, Duncan's attorney in New York, said no decision has been ma=
de regarding Duncan's testimony.=20
"We have not received a subpoena and we have not made a final decision on w=
hether he will testify," Giuffra said.=20
If Duncan refuses to testify, Johnson said remedies under consideration by =
the committee include charging him with contempt of Congress, the penalty f=
or which can be a year in jail and a $10,000 fine.=20
Berardino, meanwhile, also is expected to testify Thursday, but Andersen of=
ficials have told the committee he wants to postpone.=20
"Andersen has offered to provide the committee with the witness in a week o=
r so, and that is not acceptable to us," Johnson said. "Mr. Berardino found=
 time to appear on Meet the Press last weekend, and we believe he should be=
 obliged to appear before Congress as well."=20
Berardino, who has been at the forefront of defending the Chicago-based Big=
 Five accounting firm's conduct in the Enron matter, made an appearance on =
the Sunday talk show.=20
Patrick Dorton, spokesman for Andersen, said Berardino wants to cooperate w=
ith the committee.=20
"We have directly told the committee we are willing to testify; it's only a=
 question of when," Dorton said.=20
The subpoenas follow a long weekend of back-and-forth between the committee=
 and its would-be witnesses, and signal a heightening of tension as the inv=
estigation progresses.=20
Temple, Andersen's in-house counsel and author of an ambiguous Oct. 12 memo=
 on the company's document-retention policy, is expected to cooperate with =
the committee summons, Johnson said.=20
Odom, Andersen's risk management partner in Houston who was the recipient o=
f Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail, also is considered a friendly witness.=20
"They both have agreed to testify before the committee and cooperate with i=
nvestigators," Johnson said. "Obviously they have certain client confidenti=
ality concerns, and compelling them to testify provides them with some cove=
r from any possible civil litigation by Enron."=20
Duncan, Temple and Odom are central figures in the probe of document destru=
ction relating to Andersen's work on behalf of Enron.=20
Duncan, who was Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, is accused by=
 his former employer of ordering a massive destruction of documents beginni=
ng Oct. 23, after learning the SEC was investigating Enron's books.=20
Duncan, who has said through his attorneys that he followed company policy =
and did nothing wrong, was fired by Andersen Jan. 15 and began cooperating =
with congressional investigators the next day.=20
The shredding at Andersen stopped after Temple, an in-house lawyer for the =
firm in Chicago, wrote a memo telling employees to preserve documents.=20
Temple's instruction followed word on Nov. 9 that the SEC had subpoenaed An=
dersen -- weeks after the SEC opened its probe of Enron.=20
House investigators want to know whether Andersen's legal department intent=
ionally stalled on issuing the order to preserve documents until after thou=
sands of Enron papers and e-mails had been destroyed.=20
Weeks earlier, Temple sent Odom the e-mail referencing the firm's policy on=
 document destruction and retention.=20
Coming as it did days before Enron's calamitous Oct. 16 third-quarter earni=
ngs report, thee-mail has been the focus of zealous scrutiny by House and S=
enate investigators tracking Andersen's destruction of evidence.=20
"Mike -- It might be useful to consider reminding the engagement team of ou=
r documentation and retention policy," Temple wrote in the Oct. 12 memo. "I=
t will be helpful to make sure that we have complied with the policy."=20
Temple's e-mail included a link to the company's policy, which outlines whi=
ch sorts of documents should be destroyed and which retained.=20
Four days later, Enron reported a $638 million third-quarter loss and discl=
osed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
The devastating report was the start of Enron's stunning free fall, culmina=
ting in the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy on Dec. 2.=20
Andersen has acknowledged the apparent impropriety of its document shreddin=
g, but said Temple's e-mail was aimed at preserving evidence.=20
Odom, who is still employed by Andersen, was moved out of management duties=
 in Houston the day Duncan was fired.=20
While the destruction of documents is crucial to the probe into Enron's col=
lapse, the central issue is likely to be how involved Andersen management w=
as in creating a corporate structure that misled creditors and shareholders=
, experts and investigators said.=20
The House committee's investigation is one of 10 Enron-related probes under=
 way on Capitol Hill.=20
The SEC and Labor Department also are investigating, and the Justice Depart=
ment has opened a criminal probe.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron judge asks for a plan to stop shre=

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron judge asks for a plan to stop shre=
dding TRADER'S COLLAPSE ARTHUR ANDERSEN MUST AGREE WITH PLAINTIFFS TO HALT =
DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.=20
A US federal judge asked plaintiffs in a series of lawsuits against Enron t=
o agree to a plan by today with Arthur Andersen to end the shredding of Enr=
on-related documents by Enron's former accountant.
The plaintiffs, whose representatives filled two tables in the packed court=
room of US District Judge Melinda Harmon, had offered a variety of proposal=
s, some giving Andersen 20 days and some demanding the court take immediate=
 custody of the remaining documents.=20
Rusty Hardin, representing Arthur Andersen, said there could be up to 20m d=
ocuments involved. But plaintiffs were unsympathetic, noting the accounting=
 firm had admitted documents were destroyed, while four to five former Enro=
n employees have confirmed trash bags were routinely filled on the 19th flo=
or of the Enron building with shredded documents.=20
One of the employees, Maureen Raymond Castaneda, director of foreign exchan=
ge and sovereign risk, seized a cardboard box overflowing with shredded pap=
er when she was laid off last week, Paul Howes, of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hy=
nes & Lerach, told the Financial Times.=20
Enron has denied any knowledge of shredding and vowed strict action against=
 anyone involved, saying it had sent out four emails warning staff against =
destroying evidence. The company sealed off the site where the former emplo=
yees said the shredding had taken place since November.=20
Mark Palmer, Enron spokesman, said the company's lawyer, Bob Bennett, conta=
cted the Department of Justice yesterday and offered to co-operate in any i=
nvestigation. The department and the FBI immediately sent investigators to =
the Enron headquarters.=20
The plaintiffs pointed repeatedly at the box of shredded paper in making th=
eir case. "These are not five-year-old payroll records," said Bill Lerach o=
f Milberg, representing Enron shareholder Amalgamated Bank in the case. "Th=
ey contain the names of the illicit partnerships. These were current docume=
nts."=20
He said it was not enough to take the word of Enron and Arthur Andersen exe=
cutives that no further documents would be destroyed.=20
Neil Rothstein of Scott and Scott of Connecticut, which is representing the=
 Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund in the case against Enron, said: =
"This is criminal behaviour. This has to stop now, today. We have no idea w=
hether this is going on right this minute."=20

Plaintiffs in a series of lawsuits against Enron joined yesterday to ask a =
federal court judge to order an immediate end to the shredding of documents=
 by Enron and its former accountant Arthur Andersen, and to take custody of=
 remaining documents.=20
The plaintiffs noted that Andersen had admitted that documents were destroy=
ed, while several Enron employees confirmed trash bags were filled routinel=
y on floor 19 of Enron's building with shredded documents.
One former Enron employee brought a box of shreddings to the court. "These =
are not five-year-old payroll records," said Bill Lerach of Milberg Weiss B=
ershad Hynes & Lerach, representing Enron shareholder Amalgamated Bank in t=
he case. "They contain the names of the illicit partnerships. These were cu=
rrent documents."=20
The word of Enron and Andersen executives that no further documents would b=
e destroyed was inadequate, Mr Lerach said, particularly as Andersen had be=
en involved in similar cases, including that of Houston-based Waste Managem=
ent.=20
Andersen agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $7m in June l=
ast year without admitting or denying liability to settle SEC allegations o=
f audit fraud after Waste Management had made the largest profits restateme=
nt in US history. Andersen then agreed in November to pay a further $20m to=
 Waste Management shareholders for failing to uncover the problems.=20
Neil Rothstein of Scott & Scott of Connecticut, representing the Archdioces=
e of Milwaukee Supporting Fund against Enron, objected to the suggestion by=
 some plaintiffs that the companies be given 20 days to get records in orde=
r.=20
"This is criminal behaviour," he said pointing to the box of shreddings. "T=
his has to stop now."=20

BACK PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Shredding storm may leave Enron's defence in ta=
tters - Revelations raise questions about what group was trying to hide, sa=
ys Peter Spiegel.=20
It has become axiomatic in the world of US political and financial scandals=
 that it is not the original wrongdoing that brings down the powerful - it =
is the cover-up.
During Watergate, the measure by which all American scandals are judged, th=
e break-in at Democratic party headquarters by a handful of amateur burglar=
s would not have led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. It was his e=
ffort to conceal the burglars' ties to his campaign that forced him out of =
office.=20
Similarly, in the past week the escalating Enron controversy has shifted fr=
om a complicated inquiry into possibly improper use of accounting principle=
s, to an examination of document-shredding at both Enron and its Andersen a=
uditors - and what they were trying to hide.=20
Enron said yesterday that the question had already become the subject of a =
Federal Bureau of Investigation probe. Following accusations by aformer emp=
loyee that Enron officials were destroying records, the company's lawyers y=
esterday asked the Justice Department to send in FBI agents to find out wha=
t happened.=20
On Capitol Hill, the shredding has also turned perceptions of Enron. Once v=
iewed as a high-flyer with a failed business model and some questionable ac=
counting practices, top investigators are increasingly convinced there was =
long-term dishonesty at the heart of the company.=20
"There's no question in my mind the conduct of Enron and some key figures a=
t Andersen served to deprive investors of information they should have had,=
" Republican James Greenwood, head of one of the most important congression=
al inquiries, said in an interview this week. "That was done for very uneth=
ical reasons."=20
When the collapse of Enron, once the US's seventh largest company, remained=
 a question of accounting rules, defences were plausible. Off-balance sheet=
 partnerships are, after all, perfectly legal and they enabled the company =
to avoid scrutiny of its debts.=20
But when the losses were fully disclosed on October 16, investors fled and =
the giant energy trader sank into bankruptcy.=20
The closeness of the relationships between Enron and the partnerships have =
led to questions about whether they were truly independent companies operat=
ing at arm's length, but Enron lawyers have repeatedly pointed out that the=
 practice of using them can be found in any graduate accounting text book.=
=20
Shredding documents, however, is not in any text book. Record destruction b=
y itself can be a crime, particularly when it occurs after the opening of a=
 federal investigation or the filing of a lawsuit.=20
Andersen's shredding began in earnest on October 23, the day after Enron pu=
blicly acknowledged it had been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission, the US financial regulator. It continued until November 9, the da=
y after Andersen received an SEC subpoena.=20
If former Enron employees are to be believed, Enron itself was shredding do=
cuments about the private partnerships just last week - months after the op=
ening of a formal SEC investigation, weeks after the filings of dozens of l=
awsuits and days after the Justice Department acknowledged it had launched =
a criminal inquiry into the company.=20
Beyond the potential criminality of the record destruction, however, the ac=
t of shredding brings with it practical and legal assumptions which call in=
to question the very defences Enron and Andersen have made of their account=
ing practices. If the partnerships were indeed perfectly legitimate, why th=
e need to destroy documents?=20
There are also signals that the shredding revelations have moved the Enron =
controversy from the realm of hard-core scandal-watchers into US living roo=
ms. Early last week, Gallup issued a poll that showed only 18 per cent of t=
he American public was following Enron news very closely. But yesterday, Ma=
ureen Castaneda, the former Enron executive accusing the company of shreddi=
ng, could be seen everywhere on television news.=20
In their defence, Enron and Andersen have insisted there was no company-wid=
e order to destroy papers. Andersen has attempted to point the finger at it=
s Houston office, where it has fired David Duncan, its lead Enron auditor, =
and disciplined seven colleagues. But it is a defence that has been difficu=
lt to maintain following revelations that officials from Andersen's Chicago=
 head office were having frequent discussions with Mr Duncan about Enron's =
troubles well before the shredding began.=20
It is now Enron's turn to make its case, arguing that it sent repeated miss=
ives ordering staff to gather documents, as legally required of companies f=
acing litigation. One such e-mail, obtained by the Financial Times and sent=
 on October 31, congratulated employees on their "excellent work" at securi=
ng electronic data. "Please err on the side of retention of documents," the=
 e-mail said.=20
The shredding storm may prove immaterial for the company, already in bankru=
ptcy. But the revelations could make all the difference when the time comes=
 to judge whether anyone at Enron should land in prison. DIY chain fraud tr=

Bush defends actions on Enron
President says his mother-in-law was one of collapse's victims=20
By BENNETT ROTH=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Jan. 22, 2002, 9:52PM
WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Tuesday defended his administration's handl=
ing of the Enron debacle and portrayed his mother-in-law as a victim of the=
 sudden collapse of the energy company's once-soaring stock.=20
Although he visited West Virginia to promote his energy and economic plans,=
 Bush was also forced to address the controversy over Enron, which contribu=
ted generously to his campaigns and unsuccessfully sought White House help =
last fall as its financial situation soured.=20
In his first comments on the issue since it was revealed that members of hi=
s administration had spoken with Enron chief Ken Lay last fall, Bush said h=
e was not worried that the issue would hurt his reputation or was distracti=
ng from his agenda.=20
"Our administration has done the exact right thing," Bush said. "There have=
 been a couple of contacts with people in my Cabinet. And my Cabinet office=
rs said, `No help here.' "=20
The president said he sympathized with the Houston company's investors, inc=
luding his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, who lost nearly all of her investmen=
t.=20
"What I am outraged about is that employees didn't know all the facts about=
 Enron. My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth a=
nything now," Bush said.=20
The president said his mother-in-law, like other investors, "didn't know al=
l the facts" about the company's financial situation.=20
"And that's wrong," Bush said.=20
The White House later explained that on Sept. 21, 1999, Welch purchased 200=
 shares of Enron stock at $40.90 a share for a total investment of $8,180.=
=20
Last Dec. 4 -- two days after the company declared bankruptcy -- Welch sold=
 her Enron stock at 42 cents a share for a total of $84.=20
The daily revelations about Enron and the company's contacts with the Bush =
administration have lately overshadowed the White House's efforts to focus =
attention on terrorism and the economy.=20
Even during the trip to Belle, W.Va., reporters peppered Bush with question=
s on Enron as he toured a machinery company.=20
With a number of congressional committees set to begin hearings on Enron th=
is week, Bush warned lawmakers about dwelling too much on the issue.=20
"The Congress needs to stay focussed on the American people," Bush said. "W=
e're running a war. We've got to make sure our homeland is secure. And we'v=
e got to make sure people can find work."=20
To respond to Enron's problems, Bush has called for more corporate disclosu=
re of financial information and directed the Labor Department to look into =
tighter regulation of 401(k) retirement accounts.=20
But the president has balked at releasing information about all administrat=
ion contacts with Enron unless there is an accusation of wrongdoing.=20
"If somebody has an accusation of wrongdoing, just let me know," he said. T=
he administration recently revealed that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill an=
d Commerce Secretary Don Evans spoke with Lay last fall but concluded nothi=
ng should be done to help the company.=20
White House economics adviser Lawrence Lindsey also studied the Enron situa=
tion and reached the same conclusion.=20
Bush also defended the administration's decision not to release records of =
Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which met six times with En=
ron officials last year.=20
"We laid out the energy report. It's fully disclosed," Bush said.=20
But critics, including many Democratic lawmakers and environmentalists, arg=
ued that accounts of the task force meetings may reveal how Bush's top cont=
ributors in the energy industry, including Enron, played a major role in sh=
aping the energy blueprint.=20
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass, who unveiled an alternative to Bush's energy plan =
on Tuesday, said that Enron and other companies were allowed an "access bon=
anza " to Cheney's task force.=20
"As a result, those most heavily invested in the current energy system have=
 set a course for the future, which, surprisingly, champions status-quo pol=
icies at the expense of new ideas and innovation," Kerry said.=20
The Massachusetts senator and possible presidential contender in 2004 said =
energy policy should focus on raising fuel standards for large vehicles and=
 increasing government incentives for renewable energy like wind and solar =
power.=20
Kerry opposed Bush's proposal for drilling in Alaska's environmentally sens=
itive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.=20
The president renewed his call for drilling in Alaska in a speech to worker=
s in West Virginia. And deep in the heart of the coal mining belt, Bush dre=
w cheers when he said, "We need to use coal."=20
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer denied the allegation by Democrats and environ=
mentalists that Cheney's task force was largely influenced by the energy in=
dustry and said environmentalists such as the Sierra Club had equal access.=
=20
"The president thinks that access should be across the board. And that's wh=
y the Sierra Club, for example, as you know, met repeatedly with the energy=
 task force," Fleischer said.=20
However, a Sierra Club official said the group met just twice with the admi=
nistration and only after the energy task force report was unveiled last Ma=
y.=20
"I think Mr. Fleischer is mistaken. Enron had three times the meetings we d=

 at the Sierra Club.=20

Andersen Ex-Staffer May Invoke Fifth Amendment on Capitol Hill --- Hearings=
 Approach as FBI Seizes Shredded Papers, Bush Defends Stance

The Arthur Andersen LLP executive fired for destroying documents related to=
 Enron Corp. has told a House committee through counsel that he may invoke =
his Fifth Amendment right against potential self-incrimination to avoid tes=
tifying at a hearing tomorrow, people familiar with the matter say.=20
David Duncan, the head of Andersen's Houston office, oversaw the auditing o=
f Enron's books and is at the center of a congressional investigation into =
the destruction of documents. The shredding continued after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission began an inquiry during the fall into Enron's accou=
nting practices, which helped force the giant Houston energy company into b=
ankruptcy-court proceedings last month.
"We are sending Mr. Duncan what we call an unfriendly subpoena," said Ken J=
ohnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's chairman,=
 Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana. During talks with Mr. Duncan's =
lawyers, "we were told in all likelihood that he would take the Fifth," Mr.=
 Johnson said.=20
A lawyer for Mr. Duncan, Vince DiBlasi, said, "No decision has been made" a=
bout whether his client would decline to testify.=20
The committee also plans to issue subpoenas to three other Andersen executi=
ves, including Chief Executive Joseph Berardino, who had resisted testifyin=
g again this week after appearing before another House panel late last year=
, Mr. Johnson said. A spokesman for Mr. Berardino said, "We have said repea=
tedly that we will testify. It's only a question of when."=20
The other two agreed to testify at tomorrow's hearing before the Oversight =
and Investigations Subcommittee but requested subpoenas, Mr. Johnson said. =
One of them is Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago headquarters wh=
ose e-mailed reminder of the firm's document-destruction-and-retention poli=
cy has been cited by Mr. Duncan in explaining his actions. The other is Mic=
hael Odom, head of risk management in Andersen's Houston office, who forwar=
ded Ms. Temple's e-mail to Mr. Duncan.=20
Another Andersen executive in the Houston office, meanwhile, pointed a fing=
er yesterday at the Chicago headquarters in explaining the document destruc=
tion, according to a person familiar with the House committee's interview w=
ith him. That development followed a decision by the Federal Bureau of Inve=
stigation to begin looking into the reported shredding of documents at Enro=
n's headquarters in Houston. Mr. Johnson said the committee plans to hold a=
dditional hearings into alleged document destruction at Enron "very soon."=
=20
Also yesterday, President Bush offered his most extensive defense to date o=
f his administration's handling of the Enron debacle, saying officials acte=
d properly in refusing to help the company avoid bankruptcy court and portr=
aying his own family as a victim of the collapse.=20
Asked about Enron by a reporter while visiting a West Virginia factory to p=
romote his economic agenda, Mr. Bush said Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill a=
nd Commerce Secretary Donald Evans did the "exact right thing" in refusing =
to help Enron CEO Kenneth Lay when he called during the fall seeking federa=
l intervention. "My cabinet officers said: `No help here,' " he said.=20
Mr. Bush said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, bought 200 shares of Enron st=
ock on Sept. 21, 1999, at $40.90 each for a total of $8,180. Mrs. Welch sol=
d them on Dec. 4, two days after Enron filed in bankruptcy court, for 42 ce=
nts a share, for a loss of $8,096. "If she had known all the facts, I don't=
 know what her decision would have been," the president said. "But she didn=
't know all the facts."=20
One of Congress's most powerful Democrats weighed in on the scandal, too. "=
Enron raises serious questions about whether we can contemplate the deregul=
ation of electric utility sales," said Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the Ener=
gy and Commerce Committee's ranking minority member, who has longstanding c=
oncerns about such proposals. Mr. Dingell also said he favors new rules to =
restrict the ability of accounting firms to obtain lucrative consulting con=
tracts from companies they audit.=20
In Houston, FBI agents began interviewing Enron employees and seized a tras=
h can full of shredded documents. An Enron lawyer, Kenneth Marks, disclosed=
 the FBI action, later confirmed by FBI officials in Washington, at a packe=
d federal court hearing in Houston on one of numerous private-investors sui=
ts against the company.=20
Plaintiff lawyer William Lerach brought a large cardboard box containing sh=
redded papers that he said had been supplied by a former Enron worker, one =
of three who asserted in interviews during the week that documents had been=
 destroyed after the SEC began investigating Enron in October. If intended =
to thwart investigators, document destruction could amount to criminal obst=
ruction of justice.=20
The former employees said they saw shredded documents on the 19th floor of =
Enron headquarters, home to accounting operations at the center of investig=
ations into its collapse. The shreds reportedly contained the names of priv=
ate partnerships that are the focus of the probes.=20
Mr. Marks, the Enron attorney, said company officials "located a single tra=
sh can with shredded material." The material was "secured and bagged," and =
guards were stationed on the 19th and 20th floors, he said. "We don't know =
what happened here," he added, asserting that there were various possible e=
xplanations, some "completely innocent." Enron informed the Justice Departm=
ent and the SEC about the matter, he said, adding that the Justice Departme=
nt dispatched the FBI to the scene.=20
The House committee's investigators yesterday interviewed another Andersen =
executive from Houston, Thomas Bauer. Mr. Bauer's account, relayed by a per=
son familiar with his interview, appears to bolster Mr. Duncan's defense. M=
r. Duncan has told investigators he oversaw the destruction of Enron docume=
nts after receiving Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail reminder of the company's d=
ocument-disposal-and-retention policy and immediately halted it after recei=
ving word from her on Nov. 9 that Enron-related documents had been subpoena=
ed.=20
Mr. Bauer told investigators that he assumed document destruction and reten=
tion should continue per the policy until told differently by Andersen lawy=
ers. Like Mr. Duncan, Mr. Bauer also said he didn't think it was necessary =
to preserve all Enron-related documents because Andersen hadn't received a =
subpoena at that point.=20
Congressional investigators are dubious of that defense, especially given t=
hat Andersen's Houston office in early November was sent a copy of a direct=
ive from Enron executives to its own employees to preserve all documents. "=
It sounds like they are pleading idiocy," said Mr. Johnson, the Tauzin spok=
esman.=20
Experts say Mr. Duncan appears to be preparing an "advice-of-counsel" defen=
se -- that he had no criminal intent because he was following a policy sent=
 by Ms. Temple, the Andersen lawyer. Reliance on counsel's advice can be "a=
 powerful defense," says Stanley Arkin, a New York attorney not involved in=
 the case. But "if the advice is on its face patently outrageous, patently =
stupid or violates common sense, it won't excuse the conduct."=20

Accounting for Enron: Enron Pensions Had More Room at the Top --- Executive=
s' Benefits Grew As Retirement Plans Of Employees Were Cut
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

At a time when Enron Corp. was cutting back on its employee retirement plan=
s to save money, executive benefits at the energy company kept getting rich=
er.=20
Beginning in the 1990s, Enron joined many other U.S. companies in trimming =
its employee-pension and savings-plan benefits to cut costs. But throughout=
 the same period, Enron also was continuing to offer a lavish set of pensio=
n and retirement plans for its top executives.
Those benefits, including a lifelong pension and company-paid insurance pre=
miums for Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, are likely to come under more scruti=
ny, given the effect of Enron's collapse on the company's employees. The U.=
S. Department of Labor today will hold a briefing on its investigation of E=
nron's retirement plan.=20
Not only did Enron workers lose their benefits when they lost their jobs, b=
ut they also have seen their retirement plans gutted as Enron's stock, whic=
h accounted for as much as 60% of the company's 401(k) plan, has dropped to=
 about 50 cents a share from a peak of $90 last year.=20
At the same time that employees were locked into much of the Enron stock in=
 their 401(k) plans, executives last year sold shares valued at about $128 =
million, on top of $486 million in sales in 2000, according to Thomson Fina=
ncial/Lancer Analytics, which tracks insider transactions. Mr. Lay alone so=
ld shares valued at $29.8 million during that period.=20
According to company filings, Enron will pay Mr. Lay a pension estimated at=
 $475,042 a year for life. In addition, as part of an agreement Mr. Lay sig=
ned with the company in 1996, it agreed to pay a total of $1.25 million in =
insurance premiums through 2001 on a $12 million life insurance policy. Oth=
er executives have similar pension or insurance agreements with Enron.=20
Such so-called "split-dollar" policies are used to channel executive pensio=
n benefits into vehicles that executives can tap or pass on to their heirs,=
 mostly tax-free.=20
Enron also has a kind of executive 401(k), established in the 1980s, which =
guarantees executives in the plan minimum returns of 12%.=20
In addition, at the time the company was reducing pensions for most of its =
employees, Enron set up an executive savings plan that lets participating e=
xecutives contribute 25% of their salaries and 100% of their cash bonuses e=
ach year. The participants were guaranteed a 9% return on the first two yea=
rs of the plan, and they were allowed to put their money into an array of i=
nvestments -- not just Enron stock.=20
While the existence of Enron's executive benefits is outlined in company fi=
lings and Securities and Exchange Commission documents, the total cost of t=
he pension and retirement promises to Enron executives is nearly impossible=
 to measure. The cost of the split-dollar arrangements is largely invisible=
 (only the premiums are reported as an expense), and the benefits that accr=
ue in the executive savings plans (also known as deferred-compensation plan=
s) aren't required to be disclosed. An Enron spokesman didn't respond to re=
quests for comment.=20
However, filings show that the liability for the executive pensions was $56=
 million in 2000, or about 8% of the total pension liability for all employ=
ees and retirees.=20
The documents do show that at the same time that Enron was beefing up retir=
ement benefits for its top executives, it was cutting them for its other wo=
rkers.=20
According to SEC filings, in 1986 Enron set up an employee stock-ownership =
plan, which bought 8.7 million shares of Enron stock in exchange for a note=
 of $335 million. To pay off much of this debt, the company in January 1987=
 terminated its overfunded pension plan, and transferred the $230 million i=
n surplus assets, tax-free, to the ESOP.=20
Meanwhile, the company set up a new pension plan, transferring into it the =
assets and liabilities from the old plan; the new plan, though no longer ov=
erfunded, was less costly than the old one.=20
But even though Enron set up an ESOP and a new pension, this doesn't mean E=
nron employees were to enjoy benefits from both a pension and an ESOP. That=
 is because Enron created a so-called "floor-offset" arrangement between th=
e pension and the ESOP. That meant the benefits employees earned in one pla=
n essentially erased benefits earned in the other. These arrangements have =
been used by many companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co. and Airborne Inc=
.=20
A major reason why companies set up these arrangements is to reduce their p=
ension expense. And, indeed, the "offset" contributed to a significant decl=
ine in Enron's pension expense, which was $3.6 million in 1987. After the o=
ffset was established, instead of an expense, Enron's pension actually cont=
ributed $9.6 million to Enron's bottom line in 1988.=20
In an unusual step, Enron calculated the ESOP "offsets" based on the price =
of the stock from 1996 to 2000, when it was trading between $37.75 and $43.=
44. As previously reported in The Wall Street Journal, it then used the hig=
her locked-in value of the ESOP accounts to permanently cut the value of pe=
nsions that employees had earned between January 1987 and January 1995. Acc=
ording to filings, employees had $116 million in ESOP assets at the end of =
2000. The assets now are nearly worthless.=20
Some Enron employees still will receive their pensions -- albeit at the red=
uced values. How much employees lost depends on the size of the pensions th=
ey had earned, and the value of their ESOP accounts from 1996 to 2000.=20
This arrangement comes to light because Enron sought -- and received -- per=
mission from the Labor Department to change its plan in this fashion; compa=
ny documents also indicate that Mr. Lay's pension wasn't affected by the ES=
OP offset.=20
Not only were the past pensions permanently erased, but the pension going f=
orward, in 1996, also was reduced. At that time, Enron converted the tradit=
ional pension to a cash-balance pension, which reduces the benefits build-u=
p for longer-term, older workers.=20
This fall, as the company slid toward bankruptcy, Enron said it might freez=
e the pensions of all employees, and it stopped contributing to the 401(k).=
=20
---=20
Cassell Bryan-Low contributed to this article.=20
--- Do Unto Others . . .

What Enron did to its retirement plans:

-- Used ESOP to get surplus assets from pension plan, tax free.
-- Used ESOP to cut pension expense.
-- Used ESOP to offset pension benefits.
-- Stopped contributing to ESOPs.
-- Converted pension to cash balance pension plan.
-- Froze pension plan of union employees.
-- Locked employees in 401(k) into Enron stock until age 50.
-- In late 2001, stopped contributing to 401(k).

How this affected employees:

-- Pensions earned before 1996 are reduced.
-- Pension earned after 1996 are cut.
-- Pensions for union workers frozen; investment risk increased.
-- ESOPs are now worthless.
-- 401(k)s are devastated.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
Chief's Words Paint Hands-Off Image, but Actions Offer Different View
By ALEX BERENSON

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, more than once made =
a point last year of telling people how little he understood about the fina=
nces of the company he has run since 1986.=20
In August, Mr. Lay said in an interview that questions about the deals that=
 Enron used to shift debt off its books were ''way over my head.'' In Novem=
ber, Mr. Lay told Chuck Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, which at the time h=
ad agreed to buy Enron, that he had never fully read the financial statemen=
ts Enron filed with federal regulators, according to Mr. Watson.
But if Mr. Lay's comments left the impression that he was a hands-off chair=
man, a different picture has emerged over the last 10 days as to what Mr. L=
ay knew about the company's accounting practices and when he knew it.=20
Disclosures by Congressional investigators and lawyers suing Enron showed t=
hat Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the company's suspect financi=
al arrangements. He knew that doubts had been raised about Enron's accounti=
ng, even as he encouraged employees to buy Enron shares. About the same tim=
e in September and October, Mr. Lay, to avoid facing margin calls as invest=
ments in his portfolio lost value, repaid millions in loans from Enron with=
 company stock.=20
Now, employees who retained their faith in Mr. Lay even as the company was =
collapsing are criticizing him for breaching their trust. At worst, experts=
 in securities law say, investigators may view Mr. Lay's professions of ign=
orance as a deliberate effort to distance himself from Enron's problems.=20
''He's got a lot of trouble,'' said James D. Cox, professor of corporate an=
d securities law at Duke University. Mr. Lay is at risk of facing criminal =
charges of fraud or insider trading, Mr. Cox said.=20
''He's going to be spending a lot of time with lawyers; the real fear is on=
 the criminal side,'' Mr. Cox said. ''He could be the next Charles Keating,=
'' a reference to the savings and loan operator who pleaded guilty to fraud=
 in the 1989 failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan.=20
Lawyers for Mr. Lay and Enron did not return calls seeking comment.=20
The first blow to Mr. Lay came Jan. 14, when the House Energy and Commerce =
Committee released a letter showing that as he publicly proclaimed his igno=
rance of Enron's financial structure in August, he had been warned by Sherr=
on S. Watkins, an Enron vice president, that the company might ''implode in=
 a wave of accounting scandals.'' In response to the letter, Mr. Lay direct=
ed Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm, to conduct a limited inquiry -- a rev=
iew that a lawyer for Ms. Watkins has called a whitewash.=20
Last Friday, a lawyer representing employees who have sued Enron released a=
 10-page transcript of an online chat between Mr. Lay and Enron employees o=
n Sept. 26. In the chat, Mr. Lay repeatedly promoted Enron's stock while pr=
omising employees that the company's financial reporting was ''legal and to=
tally appropriate.''=20
Congressional investigators, meanwhile, made public the Vinson & Elkins rep=
ort. It showed that Mr. Lay approved the creation in 1999 of two of the par=
tnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investments, that have figured prominentl=
y in questions about the company's accounting practices.=20
In the process, Enron's board, under Mr. Lay's leadership, waived the compa=
ny's code of ethics to let its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, r=
un them and profit from them. Losses at those partnerships subsequently for=
ced Enron to erase more than $500 million in shareholders equity, a measure=
 of the company's value.=20
Finally, on Sunday, Earl J. Silbert, Mr. Lay's lawyer, acknowledged that Mr=
. Lay had sold some of his Enron stock back to the company in September and=
 October, while Vinson & Elkins was investigating Ms. Watkins's claims. Det=
ails of the sales, repayments of a revolving line of credit extended to Mr.=
 Lay by Enron, do not have to be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission until Feb. 14.=20
The revelation that Mr. Lay encouraged Enron employees to buy stock after h=
e was warned about accounting problems may open him to charges of securitie=
s fraud, said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington University School of La=
w in St. Louis and co-author of an 11-volume treatise on securities law. Th=
e fact that he was disposing of shares at the same time could open him to c=
harges of insider trading, Mr. Seligman added.=20
''If he knowingly made false statements while he traded stock, he will face=
 criminal liability,'' Mr. Seligman said. Mr. Lay may also face S.E.C. proc=
eedings and already is a defendant in scores of lawsuits.=20
Even if Mr. Lay did not know the details of the partnerships used by Enron =
to inflate its earnings, he could be held criminally liable, Mr. Seligman s=
aid. As long as Mr. Lay ''understood why they were created, what they were =
intended to do,'' he said, ''the fact that he didn't know whether they were=
 created in Panama or the Cayman Islands is a detail that would not be mate=
rial.''=20
Ira Lee Sorkin, a former director of New York office of the S.E.C. who is n=
ow a defense lawyer, cautioned against rushing to judgment. But Mr. Sorkin =
said the fact that Mr. Lay had disposed of shares after the warning from Ms=
. Watkins might be difficult for Mr. Lay to explain.=20
Other securities lawyers have said the fact that Enron, which presumably ha=
d the same information about its prospects as Mr. Lay, acquired his shares =
might protect him from charges of insider trading.=20
But Mr. Sorkin disagrees. ''If he knew of the information that we now suspe=
ct he knew about and paid back the company, knowing full well that this sto=
ck is going to drop like a lead balloon,'' Mr. Sorkin said, ''then he's goi=
ng to have an issue.''

Chart: ''Filling in the Details'' Last summer and fall, as energy prices an=
d Enron's stock fell, Kenneth L. Lay, the company's chairman and chief exec=
utive, repeatedly reassured investors and employees, urging them to buy sto=
ck and telling them that he knew of no problems at the company. Recent disc=
losures show that he had been told of concerns about Enron's accounting pra=
ctices and had disposed of millions of dollars worth of Enron stock to meet=
 obligations on his investments. Public Comments and Disclosures AUG. 14 Wh=

sues''are behind the departure. What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG. 15=
 In the wake of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Sherron S. Watkins, a vice pres=

 shares at $20.78 with a total value of $519,500. The stock closes at $36.2=
5. A lawyer for Mr. Lay subsequently explains that he used some of the stoc=
k to help repay a line of credit from Enron. Public Comments and Disclosure=
s AUG. 21 Mr. Lay sends an e-mail to employees assuring them that the compa=
ny is on solid footing. He says in the e-mail that ''one of my highest prio=
rities is to restore investor confidence in Enron. This should result in a =
significantly higher stock price.'' What Was Going On Behind the Scenes AUG=
. 21 Four Andersen officials, including David B. Duncan, the lead partner o=
n the Enron account, meet to discuss Ms. Watkins's concerns. According to a=
n Andersen memo, they ''agreed to consult our firm's legal adviser about wh=
at actions to take'' in regard to Ms. Watkins's accusations. Mr. Lay exerci=
ses options on 68,620 shares at $21.56 with a total value of $1,479,447. Th=
e stock closes at $36.88. A lawyer for Mr. Lay said he still holds these sh=
ares, which are now trading for less than a dollar. AUG. 22 Ms. Watkins mee=
ts with Mr. Lay. She gives him a seven-page letter in which she says that E=
nron may be an ''elaborate accounting hoax.'' She urges him to look into it=
, but not to involve the company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, becau=
se it has potential conflicts of interest. Despite Ms. Watkins's concerns a=
bout Vinson & Elkins, the firm is asked to determine if a broad inquiry is =
necessary to deal with the accusations. It is specifically told not to spen=

Enron creditors seek outside supervision
Court to review options=20
By ERIC BERGER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 22, 2002, 11:24PM
Lawyers for Enron creditors have asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to appoint a=
n outsider to supervise the current management or take control of the troub=
led company.=20
The motion, filed Tuesday by the Dallas-based Wiser Oil Company and several=
 other energy companies, contends that Enron executives should no longer be=
 entrusted with leading the company through the biggest bankruptcy ever.=20
The action by creditors is backed up by growing evidence of mass shredding =
of Enron's financial documents.=20
"Particularly disturbing are reports that employees of the debtors have bee=
n destroying Enron documents since the federal government began investigati=
ng their collapse," the motion states.=20
On Tuesday FBI agents visited Enron's headquarters following the latest all=
egations of destruction of documents that could be used as evidence of wron=
gdoing.=20
An Enron spokesperson said the company has posted security guards to restri=
ct access to floors holding financial records.=20
Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center and an expert =
in bankruptcy law, believes it is not a coincidence Tuesday's filing by cre=
ditors was made as shredding allegations mount.=20
"This is a one-for-one response," she said. "They are pissed."=20
A hearing on the motion has been set for Feb. 20 in the court of Judge Arth=
ur Gonzalez.=20
He is hearing Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.=20
Enron hopes to pare down its assets during the bankruptcy process to pay cr=
editors and emerge as a smaller, profitable company. Removal of its managem=
ent team may make that a more difficult goal.=20
Rapoport believes it's likely at least an examiner will be appointed, but s=
he wouldn't not rule out the possibility of the judge taking the more drast=
ic step of appointing a trustee.=20
An examiner is an independent counsel of sorts.=20
Such an appointee would have the power to look into what caused Enron's dec=
line and investigate whether the company's officials are acting in the best=
 interest of all the creditors during the bankruptcy process.=20
A trustee has much broader powers to run the company, and essentially wrest=
s control of it from current executives.=20
"A judge appointing a trustee is telling a debtor we don't trust you a seco=
nd longer," Rapoport said. "But my instinct is that the bankruptcy judge is=
 going to pick the lesser of the two evils and will appoint an examiner alo=
ng with giving a strong lecture to the debtors."=20
Bankruptcy lawyers for Wiser, who filed the motion, and Enron, who can be e=
xpected to challenge it, did not return telephone calls seeking comment Tue=
sday night.=20
The motion presents several arguments in favor of a trustee or examiner.=20
First, the motion says access to Enron's financial records has been limited=
, and it is difficult to get accurate accounts of the company's assets and =
debt.=20
The motion also objects to the sale of assets from Enron's once-robust trad=
ing business to UBS Warburg last week. Last week the judge approved the sal=
e, which provided no money up front and will only offer revenue if the busi=
ness succeeds.=20
Finally, the motion cites the civil and criminal investigations by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor, Congress and the D=
epartment of Justice.=20
Previously, Wiser has announced it stands to lose about $6 million because =
Enron will not live up to oil and gas hedges -- contracts that were suppose=
d to ensure Wiser would reduce its risk of losses on price fluctuations.=20

Enron's top security team, including four former CIA officers and and ex-FB=
I agent, has left the company to form a private consulting firm.=20
An Enron spokesman said Tuesday the move is unrelated to allegations that e=
xecutives hid financial problems from investors and that employees shredded=
 documents after the company filed for bankruptcy.=20
The new firm, Secure Solutions International, will continue security work f=
or Enron through a consulting contract, which enables it to work for other =
clients, spokesman Vance Meyer said.=20
He said that after Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec.=
 2, the security officers were at risk of being laid off and suggested they=
 form an independent firm with Enron as a client.=20
John W. Presley of Katy, a former FBI agent who was Enron's director of cor=
porate security and now leads SSI, could not be reached for comment.=20
The Enron team included Presley, four Central Intelligence Agency veterans =
and a former investigator for the Florida Department of Environmental Prote=
ction.=20
It acted as an in-house detective agency, probing a variety of allegations =
of fraud and other kinds of rule-breaking by Enron workers.=20
Other duties included guarding executives, securing Enron's computer operat=
ions and protecting the corporation's power plant in India.=20
Team member David M. Cromley, a former CIA agent who was Enron's director o=
f business analysis, gave Enron executives "detailed and unique information=
" allowing them to make decisions on "investments, sales of assets, joint v=
entures and products," according to his business biography. It also says he=
 worked for the CIA in war zones in Somalia, Liberia and Romania and specia=
lized in counter-terrorism operations.=20
Andre Le Gallo, a business intelligence consultant in California, said Tues=
day that he was the first person recruited from the CIA by Enron. Le Gallo =
worked at Enron for about five years, ending in December 1999.=20
"They were looking for people who knew where the international buttons were=
," Le Gallo said.=20
Enron's international projects included the politically sensitive Indian el=
ectricity generation plant. The CIA gathered information about the risks of=
 the project and about British companies that were competing with Enron to =
build it, The New York Times reported in 1995.=20
Le Gallo said the former agents' switch to private consulting is not unusua=
l in the security industry, especially in light of Enron's collapse.=20
"I'm sure they moved because they found better things to do than at a sinki=
ng firm," he said.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
In Shift, Bush Assails Enron Over Handling of Collapse
By DAVID E. SANGER with DAVID BARBOZA

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

BELLE, W.Va., Jan. 22 -- Abruptly changing his tone about a company that co=
ntributed heavily to his political campaigns, President Bush said today tha=
t he was ''outraged'' that the Enron Corporation misled its employees and i=
nvestors, including his mother-in-law, who he said lost more than $8,000 wh=
en its stock collapsed.=20
For the first time, Mr. Bush called for government action to force greater =
corporate disclosure of financial information.
In comments to reporters here before he toured a machinery shop, Mr. Bush a=
lso strongly defended how members of his cabinet handled calls for aid from=
 Enron's top executives, summarizing those members' message to the company'=
s leaders as ''no help here.''=20
Mr. Bush's new tone came as the scope of the Enron investigation widened. T=
he company told a federal court in Houston today that on Monday night it ha=
d discovered more shredded documents on the 19th floor of its headquarters =
in Houston, suggesting that employees were destroying potential evidence de=
spite what the company's leaders say were orders to the contrary.=20
The shredded remains were turned over to the Justice Department today, and =
the Federal Bureau of Investigation sealed off part of the headquarters bui=
lding.=20
Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce committee said it would issue subp=
oenas to a recently dismissed partner of Arthur Andersen, the main accounti=
ng firm for Enron and the auditor of its questionable financial arrangement=
s. The fired Andersen partner, David B. Duncan, may cite his Fifth Amendmen=
t right against self-incrimination before the committee on Thursday, invest=
igators said. Three others at Andersen, including the firm's chief executiv=
e, were also summoned.=20
In his comments today, the president never mentioned Enron's chief executiv=
e, Kenneth L. Lay, a once-close friend whom he had nicknamed Kenny Boy and =
who was the largest single contributor to Mr. Bush's campaigns since Mr. Bu=
sh entered politics. Nonetheless, by implication the president cut the cord=
 with Mr. Lay today, saying, ''What I'm outraged about is that shareholders=
 and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron.''=20
''My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anythin=
g now,'' he said of Jenna Welch, Laura Bush's mother.=20
Mr. Bush added later: ''She didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareho=
lders didn't know all the facts. And that's wrong.''=20
Republican strategists said Mr. Bush's changed tone reflected a political c=
alculation by the White House as Congressional hearings on the company's co=
llapse begin this week. They said the administration was determined not to =
allow Democrats to portray Enron as a problem only for Republicans.=20
''The dynamic over Enron cannot be that Democrats are against Enron and for=
 reform, and we're defending Enron and against reform,'' said one strategis=
t who is close to the White House but who would not allow his name to be us=
ed. ''What Enron did is outrageous, and if you don't move to correct it, it=
 becomes an indictment of the free market. The Republican Party is the free=
 market party. And we have to demonstrate our desire to make the market fai=
r and to crack down on abuse.''=20
Bill Dal Col, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Bush's comments were an app=
ropriate response to the widening disclosures about Enron.=20
''When you've got a crisis that's growing like this -- every time you turn =
the page there's a new chapter of hocus-pocus accounting -- the stronger th=
e outrage has to be,'' Mr. Dal Col said.=20
After Mr. Bush spoke, the White House corrected the president on the timing=
 of his mother-in-law's investment. Mrs. Welch bought 200 shares of Enron o=
n Sept. 21, 1999, for $40.90 a share, the White House said, for a total inv=
estment of $8,180. She sold her holdings on Dec. 4, two days after the comp=
any declared bankruptcy, for 42 cents a share, meaning her investment had p=
lummeted to $84.=20
The White House did not say if any other members of Mr. Bush's family had h=
eld Enron stock. Some of his close aides did, but they were forced to dives=
t their holdings shortly after they joined the administration, under federa=
l ethics rules.=20
When Mr. Bush last spoke publicly about Enron on Jan. 11, he distanced hims=
elf from Mr. Lay, saying he recalled that the Texas executive had also supp=
orted Mr. Bush's rival, Ann Richards, for governor of Texas -- and expresse=
d concern for Enron's workers. Mr. Bush also called for an investigation in=
to ''the whys of Enron,'' focusing on changing rules to protect the life sa=
vings of workers. But in those comments, he never criticized the company or=
 its executives, many of whom were his political and social friends in Texa=
s. His tone suggested that he viewed Enron's collapse as an example of the =
ups and downs of capitalism, rather than an effort to defraud.=20
Today, after a stream of revelations about the company's efforts to hide it=
s debts and overstate its profits, Mr. Bush seemed angry -- both at the com=
pany and at suggestions that his administration had been unduly influenced =
by a major contributor.=20
''If somebody has got an accusation about some wrongdoing, just let me know=
,'' he told reporters.=20
''It's like when I talked with Don Evans and O'Neill,'' he said, referring =
to his commerce secretary and Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasur=
y, ''they told me they had spoke to Enron. I said, 'Tell the people what yo=
u did.' ''=20
He brushed aside any suggestion that Enron officials, in several meetings w=
ith Vice President Dick Cheney and his energy task force, had influenced th=
e administration's energy policy. ''We laid out the energy report,'' Mr. Bu=
sh said. ''It's fully disclosed.''=20
Mr. Bush called for action to prevent a recurrence of the Enron debacle, sa=
ying, ''Our government must do something about it.''=20
But he never elaborated on how oversight of companies like Enron, or their =
accounting firms, should change.=20
And just minutes later, addressing workers at the Walker Machinery Company =
here about the economy and his campaign against terrorism, Mr. Bush returne=
d to one of his favorite themes: that the government overregulates the econ=
omy and should let up on American companies so they are freer to act as the=
y see fit. He said the government should ''not overregulate those who are t=
rying to create work.''=20
As Mr. Bush spoke today, new details were emerging about shredded documents=
 at the company's headquarters. Enron said in federal court that a second b=
atch of shredded documents was found on Monday night in a trash receptacle =
at the company's headquarters.=20
Enron officials said they knew nothing about the destruction of the documen=
ts and they insisted that the company had repeatedly ordered employees not =
to destroy documents after a series of lawsuits and federal investigations =
began looking into the collapse of the company last October and November. D=
estroying documents that are relevant to those investigations or to lawsuit=
s against the company and its executives would be a crime.=20
But lawyers representing shareholders and employees said they doubted that =
explanation. ''This cannot be tolerated,'' said William Lerach, an attorney=
 in a class-action suit against Enron and Andersen, pointing to a box of sh=
redded Enron documents that he brought to the court hearing. ''The integrit=
y of the civil litigation system has been insulted.''=20
He and others asked Judge Melinda Harmon of Federal District Court in Houst=
on to seize the company's documents and put them under the guard of United =
States marshals. They argued that Enron and Andersen could not be trusted t=
o turn over valuable evidence related to the case.=20
The court hearing came a day after a former Enron employee, Maureen Castane=
da, said that she had found a box of shredded documents on the 19th floor o=
f the Enron headquarters, the same floor where the company found additional=
 evidence of shredding on Monday night. Ms. Castaneda, who was a director o=
f foreign exchange at Enron until she was fired last week, said she took a =
box home to use the confetti as packing material. She said the box containe=
d shards of paper referring to some of the secret Enron partnerships that a=
re at the center of the accounting scandal that forced the company into ban=
kruptcy protection.=20
Efforts to reach Ms. Castaneda today were unsuccessful. The company said th=
at it was now cooperating with federal investigators and that company lawye=
rs had interviewed several workers on the 19th floor about document shreddi=
ng.=20
''Until yesterday, the company believed the process was working and was com=
pletely observed,'' Kenneth Marks, a lawyer for Enron, said today. ''We don=
't know what happened here. There could be completely innocent explanations=
 for this.''=20
Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for Andersen, criticized the opposing lawyers for dr=
umming up publicity with television interviews Monday night, a day ahead of=
 the scheduled hearing. Mr. Hardin said lawyers for Andersen were working h=
ard to preserve and recover documents.=20
''We are not suicidal,'' he said, gesturing toward Judge Harmon. ''If we we=
re shredders and not preserving documents you could run us out of business.=
''=20
In an interview today, an Enron employee who works on the 19th floor confir=
med that shredded material had filled a plastic bin beside the shredding ma=
chine for several weeks. He said that he had never seen anyone actually doi=
ng the shredding but that he had assumed it was taking place.=20
''It was obvious there was paper in the shredder,'' he said. ''Probably rec=
ently.''=20
He said the 19th floor is divided between a research division and payroll a=
nd accounting departments. The employee, who spoke on the condition that hi=
s name not be used, said he had not considered the evidence of shredding in=
 a common room to be significant because accounting and payroll employees r=
outinely destroy documents.=20
And he said that while company executives had sent three e-mail messages in=
 October outlining restrictions on shredding, he had not interpreted those =
messages to be blanket prohibitions but instead were limited to documents r=
elated to the investigations. He said a fourth e-mail message sent on Jan. =
14 was emphatic that all shredding cease.=20
Document shredding seems likely to be a main topic of the coming Congressio=
nal hearings. Tonight, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, preparing f=
or its hearing on Thursday on shredding of documents by Andersen, Enron's a=
uditors, was expected to subpoena four current or former Andersen officials=
: Joseph F. Berardino, the chief executive; Michael C. Odom, a partner in t=
he firm's Houston office who was relieved of management responsibilities la=
st week; Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago headquarters; and Mr.=
 Duncan, the lead partner on the Enron account.=20
Ms. Temple and Mr. Odom are expected to testify willingly, but Mr. Berardin=
o and Mr. Duncan are resisting, investigators say, and Mr. Duncan may invok=
e his Fifth Amendment right, they said.=20
''Duncan remains an extremely recalcitrant witness who believes he ought to=
 be able to take the Fifth by fax,'' said Representative James C. Greenwood=
, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee that will=
 hold the hearing. If Mr. Duncan does not at least show up to exercise his =
Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Greenwood said, the subcommittee would consider=
 citing him for contempt of Congress.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Kind Words for Andersen
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- Last week, the Enron Corporation fired its longtime =
auditor, Arthur Andersen, during the company's accounting scandal. But not =
so long ago, Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, had only nice things to say =
about his auditors.=20
Andersen's ''expertise and professional skepticism,'' Mr. Lay explained in =
September 2000, had helped ''improve the overall control environment within=
'' Enron.
Mr. Lay made the comments in a letter to Arthur Levitt, who was then chairm=
an of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to persuade Mr. Levitt to bac=
k off on plans to improve auditor independence. Specifically, one of Mr. Le=
vitt's initiatives would have prohibited a company's external auditor from =
also performing internal audits, as Andersen continued to do for Enron.=20
Mr. Lay, in his letter, explained that Mr. Levitt's proposals were ''troubl=
ing'' because Enron had found the existing setup to be cheaper and more eff=
icient. But, as is now understood, it is not clear that the arrangement wor=
ked so well. In November, Enron admitted overstating its profits since 1997=
 by nearly $600 million -- one of a series of damaging disclosures that led=
 to its bankruptcy filing.=20
Today, Mr. Levitt said in an interview that the issue Mr. Lay objected to '=
'goes right to the heart of what we were driving at, what we were trying to=
 eliminate.'' The most egregious conflict, he said, ''was the performance o=
f internal audits by the external auditor; he's auditing himself.''=20
Had Enron had separate auditors doing their internal and external reviews, =
Mr. Levitt added, other auditors ''might have found something that Andersen=
 wasn't able to uncover.''=20
At the bottom of Mr. Lay's letter is Enron's trademarked motto, which, with=
 the benefit of hindsight, is quite prescient: ''Endless possibilities.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LAWYER
Seeking Top Berth In Pursuit Of Enron
By LESLIE WAYNE

01/23/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 -- The lawyer William Lerach was all over the television=
 news today as he lugged a large carton of shredded Enron documents to the =
courthouse in Houston. Amid a sea of microphones, Mr. Lerach gave the impre=
ssion he was leading the charge for angry shareholders in their legal battl=
e against Enron.=20
In reality, it is a job he wants but does not yet have. Instead, Mr. Lerach=
, perhaps the most famous and flamboyant lawyer for shareholders, is engage=
d in a pitched three-way battle to be named chief legal counsel for all Enr=
on shareholders, a job that could end up netting legal fees in the hundreds=
 of millions of dollars for the firm selected.
Just who will be named chief counsel for the class-action suit will be dete=
rmined by a federal judge next month.=20
In the meantime, Mr. Lerach is campaigning, appearing on morning talk shows=
 and making dramatic statements to reporters on the courthouse steps as he =
filled the airwaves today.=20
He wants the job so badly that he has even jettisoned some clients, most fa=
mously, Amalgamated Bank of New York, in the hopes of staking his fortune w=
ith even bigger ones -- one of the criteria for deciding the lead counsel.=
=20
''Bill Lerach puts himself in the forefront in terms of publicity and fees =
and everything else,'' said James M. Finberg, a lawyer with a San Francisco=
 firm that is also vying to be named chief counsel. ''But the decision of w=
ho becomes lead counsel will not be made by who has the most press attentio=
n, but will be made by a judge.'' His firm's clients include the City of Ne=
w York pension fund and a State of Florida pension fund.=20
In the world of shareholder litigation, Mr. Lerach, who did not return call=
s for comment, is well known. He has won over a billion dollars for shareho=
lders in two big financial scandals involving junk bonds and savings and lo=
ans, and brought frivolous cases like litigation over the lip-synching duo,=
 Milli Vanilli.=20
Mr. Lerach has made a personal fortune and gained the lasting hatred of cor=
porate America by bringing more than 600 suits against companies whose stoc=
k price has dropped. His firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, accoun=
ts for about half of all shareholder suits against corporations and has won=
 $6 billion for its clients.=20
For this Mr. Lerach earned the name the ''king of strike suits,'' and corpo=
rations talk about having been ''Lerached.''=20
His firm once agreed to pay $50 million to settle a case in which someone h=
e sued accused him of abusing the legal system and a federal jury agreed.=
=20
''He is a controversial figure of historic dimensions,'' said John Coffee, =
a securities law professor at Columbia University. ''Those who do not like =
him say he behaves as an extortionist, is threatening and shakes people dow=
n. Others say he is more zealous than the lazier plaintiffs' attorneys. He =
is the most controversial figure in a field of litigation known for its ego=
s and flamboyant types.''=20
Some say Mr. Lerach's boldest move to date may be in giving the impression =
in the Enron case that he already has the job he wants: ''Lerach is running=
 around like it's his case,'' said one law school professor, who insisted o=
n not being identified. ''Why is this man smiling? He thinks he has the cas=
e, and it is not clear that he does.''=20
In reality there are three legal teams vying to be selected as the lead cou=
nsel for the shareholders -- mainly large pension funds who bought Enron sh=
ares, but also individual investors. Mr. Lerach's big client is the Univers=
ity of California Regents, which has lost about $144 million. Another is Mr=
. Finberg's firm, Lieff Cabraser Heimann Bernstein, whose two clients, the =
New York and Florida pension funds, have a combined total of $440 million i=
n losses and which feels it has something extra. ''We have a very sympathet=
ic group,'' Mr. Finberg said. ''We represent a lot of the families of peopl=
e who died in the World Trade Center.''=20
A third group is composed of public pension funds from Georgia, Ohio, Washi=
ngton and Alabama and is represented by a law firm in Delaware and one in A=
tlanta. This group is claiming losses of $330 million. Lawyers for the two =
firms, Grant & Eisenhofer and Chitwood & Harley, did not return calls.=20
Under federal securities reform legislation enacted in 1995, the criterion =
for selecting a lead lawyer was changed. Rather than the firm that filed a =
class-action case first (one of Mr. Lerach's specialties), the lawyer who r=
epresents the plaintiffs with the greatest losses, among other factors, is =
now favored.=20
The lead lawyer's firm decides on the legal strategy, directs all other law=
yers and gets the biggest slice of the fees, as well as determines how much=
 lawyers for the other plaintiffs will be paid. These fees can run into the=
 hundreds of millions -- the $3.2 billion class-action settlement against t=
he Cendant Corporation is expected to net legal fees of over $270 million.=
=20
''The lead law firm does most of the work and gets most of the fees,'' said=
 Brian Borders, a spokesman for the Association of Publicly Traded Companie=
s, which represents small and midsize companies. ''The fees in the Enron ca=
se could be in the hundreds of millions. It is going to be the grandaddy of=
 all securities class-action cases and that will dictate the size of the fe=
es.''=20
At the moment, Mr. Lerach is doing some fancy footwork to get the lead posi=
tion. In court today, he argued that the selection of the lead counsel shou=
ld be changed from the law firm whose clients, as a group, suffered the big=
gest losses to the firm with the single client who has lost the most. By th=
e first calculation, Mr. Lerach's firm would be in third place.=20
By the second calculation, he contends, he would be in first place, as he s=
ays the California Regents' $144 million was the single largest loss. While=
 the Florida pension fund lost more, $300 million, Mr. Lerach argued that F=
lorida should be disqualified as a lead plaintiff because it brought more c=
lass-action lawsuits over the last three years than allowed by federal law.=
 But lawyers for the State of Florida say this law does not apply to instit=
utional investors.=20
To back up his legal theory that the lawyer for the single-biggest plaintif=
f should get the nod, he asked his other client, Amalgamated Bank, to step =
down, and the bank, with only $10 million in losses, agreed.=20
''This is something that we agreed to do so that Bill Lerach could become t=
he lead attorney on the case,'' said Melissa Moye, chief economist for Amal=
gamated Bank, who reasoned that if stepping back was the only way to get Mr=
. Lerach selected to represent the whole class of shareholders, it would.=
=20
''We did this by mutual consent. We want the California Regents to be named=
 as the lead plaintiff,'' Ms. Moye said.=20
In fact, some see Mr. Lerach's action's today, especially his courting of t=
he press, as a smart marketing move intended to draw even bigger clients to=
 him.=20
''He's been courting the pension funds by saying, you ought to pick Milberg=
 Weiss as the lead counsel,'' said Mr. Borders of the publicly traded compa=
nies group. ''It's all about marketing.''

Politics & Policy
Cast Prepares for Congressional Curtain to Rise on Enron Scandal
By Jackie Calmes and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A24
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Congress returns for a new year today with its agenda once ag=
ain reshaped by events: The Enron Corp. scandal has joined war and recessio=
n on center stage, commanding lawmakers' legislative attention and throwing=
 yet another variable into their election-year calculations.=20
Some lawmakers, of course, will be more prominent than others. Since Congre=
ss recessed a month ago, Enron and its now-fired auditor, Arthur Andersen L=
LP, have faced a torrent of reports alleging financial shenanigans and pape=
r-shredding involving both. Now, Congress watchers need a cheat-sheet to ke=
ep track of the myriad House and Senate committees probing the mess. What f=
ollows is a guide to those who will play lead roles.
-- Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin. For all of Democrats' hopes that Enron could t=
ar the company's political favorites -- chiefly President Bush and his part=
y -- this Louisiana Democrat-turned-Republican so far has been the most agg=
ressive congressional prosecutor. He has been responsible for recent disclo=
sures on potentially criminal document destruction.=20
Mr. Tauzin has the right platform, as chairman of the powerful House Energy=
 and Commerce Committee. He is inclined to use it: A savvy politician and m=
edia performer, he is a populist sympathetic to Main Street, not Wall Stree=
t, and to independent oil and gas companies rather than corporate behemoths=
.=20
A prodigious fund-raiser, Mr. Tauzin has pocketed checks from both companie=
s: $57,000 from Andersen since 1989, according to the nonpartisan Center fo=
r Responsive Politics, and $6,464 from Enron. Unlike some other politicians=
 of late, his spokesman says he won't be returning any of it.=20
-- Rep. John Dingell. The pugnacious Michigander is Mr. Tauzin's Democratic=
 opposite at the Energy and Commerce Committee. He long headed the panel, a=
nd sometimes acts -- and is treated -- as if he still does.=20
"Big John," as colleagues call him, will focus on document shredding and ot=
her potential evidence of obstruction of justice. Also watch for him to use=
 Enron hearings to raise longstanding concerns about the perils of energy d=
eregulation, formerly Enron's top legislative priority, and about auditors'=
 independence. Of Andersen's role as both Enron consultant and auditor, he =
said in an interview, "It is impossible for any intelligent man to look at =
this and not come to the conclusion that this is a serious conflict of inte=
rest."=20
His take since 1989: $9,000 from Enron, $6,500 from Andersen.=20
-- Rep. Henry Waxman. The California Democrat has been far ahead of the pac=
k on Enron, though he is handicapped by being in the House's minority party=
 -- and thus lacking the GOP chairmen's power to set hearings and subpoena =
witnesses. The liberal activist set up a Web site in December for whistle-b=
lowers. He and Mr. Dingell triggered an investigation by Congress's nonpart=
isan General Accounting Office into the secret deliberations of Vice Presid=
ent Dick Cheney's task force with energy-industry representatives -- notabl=
y Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay -- as Mr. Cheney drafted the administration's =
energy plan.=20
Mr. Waxman will be an interrogator on Energy and Commerce, but his own Enro=
n-Andersen probes have been from his perch as top Democrat on the House Gov=
ernment Reform and Oversight Committee. His tenaciousness contrasts with th=
e unusually low profile of Indiana Rep. Dan Burton, the panel's GOP chairma=
n who was arch-inquisitor of the Clinton administration. Privately, White H=
ouse aides have warned that Mr. Waxman could end up as "the next Dan Burton=
," reflecting the widespread view that Mr. Burton's tenacity backfired. Dem=
ocrats scoff.=20
Mr. Waxman's take from the companies, according to federal records: 0.=20
-- Sen. Joseph Lieberman. The Connecticut Democrat gavels the opening of he=
arings of his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee tomorrow. His celebrity=
 is enhanced by his creditable, if losing, run for vice president in 2000, =
but his motives inevitably will be viewed through the prism of 2004's presi=
dential politics.=20
Many Democrats had feared the sober centrist would be reluctant to use his =
influential chairmanship to plumb the Enron scandal; some still question ho=
w aggressive he will be. An early draft of Mr. Lieberman's opening statemen=
t suggests he will play the tough but fair "big picture" investigator, warn=
ing against leaping to conclusions and focusing on what government regulato=
rs could have done.=20
Mr. Lieberman has satisfied Democratic activists by vowing to press for inf=
ormation on the Cheney task force's Enron contacts. He got an assist last w=
eekend from his committee's top Republican, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee=
, who said the White House should "get the information out."=20
Mr. Lieberman received $11,500 from Andersen and $2,000 from Enron since 19=
89. Mr. Thompson accepted $8,800 from Andersen, according to the center's r=
ecords, and nothing from Enron.=20
-- Sen. Carl Levin. At the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Levin's inve=
stigations subcommittee actually will take the lead in digging for insider =
details about Enron's spectacular flame-out, which culminated in the larges=
t U.S. bankruptcy filing ever. Mr. Levin received nothing from Enron, accor=
ding to the center's records, and $3,200 from Andersen.=20
The Michigan Democrat's panel already has sent out 51 subpoenas to Enron an=
d Andersen officials. Among them is one to Wendy Gramm, a member of the Enr=
on board's audit committee and wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm -- the Senate'=
s second-largest recipient of Enron funds, with $97,350 since 1989. Mr. Gra=
mm's personal and political ties to Enron raised questions about his role i=
n coming hearings of the Senate Banking Committee, where he is the top Repu=
blican; yesterday, his office said he will skip hearings that focus on the =
company. The panel, led by Democratic Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, also =
will be looking at financial aspects of the scandal.=20
Separately, the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance panels =
have jurisdiction over a number of issues raised in the financial debacle -=
- and the power to probe Enron's Internal Revenue Service records. The lead=
 actors at Ways and Means have been relatively mute. Montana Sen. Max Baucu=
s, the Finance chairman, this week is asking Enron to voluntarily release i=
ncome-tax records. That move could signal the start of a fuller committee i=
nvestigation into Enron's use of offshore entities as tax shelters, its pre=
paration of tax returns, and overall compliance with federal tax laws.=20
Mr. Baucus has taken $3,200 from Enron, but a spokesman says he will give t=
he sum to a fund for Enron workers.=20

Unaccountable in Washington
By Michael H. Granof and Stephen A. Zeff

c. 2002 New York Times Company

AUSTIN, Tex. -- The first of at least 11 Congressional hearings into the la=
rgest corporate bankruptcy in United States history begins tomorrow. Althou=
gh Enron's executives and accountants have much to answer for, they can be =
forgiven for cracking a wry smile when members of Congress begin lecturing =
them on their dereliction of duty: Congress itself, as much as Enron and Ar=
thur Andersen, bears some responsibility for the current state of affairs.=
=20
The story begins in the 1970's and 1980's, when members of Congress, most f=
rom oil-producing states, pressured the Financial Accounting Standards Boar=
d and the Securities and Exchange Commission not to demand tougher standard=
s for financial reporting in the petroleum industry. At the time, it was cl=
ear that the lawmakers were serving corporate interests, not those of inves=
tors. Now it's clear that this was only a warm-up act.
While the F.A.S.B. is a private organization financed by industry, the boar=
d's authority comes from the S.E.C. requirement that corporations follow th=
e standards it sets. If Congress is unhappy with an F.A.S.B. standard, it c=
an pass a law directing the S.E.C. to ignore it.=20
From 1991 to 1994, members of Congress prevented the F.A.S.B. from issuing =
a standard that would have forced companies to take a charge against earnin=
gs when they issue employee stock options. Congress persisted in this cours=
e of action even though investors like Warren Buffett and the S.E.C. itself=
 supported the F.A.S.B.'s initiative, saying options should be counted as a=
n expense on earnings statements in the same way other forms of compensatio=
n are.=20
The driving forces behind the Congressional opposition were major industria=
l corporations and special-interest groups representing small, high-tech co=
mpanies. If companies counted options as compensation, they argued, earning=
s would decline and stock prices would suffer. Members of both houses calle=
d for hearings and introduced bills that would have hamstrung the F.A.S.B. =
in its attempt to bring clarity to this important issue. In fact, in 1994, =
88 members of the Senate voted for a ''sense of the Senate'' resolution in =
which they informed the F.A.S.B. that its proposed standard would have ''gr=
ave economic consequences'' for entrepreneurial ventures.=20
At one point in the debate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connectic=
ut and now chairman of the committee that will convene tomorrow's first hea=
ring, introduced a bill that would have effectively destroyed the F.A.S.B.'=
s authority to set standards for financial reporting. The bill, proposed as=
 an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, would have required t=
he S.E.C. to vote on every statement issued by the board. In the face of th=
is proposed legislation, the F.A.S.B. had no choice but to drop its proposa=
l to amend the way options are accounted for.=20
In the 1997-1998 session, the F.A.S.B. tried to rewrite the rules affecting=
 derivatives, financial devices whose worth is determined by the value of a=
nother entity, whether it be government bonds, pork bellies or, as was the =
case with some of Enron's derivatives, the price of natural gas. Derivative=
s are complicated and risky, and the F.A.S.B. in its new rules sought to en=
sure that corporate financial statements accurately reflected those risks. =
This time, in the face of opposition from members of both parties in Congre=
ss, the F.A.S.B. was able to withstand the pressure. It issued its new stan=
dards in 1998.=20
But adversity quickly followed this minor success. In the 1999-2000 session=
, members of Congress once again intervened, this time to place barriers in=
 the path of proposed standards on mergers and acquisitions and the way cor=
porations involved in them account for the value of intangible assets like =
good will. The F.A.S.B. had wanted to change the way companies account for =
some costs in such deals, forcing them to write them off over a shorter per=
iod of time. Companies opposed the change, saying the increased costs would=
 reduce their earnings, and lobbied Congress against the change. In the fac=
e of such opposition, once again the F.A.S.B. was required to make a strate=
gic retreat.=20
Yet the true cost of all this Congressional meddling is even greater than t=
he sum of its parts. Taken collectively, these proposed standards would hav=
e merely tweaked the existing accounting model. What is necessary is a comp=
rehensive overhaul of the model itself. The model was designed for the indu=
strial era. It worked fine when plants, equipment, inventories, accounts re=
ceivable -- stuff you could see and touch -- were what made a company tick.=
 It fails miserably when the critical resources of a firm are software, int=
ellectual capital, brand names and fiscal wizardry.=20
Few accountants will deny that the F.A.S.B. was unable to close accounting =
loopholes as rapidly as Enron and Andersen created them. And few will deny =
that fast and loose reporting practices are all too common in the corporate=
 world.=20
Yet Congress has not allowed even a modest tweaking. Imagine, then, the out=
cry if the F.A.S.B. actually got serious about true reform of the current a=
ccounting model. Among the changes it might propose are restoring to the ba=
lance sheet many liabilities, like certain kinds of leases, that are now co=
nsidered ''off balance sheet''; adjusting reported earnings for changes in =
current prices of assets; and recognizing and amortizing the many intangibl=
e assets that are currently not even seen on balance sheets.=20
Each of these changes could have helped regulators and investors see the En=
ron-Andersen debacle coming, or even helped to prevent it. By sending a mes=
sage that such changes are not remotely welcome or politically possible, Co=
ngress paved the way for the current crisis. Congressional involvement in f=
inancial standard-setting has been pure politics, fueled by a system of cam=
paign financing that distorts the pursuit of the nation's legislative agend=
a. If members of Congress are sincere about identifying and correcting weak=
nesses in the standards used for financial reporting, then they should inve=
stigate the old-fashioned way: follow the money. They are likely to find a =
trail that leads to the nearest mirror.

Bush Makes Recess Appointment to SEC

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Amid a flurry of last-minute recess appointments, President B=
ush put a top accounting-firm executive on the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission, which is playing a lead role in the investigation of Enron Corp.'s =
collapse.=20
Mr. Bush, using his power to avoid Senate confirmation of top government of=
ficials, tapped Cynthia A. Glassman of Ernst & Young to serve at the SEC at=
 least until year end. The SEC, which has proposed revamping oversight of t=
he accounting industry, is investigating Arthur Andersen LLP's auditing of =
Enron's books and disclosures that the accounting firm shredded documents r=
elated to its work on behalf of the energy company, which has filed for ban=
kruptcy.
Ms. Glassman, a Republican, has worked at Ernst & Young since 1997 and was =
the firm's director of commercial-bank risk management for two years.=20
Perhaps trying to lessen Democrats' ire, Mr. Bush reappointed Isaac Hunt, w=
ho was originally appointed by former President Clinton in 1996. Mr. Hunt, =
whose term expired more than a year ago, has seen his stock rise of late, a=
s Republicans have been unable to settle on an alternative Democratic repla=
cement.=20
In other appointments, Mr. Bush put Michael J. Bartlett, director of labor =
law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, on the National Labor Relations=
 Board. He also named Iowa State Sen. JoAnn Johnson and Deborah Matz, execu=
tive officer of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations=
, to the National Credit Union Administration's board.

Enron debacle could bring problems for Gramms
Senator could face conflict of interest if his wife is questioned by lawmak=
ers=20
By DAVID IVANOVICH=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Jan. 22, 2002, 9:35PM
WASHINGTON -- Wendy Gramm, a member of Enron's board of directors, stands t=
o lose more than $686,000 in retirement funds because of the company's bank=
ruptcy filing.=20
Besides being an unsecured creditor, the one-time head of the Commodity Fut=
ures Trading Commission likely will be called to testify before one of a my=
riad of congressional panels looking into the Enron debacle.=20
And as a member of the board's audit committee, Gramm is sure to be questio=
ned about what and when she knew about the company's financial problems.=20
Her husband, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday that he will not take p=
art in congressional investigations into Enron's collapse, but will join th=
e discussions about what should be done to avoid similar debacles.=20
"I'm not going to recuse myself on issues that are relevant to all business=
," said Gramm, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee.=20
That panel, chaired by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing F=
eb. 12 to examine accounting and retirement investment issues raised by Enr=
on's collapse.=20
Many current and former Enron employees lost their life savings because the=
ir 401(k) retirement plans were wholly invested in Enron stock.=20
Lawmakers will examine proposals that would force participants in retiremen=
t plans to diversify their portfolios.=20
Such issues, Gramm said, "are not Enron-specific."=20
Sarbanes agrees that Gramm should be able to take part in committee activit=
ies, a spokesman said.=20
But some critics contend Gramm will not be able to draw the line neatly bet=
ween Enron issues and those that apply to all businesses.=20
"He should recuse himself, given that his wife is on the board and his wife=
, potentially, could be in serious trouble," said Tyson Slocum of consumer =
activist Ralph Nader's Public Citizen.=20
As a member of the audit committee with strong government and academic cred=
entials, "she's got some serious explaining to do," added Slocum, who serve=
s as research director for Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Enviro=
nment Program.=20
Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a se=
lf-styled government watchdog group, said he doesn't know how Gramm can avo=
id creating at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.=20
Even when discussing issues such as accounting changes and 401(k) retiremen=
t rules, Noble said, "Enron is going to be the 3,000-pound elephant sitting=
 in the middle of the room."=20
Wendy Gramm first joined Enron's board in 1993, just weeks after stepping d=
own as head of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While at t=
he commission, she had championed deregulation of commodities trading, incl=
uding energy.=20
The Gramms contend they have separate business lives and do not discuss suc=
h work-related concerns at home.=20
"We talk about my taking out the garbage and Texas A&M football," Phil Gram=
m said.=20
Back in 1998, Wendy Gramm sold $207,000 in stock -- her entire Enron holdin=
gs -- and asked the company to pay her for her board work in cash payments =
to a deferred-compensation plan, rather than in Enron shares.=20
The idea was to eliminate any conflict-of-interest problems, so that her hu=
sband could freely participate in the debate over the nation's energy polic=
y.=20
Wendy Gramm sold that stock, her husband points out, before Enron's stock p=
rice rocketed up in 1999 and 2000. Her deferred-compensation fund is now ti=
ed up in the Enron bankruptcy.=20
The conflict-of-interest issue resurfaced in December 2000, when lawmakers,=
 with Sen. Gramm's blessing, approved the Commodity Futures Modernization A=
ct.=20
That bill essentially codified regulations pushed at the Commodity Futures =
Trading Commission as far back as 1989, when Wendy Gramm was a member. The =
measure exempted energy and metals commodities trading from government regu=
lation.=20
The language of interest to Enron, Sen. Gramm noted, was written by lawmake=
rs in the House. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which had jurisdiction o=
ver that portion of the bill, did not change the House language.=20
Gramm, at that time chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, objected to t=
he bill because of some banking provisions he found unacceptable. Under the=
 rules of the Senate, Gramm held up progress on the bill for four months.=
=20
Wendy Gramm, who heads a regulatory studies program at George Mason Univers=
ity in Virginia, had done her own critique of the Commodity Futures Trading=
 Commission's work and raised separate objections to the legislation.=20
Sen. Gramm does not remember being lobbied directly by Enron on the Commodi=
ty Futures Modernization bill, although he was aware of a letter Enron Chai=
rman Ken Lay had written to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., in Septem=
ber 2000, urging passage of the measure. The bill, Lay wrote, would provide=
 "critical legal certainty" for Enron's commodity-trading businesses.=20
Eventually, Gramm and the Clinton administration reached a compromise on th=
e banking provisions and the measure was attached to a spending bill.=20

Auditor Independence: The SEC Chairman Doesn't Get It
By Roger Lowenstein

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt doesn't get it. "Au=
ditor independence is not the cause of the problems that we are witnessing,=
" Mr. Pitt insisted recently. The "problems," of course, refer to Enron, an=
d "the bigger issues" in that unhappy saga relate to "the quality of our di=
sclosures, the penetrability [or lack thereof] of financial reports."=20
No doubt about it, Mr. Pitt, Enron's reports were lacking in quality and im=
penetrable to boot. And anyone who took weeks or months to plough through t=
hem would have figured it out. Especially if they had access to Enron's boo=
ks, had been party to explanations on how its affiliated partnerships relat=
ed to the mothership, and had maybe gotten invited to dinner at Ken Lay's h=
ouse.
But most of us in the public didn't. That's why we rely on public accountan=
ts to audit financial statements and certify that they are in keeping with =
generally accepted accounting principles.=20
What principles Arthur Andersen was following lord only knows. But the firm=
 that blessed not only Enron's books but also Waste Management's and Sunbea=
m's has somewhere in its employ auditors who can tell right from wrong and =
quality from its opposite. If auditors have the right incentives they will =
do so.=20
Mr. Pitt, who in private practice represented, among others, Arthur Anderse=
n, and who, in general, never saw a government action he didn't find worthy=
 of challenging, says now that he doesn't want to throw armies of lawyers a=
nd bucketfuls of taxpayer money at "every problem." Nor does he desire new =
legislation. All that is needed is an outside monitoring group and better d=
isclosure.=20
Indeed, the beauty of disclosure, which lies at the heart of our system of =
public markets, is that it does the work of cops better (usually) than legi=
ons of investigators. Just as a street thug is unlikely to commit a mugging=
 in a well-lit park, a corporate criminal won't often steal if he knows his=
 actions will soon be disclosed.=20
The question is who shines the lamp on corporate activity and -- just as im=
portant -- who makes sure that the beacon does not resort to a lampshade at=
 inconvenient moments? In Enron's case, managers had the audacity to report=
 $425 million of net income in the first quarter of 2001 -- a period in whi=
ch it also reported cash flow from operations of negative $464 million.=20
This bald disparity between cash flow, which is virtually impossible to man=
ipulate, and reported earnings was a clear red flag that something was amis=
s. Andersen, from its own memos at the time, knew it -- and let it go.=20
Enron has been widely compared to Long Term Capital Management, the bond-tr=
ading hedge fund that imploded in 1998. But it is the contrast between the =
two that is illustrative. It demonstrates the difference between problems s=
pawned by poor judgment and those involving conflicts of interest -- in Mr.=
 Pitt's phrase, "auditor independence."=20
At first blush, the two cases seem much alike. Both LTCM and Enron were big=
, complex and secretive. LTCM's traders cut their teeth in financial deriva=
tives, when those markets were new, inefficient and ripe with opportunity. =
Enron, somewhat similarly, was a pioneer in energy derivatives.=20
Over time, and largely thanks to LTCM's success, bond arbitrage became crow=
ded and hedging opportunities narrowed, leading LTCM to branch into new are=
nas, including equities. Enron, similarly, forged into virgin markets, incl=
uding fiber-optic bandwidth, data storage and snow protection for ski resor=
ts -- the latter reminiscent of LTCM's monster trade in "equity volatility"=
 (stock market insurance). Each firm was held in awe by investors and credi=
tors and by legions of worshipful admirers until -- quite suddenly -- it co=
llapsed.=20
But these similarities shouldn't blind us to the fact that Enron and LTCM w=
ere wholly dissimilar in their degree of moral culpability. LTCM's results,=
 when the firm was making money, were genuine, and its traders were the big=
gest losers in the firm's downfall. That they went down with the ship tells=
 us they genuinely believed in the product.=20
Enron's managers, on the other hand, unloaded bucketfuls of stock even whil=
e they were publicly touting it. That's why a criminal investigation is war=
ranted, and why conflict of interest is at the heart of the Enron case.=20
Enron's managers had to know -- indeed, were warned -- that their accountin=
g was highly, highly dubious. Had they feared an accounting in the Biblical=
 sense they never would have tried to report such "results" -- which, of co=
urse, have since been reversed. What made them so certain of Andersen's pro=
tection?=20
For one, Andersen was co-opted by the $27 million it was paid by Enron for =
other, non-audit work and by the reasonable expectation that more such grav=
y would follow. There is an easy solution to this particular conflict: ban =
it. Enron should not be able to otherwise pay off the firm that is supposed=
ly serving as the guardian of its integrity.=20
Mr. Pitt belittles the problem, saying that auditors are conflicted anyhow,=
 just by the fees they receive for audits. Who wants to anger the client by=
 being a pain in the neck and lose the job for next year?=20
But again, the chairman misses the point. Auditors don't work for managers;=
 they work for the directors. Hiring and firing auditors is solely up to th=
e audit committee of the board. But owing to the consulting-type payoffs An=
dersen received and, more seriously, long cultural tradition, auditors beha=
ve as though the client is management.=20
This problem is deeply embedded in our corporate culture. It is why executi=
ves at top corporations from General Electric on down routinely try to "man=
age" their earnings and why their auditors routinely help them. If auditors=
 understood that their true client is the board -- and through it, the inve=
sting public -- they would see that their interest is in disclosing a true =
picture, not a prettified one.=20
But this sort of cultural change is never easy -- in this case only a total=
 overhaul can get the job done. We need an independent watchdog with legisl=
ative teeth, not the administrative wand-waving proposed by Mr. Pitt. In sh=
ort, Congress should create a body that could set standards in public audit=
ing and would also have real disciplinary and enforcement powers to monitor=
 public auditors.=20
Mr. Pitt can still undo the harm from his comment that "there is nothing ro=
tten with the accounting profession." None less than his boss, George W. Bu=
sh, found a new sense of purpose -- an enlarged appreciation for his job an=
d for the meaning of leadership -- when events interrupted what had seemed =
to be a placid era.=20
Harvey Pitt, this is your Afghanistan.=20

Accounting for Enron: Resources, Power Of State Authorities Tested by Ander=
sen
By Russell Gold
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

A4
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Tiny state boards of accountancy are the latest players to step into the wi=
dening investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP following the collapse of Enron=
 Corp.=20
Theoretically, they have formidable strength -- subpoena power and statutor=
y authority to take away Andersen's permit to practice accounting in a stat=
e. But that would be a huge leap for thinly staffed agencies that usually s=
pend their time administering Certified Public Accountant exams and discipl=
ining local accountants who have been convicted of crimes. The agencies hav=
e no ability to pursue criminal charges, but can pursue civil penalties thr=
ough an administrative-law procedure.
In Texas, where Andersen fired its lead auditor for Enron last week for ove=
rseeing document destruction, the State Board of Public Accountancy has ope=
ned an inquiry to determine whether "possible misdeeds, omissions or malfea=
sance" took place. State Rep. Steven Wolens, who requested the investigatio=
n, said if the board recommends the revoking of Andersen's permit, that wou=
ld have "a domino effect. All the eyes would be on New York and California =
to act next."=20
Already other states, including Connecticut and Illinois, have begun their =
own investigations. Other states also may be taking action, but state profe=
ssional regulation laws generally prohibit disclosure of pending matters. D=
avid Costello, president of the National Association of State Boards of Acc=
ountancy, has said state boards "throughout the U.S. are vigilantly trackin=
g" reports about Enron and Andersen. Governors typically appoint board dire=
ctors who then hire permanent staff.=20
Michael Kozik, an attorney with the Connecticut State Board of Accountancy,=
 wouldn't say whether the states were working together. "We have opened a f=
ile and we are starting to explore the legal and accounting issues involved=
," he says. The matter was initiated at the request of state Attorney Gener=
al Richard Blumenthal, who said in a letter to the board that the state and=
 its citizens already have suffered "serious and possibly irretrievable fin=
ancial losses." A state pension fund and agency lost a combined $235 millio=
n.=20
Meanwhile, attorneys general from Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Alabama hav=
e asked the U.S. District Court in Houston to name them lead plaintiffs in =
a nationwide class-action lawsuit against Enron and Andersen. The four stat=
es' retirement pension boards lost a combined $331 million because of the c=
ollapsed value of Enron's stock and bonds. Other states could join as membe=
rs of the class.=20
Amid this case and myriad other investigations, can the Texas accountancy b=
oard -- an agency with five lawyers (the state attorney general can help ou=
t in major cases) and a $550,000 investigation budget intended to resolve c=
omplaints "emphasizing voluntary compliance and education" -- realistically=
 be expected to build its own case?=20
"I think they will be absolutely overwhelmed," says Wayne Shaw, an accounti=
ng professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. "Almost always wha=
t you see is them going after an individual already convicted of something,=
 or investigating a one- or two-person firm. They have never had to deal wi=
th anything like this. I don't think they have the structure or expertise t=
o deal with this."=20
While Mr. Wolens's letter directs the board to investigate the Big Five acc=
ounting firm, Mr. Shaw says it is more likely the board will focus on a han=
dful of Andersen auditors. Andersen lawyers so far have taken steps to sepa=
rate the Chicago firm from the activities of its Houston office, which hand=
led the Enron account.=20
William Treacy, executive director of the state board, declines to comment =
on the Andersen matter, but says "we have the necessary resources to invest=
igate and prosecute cases of a major nature."

Accounting Industry Review Board Votes to End Its Existence in Protest
By Scot J. Paltrow and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The accounting industry's Public Oversight Board, which oversees auditors' =
"peer review" method of self-regulation, unexpectedly voted itself out of e=
xistence, a move that at least temporarily would leave no mechanism in plac=
e for policing audits of public companies.=20
The board's chairman, Charles A. Bowsher, said the abrupt move was meant as=
 a protest to plans announced last week by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt to devi=
se a new body that eventually would replace the oversight board in monitori=
ng the industry.
The announcement, which caught the Securities and Exchange Commission and t=
he Big Five accounting firms by surprise, comes as the accounting industry,=
 in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse, faces unprecedented criticism for f=
ailing to supervise itself effectively amid repeated failure by auditors to=
 detect major accounting irregularities.=20
"We thought that in the public interest we just had to speak up" by voting =
to shut down, said Mr. Bowsher, adding that "it just isn't true" that Mr. P=
itt's proposal would increase independent oversight of auditors.=20
The oversight board, founded in 1977, reviews and must approve the peer rev=
iews accounting firms do of one another. Its staff also investigates "faile=
d audits" in which auditors failed to ferret out companies' violations of a=
ccounting rules. The system has been heavily criticized because no large ac=
counting firm has ever been given an unfavorable review. Mr. Bowsher had ar=
gued that the board could have been a much more effective regulator if the =
industry had allowed it to have real powers to demand records and impose di=
sciplinary measures on firms.=20
The five-member board voted unanimously to "terminate its existence" no lat=
er than March 31. The decision was made in a telephone meeting of the board=
 on Sunday, but was announced yesterday. Although Mr. Pitt has announced br=
oad outlines of his plan for a new body with stronger powers to discipline =
the industry, no formal proposal has been drawn up. If the oversight board =
shuts down as planned, that threatens to leave the industry without an over=
seer of audits at least for several months.=20
Mr. Bowsher said the board felt that Mr. Pitt's plan, rather than increasin=
g independent oversight of the profession, actually would tighten accountin=
g firms' control. For example, he noted, the proposal is for a new board th=
at would have a large minority of its members from the accounting industry.=
 The five members of the current oversight board are prominent people from =
the business world who have no direct ties to the big accounting firms. In =
a letter to Mr. Pitt notifying him of the board's decision, Mr. Bowsher als=
o faulted Mr. Pitt for holding a series of private meetings in recent weeks=
 with officials of the Big Five accounting firms and the industry's trade a=
ssociation, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, before =
he announced his plan on Jan. 17.=20
The AICPA and Big Five firms were Mr. Pitt's clients while he was in privat=
e legal practice before he became SEC chairman.=20
Mr. Bowsher said the SEC and AICPA have contacted him asking whether the bo=
ard would reconsider its decision. He said the board will listen to their p=
roposals but "I would be surprised if we reversed our decision."=20
In a letter to Mr. Bowsher today, Mr. Pitt said the new regime he envisions=
 would have a role for the oversight board and said, "The issues, I think, =
are too important for the POB simply to walk away."=20
KPMG LLP said, "We believe it's irresponsible for the Public Oversight Boar=
d simply to resign."=20
A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP confirmed that chief executives =
of the Big Five firms, including Pricewaterhouse, had held a series of priv=
ate meetings with Mr. Pitt in Washington between Dec. 4 and Jan. 17. He sai=
d the gatherings took place at Mr. Pitt's invitation. He said the firms rep=
orted on progress they had made in response to Mr. Pitt's call in early Dec=
ember for them to come up with a better plan for policing the industry.=20
The SEC plan calls for a new board with stronger powers to oversee audits, =
but it wouldn't be a formal self-regulatory organization like the New York =
Stock Exchange or National Association of Securities Dealers, which derive =
their disciplinary authority from laws passed by Congress, and which themse=
lves are formally subject to SEC oversight.=20
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Mr. Pitt's private meetings with the Bi=
g Five officials, which included Andersen representatives, didn't violate c=
onflict-of-interest rules because he "just got the process rolling" and was=
n't taking official action.=20
John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who has written about regulati=
on of the accounting industry, faulted Mr. Pitt for holding the private gat=
herings. "It's not the high watermark of public accountability when the ind=
ustry to be regulated designs its own regulatory structure in negotiations =
with its former lawyer."=20
Lynn Turner, who was the SEC's chief accountant under former SEC Chairman A=
rthur Levitt, yesterday also faulted Mr. Pitt's proposal and the private ne=
gotiations. The Public Oversight Board's decision to disband "shows you tha=
t what the SEC has proposed is what the accounting profession wants, and ha=
s nothing to do with the public," says Mr. Turner, now an accounting profes=
sor at Colorado State University. "What the POB is saying here is that the =
SEC's proposal was a deal cut with the accounting profession and not with t=
he investing public."=20
Ms. Harlan, the SEC spokeswoman, stressed that Mr. Pitt plans to get input =
from interests besides the accounting industry before the SEC issues a form=
al proposal.

Bidders Circle Over Enron's Indian Unit, Raising Prospect That It May Be Sp=
lit Up
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

NEW DELHI -- The bidding process for the troubled Indian unit of energy tra=
der Enron Corp., which has filed for bankruptcy, could begin early next mon=
th, according to a representative of one of the potential buyers.=20
Some prospective bidders appear most interested in the unit's liquefied-nat=
ural-gas facilities. While creditors have said they want to sell the Indian=
 power plant and LNG business together, this raises the prospect that the I=
ndian unit could be split after it is sold.
Jean-Claude Breton, chief representative in India for European oil company =
TotalFina Elf, said that the bidders and Dabhol Power Co., Enron's Indian a=
rm, might begin due diligence in early February. He said TotalFina was stud=
ying whether to bid. "We need some more time to convince ourselves whether =
or not this project can be made commercially viable," he said.=20
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol is India's largest foreign investment. But it has b=
een plagued by controversy. Last May, the local electricity board -- the pl=
ant's sole customer -- stopped paying Dabhol for power in a dispute largely=
 about pricing.=20
Royal Dutch/Shell last month also expressed an interest in the Dabhol proje=
ct -- primarily its LNG pier and storage depot. A Shell spokesman in London=
 said he couldn't immediately comment on whether Shell would bid for Dabhol=
.=20
French state-owned Gaz de France has a 10% stake in Petronet LNG, which is =
planning to bring liquefied gas from the Middle East to India. A spokeswoma=
n said the company is examining other opportunities in India, although she =
couldn't immediately comment on whether Gaz de France might bid for Dabhol.=
 Indian power utilities BSES Ltd. and Tata Power Co. have also expressed in=
terest in bidding. Enron owns 65% of Dabhol, General Electric Co. and Becht=
el Corp. each own 10%, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns 15%=

Enron partner bound by promises not kept=20

Jan. 22, 2002, 11:25PM
EOTT Energy Partners was battered on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, m=
ainly because of problems related to its former parent, Enron Corp.=20
The publicly traded units of one of the nation's largest independent gather=
ers and marketers of crude oil closed at $10.19, off by $4.86. Early in the=
 day they fell as low as $8.40.=20
Although EOTT itself isn't part of the Enron bankruptcy, Enron's inability =
to pay on past promises will hurt EOTT in several ways.=20
One of the Enron subsidiaries in Chapter 11, Enron Gas Liquids, has a long-=
term contract to sell products for EOTT that can't be honored, which increa=
ses its exposure to price swings.=20
Additionally, Enron can't make up a 22.5-cents-per-unit shortfall on EOTT's=
 cash distribution for the fourth quarter, which leaves holders considerabl=
y short of the 47.5 cents they were promised. The period that ended Dec. 31=
 was the last quarter for this arrangement.=20
EOTT announced Tuesday that the cash distribution for the quarter will be 2=
5 cents. It will make a claim for Enron's 22.5 cents in bankruptcy court.=
=20
This further weakens earnings at a time when slumping crude oil prices are =
shrinking the profit margins on the approximately 350,000 barrels per day t=
he company handles.=20
EOTT officials warned that earnings for 2001 will be below the earlier esti=
mates of 90 cents to 94 cents per unit, while declining to elaborate or to =
provide estimates for 2002.=20
On Tuesday, Moody's placed EOTT's credit ratings under review for a possibl=
e downgrade.=20
"The first weak quarter in two years for our marketing and transportation b=
usiness comes at the worst possible time," said President and Chief Executi=
ve Officer Dana Gibbs.=20
"Although our uncommitted credit lines continue to meet our immediate worki=
ng capital and supplier credit needs, cash requirements over the next sever=
al months are at a historic high, and Enron's bankruptcy has significantly =
impacted the partnership's financing alternatives," he said in a written st=
atement.=20
The company won't disclose more until its fourth-quarter results are releas=
ed in the latter half of February, Gibbs told analysts in a conference call=
.=20
Enron is "a large part of its problems" said analyst David LaBonte of Salom=
on Smith Barney.=20
The publicly traded partnership is independent, but Enron is still the gene=
ral partner. LaBonte of Salomon Smith Barney said in an earlier analysis th=
at he expects the general partnership interest to be put up for sale.=20
Included are the $117 million purchase last year from Enron of an MTBE plan=
t plus liquefied natural gas pipeline and storage facilities.=20
Part of the deal was a 10-year "tolling agreement" with Enron. With this ty=
pe of arrangement EOTT receives a fixed fee, with Enron serving as a middle=
man who doesn't use the MTBE or handle natural gas liquids. MTBE is a key c=
hemical used in gasoline formulas in areas with pollution problems, like Ho=
uston.=20
The bankrupt Enron Gas Liquids dropped out of the agreement, so EOTT began =
marketing the MTBE itself Nov. 29. This exposes the company to swings in th=
e marketplace, said Gibbs.=20
On the storage side there are problems as well. Enron Gas Liquids has the s=
ole right to lease the facilities and until this is resolved EOTT can't neg=
otiate with third parties, he added.=20
EOTT plans to take a $30 million noncash charge to write down the value of =
these tolling and storage agreements.=20
Enron was also supposed to foot the bill to convert the MTBE plant to one t=
hat makes a different additive if the Environmental Protection Agency decid=
es to phase out MTBE, said an analyst who asked not to be identified.=20
There was also speculation that EOTT may have overpaid for these facilities=
, which will be written down on the next financial report.=20
Finally, suppliers who are concerned about Enron's bankruptcy have been req=
uiring more letters of credit from EOTT. A very limited amount of business =
has been lost to people who decided to buy their crude elsewhere, said Gibb=
s.=20
EOTT was formed in 1994 when Enron combined Enron Oil Trading & Transportat=
ion, renamed EOTT Energy, with Enron Products Marketing Co., according to H=
oover's Inc.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: REGULATIONS
Exemption Won In '97 Set Stage For Enron Woes
By STEPHEN LABATON

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -- As it expanded aggressively overseas in the 1990's, =
the Enron Corporation won an exemption from a Depression-era law that would=
 have prevented its foreign operations from shifting debt off their books a=
nd that barred executives from investing in partnerships affiliated with th=
e company.=20
The exemption enabled Enron's foreign operations to engage in the kind of f=
inancial engineering that experts now say was reminiscent of some of the co=
rporate excesses of the 1920's that led to the 1940 law and that were an im=
portant element of the company's meteoric rise and startling collapse.
Had Enron not been granted the exemption, some of its operations in South A=
merica and in Europe would not have been able to structure financial operat=
ions to both conceal them from investors and shift debt off their books.=20
Enron's initial efforts in 1996 to persuade Congress to change the law were=
 thwarted by opposition from a powerful trade group and some federal regula=
tors. The company responded by hiring the former boss of a leading staff of=
ficial at the Securities and Exchange Commission to represent it in negotia=
tions with the agency. In an unheralded five-paragraph order in March 1997,=
 the S.E.C. official, Barry P. Barbash, gave Enron's foreign operations a b=
road exemption from the law -- the Investment Company Act of 1940.=20
How Enron came to get its exemption from the severe restrictions of the law=
 clearly illustrates the ways the company lobbied Washington and the respon=
se by the regulatory system. That system was devised during the Depression =
to protect investors and customers of utilities from a wide range of corpor=
ate abuses that investigators think ultimately took place at Enron.=20
Both Congress and the S.E.C. are reviewing the exemption to the Investment =
Company Act and earlier exemptions that were given to the company by the ag=
ency, including a 1993 exemption from the tough restrictions imposed by the=
 Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.=20
Experts say that the S.E.C. rulings unshackled the company from significant=
 accounting restraints and business dealings between the Enron companies an=
d their executives. The 1997 exemption, in particular, cleared the path for=
 the company to both expand overseas and make greater use of the special pa=
rtnerships that have caused the company so much turmoil.=20
''From a regulatory standpoint, this raises a flag,'' said Joseph V. Del Ra=
so, a former official at the S.E.C. in the 1980's and an expert on the Inve=
stment Company Act. ''It gave them carte blanche to go all over the world a=
nd set up subsidiaries and affiliated entities that would have been prohibi=
ted under the act.''=20
Another expert on the act, Mark A. Sargent, the dean of the Villanova law s=
chool, agreed.=20
''The Enron structure was not a single company with stockholders engaged in=
 operations like an ordinary corporation,'' he said. ''It was similar to an=
 investment company with investments in a bunch of different companies. The=
 decision to exempt those from the kind of protections to investors is now =
coming home to roost.''=20
Arthur Levitt, who was the chairman of the S.E.C. when the 1997 exemption w=
as granted, said today that he had no recollection of it. But he said it co=
uld be a potentially significant part of the agency's role in failing to ov=
ersee Enron.=20
''It may be one of those cases of the nail in the shoe of the horse,'' he s=
aid. ''It may be one of those things that seemed insignificant at the time =
but can wind up being determinative.''=20
Mr. Barbash, the lawyer at the S.E.C. who approved the exemption, said in a=
n interview this week that he viewed the exemption as narrow because it app=
lied only to the foreign operations of Enron and some of its subsidiaries. =
He said that it was successful in that it managed to head off Enron's effor=
ts to have a broadly worded exemption written into the law ''that companies=
 could have then driven trucks through.''=20
''Enron knew the regulatory boxes, and they tried to fashion their business=
es to fall outside of those boxes,'' Mr. Barbash said. ''Much of what's bee=
n written so far about the company is that it turned itself inside out like=
 a pretzel to fall outside of restrictions -- accounting restrictions, taxp=
ayer restrictions and regulatory restrictions.''=20
Another former S.E.C. official who is an authority on the Investment Compan=
y Act, was more critical.=20
''This was a case of giving Enron an inch and they took miles,'' said the f=
ormer official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They were given =
a significant new opportunity, and they took it and flew it smasho into the=
 ground.''=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, did not return a call seeking comment.=20
Mr. Barbash, who at the time was director of the investment management divi=
sion at the S.E.C., said that Enron's lawyers came to him in 1996 after the=
 company had failed to persuade Congress to grant the company broad exempti=
on to the 1940 law.=20
Enron and several of its subsidiaries said they needed the exemption becaus=
e their foreign operations were quickly taking on the characteristics of in=
vestment companies. The act, which regulates mutual funds and other kinds o=
f investment companies, generally applies to companies that hold at least 4=
0 percent of their assets in securities that are passive investments and no=
t controlling interests.=20
A lawyer who represented Enron said that although the company and its forei=
gn subsidiaries had actually controlled many of their overseas ventures, li=
ke power plants, they were unable to have a 51 percent stake in them becaus=
e of local rules and political constraints.=20
In 1996, Congress rewrote parts of the act but refused to grant an exemptio=
n to Enron because of significant opposition from both the S.E.C. and the I=
nvestment Company Institute, the main trade organization for the mutual fun=
d industry and a strong supporter of the law. Mr. Barbash said that in 1996=
, Congressional aides advised Enron's lawyers to seek an exemption directly=
 from the agency.=20
The company decided to retain Joel H. Goldberg, a former director of the in=
vestment management division at the S.E.C., who said today that he did not =
know how the company came to hire him.=20
An Enron official said the company had retained Mr. Goldberg knowing that h=
e had previously been Mr. Barbash's boss and was his predecessor at the S.E=
.C. Mr. Goldberg had been Mr. Barbash's supervisor at the S.E.C. in the 198=
0's and the Labor Department in the 1970's. The two lawyers are now partner=
s at the international law firm of Shearman & Sterling.=20
Mr. Goldberg said he viewed the exemption as a narrowly tailored one intend=
ed to permit the company to continue its overseas projects. But he acknowle=
dged that had the company not been granted the exemption, it would have bee=
n constrained from using any partnerships or shifting debt off the books in=
 its foreign operations.=20
''I guess on the one hand, if they had been subject to the Investment Compa=
ny Act, they probably could not have done these transactions,'' he said. ''=
The subsidiaries would not have existed, and they would have had to make an=
other plan.''

DEBATE
Enron: A simple question of right and wrong

01/22/2002
USA Today
FINAL
A.12
(Copyright 2002)

"To my knowledge, there is nothing that we have found that was illegal."=20
That was Joseph Berardino, CEO of Arthur Andersen, on Sunday's Meet the Pre=
ss, trying to comfort viewers about the integrity of the audits his company=
 performed on the once-mighty energy firm, Enron. Enron's collapse, Berardi=
no said, was a result of a bad business plan. "It failed because the econom=
ics didn't work."
Both statements may very well be true. But they're hardly reassuring. Quite=
 the opposite, in fact. The less illegality found in the Enron debacle, the=
 more chilling the picture becomes for investors.=20
Just look at what Enron, often with the blessing of Andersen, managed to ac=
complish, apparently within the comfortable confines of today's laws:=20
* For nearly five years, Enron inflated earnings by a total of almost $600 =
million. This "legal" practice forced investors to make decisions about the=
 value of Enron's stock using bogus profit figures.=20
* Using off-the-books partnerships and maddeningly opaque accounting, with =
Andersen's approval, Enron shielded about $500 million in debt. That helped=
 keep Enron's credit rating high, but at the expense of misleading anyone f=
oolish enough to trust the numbers coming from the company and the private =
credit-ratings agencies.=20
To be sure, at least one high-level Enron official tried to do the right th=
ing, raising concerns with Enron's CEO Kenneth Lay about the company's acco=
unting practices. And some Andersen officials expressed concern about Enron=
's now-famous "partnerships" and how Enron was crunching its numbers back i=
n February 2001. Even some stock analysts openly puzzled over how Enron mad=
e its money.=20
But since everything looked legal on paper, those asking pointed questions =
were ignored. On Sept. 26, Lay was urging employees to buy company shares, =
telling them it was an "incredible bargain" and emphasizing that Andersen h=
ad signed off on the off-the-books partnerships. Just 20 days later, Enron =
announced a substantial third- quarter loss and a $1.2-billion drop in shar=
eholder equity.=20
Andersen continued to OK Enron's books. And stock analysts were busy toutin=
g its stock right up to the bitter end. As late as Oct. 25, all but two of =
17 analysts were giving Enron stock a thumbs-up.=20
Even if the nation's laws weren't so permissive, Enron very well may have m=
et the same end. In a free-market economy, no business is guaranteed a succ=
essful future. But Berardino's defense that he couldn't find any illegality=
 among all of these acts provides little solace to the thousands of Enron e=
mployees and countless investors who banked on Enron and Andersen for hones=
t numbers and lost billions. Had everyone involved used an ethical compass,=
 rather than a strictly legal one, investors would have been armed with acc=
urate information about Enron's business and the risks it entailed when dec=
iding whether or not to buy its stock.=20
If investors and workers are to be spared calamitous surprises in the futur=
e, merely passing a raft of new legislation won't solve the problem. A chan=
ge of attitude about what is acceptable in executive suites and on accounti=
ng desks is at least as vital.

Business World: Enron For Beginners
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

01/23/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A23
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Let's help the congressfolks who begin their multiple hearings into the Enr=
on bankruptcy tomorrow.=20
The problem wasn't Enron's trading business, which many have associated wit=
h deregulation and therefore with Satanism. Enron's problem was bad assets =
of a conventional variety: a power plant in India, utility and pipeline inv=
estments in Brazil, a waterworks in Britain, unused and inoperable telecomm=
unications assets in this country.
Traditional accounting would have required the company to mark down its cur=
rent earnings to cover the declining value of these assets. Instead, Enron =
chose to avail itself of a dodge, creating outside partnerships to buy the =
assets at list price. Banks put up the money, but the loans were secured wi=
th promises of Enron stock, and if the stock price fell, with promises of c=
ash. That is, shareholders were still on the hook for the bad assets but th=
ey didn't know it.=20
The standard view, that Enron executives were simple crooks, tends to overl=
ook that they were also the company's biggest individual shareholders. If t=
hese were crooks, they were dumb crooks.=20
We might understand, though not approve, if Ken Lay were sitting on a beach=
 in the Bahamas now, his purloined millions in an untraceable Cayman Island=
 bank account. But when the normally dexterous and astute Mr. Lay is handed=
 a loaded gun and manages to shoot off most of his toes before the gun is t=
aken away from him, then the questions get really interesting.=20
We've seen the same scenario with other companies that weren't nearly so fa=
mous for political connections. Cendant almost imploded after it was found =
to have falsely accounted for its customer acquisition costs. Sunbeam under=
 Al Dunlap shipped unwanted barbecue grills to shopkeepers and called them =
sales. These cases (and many like them) had nothing to do with deregulation=
 or campaign finance yet they are of a single species with the Enron disast=
er.=20
One can readily imagine what went through executives' minds: The assets wil=
l bounce back. Our new trading ventures will grow so fast as to dwarf the l=
osses when we eventually are obliged to recognize them.=20
The company had big plans for brokering advertising time, Internet bandwidt=
h and other imagined "new economy" commodities, none of which were working =
out as quickly as hoped. In accounting logic, though, a theory can trump a =
fact if you believe hard enough, and Enron was full of believers (as news t=
his week of Mr. Lay's soured investments in other new economy wonders shows=
).=20
Worse, margins were eroding in Enron's core energy trading business. As we =
noted last June, revenues had quadrupled in a year but profits were up only=
 31% -- a sign that the business was going backward and would be in bad sha=
pe if revenues didn't keep growing spectacularly.=20
Unfortunately, even the quadrupling was largely a function of idiosyncratic=
 conditions in California, which were soon reversed. The sad truth is that =
Enron's business was maturing. There would be no great profusion of new ear=
nings to make up the losses. Enron's accounting gamble had come a cropper. =
The roof finally fell in when the stock plummeted, causing lenders to deman=
d cash Enron didn't have.=20
Why Enron did what it did may, in some sense, be unknowable, but two factor=
s seem to explain why high-growth companies in particular find it hard to t=
ake cognizance of dimming prospects.=20
The Wall Street factor: Enron ran into the dilemma that comes to companies =
whose share prices reflect extravagant hopes about the future that prove un=
founded -- how do you let the air out of your own stock? Our legal system a=
nd the ethos of shareholder capitalism make it very hard for companies to d=
o that, so some stretch accounting logic in an attempt to protect the share=
 price.=20
The psychological factor: Ken Lay's name may be mud among Enron employees n=
ow, but an earlier generation remembers him as a decent guy and irrepressib=
le visionary. But as the Rebecca Mark episode seemed to demonstrate, he had=
 a weakness for the meteoric personalities in his midst. Ms. Mark was the b=
ombshell and livewire who led the company's investment in the Dabhol power =
plant in India, which turned into a political and financial disaster, and t=
hen its foray into the water business, which became another disaster.=20
Everything we've learned about Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege and the =
wunderkind CEO who mysteriously resigned last August, suggests he was anoth=
er personality that Mr. Lay fell in love with. He moved Enron into losing i=
nvestments in fiber-optic bandwidth and other new markets, and oversaw the =
debt-hiding strategy. When Enron's share price began unraveling, he claimed=
 outlandishly that investors should be willing to pay twice the share price=
 for Enron's shrinking earnings.=20
Notice that we don't mention a lack of regulation or the need for campaign =
finance laws. Harrumphing in Washington won't stop the occasional Enron fro=
m falling off the edge.=20
Accountants are right when they say accounting conventions haven't kept up =
with the world. Most of a company's value these days resides in assets not =
measured on a balance sheet, such as management's alertness to opportunity =
(which many saw as Enron's chief virtue). Indeed, an irony that will surely=
 escape Congressional sleuths is that Enron wouldn't have failed if investo=
rs had not rewarded it with an excessively optimistic stock price in the fi=
rst place.=20
The fact is, as trading becomes cheaper and as investors diversify their ri=
sks with mutual funds, the public's appetite for risk has been growing stro=
nger. We push companies to live more dangerously now, to roll the dice on i=
nspired innovation. That's why we dangle large stock rewards in front of ma=
nagements: to overcome their bias in favor of caution and self-protectivene=
ss.=20
The Enron hearings can serve a useful purpose if they foster a realistic vi=
ew of the new, quicksilver corporate order. For instance, high-risk, high-r=
eward, eggs-in-one-basket stock incentives are an excellent tool of behavio=
r of modification when aimed at top executives, who can affect a company's =
share price with every decision. They make no sense for the average employe=
e, who can't.=20
The typical worker is already exposed enough to his firm's fortunes through=
 his job. His pension savings should be put safely out of harm's way. We'll=
 be lucky, though, if the hullabaloo over Enron, which is turning sillier a=
nd shriller by the day, doesn't run right past this obvious lesson and resu=
lt in something truly unwise.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE INVESTORS
In 401(k) Plans, a New Rush to Diversify
By PETER T. KILBORN

BALTIMORE, Jan. 22 -- People were thinking about the safety of their 401(k)=
 retirement funds long before the fall of Enron -- the drop in the stock ma=
rket over the last two years had assured that.=20
But the Enron collapse, in which many of the company's employees lost their=
 retirement savings, has moved people, including those having lunch at Jimm=
y's Famous Seafood Restaurant here, to take action.
''I've got an appointment Wednesday to talk with the representative at Metr=
opolitan Life,'' said Pam, a Baltimore school system employee, who declined=
 to give her full name. Sitting at another table was Roxanne, a state port =
employee, who also refused to give her last name. ''I've got plans to meet =
with my financial adviser to talk about diversity,'' she said.=20
Across the country, from the docks of this industrial city, to Detroit, Chi=
cago, Denver and Silicon Alley, people who once boasted of 20 percent year-=
by-year increases in their 401(k) retirement plans are on the move. They ar=
e making appointments with brokers and their human resources offices, rewor=
king their portfolios and shifting money from the market's fallen stars. Th=
ey are allocating more of their money to safer fixed-income securities and =
blue chip stocks -- companies that retain some of their trust.=20
Donald Clarke, 56, a senior electrical engineer at Bethlehem Steel, was hav=
ing Jimmy's sour beef and dumplings plate. The Enron scandal, he said, shou=
ld put all investors on alert. ''All companies try to put a rosy picture on=
 themselves for the stockholders,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''But they're still su=
pposed to be truthful. Enron wasn't.''=20
Reports of the collapse of Enron employees' 401(k) accounts are stirring pa=
rticular scrutiny of employers that require investment in their own stock. =
''That's something that I'm really going to look into when I find my next j=
ob,'' said Sue Becker, 51, of Evanston, Ill., who recently left a job with =
a food processing company. ''That would definitely be a question I would as=
k in the interview.''=20
Michael Sachs, 28, a lawyer at Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal in Chicago wh=
o has $12,000 to 15,000 in a 401(k) account, agreed. ''I'd be asking that q=
uestion,'' he said.''=20
Paul Colwell, a history teacher at Lincoln Park High School outside Detroit=
, said Enron ''makes me wonder about some of the companies I'm invested in.=
''=20
Mr. Colwell added: ''What have they been doing? Are they as solid as I thou=
ght they were?''=20
Linda Schultz, 46, of Rosemont, Ill., works for Sears, Roebuck & Company in=
 Chicago. Like Enron employees, she is required to hold stock in her compan=
y and has 30 percent of her 401(k) in Sears stock. Unlike Enron employees, =
her stock is worth something: at about $54 a share, it is far above the $15=
 Ms. Schultz paid when she began working at Sears 24 years ago.=20
But in this climate she said she would get rid of the stock if her retireme=
nt plan permitted her to. Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has don=
e work for Sears in the past, Ms. Schultz said. ''People started wondering =
about what was going on with us, and they started getting nervous. You just=
 don't know what's going to happen with the company.''=20
Some investors have thicker skins. Rory MacDonald, 53, who said he works fo=
r a ''worldwide big deal oil and gas company'' he wouldn't name, was taking=
 a cigarette break in Denver's 16 Street Mall. He said his 401(k) account p=
lunged $100,000 last year.=20
Mr. MacDonald, who plans to retire at 63, said he considered directing the =
account into less volatile securities but did not change anything. ''I expe=
ct before my 10 years are up and I retire, the stock market will go back up=
 and I will recoup that loss,'' he said.=20
At Jimmy's, Mr. Clarke was having lunch with Terry Moore, 58, an engineer w=
ho retired from Bethlehem in 1994 after 30 years with the company.=20
Except for the apparent corruption, they said, Enron has nothing on Bethleh=
em, which has also filed for bankruptcy protection.=20
''Bethlehem was 48 cents today,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''When I started buying =
it, it was about $35 a share.'' The decline has meant a $70,000 loss in his=
 retirement account.=20
Before dumping it all, Mr. Moore made money with his Bethlehem stock. ''I b=
ought and sold, bought and sold,'' he said, and managed to get his timing r=
ight.=20
Unlike the many workers whose only retirement fund is a 401(k) account, Mr.=
 Clarke and Mr. Moore also have fixed-benefit pensions, financed entirely b=
y the company, that ensures them a monthly check of a fixed amount througho=
ut their retirements. Mr. Moore collects about $2,000 a month, about $600 l=
ess than he would have received had he not retired early.=20
But those plans, are not as safe as they seem. ''They can change it in a he=
artbeat,'' Mr. Moore said. If Bethlehem was shut down, the government would=
 pick up the pension plan but reduce the benefit.=20
For Barbara Friedman, who was having lunch at Jimmy's, Enron signifies the =
end of an era. ''Two years ago the market was fun,'' said Ms. Friedman, 59,=
 whose two grown children are invested in sunken 401(k) plans. ''Win or los=
e, it was fun. Now it's not fun.''=20
As she paid her check, she continued. ''It isn't just Enron,'' she said. ''=
You had all these high-flying stocks. The worst thing was how attuned we be=
came to those investment managers and television pundits, hanging on their =
every word. That trust has gone.''

New Order: Amid Enron's Fallout, And a Sinking Stock, Tyco Plans a Breakup =
--- Giant's Surprise Move Comes As More Companies Face Push for Clearer Num=
bers --- Suffering for Another's `Sins'
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mark Maremont, John Hechinger and Ka=
ren Damato

As the collapse of Enron Corp. triggers widespread investor anxiety about c=
ompanies with inscrutable finances, giant Tyco International Ltd. -- its st=
ock price depressed amid persistent questions about its books -- announced =
a surprise plan to split into four separate companies.=20
The breakup represents a sharp departure from nearly a decade of acquisitio=
n-fueled growth that transformed Tyco from an obscure maker of fire-protect=
ion devices into one of the world's biggest conglomerates, with $38 billion=
 in annual revenue and a stock-market value of about $95 billion.
The move is an about-face for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's ambitious chairma=
n and chief executive, who last year said he was aiming for $100 billion in=
 revenues by 2006. Now, Tyco is worth at least 50% more broken up than as a=
 whole, he said. While saying that Tyco's accounting practices are spotless=
, Mr. Kozlowski told investors that separating the company into smaller, in=
dependent entities will offer investors "greatly increased simplicity, clar=
ity and transparency."=20
Mr. Kozlowski declared: "A lot of companies are going to suffer for Enron's=
 sins." But he said his spinoff wasn't planned in reaction to the recent dr=
op in Tyco's stock price. Rather, he said, for the past 18 months or so, Ty=
co executives have been frustrated by the low ratio of the company's stock =
price to its earnings, even as the company has continued to deliver strong =
earnings growth.=20
Transparency was exactly what some investors believed was lacking at Tyco, =
whose chief businesses include security gear, medical products, and financi=
al services. The company's acquisitions, while generally regarded as well e=
xecuted, made its financial statements increasingly difficult to analyze. A=
cquired companies disappeared into much bigger Tyco units, making their sub=
sequent performance impossible to track. Some smaller acquisitions were nev=
er even announced.=20
Tyco's breakup marks the latest sign that investors and regulators are dema=
nding more clarity from companies' disclosures to the public. In the wake o=
f the Enron debacle, jittery investors have been fleeing any stock with eve=
n a whiff of accounting controversy. When a wave of fresh accounting rumors=
 about Tyco started soon after Jan. 1, the company's shares tumbled nearly =
25% in less than three weeks, wiping almost $30 billion from its market val=
ue. That created profits for short sellers, whose trading strategy bets on =
a stock's decline.=20
"Enron and others have really shaken things up, and it's provided fuel for =
shorts who have been all over [Tyco] for years," said Bruce Bartlett, direc=
tor of growth investing at Oppenheimer Funds, which owns about 5.5 million =
shares of Tyco in eight different mutual funds. Mr. Bartlett said he doesn'=
t believe any of the buzz about possible accounting problems at Tyco. But i=
nvestors, he said, "hate stories that don't have accounting transparency."=
=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday reminded public companies =
of the need to clearly disclose financial transactions, including off-balan=
ce-sheet financings, in their forthcoming annual reports. Enron used such a=
rrangements to keep large amounts of debt off of its books. There is no sug=
gestion, even from Tyco's critics, that it has employed off-balance-sheet f=
inancing or secret partnerships.=20
Moody's Investors Service, the big credit-rating agency, has made an unusua=
l demand of more than 4,000 bond issuers: to provide new information on any=
 off-balance-sheet arrangements that could pose financial risks.=20
"We need better disclosure about these matters in this reporting season," S=
EC Chief Accountant Robert K. Herdman said in the commission's statement. H=
e urged companies to exceed minimum legal disclosure requirements and also =
said the SEC is continuing to study how it can improve disclosure of esoter=
ic financial arrangements.=20
Auditing firms also are clearly feeling pressure from the very public pillo=
rying of Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. That harsh spotlight is "stiffe=
ning the spines of auditors in other companies," said James Gipson, lead ma=
nager of Clipper Fund, a mutual fund with about $2.5 billion in assets. "Au=
dits taking place right now are likely to be very diligent, much more so th=
an they were a year or two ago," he said. "In the long run, investors will =
be well served by that."=20
Professional investors say they are stepping up their own vigilance because=
 of the Enron meltdown. "We are paying more attention to" companies' more c=
omplex financial engineering, said Steve Fossel, a portfolio manager and vi=
ce president with Berger LLC, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. While Berge=
r has always made an effort to analyze such arrangements, recent events hav=
e moved that "more toward the front of your mind," he said.=20
Tyco's announcement last week of results for its fiscal first quarter, whic=
h ended Dec. 31, provided a prime example of what some investors have calle=
d the company's preference for baffling disclosures. The results featured t=
hree separate changes in accounting practices and a "pro forma" section on =
hypothetical year-earlier earnings. There were also numerous charges and cr=
edits Tyco treated as extraordinary, even though some are considered part o=
f operating results under generally accepted accounting principles.=20
Although the accounting-practice changes were adopted to conform with recen=
t changes in general standards, even some accounting professors were left s=
haking their heads at the complexity of the results.=20
Meanwhile, the Bermuda-registered Tyco has also been lowering its taxes and=
 interest costs through a complex international structure that, in part, in=
volves issuing debt through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Befuddled investors ha=
ve found themselves wading through numerous lengthy footnotes in an attempt=
 to decipher all of this. Some wonder how Tyco has been able to report 40% =
average annual growth in per-share earnings over the last five years with a=
 grab-bag collection of businesses, ranging from disposable diapers to home=
-alarm systems.=20
Tyco's response has been that it chooses the right businesses to acquire, c=
uts costs to maximize efficiency and provides generous incentives to keep i=
ts managers at the top of their game. It has also said that its free cash f=
low -- which it put at $4.8 billion last year -- demonstrates the integrity=
 and authenticity of its earning power.=20
Until the Enron scandal, questions about Tyco's accounting seemed to have s=
ubsided. An SEC investigation of its merger-related accounting ended in 200=
0, when the SEC essentially cleared the company, and the stock had recovere=
d.=20
Mr. Kozlowski said Tyco executives began seriously considering a breakup mo=
re than a year ago but didn't move forward with it until he began informall=
y approaching some directors last month. The company then engaged Goldman S=
achs & Co. to analyze a potential breakup. The final decision took place at=
 a two-day board meeting in Bermuda that ended Monday. "We didn't just wake=
 up a week ago and say, `Hey, the stock is going down. Let's break up the c=
ompany," the Tyco chief said.=20
Under the plan to separate the company into four parts, the security and el=
ectronics units, with $17.6 billion in 2001 revenue, will form the core of =
a slimmed-down Tyco run by Mr. Kozlowski. Three other units -- a finance su=
bsidiary, a health-care business, and a unit making fire-protection devices=
 and "flow-control" equipment, such as valves and pipes -- will each be spl=
it off into a new company. As much as 20% of each new company will be sold =
in initial public offerings.=20
After the IPOs, Mr. Kozlowski said Tyco plans to spin the remainder of the =
three companies out to shareholders by the end of 2002. In addition, Tyco p=
lans to sell its plastics unit, which Mr. Kozlowski predicted could bring $=
3 billion to $4 billion. If all goes as planned, Tyco plans to eliminate $1=
1 billion of its $23 billion in debt, excluding obligations of its finance =
arm.=20
Investors reacted cautiously to the breakup plan, pushing Tyco shares up ju=
st $1.10, to $47.55, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. T=
hat's still far below the nearly $59 level at which Tyco started 2002, and =
well short of Mr. Kozlowski's prediction that the breakup plan would add 50=
% in value for investors.=20
Don MacDougall, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, praised Tyco's plan, estimatin=
g the breakup value of the company at $90 a share. Mr. MacDougall said inve=
stors will be eager to snap up shares in the IPOs, especially of the compan=
y's health-care business, a Wall Street favorite these days. That business =
makes medical products such as sutures, syringes, and diagnostic-imaging su=
pplies.=20
Mr. MacDougall said dividing the company into smaller pieces should allay i=
nvestor suspicion about Tyco's complexity, because each segment will disclo=
se far more detailed information. "Acquisitions at Tyco created financial s=
tatements that are far more complex than the average company's," he said. T=
hat depressed Tyco's share price, he added. "We've long felt that discount =
is inappropriate."=20
But some investors reacted more skeptically. Kevin McCloskey, a portfolio m=
anager at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh, which owns 4.3 million Ty=
co shares, said the plan could deliver higher share prices, but he added, "=
I have to question whether this is the time to give up on their [prior] str=
ategy." He said he suspects that Tyco executives were afraid they wouldn't =
be able to meet their own earnings projections, and with the stock price so=
 low, couldn't make new acquisitions. "So they come up with Plan C, which i=
s split up the company," he said.=20
Piloting the audacious breakup plan through his board in just a month is ch=
aracteristic behavior for Mr. Kozlowski, the son of a Newark, N.J., detecti=
ve who joined Tyco as assistant controller in 1976. After running three div=
isions, he took the reins as chief executive in 1992. The company then had =
$3 billion in annual revenue from such operations as valves, pipes and fire=
-sprinkler systems. By last year, he had expanded revenue 12-fold, gobbling=
 up scores of companies along the way, including ADT alarm systems, AMP ele=
ctrical connectors and U.S. Surgical.=20
In making deals, Mr. Kozlowski insists on a simple formula: Tyco doesn't do=
 hostile deals, and every acquisition has to add to earnings immediately. O=
nce Tyco acquires a firm, it cuts costs, sometimes ruthlessly. On the same =
day in 1999 it bought Batts Inc., a family-run maker of plastic hangers, Ty=
co executives stunned the company's employees by announcing the closure of =
all three factories in its Michigan hometown. Tyco executives said the clos=
ures helped integrate Batts into its other hanger operations.=20
Tyco is highly decentralized, run from a simple, two-story wooden building =
in Exeter, N.H., staffed with top executives and a few dozen accountants, l=
awyers and acquisition specialists. Unit managers are given considerable le=
eway -- and paid handsomely for delivering results. During much of the 1990=
s, the formula was a spectacular success, with the stock rising more than 1=
2-fold between the day Mr. Kozlowski took the helm and early October 1999.=
=20
That was about the time the first serious questions about Tyco's accounting=
 arose. The concerns were aired in a newsletter, published by Dallas money =
manager David Tice. Mr. Tice claimed that Tyco had a history of taking huge=
 acquisition-related charges that could be used to pump up profits later. H=
e also warned that investors weren't paying enough attention to the charges=
, which he said were obscuring the company's actual results.=20
Tyco executives hotly disputed the allegations, but its stock took a steep =
fall after the SEC began an informal inquiry into the company's accounting =
practices. In mid-2000, after Tyco made some minor adjustments in restating=
 its books, the SEC ended its inquiry without taking any action. Bullish in=
vestors saw that as vindication of Tyco's bookkeeping.=20
After the SEC inquiry ended, Tyco kept chugging along, delivering a 42% inc=
rease in per-share earnings in fiscal 2000, before what Tyco called restruc=
turing and other "non-recurring" items, and another 29% increase on a simil=
ar basis last year. But the stock didn't take off as Tyco executives hoped.=
 Instead, it bounced up and down with the market. It closed yesterday below=
 its October 1999 level, prior to Mr. Tice's report.=20
Tyco executives believe they have been victimized, in part, by short seller=
s, who try to profit from a stock's decline by selling borrowed shares in h=
opes of replacing them with shares bought later at a lower price. The compa=
ny has been a favorite of the shorts, who have contended that Tyco's number=
s are simply too good to be believed.=20
For starters, Tyco critics have said the company has been improving its per=
formance by having acquired companies take inflated writeoffs and otherwise=
 manipulate their books in their last few months of independence before bei=
ng gobbled up by Tyco. This period typically isn't subject to any scrutiny =
by outsiders because the acquired company usually doesn't file financial st=
atements for the period.=20
For example, some cite a series of charges by finance company CIT Group Inc=
. last year in the two months before it was acquired by Tyco. CIT posted a =
net loss of $78.8 million in its final two months of independence, when inv=
estors didn't much care. Then, after being absorbed by Tyco, it posted net =
income of $71.2 million in the remaining month of its June quarter. Tyco ex=
ecutives have said the accounting was proper, and that they told investors =
that CIT's one-month results were artificially high owing in part to large =
quarter-end revenue.=20
Others have noted Tyco's seemingly uncanny ability to keep lowering its tax=
 rate, especially in quarters in which it needs extra income. In last year'=
s fourth quarter, the company reported a tax rate of just 19.2%, down from =
24.7% for the first nine months, and 24.2% in the year-earlier period. Tyco=
 has said it had overestimated its tax rate earlier in the year and had to =
adjust it in the fourth quarter. The lower rate added about five cents per =
share to earnings in a quarter in which it beat analysts' expectations by t=
wo cents.=20
Even many veteran money managers have said Tyco's financial statements have=
 been so complex that they didn't understand them fully. Alfred Harrison, a=
 manager of Alliance Premier Growth Fund in New York, which has $12 billion=
 in assets, including Tyco shares, said recently that "nobody knows how the=
y put it together, but they do." Mr. Harrison likened Tyco's complexity in =
some senses to Enron, saying "to some degree, they become faith stocks."=20
When that faith started to diminish in recent weeks, Mr. Kozlowski vowed th=
at he would no longer use Tyco stock to make acquisitions. With the company=
 shouldering $23 billion in debt -- mostly from prior deals -- many wondere=
d how Tyco would be able to keep gobbling up companies. The fear was that w=
ithout dealmaking, the company's growth would begin to falter.=20
Mr. Tice, the Dallas money manager, said yesterday's announcement suggested=
 a repudiation of the company' strategy of growing through serial acquisiti=
ons, financed with a rising stock price and growing debt levels. "This is e=
ssentially Tyco's dream exploding," he said. "The company always wanted to =
get big -- to grow -- not break up."=20
About a month and half ago, Mr. Tice also started shorting Tyco shares in h=
is Prudent Bear mutual fund. He said he did so in part because he believed =
investors were starting to grow more skeptical of companies with obscure fi=
nancial statements. "We just felt like earnings would slow down and that th=
ere would be more concern about accounting issues after Enron," he said.=20
Mr. Kozlowski denied any "defensive" reason for the breakup plan, saying th=
e company was on track to make its earnings targets for this year. He said =
Tyco would deliver $5.5 billion next year in free cash flow -- a measure tr=
acked by many Tyco analysts and investors, who consider it a key indicator =
of earnings quality. Mr. Kozlowski also said Tyco had no reason to be conce=
rned about its debt, which was low considering the size of its total balanc=
e sheet.=20
But at some point, the Tyco chief said, investors were going to start clamo=
ring for a breakup. Instead of waiting two or three years to prove to skept=
ical investors that its model works, he decided on the breakup plan. Someti=
mes, he added, "you just have to pull the trigger and do it."
