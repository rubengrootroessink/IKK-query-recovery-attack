I talked to Chris about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to Scott Neal about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.
