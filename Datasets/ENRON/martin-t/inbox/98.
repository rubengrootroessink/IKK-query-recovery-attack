Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

(This article was originally published Thursday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENE) executive who warned Chief E=
xecutive Kenneth Lay in August that questionable accounting practices could=
 bring about the company's downfall was initially hired by Enron to work on=
 one of the partnerships now at the center of current federal investigation=
s, the executive's lawyer and Enron said.=20
Enron hired Sherron S. Watkins away from accounting firm Arthur Andersen in=
 1993 to oversee the accounting for Joint Energy Development Investment, an=
 off-balance-sheet partnership Enron started with the California Public Emp=
loyees Retirement System to make investments in energy projects, an Enron s=
pokesperson and Watkins' lawyer Philip H. Hilder said.=20
After four years in her post, Watkins expressed concerns about accounting p=
ractices used on the partnership and asked to be reassigned, Hilder said. W=
atkins did some "clean-up" work regarding JEDI in early 1997, and then was =
moved to a new job, he said.=20
"She did raise some concerns at that time," Hilder said. Watkins told curre=
nt Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon, a long-time colleague, that =
she was uncomfortable with the accounting practices she was told to employ =
in her work for JEDI, Hilder said.=20
McMahon declined to comment on the issue.=20
Robert Bennett, an attorney representing Enron in federal investigations of=
 the company, wouldn't comment on whether concerns were raised or how they =
were handled.=20
Last November, Enron conceded it shouldn't have treated JEDI as a separate =
entity. Consolidating JEDI and a related partnership, Chewco Investments LP=
, into its financial reports reduced Enron's earnings by $400 million.=20
Enron auditor Arthur Andersen has said consolidating those partnerships acc=
ounted for most of the restatement of Enron's financial reports, which all =
told reduced the company's earnings by about 20% over a four-year period be=
ginning in 1997.=20

Trouble With JEDI=20

The trouble with JEDI came in 1997, when Enron wanted to establish a new pa=
rtnership with Calpers called JEDI II. Calpers was willing to invest $500 m=
illion in the new partnership, but wanted to recover its $250 million inves=
tment in JEDI.=20
According to published reports and congressional testimony by an Andersen o=
fficial, Enron bought Calpers' interest in JEDI for $375 million, then sold=
 it to Chewco, another Enron off-balance-sheet partnership. Chewco's invest=
ment allowed Enron to avoid booking JEDI-related debt to its own balance sh=
eet. It emerged later that Enron had guaranteed part of Chewco's investment=
, invalidating its status as an outside party and forcing the consolidation=
.=20
As reported, Andersen Chief Executive and Managing Partner Joseph Berardino=
 told a House committee that the firm only learned of Enron's guarantee in =
November, at which time it alerted Enron to "possible illegal acts" within =
the company. Enron said at the time it has always been open with its audito=
r and notified Andersen as soon as it learned the information.=20
Revelations about JEDI, Chewco and other Enron partnerships eventually ruin=
ed the one-time market leader's credibility on Wall Street and led to the b=
iggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The U.S. Justice Department, seve=
ral Congressional committees, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ar=
e investigating the collapse.=20
Watkins warned in her much-publicized August 2001 letter to Lay that Enron'=
s handling of the partnerships could produce such an outcome. "I am incredi=
bly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," she wro=
te.=20
Watkins wrote her letter to Lay one day after then Chief Executive Jeffrey =
Skilling abruptly resigned from the company on Aug. 14, attorney Hilder sai=
d.=20

Work On Raptor, Condor=20

At the time, Watkins had been working with Fastow for a month on a temporar=
y basis on some of the partnerships. Watkins was able to go into detail in =
her letter about transactions with partnerships called Raptor and Condor be=
cause "she was reviewing the assets of Raptor and Condor for potential sale=
," he said.=20
"She saw that there were some serious questions with the accounting operati=
ons and raised some questions and wanted the executives to be aware," Hilde=
r said.=20
The issues she raised - namely that the partnerships were thinly capitalize=
d and insufficiently independent - were those that eventually forced Enron =
to consolidate some of the partnerships.=20
Those close to Fastow now characterize Watkins as a disgruntled employee wh=
o hadn't quickly climbed the corporate ladder.=20
Watkins' lawyer dismissed that conclusion. "It's completely the opposite of=
 disgruntled," Hilder said. "She found great job satisfaction. She had an o=
utstanding work history with Enron."=20
Enron lawyer Bennett also distanced the company from those characterization=
s. "She certainly isn't a kook," Bennett said.=20
As reported, Watkins met with Lay, who asked Enron's outside law firm to re=
view her concerns. The firm, Vinson & Elkins, concluded in an Oct. 15 repor=
t that the accounting for the partnerships was sound, but that Enron could =
face public-relations problems if the details were revealed. Watkins initia=
lly hadn't signed the letter she sent to Lay, but was later convinced to re=
veal her identity by McMahon, at the time the chief executive of Enron Indu=
strial Markets, Hilder said.=20
Watkins brought her concerns about the partnerships to McMahon because she =
has a longstanding relationship with him dating back to the late 1980s, acc=
ording to Hilder. Both worked at MG Natural Gas Corp. and Arthur Andersen.=
=20
They also shared a concern about the partnerships. In early 2000, when he w=
as Enron's treasurer, McMahon raised concerns about partnerships headed by =
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to Skilling, then Enron's president, =
according to The Wall Street Journal. Skilling wasn't concerned, and McMaho=
n moved on to a new post. After Fastow was ousted in late October 2001, McM=
ahon was named CFO.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE AUDITOR
Enron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Documents disclosed yesterday indicate that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman an=
d chief executive of Enron, disposed of stock within days of receiving a le=
tter warning of accounting problems at the company.=20
That letter, from Sherron S. Watkins, a senior employee, ignited an investi=
gation by Enron's outside law firm, which concluded that the accounting iss=
ues could be embarrassing. As part of that inquiry, Mr. Lay met with Ms. Wa=
tkins.
The documents released yesterday by Congressional investigators were intern=
al memos from Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, which the company fired yes=
terday. The documents not only put Mr. Lay's stock transactions and the Wat=
kins letter on a timeline, but also provide the best map to date of what An=
dersen officials considered doing about Enron's accounting.=20
In Houston, investigators continued to interview Enron executives and to pr=
ess for more information on Enron's collapse and Andersen's role, including=
 the destruction of documents.=20
One memo released by investigators revealed that as long ago as February, A=
ndersen workers considered dropping Enron as a client because of concerns a=
bout the disclosure of off-balance-sheet debts.=20
Enron's sudden collapse last fall and the resulting criminal and civil inve=
stigations revolve around Enron's transactions with partnerships formed by =
Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer. Mr. Fastow was ou=
sted in late October as investors grew concerned about the partnerships, am=
ong them LJM1 and LJM2. Enron subsequently disclosed that Mr. Fastow made m=
ore than $30 million off the deals.=20
An e-mail message dated Feb. 6, 2001, released by investigators, showed tha=
t Andersen partners discussed whether to consolidate one of the partnership=
's financial results with Enron's, and it discussed potential conflicts of =
interest confronting Mr. Fastow. The message was reported yesterday by The =
Washington Post.=20
Yesterday, Andersen issued a statement saying that the deliberations descri=
bed by the memo were routine and that nothing ''indicated that any illegal =
actions or improper accounting was suspected.''=20
The firm also acknowledged that senior partners with Andersen in Chicago, w=
here the accounting firm has its headquarters, were involved in the Februar=
y discussions and held conference calls with the firm's Houston office, whi=
ch oversaw the Enron account. An Andersen spokesman said it was not unusual=
 for senior partners to be involved in such meetings about clients of Enron=
's size and complexity.=20
Meanwhile, Congressional investigators have also been told that by Septembe=
r, officials from the Chicago office had joined a review team of Andersen a=
uditors in Houston analyzing Enron's dealings with the partnerships in the =
wake of Ms. Watkins's letter.=20
On ''Moneyline'' on CNN last night, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. B=
erardino, said he had been meeting with the firm's partners, other employee=
s and clients to try to reassure them about the firm's prospects. ''We will=
 do what great companies have done: learn from this experience,'' he said. =
''Our people are very, very confident that we will move forward.''=20
Until yesterday, it had not been clear just when Ms. Watkins wrote her lett=
er warning of accounting problems or when Mr. Lay received it. But her lawy=
er, Philip Hilder, said in an interview yesterday that the letter was writt=
en on Aug. 15, and one of the newly disclosed Andersen memos obtained by Co=
ngressional investigators indicates that her meeting with Mr. Lay had been =
scheduled for Aug. 22 and the scheduling had been done by Aug. 20.=20
It was on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21 that Mr. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shar=
es of stock for $2 million. At the time, the shares were worth $3.5 million=
. Mr. Lay did not report selling the stock, but a lawyer for Enron disclose=
d earlier this week that some shares had been used to repay a previously un=
disclosed loan from Enron. Enron has declined to discuss details of the rep=
ayment, but it seems likely that the shares purchased then were used to rep=
ay the loan. Had Mr. Lay not planned to use the shares for that purpose, th=
ere would have been no apparent reason to exercise the options then.=20
Under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, corporate officials =
are required to disclose sales of their company's stock by the tenth day of=
 the month after the sale. But there is an exception when the shares are su=
rrendered to the company to repay a loan. Disclosures of such transactions =
can be delayed until 45 days after the company's fiscal year ends. For Enro=
n, that will be Feb. 14.=20
As Mr. Lay was apparently reducing his own stake in Enron, he was sounding =
optimistic in public. ''As I mentioned at the employee meeting, one of my h=
ighest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron,'' Mr. Lay wro=
te in an e-mail message to employees dated Aug. 21. ''This should result in=
 a significantly higher stock price.''=20
An Enron spokesman said last night that Mr. Lay ''exercised the options to =
hold those shares,'' but that he did not know whether those ''particular'' =
shares had then been used to repay a company loan.=20
Congressional investigators have learned this week that some Enron executiv=
es, concerned about the company's finances, sought legal counsel on their o=
wn from lawyers outside the company before the financial disclosures last f=
all that ultimately led to Enron's bankruptcy in December.=20
Last night, Salon.com reported that an Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz=
, last summer hired a New York law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacob=
son, to take another look at the company's financial structure. Fried Frank=
, where the S.E.C. chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, worked until last fall, recomm=
ended that Enron end its deals with the partnerships. There was no response=
 to a message left last night at Mr. Mintz's home in Houston.=20
The investigation by the Houston law firm of Vinson & Elkins, a result of M=
s. Watkins's letter, concluded that Enron had done nothing wrong in setting=
 up the partnerships but also said that there was a serious risk of adverse=
 publicity and litigation for the company.=20
In Houston yesterday, investigators of the House Energy and Commerce Commit=
tee interviewed Richard Buy, Enron's chief risk officer, among other execut=
ives. On Friday they plan to interview Richard Causey, the company's chief =
accounting officer. Investigators then plan to conduct interviews across th=
e country about document destruction at Andersen. Investigators have also s=
tarted to receive reconstructed versions of some of the e-mail messages and=
 electronic documents that were destroyed by the accounting firm from Septe=
mber to November.=20
On Wednesday, investigators from the committee spent more than four hours i=
nterviewing David B. Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of auditin=
g Enron, who was fired earlier this week after the firm said he oversaw doc=
ument destruction at Andersen's Houston office despite a regulatory investi=
gation.=20
Mr. Duncan maintained that he was only following a document-destruction pol=
icy re-emphasized in an Oct. 12 memo from an Andersen lawyer, according to =
a person close to the case. He was asked by investigators whether ''it was =
usual in your career for people to talk to you about the document-retention=
 policy,'' this person said. ''He said it's not something that happens all =
the time.''=20
Mr. Duncan also stated that by September, Andersen executives in Chicago we=
re having frequent phone calls with auditors in Houston re-examining Enron'=
s transactions with the partnerships, this person said.=20
The internal Andersen documents paint a complicated picture of a firm where=
 accountants were struggling to evaluate the risks posed by Enron's aggress=
ive approach to accounting. The Andersen executives also worried that the f=
ees received from Enron could appear to compromise their objectivity.=20
''We arbitrarily discussed that it would not be unforeseeable that fees cou=
ld reach a $100 million per-year amount considering the multidisciplinary s=
ervices being provided,'' wrote Michael D. Jones, in Andersen's Houston off=
ice. ''Such amount did not trouble the participants so long as the nature o=
f the services was not an issue.''=20
In a statement yesterday, Andersen said that ''discussion about the potenti=
al that fees could rise to as much as $100 million was not in the context o=
f the firm's desire to grow revenues.''=20
''Rather,'' it continued, ''the discussion related to concerns about the po=
ssibility that the size of the fees could be misperceived as affecting inde=
pendence.''=20
But Mr. Jones's e-mail message also suggested that Andersen's accountants c=
onsider whether the LJM partnerships should be treated as a separate entity=
 for accounting purposes. That suggestion makes clear that nearly a year ag=
o Enron's auditors questioned whether unreported transactions between the c=
ompany and entities like LJM might be improperly characterized in its finan=
cial statements.

Enron fires Andersen=20
Board takes action as new facts surface=20
By JULIE MASON=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20

WASHINGTON -- As evidence surfaced Thursday that Arthur Andersen was worrie=
d about Enron Corp.'s accounting and conflicts of interest as early as Febr=
uary, the one-time energy giant fired Andersen as its auditor.=20
The action by the Enron board of directors is the latest in a round of firi=
ngs and recriminations spawned by the collapse of the Houston-based energy =
company.=20
Embattled Enron Chairman Ken Lay, whose own conduct is under intense scruti=
ny, said company officials are reviewing past Enron accounting practices --=
 and are now looking to hire new auditors.=20
"While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until =
the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in=
 light of recent events," Lay said.=20
Those events include the apparent destruction of thousands of documents per=
taining to Enron by Andersen executives, and firing and disciplinary action=
 taken by Andersen against its employees in charge of Enron's books.=20
Andersen officials responded to their firing by Enron with a statement illu=
strating the growing acrimony between the one-time high-flying allies.=20
"As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's =
business failed and it went into bankruptcy," the auditors said.=20
Investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee were in Houston =
interviewing Enron's former risk assessment officer, Rick Buy, and others a=
s part of a probe of the company's free fall.=20
Ken Johnson, chief spokesman for the committee, declined to identify what i=

To many, the Enron debacle -- the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. hist=
ory -- is a complex soup whose ingredients boil down to some essential less=
ons:=20
About how money can obliterate corporate executives' good sense. About the =
dangers of employees putting all their investment money into one seemingly =
sound basket. About elected officials distancing themselves from a formerly=
 valued contributor -- President Bush's description of embattled Enron CEO =
Kenneth Lay went from "Kenny Boy" to "Mr. Lay" to "a supporter."
To me, the Enron fiasco boils down to a simple question for everyone who cr=
eated it:=20
"How could you?"=20
They're three little words that reflect all the passion and frustration of =
"I love you" -- and that we think far more often. It's the question we sile=
ntly ask the boss who passes us over, the co-worker who disrespects us, the=
 child who lies to us with a sweet, open face.=20
But considering all we know about human treachery, what's stunning isn't th=
at some people treat us poorly. It's that such behavior surprises us.=20
I've wrapped "How could you?" around everyone from commitment-phobic ex-boy=
friends, to the car dealer who tried to charge me $1,300 for a repair for w=
hich I paid $63 elsewhere, to spy Robert Hanssen for selling classified inf=
ormation that could have threatened his nation's -- and his own family's --=
 security.=20
What other response -- besides a stiff jail sentence -- is more appropriate=
 for Enron officers who apparently made millions selling their own soon-to-=
be-worthless stock while preventing their employees from doing the same?=20
The photos of blank-faced young former employees whose trust in corporate A=
merica had evaporated were bad enough. What drove me to "How could you?" wa=
s reading about folks like retired pipeline operator Charles Prestwood -- w=
hose $1.3 million 401(k) nest egg in Enron stock is now virtually worthless=
.=20
I mean, how could one Enron official make nearly $63 million in 14 months -=
- and then watch 20,000 other employees lose their retirement savings?=20
How could anyone?=20
"It's called sociopathy -- people who don't think about or have much empath=
y for the impact of their actions on others," says clinical social worker D=
ennis O'Brien, who often counsels employees of businesses and organizations=
.=20
A Houston native whose neighborhood adjoined that of many Enron honchos, O'=
Brien sounds as baffled as anyone by certain executives' behavior.=20
"These are not the type of people who show up at therapy," he says. "They d=
on't know they have a problem."=20
They aren't just in the business world. Years ago, my friend Elizabeth was =
pregnant with her second child when her husband went off with "friends" to =
a college reunion.=20
"He leaves on Thursday and I don't hear from him the entire weekend," she r=
ecalls. "No phone call, nothing. He just shows up Sunday. I was like, 'How =
could you?' "=20
Her husband, who was actually with a lover, told his pregnant wife the affa=
ir was her fault because she was "fat."=20
But it took Elizabeth seven years to leave him because "I thought it must b=
e something I was doing. . . . I allowed myself to be a victim, but finally=
 realized that what he did was about him. . . . He just doesn't think about=
 how what he's going to do affects other people.=20
"That's what Enron did to the people who worked for them," she theorizes. "=
I used what happened with my ex to learn who I am. I don't know how people =
victimized by Enron will recoup what they've lost."=20
Certainly, Enron's victims have heard enough about what they did wrong. But=
 the rest of us should acknowledge what's tricky about "How could you?"=20
Too often, it absolves us from asking another valid question:=20
"How could I?"=20
"It's sort of like going to a doctor and letting him operate and you don't =
ask questions or get a second opinion," suggests Shelley Lafall, a Silver S=
pring artist. "We've learned not to do that. I guess we'll learn some busin=
ess lessons from Enron."=20
But in fact, she continues, "we all do mean stuff all the time, in little w=
ays -- whether it's a waitress you don't give a good tip to or somebody who=
's bagging your groceries and you're huffing and puffing and looking at you=
r watch."=20
Most people, thank God, aren't coldblooded enough to grab millions of dolla=
rs and then run. But we'll cut off some perfectly nice person in traffic.=
=20
"Usually, I'll let somebody in -- and give myself Brownie points," Shelley =
says. "But sometimes, there's this survival instinct that kicks in to look =
out for number one -- especially when number two is faceless.=20
"It's a hardness that fails to recognize someone else's humanity."=20
Every jerk responsible for the cosmic horror that is Enron should be soundl=
y punished. Yet Shelley has a point when she suggests that those who ask, "=
How could you?" are ignoring a basic fact:=20
"We're just not that far from our primitive selves."

Broadband-unit hype didn't match reality=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20

A year ago this month, at Enron's annual analysts' meeting at the Four Seas=
ons Hotel in Houston, then-President Jeff Skilling was emphatic about the p=
otential of the company's broadband Internet business.=20
At a time when Enron stock was trading in the low $80s, Skilling said the b=
roadband unit alone was worth $40 per share. Enron stock, he said, should b=
e selling for $126.=20
That brought a gasp from many of the Enron Broadband Services employees wat=
ching the presentation on a webcast. The picture he painted was a far cry f=
rom the reality they knew.=20
Not only did many of the 2,000 EBS employees have copious time to kill beca=
use of a lack of customers, they knew the company was actually trying to se=
ll the very heart of the business -- an 18,000-mile fiber-optic data networ=
k, assembled at a cost of $1.5 billion.=20
The effort to peddle broadband's one hard asset, known as "Project Cannon,"=
 was not shared with analysts or investors, but it started to leak out to e=
mployees in December 2000. By March, most employees knew, but few, if any, =
outsiders did.=20
And by April, the company -- while publicly saying it planned to expand the=
 network -- also was trying to quietly sell millions of dollars in computer=
s and telecommunications equipment stockpiled in a warehouse on Shepherd Dr=
ive near Interstate 10.=20
"There wasn't a whole lot of connection between what the management said an=
d what we knew," said Dixie Yeck, a former trader with EBS.=20
Eventually, losses from the broadband business, combined with disclosure of=
 myriad questionable financial transactions, eroded investor confidence in =
Enron. On Dec. 26, EBS followed 28 other Enron affiliates and filed for Cha=
pter 11 bankruptcy.=20
Now, a month after Enron's bankruptcy filing, it's clear that EBS had much =
in common with the hundreds of dot-com and telecom businesses that folded i=
n the past two years.=20
Like dot-coms, EBS always admitted profitability wasn't imminent but would =
take time, hard work and a lot of investment. And, also like dot-coms, it h=
ad a lot of hype, too many employees and not enough paying customers.=20
Enron created the broadband business after its 1997 acquisition of Portland=
 General Electric, a small Oregon utility that was also building its own fi=
ber-optic network. Some Enron employees believed they could do just what co=
lleagues had done in the natural gas business a decade earlier -- turn acce=
ss to the largest Internet data pipelines into a fluid commodity that could=
 be bought and sold on a daily basis.=20
By building more than two dozen "pooling points" -- data-switching hubs tha=
t connected with other networks around the world -- Enron could sell time o=
ver the Internet to send and receive large amounts of data reliably. This i=
ncluded everything from broadcasts of conferences and sporting events to su=
ch mundane traffic as vast amounts of arcane business data.=20
The business reported steep losses every quarter it was in existence, but i=
t still got points from investors for being a pioneer.=20
In the summer of 2000, when it signed a 20-year deal with Dallas-based Bloc=
kbuster Inc. to deliver movies over the Internet to homes, EBS became a sta=
r and the stock rose to record heights.=20
Then-EBS Chief Executive Ken Rice predicted broadband trading would one day=
 equal the company's natural gas retail and wholesale business.=20
"A lot of the guys in that division will say `no way,' but there's no doubt=
 to anyone it will be big," Rice said last spring.=20
It wasn't. In March 2001, the Blockbuster deal fell apart. Long before that=
, company insiders said, there were clear signs of trouble.=20
Though EBS had plans to increase staff significantly, in early 2000 it star=
ted to become a dumping ground for employees cut from operations being down=
sized or eliminated. Several hundred employees from Enron's faltering water=
-industry spinoff, Azurix, were transferred to EBS as a way to keep talente=
d workers.=20
The influx of new people meant roles and responsibilities changed frequentl=
y, said Matt Mitchell, a former sales engineer with the broadband group who=
 was laid off in November.=20
For a while there was plenty of work to go around, with customers to find a=
nd things to trade. But not all the trades brought in cash. Some, for insta=
nce, involved Enron selling access to a particular circuit to Dynegy, which=
 would then sell it to El Paso Corp., which would sell it back to Enron. Th=
e transaction could be treated as a trade, but Enron didn't net any cash fr=
om it.=20
And some of the contracts were so structured that companies would buy long-=
term broadband access without having to pay for it for years. Such deals we=
re done with startup companies in particular, to enable them to get on thei=
r feet without having to lay out cash upfront.=20
Enron, however, would book the full value of the contract in the quarter th=
e deal was closed, insiders said, but many customers never got around to pa=
ying before going out of business.=20
Playing with the numbers wasn't that unusual in EBS, as revelations made in=
 November 2001, after Enron started to come undone, now show.=20
According to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, in June 2000, EB=
S sold an unused portion of its network to LJM2 Co-Investment, one of the n=
ow-infamous partnerships that had been formed by then-Chief Financial Offic=
er Andrew Fastow.=20
LJM2 bought the cable for $30 million in cash and $70 million in an interes=
t-bearing note, an IOU. Enron recorded $67 million in pre-tax revenue from =
the transaction.=20
Six months later, LJM2 sold some of that fiber to other companies for $40 m=
illion, but because Enron helped market the fiber to those buyers, it recei=
ved an "agency fee" of $20.3 million.=20
That same month, LJM2 sold the remaining fiber for $113 million to a specia=
l partnership that Enron had created strictly for the purpose of making tha=
t purchase. So even though EBS technically no longer owned those assets, an=
 Enron-controlled partnership did.=20
The public record of this flip-flopping of assets wasn't nearly as revealin=
g, however. Financial statements Enron made in early 2001 about the deals s=
imply described it as "the sale of excess dark fiber."=20
When the Blockbuster deal fell apart, outsiders started to become more skep=
tical of Enron's claims about the business. When about 250 employees were c=
ut from EBS a month later, the stock started to drop.=20
Analysts said they were never told of plans to sell the network, or even wh=
en the company started to sell millions of dollars in Compaq and Sun Micros=
ystems equipment it had bragged about buying a year earlier.=20
A company spokeswoman said Enron was continually re-examining whether such =
hard assets as pipelines or networks were necessary.=20
Some analysts agree, saying that not having that information doesn't seem v=
ery important, even in hindsight.=20
"They always said the important part of the business would be the trading, =
not the network," said Andre Meade, head of utilities research at Commerzba=
nk Securities. "So getting rid of the assets would eventually be a good mov=
e."=20
But to John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris, the omission of t=
he attempted network sale was significant.=20
"The disconnect there was like night and day," Olson said. "How could they =
get out there and make presentations on their business like they did when t=
hey were trying to unload these other assets?"=20

Enron Chairman Ken Lay has put three of his four Aspen, Colo., properties u=
p for sale for $16.2 million, or reportedly $3.6 million more than he paid =
for them since 1998.=20
They include a 4,537-square-foot log and stone "cabin-style" home listed at=
 $6.8 million and a 4,559-square-foot riverfront residence listed at $6.5 m=
illion.=20
Both have hot tubs, security systems and lawn sprinklers. The larger house =
includes a "caretaker unit," according to the listing.=20
The third property is a 20,266-square-foot vacant lot listed at $2.9 millio=
n. It has a building permit with plans for a home, said Aspen broker Joshua=
 Saslove, owner of Joshua & Co.=20
"They are premier Aspen properties located within walking distance of downt=
own," he said "We have had a substantial amount of interest in them."=20
Lay and his wife, Linda, are not selling a 4,200-square-foot "cottage" they=
 use in the summer and winter, he said. The Pitkin County assessor's office=
 has valued it at $3 million.=20
The "cabin-style" home is seven years old and was purchased by the Lays in =
November 1999. The two-story home has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.=20
The other home, with "considerable" frontage on the Roaring Fork River, has=
 four bedrooms and four bathrooms, Saslove said.=20
Saslove said his company put the three properties on the market on Nov. 12,=
 three days after Enron had agreed to be bought by rival energy company Dyn=
egy Inc. for $9 billion in stock. Dynegy later backed out of the deal.=20
"They seem to be in no great hurry to sell the homes," Saslove said. "But l=

Lay could not be reached for comment late Thursday.=20
Saslove said he did not know how much the Lays would profit if all three pr=

However, The Aspen Times said the couple would get a $3.6 million profit be=
fore taxes, or a 23 percent return on their investment.=20

When Enron Corp. and Blockbuster Inc. joined forces in mid-2000, it looked =
like they were on to something big. The companies announced they would soon=
 be allowing consumers across America to choose from among thousands of mov=
ies, including hot new features, sent via telephone lines to watch on their=
 TVs at home.=20
Announcing the partnership in July, 2000, Enron chairman Kenneth Lay called=
 it the "killer app for the entertainment industry." Blockbuster chairman J=
ohn Antioco said the two companies had come up with the "ultimate bricks-cl=
icks-and-flicks strategy." Oracle Corp. chairman Larry Ellison later commit=
ted his private company, nCube Corp., to provide critical computer hardware=
 and $2-million (U.S.). Mr. Ellison said he was "proud" to be part of the v=
enture.
It looked like another brilliant move by Enron, already a hero on Wall Stre=
et. But within eight months of its launch, the partners had split. Enron's =
impatience "didn't add up," says Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf.=20
As it turns out, Blockbuster didn't know the half of it. Within months of i=
nking the deal, Enron had set up an affiliated partnership, code-named Proj=
ect Braveheart, an apparent allusion to the 1995 Mel Gibson movie. Enron ob=
tained a $115.2-million investment in the partnership from CIBC World Marke=
ts, the investment-banking arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Tor=
onto. In return, CIBC received a promise of almost all earnings from Enron'=
s share of the venture for the first 10 years. Blockbuster didn't know abou=
t Braveheart at the time, Ms. Raskopf says.=20
The partnership had no separate staff and no assets other than Enron's stak=
e in the venture with Blockbuster, which was barely getting off the ground =
in late 2000. Still, in an audacious accounting move, Enron claimed $110.9-=
million in profits from Braveheart in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the fi=
rst quarter of 2001. That amount sharply limited the overall losses suffere=
d by Enron's fibre-optics division in the two periods.=20
At its peak, in March, 2001, the venture with Blockbuster provided only abo=
ut 1,000 test customers with movies in four U.S. cities. Many of those cust=
omers didn't even pay. "It was nothing but a pilot project," says Blockbust=
er's Ms. Raskopf. "I don't know how anyone could have been booking revenues=
."=20
Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., never accounted for any financial gain =
or loss from the short-lived venture, she says.=20
Project Braveheart was one of dozens of outside partnerships that Enron off=
icials created to burnish the company's financial results at a time when it=
 felt under pressure to show high profits that would justify its soaring st=
ock price, according to current and former company executives. One of the r=
easons Enron began sliding toward bankruptcy court last fall was the abando=
nment of some of these accounting manoeuvres, which contributed to huge los=
ses and the collapse of its stock.=20
Some of the partnerships were designed to shift large debts off Enron's bal=
ance sheet and make the company appear more robust in the eyes of investors=
 and credit-rating agencies. Others, such as Braveheart, raised fast cash n=
eeded to fund Enron's ever-expanding array of new businesses.=20
Enron's current chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, says he had nothi=
ng to do with Braveheart or related partnerships. "I'm not going to defend =
them," he says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company has no other comment.=
=20
In exchange for its $115.2-million investment, CIBC was supposed to receive=
 93 per cent of Braveheart's cash flow for 10 years. But Enron made the inv=
estment in the embryonic partnership more attractive by promising to repay =
CIBC the full value of its investment if the partnership failed to be a mon=
ey maker. Three former Enron employees familiar with the partnership deals =
say that this kind of guarantee was designed specifically to attract invest=
ors who otherwise might worry about the viability of the deals.=20
In late November, CIBC said its total unsecured potential losses related to=
 Enron amounted to $115-million. That amount is roughly equal to the sum CI=
BC invested in Braveheart. The bank also said it has secured-debt exposure =
to Enron of another $100-million. Citing "client confidentiality," Rob McLe=
od, a CIBC spokesman, declined to comment on its investment in Braveheart o=
r other Enron partnerships.=20
Separately, three Canadian institutional investors that invested more than =
$175-million in Enron debt securities in October have filed a wrongful-cond=
uct lawsuit against the company's investment bankers and auditor. The suit,=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE STRATEGY
Deals That Helped Doom Enron Began to Form in the Early 90's
By KURT EICHENWALD with MICHAEL BRICK

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 17 -- The financial dealings that played a central role in En=
ron's collapse were begun a decade ago, court records show, by a newly hire=
d financial whiz kid in part to keep debt off the company's books so it cou=
ld grow unimpeded.=20
Those early deals by the finance officer, Andrew S. Fastow -- the first lin=
ks of the complex chain of thousands of partnerships -- were much simpler t=
han the ones that the company developed in the late 1990's. But the records=
 show that they contained many of the hallmarks of the transactions that la=
ter helped bring the company to its knees.
Mr. Fastow, now 40, who was ousted in October, has not spoken publicly abou=
t the events leading to Enron's downfall. But in a 1997 deposition -- from =
a lawsuit contending, essentially, that Enron's business model had been sto=
len from a New York businessman, Bernard H. Glatzer -- Mr. Fastow provided =
answers to some of the questions that investigators are puzzling over: For =
example, why were assets of Enron moved into the partnerships? What role di=
d the accountants play? What motivated it to start down a path that ultimat=
ely led to its demise?=20
In 1991, soon after he joined Enron from Continental Bank in Chicago, Mr. F=
astow worked with a group of Wall Street firms to put together a deal, know=
n as Cactus 1, in which interests in natural gas reserves would be packaged=
 and sold to public investors. But that effort was abandoned as Enron reali=
zed it would make no money from the transaction, largely because the compan=
y could not obtain high enough credit ratings for the securities.=20
''Enron would have lost money compared with the transaction we ultimately d=
id,'' Mr. Fastow said in the deposition.=20
The deal that finally worked was called Cactus III. Rather than packaging t=
he energy assets for purchase by the public, Mr. Fastow constructed a compl=
ex partnership deal for private investors, including the General Electric C=
redit Corporation and a consortium of banks.=20
In describing that transaction in the deposition, Mr. Fastow explained the =
benefits it brought to Enron -- in particular how it allowed the company to=
 maintain the high credit rating necessary to carry out its business strate=
gy. ''If a company like Enron has too much debt on its balance sheet, then =
the rating agencies will lower Enron Corp.'s rating,'' Mr. Fastow said. ''S=
o, we endeavor to find ways to finance activities off balance sheet.''=20
Such transactions, which are legal and common in business, offer corporatio=
ns alternate means of financing, while allowing them to avoid issuing new s=
tock or being weighed down with additional debt.=20
''In making things off balance sheet,'' Mr. Fastow said, ''you're actually =
transferring risks of the transaction to investors. So when you sell someth=
ing to investors, they take some risk, they earn a return from that risk.''=
=20
To put together such complex deals, Mr. Fastow said, the company worked han=
d-in-hand with its auditing firm, Arthur Andersen.=20
''We worked very closely with our accountants, making sure that we are neve=
r violating any of the rules,'' Mr. Fastow said.=20
Ultimately, the decisions by Enron and Andersen to allow certain partnershi=
ps to be pushed off the company's balance sheet helped set in motion the ev=
ents that crippled the energy company. The Cactus III deal involved a compa=
ratively small sum; by last year, the company had moved billions of dollars=
 of assets into partnerships and claimed hundreds of millions of dollars in=
 profits in connection with the deals.=20
It was when Enron, under intense pressure from securities regulators and Wa=
ll Street, reversed that accounting -- pulling the partnerships back onto i=
ts books and eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder's equity in a =
single stroke -- that the company went into its death spiral. The resulting=
 crisis in confidence among Enron's investors, its banks and traders in its=
 stock drove the company to file for bankruptcy protection early last month=
.=20
There is little in the deposition's description of the early days of Mr. Fa=
stow's tenure that indicated the troubles to come.=20
Mr. Fastow was brought into the company as a manager of its Enron Finance C=
orporation and eventually was promoted to chief financial officer. Since th=
e debacle, some of his superiors have maintained that they had little knowl=
edge of Mr. Fastow's activities. But the partnership transactions were revi=
ewed by Arthur Andersen and senior officers of Enron. Moreover, the Enron b=
oard waived the company's conflict of interest policy to allow Mr. Fastow t=
o manage some of the partnerships, dealings that brought him at least $30 m=
illion.=20
The lawsuit in which Mr. Fastow testified was originally brought by Mr. Gla=
tzer against one of Enron's bankers and some individuals. A federal judge r=
uled in favor of the defendants in 1998, but motions for a rehearing are pe=
nding. With the Cactus III transaction, according to Mr. Fastow's testimony=
, two classes of investments were created. The first, Class A, was bought b=
y what is known as a special purpose vehicle -- a legal entity whose operat=
ions are limited to the acquisition and financing of specific assets. That =
structure provides lenders with greater security that they will get their m=
oney back even if a parent company goes bankrupt.=20
The special purpose vehicle borrowed money from a consortium of banks, leav=
ing it with the obligation to repay those loans. The borrowed money was the=
n used to purchase all of the Class A securities in Cactus III. Those secur=
ities, in turn, paid interest which was used to repay the banks for their l=
oans.=20
That structure, Mr. Fastow said, ''was a conduit, in a sense, just a way fo=
r the banks to loan money instead of owning'' a direct stake in the partner=
ship.=20
The second group of securities, Class B, was far less complex. They were so=
ld directly to General Electric Credit, which in return received interest o=
n the investment at a rate that fluctuated.=20
The structure allowed Enron to make money through a series of new transacti=
ons. Cactus III now effectively owned certain gas reserves. Enron sold a co=
ntract, committing it to sell the gas at some future point, Mr. Fastow said=
. Enron then bought the gas from Cactus III, and used it to meet the contra=
ct's obligations.=20
''Hopefully they find a way to sell the gas for more than they purchased th=
e gas,'' Mr. Fastow said.=20
In the end, Mr. Fastow said, the deal was an all-around benefit for Enron.=
=20
''Did I raise money in a cost-efficient manner?'' Mr. Fastow asked. ''I bel=
ieve the answer is yes. I argue that because I did it. I want people to thi=
nk I did a good job.''

Officials at Andersen's head office in Chicago took part in regular confere=
nce calls and discussed destroying documents with the firm's Enron auditors=
 in Houston in the weeks leading up to the purge, Congressional investigato=
rs have learnt.=20
The discussions threaten to ruin attempts by Andersen to contain the Enron =
damage to a few people in its Houston office. Investigators are focusing on=
 high-level, regular contacts between David Duncan, the lead Enron auditor =
fired by Andersen this week, members of his team and senior staff in Chicag=
o.
Mr Duncan told investigators that from mid-September, sometimes two or thre=
e times a week, there were conference calls involving between six and eight=
 people, half of whom were based in Chicago. The group referred to itself a=
s the "expanded review team" and discussed matters relating to the now-disc=
redited accounting at Enron.=20
Enron filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy in the US on December 2. I=
ts downfall has led to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department a=
nd inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress.=20
President George W. Bush has attempted to stop the fallout spreading to the=
 White House as the energy trader's ties to prominent Republicans are being=
 probed.=20
Andersen said when it fired Mr Duncan on Tuesday that he had organised the =
destruction of thousands of Enron documents. It said the destruction was "u=
ndertaken without any consultation with others in the firm".=20
According to people close to the investigations, Mr Duncan has described de=
tailed communications with head office. He believes he is being hung out to=
 dry as Andersen attempts to keep its clients and preserve its integrity.=
=20
Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer in Chicago, was often on the calls, Mr Dun=
can said. She sent a memo to Houston on October 12, after calls had taken p=
lace. The memo directed the auditors to the company's document retention po=
licies. According to Mr Duncan, John Stewart, director of accounting princi=
ples in Andersen's Professional Standards Group in Chicago, also took part =
in calls.=20
Andersen staff in Chicago did not immediately return calls. Staff in the Ho=
uston office referred enquiries to Andersen head office, which also did not=
 return calls.=20
Joining Mr Duncan on the calls from Houston were some staff put on leave or=

Attorneys for Enron assure judge more documents won't be shredded

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp.'s accountants shredded thousands of docume=
nts during the company's collapse, attorneys for Arthur Andersen moved to r=
eassure a judge that no more data will be shredded.=20
The Houston Federation of Teachers, whose members had $30 million in pensio=
n funds invested in Enron stock, have sued for a court order to prevent mor=
e of the energy trader's documents from being destroyed.
Attorney Rusty Hardin on Thursday told State District Judge Caroline Baker =
he would not enter the statement as an official agreement because he believ=
es federal courts have jurisdiction over the issue.=20
George Fleming, representing the federation's members and other investors i=
n Enron stock, filed an amended lawsuit Wednesday requesting a restraining =
order to stop any further document tampering and prevent further payouts to=
 Enron executives except for the normal course of business.=20
The lawsuit names company executives and the Arthur Andersen firm, which ha=
s said its employees destroyed Enron-related financial records.=20
Hardin and Andy Ramzel, his co-counsel, argued against further action in Ba=
ker's court because the matter belongs before a federal bankruptcy judge wh=
ere Enron's case is pending.=20
But Fleming told Baker, "Arthur Andersen did not file bankruptcy. This is a=
 separate proceeding."=20
Attorney Melanie Gray, representing Enron, argued that the debtor's rights =
to control its own assets must be protected.=20
Fleming's co-counsel, Anne Ferazzi, responded, "Arthur Andersen is a nondeb=
tor third party and is not entitled to (Enron's) bankruptcy protection."=20
Baker asked attorneys to expand a list of case citings for her to examine a=
nd will reconvene the hearing at 4 p.m. Friday.=20
The teachers group does not make direct investments for its approximate 5,7=
00 members. Teachers in Texas pay into the Teacher Retirement System, and t=
he money goes into a pension fund and is invested.

When Rules Keep Debt Off the Books --- Did Andersen Act Properly? Firm Is F=
ired
By Ken Brown and Henny Sender
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The once-cozy relationship between Enron Corp. and its auditor blew up in a=
 storm of recriminations yesterday amid questions about what Andersen shoul=
d have done about questionable practices at the energy company.=20
Enron's board fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. While it sai=
d it wanted to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt during the investigat=
ion, "we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events, includi=
ng the reported destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disc=
iplinary actions taken against several of Andersen's partners working in it=
s Houston office."
In a statement released later, Andersen fired back: "As a matter of fact, o=
ur relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it =
went into bankruptcy. Andersen is committed to continuing to address the is=
sues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner."=
=20
The move by Enron, previously one of Andersen's biggest clients, comes as t=
he spotlight of the investigation has shifted to Andersen. In addition to t=
he firm's destruction of documents, Andersen has come under fire for signin=
g off on accounting practices related to partnerships with which Enron did =
business. The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance sheet=
.=20
Yesterday, yet another internal Andersen memo was released by congressional=
 investigators concerning Andersen discussions of the Enron partnerships. E=
nron's publicly filed financial statements included references to the partn=
erships going back to 1999, meaning Andersen was long aware of at least som=
e of Enron's accounting issues. The newly released memos show that in Febru=
ary 2001, Andersen executives held what one executive called "significant" =
discussions about conflicts related to the partnerships and myriad other is=
sues that eventually contributed to Enron's collapse.=20
The question that Andersen now faces is: What should it have done different=
ly?=20
Accounting and corporate-governance specialists say it should have done mor=
e -- but that it didn't is typical. Until late in the game for Enron -- jus=
t a month before it filed for bankruptcy-court protection -- Andersen did w=
hat most accounting firms do when up against an important client with "aggr=
essive" accounting practices: It stuck by its client.=20
The earliest known Andersen memo referencing accounting issues at Enron is =
a Feb. 6, 2001, e-mail that summed up a meeting in which senior Andersen pa=
rtners in Houston and in its Chicago headquarters discussed if they should =
keep Enron as a client. In that memo, an Andersen auditor laid out nearly e=
very accounting issue that would later play a role in Enron's collapse. But=
 the participants in the meeting decided that Andersen "had the appropriate=
 people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement ris=
ks." The memo cites the large fees -- $100 million a year at some point in =
the future -- that Enron, a $52-million-in-fees client in 2000, was expecte=
d to generate.=20
It is rare that big accounting firms ditch clients. "There is almost no tur=
nover among Fortune 50 companies and their accountants; they seem merged at=
 the hip," says Dan Goldwasser, a lawyer with Vedder Price Kaufman & Kammho=
lz in New York. "Does it bother me? I guess it does." Andersen had audited =
Enron since the energy company was formed in a 1985 merger.=20
In a separate statement released yesterday, Andersen said, "Nothing in the =
[February] meeting or the memo [summarizing it] indicated that any illegal =
actions or improper accounting was suspected." It said the reference to $10=
0 million in fees "was not in the context of the firm's desire to grow reve=
nues," but whether the large fees would be wrongly perceived as compromisin=
g it.=20
Andersen's statement added it wasn't until August, when a whistle-blower su=
rfaced at Enron, "that we became aware that individuals within Enron believ=
ed that there may have been accounting improprieties." The statement doesn'=
t elaborate on what Andersen did over the next several months.=20
Congressional investigators also released an Aug. 21 memo, which summarizes=
 a conversation between an Andersen audit partner who wasn't on the Enron a=
ccount, and Sherron Watkins, the Enron whistleblower, outlining her concern=
s about Enron's accounting. Ms. Watkins, one of several Andersen auditors w=
ho had gone to work for Enron, in particular expressed worries about the pa=
rtnerships and then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's involvement in =
them. The partner passed that information on to several Enron auditors at A=
ndersen and to the firm's lawyers, according to the memo.=20
More information about what Andersen knew could come out soon. Congressiona=
l investigators received two new boxes of documents from Andersen yesterday=
, including copies of destroyed documents recovered from Andersen's compute=
r systems. The boxes contain mostly e-mail, mainly from David Duncan, Ander=
sen's lead auditor on the Enron assignment until he was fired Tuesday. Cong=
ressional investigators plan to meet today with Richard Causey, Enron's lon=
gtime chief accounting officer and a former Andersen auditor.=20
Some observers argue that given all the questions surrounding the partnersh=
ips, Andersen should have voiced concerns to the audit committee of Enron's=
 board earlier than it apparently did -- Nov. 2. "Basically, they have an o=
bligation to go to the board of directors, particularly the audit committee=
 of the board, when they come up with anything suspicious or anything contr=
oversial or anything that could have been a potential problem," says John N=
ash, president emeritus of the National Association of Corporate Directors.=
=20
--- Unraveling Andersen's Involvement

Some of the events that came to light recently involving Enron
auditor Arthur Andersen

Feb. 5, 2001: Arthur Andersen officials discuss Enron's "aggressive"
accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a meeting
to decide whether to retain the energy-trading company as a client. An=20
internal memo, drafted Feb. 6, recounts the executives' discussion of
many of the alleged problems that have become the focus of
investigations into Enron's collapse. The memo was addressed to two
Andersen officials, including David Duncan, who headed the Enron
account.

August 2001: Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersen
employee, writes anonymously to Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay with
concerns about potential conflicts of interest and accounting
practices.

Aug. 20, 2001: Date of, according to a second memo by another
Andersen executive, a phone conversation between Watkins and an
Andersen employee, who relays the issues to senior Andersen
management, including Duncan.

Fall 2001: Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm, conducts a preliminary
investigation into Watkins's charges.

Oct. 12, 2001: E-mail by in-house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple
reminds risk-management partner Michael Odom of document-and-retention=20
policy. Temple later tells Andersen that she intended to refer only to
work in progress.

Dec. 2, 2001: Enron files for bankruptcy-court protection.
Investigators focus on Andersen's role.

Jan. 10, 2002: Andersen discloses to investigators that "a
significant but undetermined number" of documents relating to the
Enron audit had been destroyed in recent months.

Jan. 15, 2002: Andersen fires Duncan, saying that he led "an
expedited effort to destroy documents" after he learned "that Enron
had received a request for information from the SEC about its
financial accounting and reporting."

Jan. 16, 2002: Duncan is questioned by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee and the Justice Department, mostly about the February 2001
memo. Duncan tells the investigators he called the February meeting
because he was aware the Enron account posed "significant risk,"
according to one person present during the questioning.

Jan. 17, 2002: Enron fires Arthur Andersen.

Slugfest Is Seen Among Creditors Fighting for Slice of Enron Assets
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Mitchell Pacelle, Henny Sender and R=
ebecca Smith

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

There could be less money available to Enron Corp. creditors than they had =
originally hoped.=20
As thousands of Enron creditors began jousting for a piece of the energy co=
mpany's assets, those owed money -- totaling billions of dollars -- increas=
ingly are concerned about the likely size of the recovery.
Indeed, there is a growing appreciation that the firm funded some of its gr=
owth by setting up financing vehicles and partnerships to which it pledged =
billions of dollars in assets in exchange for cash, upfront. That may leave=
 fewer assets now to divide among creditors.=20
When Enron and some of its units filed for bankruptcy-court protection on D=
ec. 2, they listed assets totaling about $50 billion and debts of $13.15 bi=
llion, not including several billion more in off-balance sheet debt -- maki=
ng it the largest-ever U.S. bankruptcy. But more units since have joined th=
e proceedings, and the company still is completing its internal analysis of=
 "financing structures and claims," noted its chief financial officer, Jeff=
rey McMahon. Its debt level, creditors fear, may now be higher than the ori=
ginal tally.=20
Whatever the final number, Enron's creditors are expected to fight for thei=
r piece of the shrinking pie. "There's going to be a huge grab for this cas=
h," predicted George Hickox, chief executive of Wiser Oil Co., which is owe=
d about $7 million on energy contracts with Enron's trading operation. "Thi=
s case is going to dissolve into liquidation and litigation," he said.=20
It is too early to predict whether Enron will be able to implement its prel=
iminary plan to reorganize as a smaller entity under Chapter 11 of the U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Code, or if it will have to be liquidated altogether. The compa=
ny has until early April to file a formal plan of reorganization that it wi=
ll present to the court. Mr. McMahon, the chief financial officer, says he =
still feels strongly that "liquidation of assets is the worst option for ev=
eryone" and wants to see the company recapitalized.=20
Yet Enron already has faced setbacks that could make it harder to survive b=
ankruptcy. Enron's advisers failed to persuade Swiss bank UBS AG, which rec=
ently agreed to take over Enron's trading business, to give Enron a 49% sta=
ke in the future business, settling instead for a smaller royalty stream. A=
nd Enron surrendered to Dynegy Inc. its most valuable pipeline system, Nort=
hern Natural Gas, which was supposed to become a core piece of the reorgani=
zed firm.=20
"Whether or not Enron is going to reorganize or liquidate is the question o=
f the day," said lawyer Thomas Lauria of White & Case, which represents Mir=
ant Corp., an energy concern that is an Enron creditor.=20
Creditors have good reason to question the value of assets available to the=
 bankruptcy estate. Through a series of partnerships and "special purpose e=
ntities," beginning in the mid- to late-1990s, Enron quietly pledged assets=
 as well as the expected revenue streams of many of its investments. For ex=
ample, it formed separate partnerships around some European power assets, t=
he expected revenue from a video-on-demand venture with Blockbuster Inc., a=
 pulp mill, various commodities contracts, "dark" broadband fiber and the l=
ike.=20
Mr. McMahon said the company still is going through its many "finance vehic=
les" to determine their impact on the bankruptcy estate. "It's early days i=
n terms of a reorganization plan," he said, adding that the firm expects to=
 work closely with creditors to see that they are paid as much as possible.=
 He also added that "we still have lots that's not tied up in" partnerships=
 and other arrangements.=20
The company's fate rests in part on gaining cooperation from the 15-member =
creditors' committee appointed by the U.S. trustee to represent the interes=
ts of all creditors. But already questions have been raised about whether t=
he makeup of the panel, which includes J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigrou=
p Inc., fairly represents the interests of all creditor constituencies.=20
"How would you feel if you were owed $16 million by Enron North America [a =
trading subsidiary], and the creditors' committee was controlled by money-c=
enter banks that have all these cozy relationships with Enron Corp.?" asked=
 John Nabors, a lawyer representing Exco Resources Inc., a Dallas oil-and-g=
as production firm that is owed $16 million on trading positions with Enron=
 North America. "It makes me real nervous. I find it hard to believe they'r=
e looking after my interests," he said.=20
Nonsense, counters a representative of the creditors' panel. Luc Despins of=
 Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, lawyer for the committee, strongly disput=
ed that the money-center banks control the group, noting that each member h=
as a single vote, and that creditors of Enron's trading business have three=
 seats on the panel. "All committee members," he said, "have the interests =
of all creditors at heart."=20
--- Bankruptcy Chapters: Eleven or Seven?

One of the primary purposes of bankruptcy is discharging debts to
give a debtor a `fresh financial start' by extinguishing the debtor's
personal liability on dischargeable debts.

Chapter 11

-- Frequently referred to as `reorganization' and generally used to
reorganize a business.
-- Individuals with large federal or state tax obligations may use
Chapter 11 because an extended period of time may be obtained for the
repayment of the taxes.
-- Generally allows the debtor to continue business operations while
proceeding with a confirmed Plan of Reorganization, which must meet
certain statutory criteria. One rationale for business reorganizations=20
is that the value of a business as an ongoing concern is greater than
it would be if its assets were liquidated and sold.
-- Firms can liquidate; they don't necessarily go into chapter 7 to
liquidate.

Chapter 7

-- The Bankruptcy Code's liquidation chapter, sometimes referred to
as a `straight bankruptcy.'
-- Used primarily by individuals who wish to free themselves of debt
simply and inexpensively, but also may be used by businesses that wish=20
to liquidate and terminate their business.
-- To qualify for relief, the debtor must be an individual,
partnership or corporation.
-- Relief is available under Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of
the debtor's debts, or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent.

NATIONAL
ENRON FIRES ACCOUNTANTS ; DISMISSAL A MOVE OF DESPERATION, EXPERTS SAY
James T. Madore and Elaine S. Povich National Correspondents

01/18/2002
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro
1A
(Copyright 2002 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Enron Corp., faced with a mushrooming financial scandal, Thursday night fir=
ed accounting firm Arthur Andersen for destroying potentially incriminating=
 documents last fall.=20
The dramatic move, severing a relationship that went back more than a decad=
e, came two days after Andersen's top brass acknowledged that partners in i=
ts Houston office ordered the destruction of documents and deletion of e-ma=
ils about Enron's financial affairs after learning of a federal investigati=
on. Andersen on Tuesday fired its lead partner who supervised the Enron aud=
its and disciplined seven others.
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay cited the recent revelations of misconduct by An=
dersen as justification for ending what had been a close relationship betwe=
en the two companies.=20
"We can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events," said Lay, w=
ho has been criticized for not warning Enron investors and employees of its=
 imminent collapse into bankruptcy last fall. He pledged to begin a search =
for new auditors immediately.=20
Andersen officials ridiculed their dismissal.=20
"As a matter of fact, our relationship with Enron ended when the company's =
business failed and it went into bankruptcy," the Chicago- based accounting=
 giant said in a statement. Bankruptcy court documents show that Andersen i=
s owed almost $2 million by Enron.=20
Experts described Enron's jettisoning of Andersen as a "desperate move" des=
igned to protect the company from lawsuits and criminal sanctions. They als=
o said it took chutzpah, because Andersen auditors repeatedly warned Enron =
management about accounting irregularities involving off-the-book partnersh=
ips.=20
"This is a significant development, but it's surprising that Enron is dumpi=
ng Arthur Andersen rather than the other way around," said Leo Stevenson, a=
 law professor at Western Michigan University's Haworth College of Business=
. "This reminds me of when bank robbers agreed to stick together until they=
 are caught, and then it's everybody for themselves."=20
Protecting interests=20
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. E=
arlier, stock in the one-time Wall Street darling plummeted after Enron adm=
itted that accounting errors would cause it to restate earnings for the pas=
t five years. Andersen reportedly had demanded the restatements, but the ne=
ws wiped out the investments of shareholders and employees, because it sent=
 Enron shares into a free fall.=20
These developments attracted the attention of investigators at the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission and later on Capitol Hill. In recent days, Ander=
sen officials have scrambled to safeguard the firm's reputation for integri=
ty, the most important asset for auditors of public companies.=20
"There's so much bad going around that everybody is trying to protect thems=
elves, and that's what Enron did in firing Andersen," Stevenson said. He al=
so said Andersen employees now would be free to cooperate with federal inve=
stigators. "This lessens the relationship and increases the likelihood that=
 both parties will look out for their own vested interests, not those of an=
yone else."=20
In Washington Thursday, congressional investigators were looking at the rel=
ationship, questioning why Andersen had chosen to continue working for Enro=
n. The investigators noted that in February 2001, senior Andersen managers =
were aware of irregularities at Enron and debated whether to drop the compa=
ny as a client. Internal Andersen memos, made public on Thursday, showed An=
dersen executives were concerned that Enron was hiding much of its debts.=
=20
The documents also indicated that Lay, Enron's chairman, disposed of stock =
within days of receiving a letter in August warning him of accounting probl=
ems.=20
Memos studied=20
House investigators focused on a Feb. 6 e-mail from Michael Jones, a senior=
 accountant in Andersen's Houston office, to other senior Andersen official=
s, reporting on a meeting convened the day before on whether to retain Enro=
n as a client. In the memo, Jones said there were "significant" discussions=
 about Enron's financial activities. But in the end, the Andersen officials=
 decided to continue to serve Enron, perhaps, in part, because of the estim=
ated $100 million in annual fees the account was bringing in, according to =
the memo.=20
In a letter to Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino, House Energy and =
Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., and Rep. John Dingell of M=
ichigan, the committee's highest-ranking Democrat, asked for all records re=
lated to the Feb. 5 meeting, along with all documents relating to subsequen=
t meetings and actions involving the Enron account.=20
On Wednesday, committee investigators interviewed former Andersen partner D=
avid Duncan, who was in charge of the Enron account and who was fired the d=
ay before by Andersen, after it was revealed he directed the document destr=
uction.=20
Committee officials said Duncan's interview led to the questions about the =
client retention meeting and the subsequent e-mail.=20
In addition, the committee released an Aug. 21 memo from Andersen partner J=
ames Hecker saying he had been contacted by Enron whistleblower Sherron Wat=
kins. Watkins first warned Lay about improper accounting practices in a let=
ter, also dated Aug. 21, which has been provided to congressional investiga=
tors. She then, apparently, contacted Andersen.=20
Andersen's Jones, in detailing the "client retention" meeting in the e-mail=
, noted that questions were raised about possible conflicts of interest of =
Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer of Enron, who has been descri=
bed as central to the web of partnerships that kept loans and losses off En=
ron's public accounting statements. He was placed on leave in October.=20

NATIONAL
CONGRESS WANTS ANDERSEN TO PROVIDE MORE BOOKKEEPING DATA ENRON SEVERS RELAT=
IONS WITH ITS ACCOUNTING FIRM

Enron fired accounting firm Arthur Andersen yesterday as the feuding corpor=
ations both came under growing scrutiny for their roles in the collapse of =
the world's largest energy trading company.=20
Enron cited Andersen's destruction of thousands of documents and its accoun=
ting advice. For its part, Andersen said its relationship with Enron ended =
in December when the company filed for bankruptcy.
"We can't afford to wait any longer," Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a =
statement, announcing that Enron's board of directors had dismissed Anderse=
n.=20
Enron's announcement came just hours after the House Energy and Commerce Co=
mmittee demanded that Andersen provide more documents detailing what the au=
ditors knew about Enron's use of questionable partnership to keep hundreds =
of millions of dollars in debt off the company's books.=20
Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Anderson, said the accounting firm remained=
 "committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of =
Enron in a forthright and candid manner."=20
As to Andersen's dismissal by Enron, Dorton said, "As a matter of fact, our=
 relationship with Enron ended when the company's business failed and it we=
nt into bankruptcy."=20
Andersen has acknowledged that it destroyed Enron-related documents, possib=
ly as early as last September. Lay cited the document shredding and Anderse=
n's firing of the head of its Enron account as reasons for dismissing the f=
irm.=20
Ten congressional committees are investigating the Enron collapse as well a=
s Andersen's auditing of the energy company. The Enron bankruptcy has left =
thousands of workers without jobs and their retirement money -- much of it =
in Enron stock -- essentially gone. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as it=
s stock fell from $83 a share a year ago to less than a dollar.=20
Documents obtained by House investigators have shown that Andersen had conc=
ern at least a year ago about some of Enron's business practices and that i=
ts use of partnership might pose problems with federal regulators.=20
During a high-level meeting in early February, Andersen executives expresse=
d concern about Enron's off-the-books accounting of profits from its partne=
rships, especially one headed by Andy Fastow, at the time also Enron's chie=
f financial officer.=20
Summarizing the meeting, Andersen accountant Michael Jones wrote in an e-ma=
il that the discussions "focused on Fastow's conflicts of interest ... and =
the amount of earnings Fastow receives" from the partnership while also Enr=
on's financial officer.=20
Another document obtained by House investigators disclosed that Andersen of=
ficials were told last August by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins of he=
r serious concerns about the off-the-books deals at Enron and that the comp=
any "will implode in a wave of accounting scandals."=20
However, Andersen decided to continue to serve Enron, noting that the fees =
from the Enron account could reach $100 million a year and that the risks p=
osed by Enron's business practices could be managed.=20
The Jones memo went to David Duncan, who headed the Enron account for Ander=
sen and earlier this week was fired by the accounting firm.=20
Jones suggested that Andersen further investigate whether the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission might have problems with Enron's use of its partnersh=
ips. Duncan has told House investigators that no such investigation was pur=
sued.=20
Enron on Nov. 8 acknowledged to the SEC that it had overstated its profits =
by $586 million as it shielded losses in the complex partnerships, includin=
g the one headed by Fastow.=20
SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt yesterday declined any comment on the recent Enron=
 disclosures.=20
Andersen, in a statement, characterized the February 2001 meeting about Enr=
on as not unusual and said its purpose was to provide a general review of t=
he Enron account.=20
"Nothing in the meeting or the memo indicated that any illegal actions or i=
mproper accounting was suspected," said the Andersen statement.

Andersen's troubles continued to worsen Thursday as it became clear that se=
veral top executives in the Chicago headquarters knew as early as February =
of the controversial partnerships that ultimately led to the energy trader'=
s collapse.=20
Also Thursday, Enron said its board voted to fire the accounting giant as t=
he company's auditor, effective immediately. In light of disclosures that A=
ndersen executives destroyed documents sought in the government investigati=
on of the Houston-based company, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said in a state=
ment, "We can't afford to wait any longer."
But the firing was an empty gesture, according to Andersen Chief Executive =
Joseph Berardino, since the business relationship between the two firms end=
ed when Enron filed the largest corporate bankruptcy ever on Dec. 12.=20
Seeking to defend the embattled accounting firm, Berardino said in an inter=
view Thursday that he was unaware until a few days ago that Sherron Watkins=
, a top executive of Enron, had raised questions about the accounting treat=
ment of the company's finances.=20
He also said a high-level review of the Enron account conducted nearly a ye=
ar ago in which Andersen executives described the energy company's trading =
activity as "intelligent gambling" was performed merely in the normal cours=
e of business.=20
The Big Five accounting firm has faced harsh criticism in recent weeks for =
its handling of Enron's books. It faces investigations by the Justice Depar=
tment, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and sev=
eral congressional panels.=20
Andersen said Tuesday it would fire David B. Duncan, the partner in charge =
of the account, for ordering the destruction of documents. It also suspende=
d three other partners and announced plans for a new management team in its=
 Houston office.=20
Duncan was among those participating in the Feb. 5 meeting in which key Chi=
cago- and Houston-based partners discussed Andersen's potential conflicts a=
nd those of Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
The next day, Andersen partner Michael Jones described the meeting in an e-=
mail to Duncan and Thomas Bauer, one of those suspended Tuesday.=20
The e-mail highlighted concerns about what was described as "Fastow's confl=
icts of interest" in heading one of Enron's off- balance sheet partnerships=
, known as LJM. Andersen partners also questioned the veracity of Fastow's =
income from LJM.=20
LJM and other similar partnerships played a key role in the collapse of the=
 energy trader, carrying huge amounts of debt that were kept out of public =
view in its books.=20
Among those described as "attendees" via phone were Steve Samek, Andersen's=
 U.S. country managing partner; Gregory Jonas, the firm's audit division ch=
ief; and Robert Kutsenda, the firm's global risk management head.=20
The partners discussed the level of fees Andersen would get for conducting =
audit, consulting and internal work for Enron--a relationship critics say w=
as fraught with potential for conflicts.=20
"We arbitrarily discussed that ... fees could reach a $100 million- per-yea=
r amount considering the multidisciplinary services being provided," Jones =
wrote. "Such amount did not trouble participants as long as the nature of t=
he services was not an issue," the e-mail stated.=20
Berardino said the meeting was a normal part of handling any audit. "Every =
year we evaluate every client," said Berardino. "We assess the risk of the =
client, the issues of the client, the people assigned to the client. The me=
mo is frankly a normal part of our process. It was no secret in our firm."=
=20
Berardino said he could not provide "an exact date" when the Chicago headqu=
arters first became aware of the concerns raised in the e-mail about Enron.=
 "We have accounting experts that continually consult, not just with Enron =
but with all our clients all over the U.S., on highly complex accounting is=
sues. They just happen to be located in Chicago."=20
Separately Thursday, Andersen sent the House Energy and Commerce Committee =
two new boxes of documents that contained, among other things, some e-mails=
 written by Duncan that were deleted and then recovered, according to Ken J=
ohnson, a spokesman for the panel.=20
In Houston, a team of committee investigators interviewed Rick Buy, Enron's=
 risk assessment officer, Johnson said. The investigators plan to interview=
 Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, on Friday.=20
"Our investigators will be fanning out around the country interviewing peop=
le who may have some knowledge of the document destruction," he said.=20
The committee on Thursday also released the full text of an Aug. 21 memo wr=
itten by Andersen audit partner James Hecker.=20
That memo revealed the details of a conversation between Hecker, who was no=
t involved in the Enron account, and Watkins, the Enron corporate vice pres=
ident who attempted to warn Enron's Lay about the energy trader's perilous =
financial practices.=20
Watkins had sought out Hecker, a social acquaintance, as a "sounding board.=
"=20
According to the memo, Watkins' consternation was heavily focused on the LJ=
M partnership and Fastow's involvement with it. At the time of her conversa=
tion with Hecker, Watkins worked for Fastow.

Andersen: No Sign Of 'Any Illegal Action' At Feb 5 Mtg

(This report was first published late Thursday.)=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Arthur Andersen LLP said a meeting last year to di=
scuss Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) was a routine matter and wasn't driven by suspici=
ons of illegal or improper accounting.
"This was a routine, required meeting consistent with our policies and prac=
tices," Andersen said in a statement issued late Thursday. Nothing at the F=
ebruary 5, 2001, meeting or follow-up memos indicated "any illegal actions =
or improper accounting was suspected," Andersen added.=20
Andersen audited Enron's books and congressional investigators have asked i=
t to provide details on the meeting and a memo summarizing it. Andersen sai=
d it provided the memo to investigators voluntarily, stressing it made "no =
effort to conceal this information."=20
According to the memo, Andersen officials discussed whether fees paid to th=
e firm by Enron might pose an "independence issue."=20
The memo also flagged other items of discussion, including Enron's "aggress=
ive" structuring of transactions and its "intelligent gambling" on mark-to-=
market accounting.=20
"The memo was prepared to document our annual risk assessment of the Enron =
engagement," Andersen said.=20
The Chicago-based Big Five firm said it reviews major accounts annually to =
determine if the firm wants to retain them as clients.=20
If a client is found to be too risky, Andersen said it may resign as its au=
ditor, something it has done hundreds of times in recent years. In other ca=
ses, it said the firm will agree to keep a riskier client, but may add more=
 auditors, procedures or controls.=20
Meeting to discuss Enron's risks wasn't unusual, Andersen said. Similarly, =
it said the fact that a number of audit partners took part in the meeting, =
in person or by phone, wasn't out of the ordinary.=20
Discussion of related party transactions with off-the-books partnerships ti=
ed to Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, and their materiality to=
 Enron's own financial reports, was done "to be sure we had considered all =
the issues," Andersen continued.=20
While auditors commented that "Enron is aggressive in its transaction struc=
turing," Andersen said discussion centered on whether "appropriate parties =
within the firm were being consulted" to ensure judgments were "informed an=
d correct."=20
Fees also were discussed, but Andersen said a $100 million figure wasn't to=
ssed out as a possible target for revenue growth, but was mentioned to high=
light concerns that having such a lucrative client could be "misperceived."=
=20
Talk of fees centered on "making sure the nature of the firm's services did=
 not compromise independence," the audit firm said.=20
Ultimately, according to its memo, Andersen decided "to retain Enron as a c=
lient," judging that "we had appropriate people and processes in place to s=
erve Enron and manage our engagement risks."=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Arthur Andersen's death by a thousand cuts continu=
ed apace Thursday, as a House investigating panel issued a new request for =
documents related to the Big Five auditing firm's discussions last February=
 about whether to retain Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) as a client.
As disclosed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee late Wednesday, a F=
eb. 6 e-mail indicated key Andersen officials met the previous day to discu=
ss whether to end the auditing firm's lucrative relationship with the Houst=

Michael Jones, an Andersen auditor in Houston, e-mailed David Duncan, the l=
ead auditor for the Enron account, a summary of the previous day's "signifi=
cant discussions" about questionable off-the-balance-sheet transactions at =
Enron.=20
The talks centered on "conflicts of interest" stemming from the millions fo=
rmer Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow received by overseeing the=
 special purpose entities involving the transactions, the e-mail showed.=20
Andersen officials consider whether to forgo the more than $100 million in =
fees the company expected to earn from the Enron account, but ultimately de=
cided they could manage the risks of continuing its association with the de=
als, which ultimately led to Enron's stunning financial collapse last year.=
=20
The new request for Andersen documents came one day after committee investi=
gators met with Duncan, whom Andersen recently fired for destroying documen=
ts related to Andersen's Enron account.=20
"Our investigators were disappointed by the limited nature of Mr. Duncan's =
memory," a Democratic committee spokesperson said late Wednesday. "We expec=
t documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks."=20
The committee's Jan. 17 letter to Joseph Berardino, Andersen's managing par=
tner and chief executive, asked for documents related to:=20
-the discussion of Fastow's conflicts of interest;=20
-the amount Fastow earned from setting up the offshore partnerships involvi=

Andersen falls deeper into Enron crisis.

Arthur Andersen lurched deeper into crisis yesterday after it emerged that =
the accountancy firm may have been aware of the problems at the collapsed e=
nergy firm Enron as much as one year ago.=20
It also became apparent that the Enron employee who had warned the company'=
s chief executive Kenneth Lay of an impending crisis in August had made her=
 concerns known to Andersen at the same time. The accountancy firm faces bi=
llions of dollars in potential lawsuits from disgruntled investors and ther=
e is growing speculation that it may not survive the Enron debacle.
Enron's descent into the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history yesterday =
led to changes in the way accounting firms are regulated in the US. The sec=
urities and exchange commission announced plans for a new independent regul=
atory body to oversee the accounting profession.=20
Chairman of the SEC, Harvey Pitt said the industry was crying out for repai=
r after a decade of neglect.=20
Congressional investigators discovered a memo dated February 6 2001 that re=
counted a meeting between Andersen executives where the question of whether=
 or not to retain Enron as a client was discussed.=20
The memo said that Andersen executives had talked about the off balance she=
et ventures that were carrying much of Enron's debts and which eventually l=
ead to its collapse. It also detailed a discussion about a potential confli=
ct of interest for Enron's then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who=
 controlled one of the ventures.=20
Andersen confirmed the contents of the memo but said it was simply a regula=
r annual review and retention meeting. The company also said it had been as=
sured by Enron that an outside firm of lawyers was examining the claims of =
the whistleblower in August.

Enron, auditor Andersen trying to pin responsibility for collapse

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron Corp. and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are trying =
to pin responsibility on each other for allowing questionable financial pra=
ctices to continue and push Enron toward bankruptcy. Enron abruptly fired A=
ndersen, citing its destruction of thousands of documents and its accountin=
g advice.=20
Sniping back, Andersen said Thursday its relationship with Enron ended in e=
arly December when the company slid into the biggest corporate bankruptcy i=
n U.S. history. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and many had their r=
etirement accounts - predominantly in Enron stock - essentially wiped out.
Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, said the accounting firm's of=
ficials dutifully informed Enron's general counsel after learning of the co=
ncerns of an Enron executive in August. Enron told the Andersen officials t=
hat it had engaged a law firm to investigate, Berardino noted.=20
---=20
Lawmakers investigating Enron have accepted more than $700,000 in political=

WASHINGTON (AP) - More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from En=
ron Corp. to the members of seven congressional committees investigating it=
s collapse, but none of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe.=
=20
That doesn't surprise government watchdogs.=20
Instead, senators and representatives are getting rid of Enron's money.=20
Among the 118 congressional investigators on the committees, Texas' two Rep=
ublican senators, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, are the two biggest =
beneficiaries of the Houston-based energy company's contributions.=20
Hutchison, who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, accepted $99,500 from=
 Enron from 1989 through 2001. She said Thursday she would donate $100,000 =
to a charitable organization for laid-off workers at Enron, which declared =

Enron Scandal: Bank Fallout
CIBC would like to forget nightmare: Total writeoff likely: Enron's 'projec=
t Braveheart' seemed too good to be true

WASHINGTON - For CIBC World Markets, the deal in mid-2000 seemed too good t=
o be true.=20
Here was an opportunity from the world's largest energy trader and the Unit=
ed States' top video renter to get in on the ground floor of the hot commun=
ications broadband market to distribute films to consumers by telephone.
For an investment of just US$115.2-million, CIBC would receive almost all t=
he earnings from Enron Corp.'s share of "Project Braveheart," named after t=
he 1995 Mel Gibson movie.=20
But Blockbuster did not know about the Braveheart side deal, and the Blockb=
uster-Enron deal eventually fell apart. Fewer than 1,000 people received th=
e cutting-edge service -- and none of them paid. Yet Enron still managed to=
 book profits of almost US$111-million from Braveheart during the final thr=
ee months of 2000 and early into 2001, virtually offsetting the losses in i=
ts fledgling fibre-optics division, according to a detailed account in The =
Wall Street Journal.=20
For its part, CIBC is reluctant to talk in detail about the Project Bravehe=
art investment that will likely end up as a total write-off -- and a nightm=
are the Toronto bank wants to forget.=20
"CIBC's exposure as a result of the Braveheart transaction is contained in =
the numbers we announced in November," said Rob McLeod, CIBC's spokesman in=
 Toronto, referring to the bank's disclosure late last year that it had US$=
115-million in senior unsecured loans, letters of credit, derivatives and s=
ecured exposures of approximately US$100-million tied up in Enron.=20
"We stand by our November announcement concerning our exposure to Enron," M=
r. McLeod added yesterday.=20
It appears that CIBC is just as much a victim as are Enron's other investor=
s and employees in what is turning out to be a hocus-pocus world of off-the=
-books investments and debt parking -- all designed to prop up Enron's fina=
ncial image at a time when it was spiralling into the history books as corp=
orate America's largest failure.=20
Six Congressional committees, the U.S. Justice Department and the Securitie=
s & Exchange Commission have launched probes into the collapse of the now-b=
ankrupt Houston-based energy trader, and the roles played by its senior exe=
cutives and key auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. The Enron board voted yester=
day to fire Andersen as the company's auditors, effective immediately.=20
The investigations are not yet formally underway, but the unravelling of En=
ron has moved at breakneck speed, most dramatically this week with the reve=
lation that the Chicago head office of Andersen was fully aware as far back=
 as February, 2001, that there were serious problems with Enron's accountin=
g practices.=20
A memo, dated Feb.6, referred to a meeting of Andersen executives who talke=
d about the amount of debt Enron had kept off its books and whether Enron s=
hould be dropped as a client. Ultimately, Andersen stayed on to perform bot=
h auditing and other services, which generated about US$53-million in fees =
in 2001.=20
The memo also appears to support secret testimony by David Duncan, the Enro=
n auditor who was fired Tuesday for ordering the shredding and destruction =
of thousands of Enron-related documents and e-mails after it became known t=
he SEC had launched an investigation in late October.=20
Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and two of its k=
ey assets -- its energy-trading division and its natural gas pipeline -- ar=
e being sold off.=20
On Wednesday, before the Congressional energy and commerce committee, Mr. D=
uncan insisted he was only doing his job and had received approval from the=
 Chicago office to destroy the documents. Congressional investigators also =
heard that Sherron Watkins, an Enron executive, had raised concerns about a=
ccounting problems with unusual partnerships that Andersen signed off on in=
 February.=20
The SEC moved yesterday to tighten U.S. accounting rules through a new regu=
latory body to oversee the industry. Complaining there were "too many accou=
nting failures," Harvey Pitt, the SEC chairman, said the new private-sector=
 panel will be able investigate accountants.=20
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession,=
" Mr. Pitt said. "We cannot afford a system like the present one that facil=
itates failure rather than success."

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't do a thorough r=
eview Enron Corp.'s annual reports for at least three years prior to the en=
ergy trading company's collapse, people with knowledge of the process told =
The Wall Street Journal.=20
Twice in the 1990s, the regulator gave Enron waivers from two regulations t=
hat would have triggered extensive financial disclosures about its operatio=
ns.
The Enron (ENRNQ) scandal has raised numerous questions about the checks an=
d balances in America's financial system. A major issue: How did such a maj=
or company get away with making indecipherable disclosures about its far-fl=
ung trading operations and complicated corporate structure, which Wall Stre=
et analysts and some Enron executives confessed they couldn't understand?=
=20
One answer that is starting to emerge from people familiar with the regulat=
ory system is that the SEC failed to conduct a thorough review of the compa=
ny's financial statements, even though the agency is responsible for review=
ing investor disclosure documents to make sure companies clearly explain th=
eir operations, financial condition and risks. Rep. John Dingell of Michiga=
n, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, recentl=
y asked the SEC in a letter how it failed "to require adequate disclosures =
over the years."=20
An SEC spokesman declined Thursday to comment on the details of how the age=
ncy handled Enron over the past decade. An Enron spokesman also declined to=
 comment.=20
Enron's problems escaped earlier detection in part because the SEC wasn't l=
ooking. Staff in the SEC's division of corporation finance, which reviews a=
nnual reports and company applications to sell stock, most recently studied=
 Enron's annual reports for 1996 and 1997. Internal records show the SEC ha=
d looked at those Enron statements because there is a record of two comment=
 letters with questions for Enron about the reports in September 1997 and S=
eptember 1998, although the specific details of the inquiries aren't clear.=

WASHINGTON - Enron Corp., Arthur Andersen LLP and several of their present =

Canadian institutional investors file suit against Enron's Wall Street bank=
ers: 'Wrongful conduct' claim

NEW YORK - Toronto-based Silvercreek Management Inc. and several other Cana=
dian institutional investors have filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal cour=
t blaming Enron Corp.'s Wall Street investment bankers for the losses they =
have incurred.=20
The suit claims that "the wrongful conduct which underlies this case is fou=
nded on Wall Street and in Manhattan, where Enron's investment bankers sold=
 the securities which propped up the pyramid."
The Canadian institutional investors say they poured more than US$175-milli=
on into Enron debt securities during October 2001.=20
The investors claim Enron's bankers earned heavy underwriting fees and cont=
inued to tout Enron's debt even as the company collapsed. The banks "knew o=
r should have known" that Enron was engaged in extensive "off-book" transac=
tions to conceal debts, and defrauded investors by marketing the securities=
, according to the suit.=20
Legal experts predict more litigation to follow that seeks relief from Enro=
n bankers such as Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney unit, Goldman Sachs=
 Group Inc. and Banc of America Securities.=20
The banks are "perceived as deep pockets with insurance coverage," said Ric=
hard Tilton, a bankruptcy specialist in private practice in New York. In a =
case such as Enron's, where a bankruptcy judge has suspended investor litig=
ation against the company itself, "it's very common to sue parties involved=
 in the transactions," such as bankers who underwrite securities offerings,=
 he noted.=20
Salomon, Goldman and Banc of America, a unit of Bank of America Corp., decl=
ined to comment. The suit also blames auditor Arthur Andersen for contribut=
ing to the mess. Andersen didn't return a call seeking comment.=20
Pat Villareal, a securities litigation partner in the Dallas office of Jone=
s Day, said the suit against Enron's investment bankers "in all likelihood =
might be an attempt to bring an action that's outside the confines of the b=
ankruptcy proceedings."=20
The investment banks could argue that the suit belongs in bankruptcy court =
because the allegations are tied "inextricably to Enron and its officers," =
she said. If that happens, the suit -- like others against Enron -- would b=
e put on indefinite hold, part of an automatic bankruptcy order that suspen=
ds litigation to allow a company's executives to focus on restructuring.=20
Even if the suit is allowed to proceed in federal court, it remains to be s=
een whether investors could hold Enron's bankers responsible.=20
If the banks argue that they were misled by Enron's financial statements as=
 they prepared prospectuses, they might have to admit some failure in their=
 own due diligence reviews, Mr. Tilton said.=20
"It would be embarrassing for the investment banks to say they were led dow=
n the road and had no idea what was going on," he said. "Claiming ignorance=
 is not a particular helpful defence if you're before a jury and particular=
ly if you're in federal court on securities laws."

Enron probe is yet to begin.

Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

MUMBAI: Six months after the announcement of a judicial inquiry into the En=
ron issue (July 11 2001) and three months after a retired supreme court jud=
ge, Sudhakar Karddukar, was appointed to head the Commission (October 25, 2=
001), the probe is still not begun.=20
Mantralaya officials told TNN the government had not yet finished providing=
 the infrastructure for the commission. Financial provisions were still bei=
ng finalised and the necessary staff of 10 persons being provided. A decisi=
on has been taken to provide an office at Arun Chambers at Tardeo.
Energy secretary R. B. Buddhiraja told TNN the Commission was likely to beg=
in work next week. Replying to a question of whether an inquiry into the pr=
oject would be of any effective use after the power major Enron Corp, had c=
ollapsed in Houston and the Dabhol Power Company was up for grabs, he said =
it was not for the ministry to decide. The commission would have to decide =
its own role.=20
The inquiry has been given six months to probe the two phases of the Dabhol=
 project, the power purchase agreement and its history, and the possible po=
litical fallout. If the Commission does get under way it is likely to take =
much longer than six months, depending on the response to the public notice=
 and subsequent developments.

Imagine for a moment the quandary that faced Sherron Watkins, Enron Corp.'s=
 would-be whistle blower.=20
Worried that company losses were being hidden in murky partnerships, the fe=
isty Enron vice-president of business development took her concerns straigh=
t to the top last August.
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scand=
als," she wrote to Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay.=20
Enron's Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins, reviewed her complaints and duti=
fully determined that the accounting gymnastics were "creative and aggressi=
ve" bookkeeping, but not inappropriate.=20
The matter was dropped, and Ms. Watkins's warning is now eerily prophetic. =
We now know that the belated disclosure of hundreds of millions of dollars =
in debts to those partnerships helped sink Enron.=20
But what if Ms. Watkins had pursued her complaint further -- to Enron's aud=
itors, to its board of directors, to regulators, to the police, to Congress=
 or even the President of the United States? Where would she have found a s=
ympathetic ear?=20
Given Enron's vast web of political connections, greased by millions of dol=
lars in political contributions, validation would have been uncommonly hard=
 to find.=20
Follow the money trail from Enron's Houston home to Chicago, New York and W=
ashington, and the portrait emerges of an entire system awash in apparent c=
onflicts of interest.=20
For starters, the lawyers at Vinson & Elkins could hardly be expected to be=
 unbiased.=20
Enron was its biggest client. And its lawyers helped craft the suspect part=
nership deals of which Ms. Watkins complained.=20
Enron's auditor, Chicago-based Arthur Andersen LLP was also working both si=
des of the fence. It collected hefty fees for auditing the energy company, =
providing business advice and doing the books for one of the partnerships.=
=20
With nowhere in Houston to turn, Ms. Watkins might have looked to the U.S. =
Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates Enron and the auditing =
profession. But SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, a securities lawyer, worked for A=
ndersen before joining the SEC.=20
In Texas, the state Attorney-General and a judge handling shareholder lawsu=
its have already stepped aside because of conflicts of interest because the=
y received Enron political funds.=20
Going to the feds would also have been problematic. U.S. Attorney-General J=
ohn Ashcroft -- the country's top cop -- took $58,000 (U.S.) worth of Enron=
 cash during his failed 2000 U.S. Senate run. He and his entire Houston-bas=
ed staff of attorneys have since stepped down from a criminal probe of Enro=
n.=20
The maze of Enron links inside the Bush White House is mind-boggling. The B=
ush team took $424,000 from Enron and its executives in 1999-2000.=20
So close were President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney -- bo=
th former Texas oilmen -- to Mr. Lay that they called him "Kenny Boy." The =
Enron boss was also instrumental in helping to craft the Bush energy policy=
. Economic adviser Larry Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron last year for se=
rving on a special company board. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick serv=
ed on Enron's advisory council. Mr. Bush's top political strategist Karl Ro=
ve owned so much Enron stock that he had to sell it after joining the White=
 House to avoid running afoul of federal ethics rules. Marc Racicot, the ch=
airman of the Republican National Committee and Mr. Bush's lead negotiator =
in the Canada-U.S. lumber fight, worked as an Enron lobbyist. The Secretary=
 of the Army is a former Enron executive.=20
And on it goes. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales is a former partner at=
 Vinson & Elkins, Enron's law firm. The law firm was also one of Mr. Bush's=
 biggest political patrons, ponying up more than $200,000 for Mr. Bush's 20=
00 presidential run.=20
On Capitol Hill, where no less than 10 committees are now picking through t=
he Enron carcass, an objective eye is equally hard to find.=20
The pockets of seven out of 10 sitting senators and nearly half of the 435 =
House members are lined with Enron cash.=20
Like Enron, Arthur Andersen was also a big Bush donor, giving $146,000 to h=
is 2000 presidential run. The head of Andersen's Houston office, who this w=
eek was demoted for his involvement in shredding Enron papers, raised more =
than $100,000 for Mr. Bush.=20
No, Ms. Watkins had nowhere to turn.=20
But this isn't just her problem anymore. The Enron saga cries out for an in=
dependent arbiter to dig through the slime. Its investors, employees and cr=
editors deserve an objective accounting.=20
Sadly, this administration and this Congress are in no position to deliver =

Politicians Trade Shots Over Enron
By SCOTT LINDLAW
Associated Press Writer

01/18/2002
AP Online
Copyright 2002 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Democratic congressional leader said he documented 17 p=
rovisions in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan that benefited Enron,=
 and demanded anew that the White House list contacts with the bankrupt ene=
rgy trading company.=20
The administration again refused on Thursday, calling the request by Rep. H=
enry Waxman, D-Calif., "a partisan waste of taxpayer money."
Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, has been=
 asking Cheney since April to turn over records on whom he met with as he d=
eveloped the national energy strategy. Cheney has refused, though the White=
 House acknowledged that Enron representatives met six times with Cheney or=
 his aides on energy issues last year. Enron has been the largest single do=
nor to President Bush.=20
Waxman said that because he was stonewalled, he did his own analysis of wha=
t Enron sought and what Enron got in the energy plan.=20
"The analysis reveals that numerous policies in the White House energy plan=
 are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated," Waxman wrote Ch=
eney in a letter dated Wednesday.=20
Among the examples: energy deregulation initiatives, support for trading in=
 energy derivatives, proposals to facilitate natural gas projects, the gran=
ting of eminent domain so power lines could be built more quickly and spur =
development in India.=20
"This creates the unfortunate appearance that a large contributor received =
special access and obtained extraordinarily favorable results in the White =
House energy plan," Waxman wrote.=20
Waxman's findings came as the administration was under intense scrutiny for=
 its contacts with Enron in the weeks before it went bankrupt.=20
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the energy plan contains only prop=
osals that Bush and Cheney believed would help make the nation more energy-=
independent.=20
"The allegation by Congressman Waxman that anything was put in that plan fo=
r political purposes is, of itself, a partisan waste of taxpayer money," Fl=
eischer said.=20
Fleischer promised that "the administration will continue to be forthcoming=
 in answering questions and providing information."=20
But he again declined to provide specific lists of contacts between the adm=
inistration and Enron during energy task force meetings.=20
"There is a very important principle involved here, and that is the right o=
f the government and all future presidencies whether they are Democrat or R=
epublican, to conduct reviews, to receive information from constituents, re=
gardless of their party or their background, in a thoughtful and deliberati=
ve fashion," he said.=20
Asked whether releasing lists of contacts would reassure the public that no=
thing improper took place behind closed doors, Fleischer said: "You're aski=
ng for us to prove a negative, and that's a road we're not traveling."

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Republicans say the collapse of Enron Corp. and result=
ing federal investigations of the energy trading company that has been Pres=
ident Bush's largest single donor shouldn't hurt the party in the 2002 elec=
tions.=20
"Enron is an issue that is not a political issue," Republican National Comm=
ittee Deputy Chairman Jack Oliver said Thursday at the party's winter meeti=
ngs in President Bush's home state.
"Enron is a situation where people have been badly hurt, people have lost t=
heir jobs and their life savings," Oliver said. "The president and many mem=
bers of Congress are moving forward, not to make it partisan, but to try to=
 get to the bottom of it to make sure it doesn't happen again."=20
The company donated heavily to both parties, and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay=
 has been Bush's biggest campaign benefactor.=20
Asked if fallout from Enron's collapse into bankruptcy and the company's ti=
es to the administration will lead to a new congressional push for campaign=
 finance reform, Oliver said, "We'll have to wait and see."=20

Lawmakers investigating Enron have accepted more than $700,000 in political=

WASHINGTON (AP) - More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from En=
ron Corp. to the members of seven congressional committees investigating it=
s collapse, but none of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe.=
=20
That doesn't surprise government watchdogs.
"If every member of Congress had to recuse themselves from any legislation =
or any business affecting any one of their donors, Congress would come to a=
 screeching halt," said Jeff Cronin, spokesman for Common Cause.=20
Utah's two Republican senators were listed among the recipients, with Bob B=
ennett receiving $8,053 and Orrin Hatch getting $3,000. Bennett is on the S=
enate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Hatc=
h is on the Senate Finance Committee.=20
Some senators and representatives are getting rid of Enron's money.=20
Among the 118 congressional investigators on the committees, Texas' two Rep=
ublican senators, Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, are the two biggest =
beneficiaries of the Houston-based energy company's contributions.=20
Hutchison, who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, accepted $99,500 from=
 Enron from 1989 through 2001. She said Thursday she would donate $100,000 =
to a charitable organization for laid-off workers at Enron, which declared =
bankruptcy Dec. 2. She also said she would stay involved in investigating E=
nron.=20
"I am deeply concerned about the situation in which Enron employees and ret=
irees have found themselves, especially regarding their pensions and other =
benefits," she said. "These are my constituents and they have borne the bru=
nt of the problem at Enron."=20
Gramm, the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, received $97,35=
0. He is the senior GOP member on the panel and also sits on the Senate Fin=
ance Committee. Both committees have begun Enron investigations.=20
Gramm's wife, Wendy, is on Enron's board and audit committee and has been n=
amed in a lawsuit by investors against Enron executives and directors.=20
"He has not seen the scope of the proposed hearings and has yet to make a d=
ecision" on taking part, Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said.=20
The Texas senator, who is retiring in January, has begun returning his 2002=
 campaign donations, and that probably includes Enron donations, Neal said.=
=20
Enron donated to 71 senators and 188 representatives - nearly half of Congr=
ess - according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The 118 Senate and H=
ouse members on the seven committees accepted $722,749 from the company or =
its officials, according to an Associated Press analysis of the center's da=
ta. Since the analysis was done, three more committees have begun investiga=
tions.=20
Larry Noble, executive director of the center, said the lawmakers were in a=
 less vulnerable position than Attorney General John Ashcroft, who removed =
himself from the Justice Department's investigation because he received mor=
e than $57,000 in Enron donations for his unsuccessful 2000 Senate re-elect=
ion campaign.=20
"The attorney general is prosecuting Enron," Noble said. "These committees =
are not adjudicating anything or prosecuting anything per se."=20
Some lawmakers are moving to distance themselves from Enron by returning th=
e donations or giving like amounts to charity.=20
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., a member of the Commerce Committee who received=
 $2,705, will donate an equivalent amount to Habitat for Humanity of Kansas=
 City. "He just wants to avoid any question in any possible hearings he'll =
be involved in," spokesman Erik Hotmire said.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., received $2,000. "I don't feel at all compr=
omised," said the senator, who is leading the Senate Governmental Affairs C=
ommittee's Enron investigation.=20
Lieberman's former chief of staff, Michael Lewan, lobbied for Enron earlier=
 this year, holding three meetings with the senator's staff but not with Li=
eberman. Lewan remains a political adviser to the senator, but Lieberman sp=
okesman Dan Gerstein said that would have no impact on the investigation.=
=20
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, acc=
epted $6,464 in contributions from Enron. The Louisiana Republican doesn't =
plan on giving it back because campaign contributions don't affect his deci=
sions, a spokesman said.=20
"It doesn't matter if they gave us a million dollars," Tauzin spokesman Ken=
 Johnson said. "We're not going to cut them any slack. ... All I can tell y=
ou is both Enron and (its accounting firm) Arthur Andersen are in line for =
a good old-fashioned spanking."=20
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, the chair of the Energy and Commerce energy and a=
ir quality subcommittee, got at least $28,909 in Enron donations, but his s=
pokeswoman, Samantha Jordan, says he won't drop out of the investigation.=
=20
Barton has pushed for electricity deregulation, an important issue to Enron=
.=20
"It is not unusual for a Texas congressman to take contributions from a Tex=
as company like Enron, and he did not make any decisions based on any fundi=
ng," Jordan said. "He will participate."=20
Barton is considering making a contribution to a fund for Enron employees.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey=
 Pitt expressed confidence Thursday in the White House's nominees to the SE=
C and said the agency won't be hobbled by its diminished ranks.
The five-member SEC has been reduced to two, Pitt and commissioner Laura Un=
ger, a Republican who has announced plans to step down shortly.=20
Bush recently announced plans to name two Republicans to fill vacancies on =
the SEC. Both work for Big Five accounting firms, raising questions about p=
otential conflicts of interest as the SEC tackles hot-button issues such as=
 its investigation of possible accounting fraud at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).=20
The Senate has yet to consider Bush's nominees: attorney Paul Atkins, a par=
tner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, and economist Cynthia Glassman, an econ=
omist and principal at Ernst & Young LLP.=20
At a press conference Thursday to announce proposals to toughen oversight o=
f U.S. accounting, Pitt said both Atkins and Glassman have "excellent backg=
round, skills and ability," and downplayed any potential conflicts their ac=
counting firm background might pose.=20
Asked about his own potential conflicts in the Enron matter, Pitt reiterate=
d that he has not participated in any votes on it since casting one in Octo=
ber to commence an investigation. Some congressional Democrats have urged P=
itt to recuse himself from any Enron-related matters that come before the S=
EC, given that he was a securities lawyer who represented Big Five accounti=
ng firms, including Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor.=20
"I am not participating in the Enron investigation," Pitt stressed. He said=
 the agency's probe is being handled by its enforcement division and said a=
ny future action he might take - or recuse himself from - is hypothetical.=
=20
If further action is required, Pitt promised to adhere to the letter and sp=
irit of ethical guidelines governing the SEC.=20
"There is no way I would ever do anything to compromise the integrity of th=

Pitt declined to comment on the SEC's ongoing investigation into Enron's co=
llapse. It was recently widened to include destruction of Enron-related doc=
uments by employees at Arthur Andersen LLP.=20

SEC's Pitt Faces Criticism on Industry --- U.S. to Form Group To Oversee Re=
views Of Accounting Firms
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- As part of a plan to overhaul accounting oversight, the U.S. =
Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a new industry organization tha=
t will oversee disciplinary reviews of accountants.=20
The plan is a result of discussions over the past few months that SEC offic=
ials have had with representatives of the Big Five accounting firms and the=
 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. SEC Chairman Harvey Pi=
tt plans a series of accounting-industry reforms, including new forms of ov=
ersight and new rules for expanded corporate disclosures.
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession,=
" he said during a news conference, adding, "We cannot afford a system like=
 the present one that facilitates failure rather than success."=20
Among other things, the SEC's plan includes a proposal to form a private-se=
ctor panel that likely will replace the current disciplinary oversight func=
tions provided by both the Public Oversight Board and the AICPA. The organi=
zation, which Mr. Pitt said would be subject to SEC oversight, would have f=
ull regulatory power to investigate wrongdoing by accountants and to issue =
penalties ranging from censures to bans from the industry.=20
The panel is expected to be funded by fees from corporate audit clients. To=
 assure objectivity, it will have a majority of public members who are inde=
pendent from the accounting industry. The SEC will seek industry and public=
 comment.=20
Whether this goes far enough to address the accounting industry's problems =
no doubt will be a matter of intense debate. John Coffee, a professor of la=
w at Columbia University, says lawmakers should be involved in addressing t=
he accounting industry's problems.=20
The issue, he notes, "is whether the chairman can negotiate with the indust=
ry a new self-regulatory structure and not involve Congress. . . . Any new =
self-regulatory structure can't be done over the weekend, in a closet or in=
 a hotel room."=20
The accounting industry has long fought changes that would put teeth into t=
he oversight efforts of the self-regulatory bodies. The industry has been n=
otorious for failing to discipline its members, fearing that the process wo=
uld increase private liability in private class-action lawsuits.=20
"Before Enron ever happened, I urged that the industry come up with somethi=
ng," said Mr. Pitt, adding, "I told them elements that had to be in the pla=
n," including a new discipline approach. There will be no proposal implemen=
ted unless they meet our standards and conditions before they are fully imp=
lemented."=20
The proposal is part of an effort to restore waning confidence in accountin=
g work following Enron Corp.'s collapse as well as several accounting scand=
als and earnings restatements at other big corporations. Indeed, in an unpr=
ecedented statement early last month, the Big Five accounting firms -- Arth=
ur Andersen LLP, KPMG LLP, Deloitte & Touche LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers LL=
P and Ernst & Young LLP -- promised to abide by higher standards in the fut=
ure.=20
"The potential loss of confidence in our accounting firms is a burden our c=
apital markets cannot and should not bear," warned Mr. Pitt.=20
The industry is divided in its support for the new panel, said people in th=
e industry. In addition, accounting officials question whether the proposal=
 will be enough to satisfy criticism of the profession in Congress and amon=
g consumer groups.=20
Pointing to the "peer review" system in the accounting industry, critics sa=
y self-regulation has been ineffective. This system, in which one accountin=
g firm monitors how another firm conducts audits, has never resulted in a n=
egative review of a large accounting firm since it was adopted in 1977 -- e=
ven though there have been accounting scandals in that period.=20
Before joining the SEC, Mr. Pitt was a top securities lawyer who had repres=
ented each of the Big Five and the AICPA. Statements he has made about a "k=
inder, gentler" SEC have raised concerns that he wouldn't be a tough regula=
tor.=20
In response, the SEC chairman has recently pressed an agenda to improve dis=
closure and create better industry oversight aimed at avoiding future Enron=
s.=20
He has pushed hard to get the accounting firms and the AICPA to support his=
 ideas.=20
Mr. Pitt's ideas mirror recommendations the Big Five requested that the SEC=
 adopt in a recent letter. The firms urged the SEC to issue an interpretati=
ve release "as soon as possible" to improve 2001 annual reports by beefing =
up disclosure in the management discussion and analysis section of filings.=
=20
As a short-term fix, the Big Five firms asked the SEC to provide "immediate=
 guidance" to public companies on disclosing off-balance-sheet transactions=
, over-the-counter derivatives contracts, and related-party transactions --=
 three hot-button areas in Enron's debacle.=20
The SEC could approve such guidance in a matter of weeks -- which carries t=
he weight of new SEC policy with public companies. Mr. Pitt has intentions =
of larger-scale changes for requiring material events to be disclosed as th=
ey unfold, rather than in quarterly statements that investors read long aft=
er events occur. Those changes would require new rules, a process that norm=
ally takes at least several months.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
S.E.C. LEADER SEES OUTSIDE MONITORS FOR AUDITING FIRMS
By STEPHEN LABATON

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 -- Responding to growing criticism of accounting practi=
ces stemming from the collapse of the Enron Corporation, the head of the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission proposed today that the accounting industr=
y should be policed by a group dominated by outside experts instead of poli=
cing itself.=20
In Connecticut, the state attorney general asked the state's accountancy bo=
ard today to consider whether to revoke the licenses that let Arthur Anders=
en, Enron's auditor, work for corporations in that state.
Enron itself formally announced that it was firing Andersen as its auditor,=
 a step that Andersen executives said they had expected. Enron is also prep=
aring to sue Andersen, a person close to Enron said.=20
Internal Andersen documents made public today showed that as long ago as Fe=
bruary, Andersen executives considered dropping Enron as a client because o=
f concerns that it was keeping debts off its main balance sheets.=20
The documents also indicated that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chie=
f executive, disposed of stock within days of receiving a letter in August =
warning him of accounting problems. [Page C1.]=20
Most of the pressure today focused on Andersen. Disclosures that the firm s=
tood by its audits long after learning of Enron's possible misdeeds, and th=
at it had destroyed Enron documents, have provoked devastated investors to =
demand that the authorities rein accountants in.=20
In outlining his proposal today, Harvey L. Pitt, the S.E.C. chairman, said =
that antiquated rules on corporate disclosure and accounting ethics had all=
owed investors to suffer from a number of auditing lapses over the last dec=
ade. These rules, he said, must be revised.=20
''We simply cannot afford a system like the present one that facilitates fa=
ilure rather than success,'' he said at a news conference this afternoon in=
 Washington. ''This commission cannot, and in any event, it will not, toler=
ate this pattern of growing restatements, audit failures, corporate failure=
s and then massive investor losses. Somehow, we have got to put a stop to a=
 vicious cycle that has now been in evidence for far too many years.''=20
But his plan, still preliminary and months from adoption, was sharply criti=
cized by some experts. They urged him to consider proposals by a predecesso=
r to assure that auditors remain independent from their clients. Mr. Pitt, =
they said, missed the point that accounting firms that earn more from consu=
lting than auditing, as Andersen did for Enron, face inevitable conflicts o=
f interest.=20
''He's chasing a gopher down a wrong hole,'' said James D. Cox, a professor=
 of securities and corporate law at Duke University and author of an accoun=
ting textbook. ''This is not a situation which involved somebody at Arthur =
Andersen who had previously engaged in misconduct. This is a question of on=
going problems in an accounting profession which has close ties to clients,=
 ties which seriously compromise their independence.''=20
At his news conference, Mr. Pitt said that changes in the oversight rules a=
nd disclosure requirements were essential, but he dismissed suggestions tha=
t he take steps to keep auditors from performing other work for the same cl=
ients.=20
''Auditor independence is not the cause of the problems that we are witness=
ing,'' Mr. Pitt said. ''This system has enough flaws and enough difficultie=
s in it that cry out for repair. And it would be easy for some people to co=
nvince you that the entire problem is a question of auditor indepedence and=
 ignore the much bigger issues of the quality of our disclosures, the penet=
rability or impenetrability of financial reports, and how audits are struct=
ured and performed.''=20
He also deflected suggestions that the federal government play a greater ro=
le in overseeing the industry and that the S.E.C. be given more lawyers and=
 officials to prosecute white-collar corruption. He does not, he said, ''be=
lieve that the solution to every problem, even major problems, is throwing =
the taxpayers' money and more bodies from the government at the issue.''=20
Though Mr. Pitt said that no new law was needed to enact his own proposal, =
to shift the responsibilities for discipline from an industry group, the Am=
erican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to a new organization, Pr=
ofessor Cox said that the commission might not otherwise have the necessary=
 authority.=20
Professional accountants now face several levels of oversight. The institut=
e disciplines them for ethics and rules violations. The Securities and Exch=
ange Commission traditionally files complaints for more egregious violation=
s, federal violations in particular. State boards can discipline them or st=
rip them of their licenses for violations of state rules and laws.=20
Mr. Pitt said today that his plan would take the accounting institute out o=
f the business of conducting disciplinary and quality review proceedings.=
=20
The plan would probably also remove the Public Oversight Board, a group of =
outside experts, from performing such roles as overseeing peer reviews of a=
ccountants' work.=20
His proposal was generally supported by the institute, which was a client o=
f Mr. Pitt's before he became chairman. Barry Melancon, president and chief=
 executive of the institute, called it unprecedented but constructive and i=
mportant to restoring confidence in auditors.=20
But Charles A. Bowsher, the former comptroller general of the United States=
, who now heads the Public Oversight Board, criticized the plan as a quick =
fix that glossed over the bigger issues.=20
''I don't think it will be an effective self-regulatory process,'' Mr. Bows=
her said. ''I'm a great believer of the self-regulatory process. But in our=
 case what this will probably do is replace a board of true outsiders with =
one consisting of industry insiders and outsiders. This is an effort by the=
 A.I.C.P.A. to gain control of the self-regulatory process.''=20
Mr. Pitt's proposal still faces many months of review. After specific rules=
 have been written, they will be subject to the normal process of comment a=
nd revision. In addition, the S.E.C., with five seats, is hobbled by three =
vacancies.=20
The move by the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, presents =
another setback for Arthur Andersen.=20
Mr. Blumenthal's request for the state's accounting board to consider revok=
ing the firm's licenses in Connecticut could prompt other states to follow.=
 Companies that have become the subjects of such investigations by several =
states, like the E. F. Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert securities firms, =
were ultimately forced into liquidation.=20
Andersen said today that it was committed to uncovering problems at the fir=
m regardless of how many investigations were being conducted.=20
''There's a lot of people looking at these issues,'' said Patrick Dorton, a=
n Andersen spokesman. ''We'll leave it to the judgment of the attorney gene=
ral as to whether there should be one more investigation. We're committed t=
o making the changes necessary to restore public confidence.''=20
In Houston today, a federal judge ordered a hearing next Tuesday on a reque=
st to speed the fact-finding behind Andersen's destruction of documents. Th=
e request came from Amalgamated Bank, which is owned by labor unions and ma=
nages retirement funds with significant holdings of Enron stock. Lawyers fo=
r Amalgamated have accused Enron and Andersen of violating federal securiti=
es laws, leading to retirement fund losses of more than $10 million.

NATIONAL
SEC PROPOSES ACCOUNTING WATCHDOG IN WAKE OF ENRON
FRANK JAMES AND MELITA MARIE GARZA, CHICAGO TRIBUNE

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
REGION
A-12
(Copyright 2002)

With Enron Corp.'s meltdown as the backdrop and his own willingness to crac=
k down on the accounting industry questioned, the chairman of the Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission yesterday proposed creation of a private-sector w=
atchdog group to discipline auditors who fail to produce accurate financial=
 reports.=20
Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the agency that oversees the nation's financial=
 markets and corporate reporting, said regulators, the accounting industry =
and Congress need to address auditing weaknesses revealed by the Enron deba=
cle and other financial disasters before investor confidence could be resto=
red.
He said he envisioned an independent "tough, no-nonsense" panel with real e=
nforcement powers and the weight of the SEC behind it as a major step in th=
at direction.=20
"We simply cannot afford a system like the current one that facilitates fai=
lure rather than success," Pitt said. "Accounting firms have important and =
critical public responsibilities. We've had far too many financial and acco=
unting failures."=20
The accounting industry in the past has successfully fought outside efforts=
 to get it to put real teeth into its self-regulatory practices. It also th=
warted attempts to increase governmental oversight of the industry.=20
But the world has changed in the wake of the scandal engulfing Enron and it=
s auditor, the Chicago-based Andersen accounting firm.=20
Questionable off-balance-sheet transactions with a series of outside partne=
rships hid hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt, forcing the compa=
ny to revise its past earnings reports drastically lower and leading to the=
 company's bankruptcy filing last month.=20
Andersen has been bruised by a series of revelations about its handling of =
Enron's auditing, including the explosive disclosure that the company destr=
oyed thousands of records related to Enron. Andersen said it would fire its=
 senior partner responsible for its Enron audits and has suspended other em=
ployees. Late yesterday, the bankrupt Enron fired the entire Andersen firm.=
=20
Pitt himself has come in for criticism as well. His past work as a lawyer f=
or Andersen and other big accounting firms and his pre- scandal public rema=
rks suggesting a gentler SEC approach to accounting issues raised eyebrows =
among advocates of tough SEC regulation.=20
Yesterday, however, Pitt appeared to be warning his former accounting-firm =
clients that their days of defeating efforts to beef up oversight of their =
industry were over, thanks to the outrage and loss of faith among investors=
 in the current scandal.=20
"This commission cannot, and in any event, it will not tolerate this patter=
n of growing [financial] restatements, audit failures, corporate failures a=
nd then massive investor losses," Pitt said. "Somehow, we have got to put a=
 stop to a vicious cycle that has now been in evidence for far too many yea=
rs."=20
While his proposal lacked many details, Pitt sketched an outline for an ind=
ependent panel whose members would mainly be unconnected to the accounting =
industry, though there would be some accounting expertise on the panel. Unl=
ike the Public Oversight Board, another attempt at self-regulation created =
in 1977 after problems in the accounting industry, Pitt's panel would have =
the power to conduct investigations, launch disciplinary actions and bar in=
dividuals from practicing accounting -- either temporarily or for good -- f=
or incompetence or unethical conduct.

COMPANIES & FINANCE ENRON COLLAPSE - Pitt attacks accountancy system and US=
 audits - ENRON AFTERMATH REGULATOR SEEKS GREATER POWERS - * CONFLICTS OF I=
NTEREST IN SPOTLIGHT - * DUKE BENEFITS FROM RIVAL'S DEMISE - * EUROPEAN GRO=
UPS UNDER THREAT.=20
Harvey Pitt, new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, yester=
day castigated the accountancy profession and the US system of financial re=
porting, calling for a more powerful regulator with the power to ban indivi=
duals and firms from auditing public companies.
The scathing speech, delivered in Washington, followed intense criticism of=
 financial disclosure in the Enron debacle and the role of Andersen, the en=
ergy trader's auditor.=20
Mr Pitt said the "potential loss of confidence in our accounting firms and =
the audit process is a burden our capital markets cannot and should not bea=
r".=20
He acknowledged that leading audit firms had shown a willingness to work wi=
th the SEC, the US's chief financial regulator, to produce a better regulat=
ory system. But in a reversal of his previously conciliatory stance, Mr Pit=
t was highly critical of leading auditors.=20
"There is a need for reform of the regulation of our accounting profession.=
 We cannot afford a system, like the present one, that facilitates failure =
rather than success," he said.=20
Mr Pitt signalled a tougher stance even than his predecessor Arthur Levitt,=
 who battled with the profession during his tenure. "We have had far too ma=
ny financial and accounting failures. The commission cannot, and in any eve=
nt will not, tolerate this pattern of growing restatements, audit failures,=
 corporate failures and investor losses."=20
In light of what he said was a "vicious cycle that has been in evidence for=
 far too many years", Mr Pitt proposed wholesale reforms of accountancy reg=
ulations.=20
The system of "peer reviews" - where the leading auditors check the quality=
 of each others' audit systems every three years - should end.=20
Mr Pitt said peer reviews would be replaced with a more frequent monitoring=
 of audit quality and competence "designed to produce better audits in the =
future". This would be carried out by a permanent quality control staff, co=
mposed of people unaffiliated with any accounting firm.=20
These staff would be overseen by a brand new accountancy regulator whose me=
mbers would be overwhelmingly from outside the profession.=20
Mr Pitt said that the SEC would continue to decide whether certain forms of=
 conduct should be pursued as violations of law or treated as violations of=
 ethical and competence standards.=20
The new body would oversee the ethical and competence issues and would have=
 the power to perform investigations, bring disciplinary proceedings, publi=
cise its results and restrict individuals and firms from auditing public co=
mpanies.=20
The AICPA, the US accountants' main professional body, responded to the spe=
ech by saying the Mr Pitt's proposals were "unprecedented in the more than =
100-year history of the accounting profession".=20
The AICPA said it would "do all it can to work with the SEC and all interes=
ted parties to maintain the integrity of the capital market system".=20
A small panel of non-SEC, non-accounting members will look at Mr Pitt's pla=
ns during a comment period of between 45 and 60 days.=20

FERC Chairman: Enron Meltdown Showed Power-Market Strength

(This article was originally published Thursday.)=20

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ, ENE) problems appear self-infli=
cted and aren't linked to larger problems in energy trading markets, Pat Wo=
od, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Thursday.
The lack of serious disruption from Enron's rapid collapse actually highlig=
hted the strengths of the wholesale power markets, suggesting FERC is headi=
ng in the right direction with its efforts to create more competitive and o=
pen markets, Wood said, addressing an energy conference at the Federal Rese=
rve Bank of Chicago.=20
"Moving to competitive energy markets is a good thing and it's the right th=
ing to do," Wood said. "The bad situation at Enron I think largely appears =
to be a self-inflicted one."=20
Wood said he was pleased to see how efficiently the power markets adjusted =
to operating without Enron. Even before Enron's credit rating slipped below=
 investment grade last year, trading counterparties were unwinding deals wi=
th the trading giant.=20
Energy markets eliminated Enron in a show of "hateful Darwinism," Wood said=
. The process "reaffirmed my personal faith that energy markets really work=
ed as we want them to do, which is to reward good guys and punish bad guys,=
" he said.=20
That's the message Wood will take before the Senate Energy Committee Jan. 2=
9, when the committee will hold a hearing looking into the market impact of=
 Enron's fiscal collapse.=20
Answering questions after his address, Wood said Enron didn't contact him t=
o discuss its problems before they became commonly known. When Enron's trou=
bles became more apparent, FERC worked to make sure the company could conti=
nue making physical deliveries of natural gas to help ensure market stabili=
ty, Wood said.=20

BOZEMAN (AP) - Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., the Senate's third-largest recip=
ient of campaign donations from Enron Corp., said Thursday he has already s=
pent the money and has no plans to return it to the bankrupt energy trading=
 company.=20
"We've already used it, it's already gone," Burns said. "I've got nothing t=
o give back."
Burns, who serves on the Senate's energy, commerce and appropriations commi=
ttees, received $23,200 in donations from Houston-based Enron, according to=
 the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
Burns was third behind two Texas Republicans - Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ($=
99,500) and Sen. Phil Gramm ($97,350).=20
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., received $3,250. His office said this week that B=
aucus plans to donate the money to a nonprofit organization set up to help =
the workers laid off by Enron.=20
Enron was the nation's seventh-largest corporation last fall before going b=
ankrupt as its stock value plummeted from more than $80 a share to less tha=
n $1. Top executives sold their stock for hundreds of millions of dollars b=
efore investors were informed the company was in trouble, and hundreds of e=
mployees saw their retirement savings wiped out.=20
Burns said Enron representatives "never asked me for anything personally," =
made a minimum number of visits to his office and put forward no legislatio=
n in Congress.=20
If Enron executives defrauded employees or investors, Burns said, that's a =
felony and should not be tolerated. "If that's the case, they should go to =
jail."=20
Burns said he didn't see a need to pass new laws in the wake of the busines=
s failure.=20
"How can you pass a law on morality?" he asked. However, he said he might c=
onsider some changes in retirement account law.

Elizabeth Dole won't keep campaign money from Enron chairman

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Dole won't keep $5,000=
 given to her campaign by Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay and his family a=
s the energy giant neared financial collapse.=20
A Dole spokesman said the Republican seeking to succeed U.S. Sen. Jesse Hel=
ms raised $20,000 at a fund-raising luncheon hosted by Lay on Sept. 20 in H=
ouston.
Aides said Dole would donate $5,000 to a fund set up to support Enron emplo=
yees who have lost jobs and retirement savings in the wake of the company's=
 sudden demise.=20
At the time of the luncheon, "no one was aware of (Enron's) situation," sai=
d Dole spokesman Jay Warshaw. "But under the circumstances, she's not comfo=
rtable keeping the direct contributions. It's inappropriate to keep the mon=
ey at this point."=20
The decision comes as political donations from Enron are being scrutinized =
as investigators piece together what efforts were made to shore up the comp=
any through political connections.=20
There is no suggestion of Dole of trying to helping executives at Enron.=20
Lay hosted the luncheon for about 25 supporters for Dole after she spoke to=
 a women's group in Houston, Warshaw said. The event did not include any ot=
her Enron employees, he said.=20
Warshaw had told a reporter the day of the fund-raiser, which was not repor=
ted in the media at the time, that "campaign activities are still on hold" =
in the wake of the attacks.=20
A North Carolina Democratic Party official questioned Dole's decision not t=
o return the entire $20,000.=20
"It's heartless and unseemly to be raking in money at a time when the rest =
of the country is mourning," said Scott Falmlen, executive director of the =
state Democratic Party.=20
Warshaw said the fund-raiser wasn't a campaign activity.=20
"Mrs. Dole was doing no public politicking or stumping," he said.=20
Spokesmen for the major Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in North Carolina=
 all said their campaigns had not knowingly accepted any contributions from=
 Enron and would either return or donate any contributions that surfaced.

You might expect the stock of Northwest Natural Gas (NWN) not to be rising =
just now. It is seeking to purchase beleaguered Enron's Portland General El=
ectric, valued at $2.8 billion. True, Northwest, a fast-growing company ser=

efficiencies from the deal. But usually the stock of a buyer comes under pr=
essure. Instead, the stock has risen, from 22 in October to 26.15 on Jan. 9=
.=20
One reason: Northwest is seen by smart-money pros as buyout bait itself. So=
me industry people think that a potential suitor is Scottish Power, a Glasg=
ow energy group engaged in natural-gas distribution in Britain. These sourc=
es say that Scottish has been eyeing both Portland General Electric and Nor=

ENRON MAY SELL POWER PLANT.
By ZHANG XIE, China Daily staff.

01/18/2002
China Daily
(Copyright 2002 by China Daily)

Floundering US energy giant Enron Corporation is looking for buyers for its=
 last business on the Chinese mainland in an effort to raise cash to pay it=
s creditors at home. An Enron representative in China said yesterday it was=
 considering selling its stake in a profitable power plant in Southwest Chi=
na's Sichuan Province, its last operation on the Chinese mainland. A senior=
 Enron executive involved in the power-plant joint venture said: "The press=
ure to repay debts is fairly heavy and possibly we'll have to sell our stak=
e. "But there is no detailed plan yet. It's just a matter of intention so f=
ar." The executive said the business was going well, despite the turmoil at=
 Enron's headquarters. If the decision is made to sell, Enron would likely =
sell all of its 51 per cent stake in the plant's operator, the Sichuan Jial=
ing Electric Power Company, which has a registered capital of 920 million y=
uan (US$110 million). The executive said potential buyers will be largely l=
imited to foreign companies as the other investor in the power plant - the =
State-owned Sichuan Electric Power Corporation - still prefers foreign capi=
tal. "Our project is profitable and quite a few foreign companies have expr=
essed their interest," he said, refusing to give further details. An offici=
al with the Chinese partner said: "They're preparing to transfer their stak=
e. And the project is going on fairly well." Enron's probable bankruptcy se=
ems not to have disrupted the functioning of the power plant but an officia=
l with PetroChina still felt China's largest oil company had had a lucky es=
cape. Earlier, PetroChina had considered a strategic partnership with Enron=
 to build a US$300 million gas pipeline in Northwest China. The PetroChina =
official said: "Luckily, we didn't complete the deal." Months before it fil=
ed the largest bankruptcy in US history on December 2, souring financial co=
nditions had pushed Enron to start retreating from the Chinese market, wher=
e it had made substantial progress over the past seven years. Enron Petrole=
um and Natural Gas (China) Ltd, its major upstream business arm in China, e=
nded all its operations in December. In June, Enron sold an oil and gas exp=
loration business in Sichuan to another US energy firm. While its registrat=
ions in China are still valid, Enron closed down its office in Beijing as e=
arly as May last year. The return of the oil-trading giant seems a remote p=
ossibility, even if it manages to stay afloat. The Enron official in Sichua=
n said: "Even if the restructuring plan is approved, (the size of) it will =
surely shrink. And possibly it will never come to China again." Enron, once=
 ranked seventh in the Fortune 500 list of large corporations, slid from Wa=
ll Street stardom to bankruptcy court in a matter of weeks, throwing thousa=
nds out of work and stirring controversy from Washington to Wall Street. (C=

BERLIN, N.H. (AP) - Collapsed energy giant Enron is reported to have contac=
ted city officials about the future of the mills that have been closed in t=
he bankruptcy of American Tissue Corp.=20
The Berlin Daily Sun also reported Friday that Arthur Andersen, Enron's acc=
ounting firm that destroyed many Enron documents and was fired Thursday, al=
so worked for American Tissue.
American Tissue dismissed Andersen in October, a month after the company ad=
mitted that its financial reports for fiscal 2000 and 2002 contained "mater=
ial inaccuracies."=20
In an Oct. 18 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, American Tissue sa=
id Andersen had audited its financial reports for the past two years.=20
Edward Stein, American Tissue's executive vice president and chief financia=
l officer, resigned after the inaccuracies were disclosed.=20
Berlin officials confirmed discussing with Enron in late summer running the=
 Pulp and Paper of America complex if Berlin and Gorham took the mills by e=
minent domain for unpaid taxes.=20
Enron was one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas, and communic=
ations companies. It also provided financing for the pulp, paper and wood p=
roducts industry and owned Garden State Paper Co. in Garfield, N.J., which =
produced recycled newsprint.=20
The discussions were dropped when American Tissue declared bankruptcy and t=
he fate of the mills fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bankruptcy Cou=
rt.=20
Enron's bankruptcy and Andersen's involvement has generated scrutiny becaus=
e of questions about Enron executives making large amounts of money in the =
sale of more than 17 million shares in the months before it collapsed while=
 employees and investors lost billions.=20
The Texas-based company, with close ties to President Bush and other top ad=
ministration officials, has denied insider trading was involved.

News: Analysis & Commentary: Enron Watch: Investigations
HOT POTATO: HANDLE WITH CARE Playing politics in the Enron probe could burn=
 either party

When Enron Corp. tumbled into bankruptcy, it put thousands out of work and =
drained billions from investors' portfolios. But the collapse of George W. =
Bush's top corporate backer may have a silver lining for one group: the Dem=
ocrats. ``Politically, this is a gift from heaven,'' says Larry Makinson, a=
 senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.=20
Of course, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) took care not to gloat whe=
n he announced that his Governmental Affairs Committee would investigate En=
ron. ``This is a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,'' Lieberman said o=
n Jan. 2. ``The questions that need to be asked and answered about what hap=
pened to Enron are of great public--not partisan--interest.''
Carefully chosen words, especially coming from the man who could be Bush's =
top challenger for the White House in 2004. And for good reason: The Enron =
debacle is a minefield. Dems will attempt to make Enron a case study in coz=
y GOP relations with Big Business and insensitivity to working people, whil=
e putting a dent in the President's armor. They'll charge that Enron's gene=
rosity to Republicans, who pocketed 73% of Enron's $5.77 million in campaig=
n donations in the past decade, bought looser regulation of energy deals an=
d a blind eye toward accounting conflicts.=20
Lieberman will be under pressure from the party leadership to rake the Repu=
blicans over the coals. That strategy would score points with the liberal D=
emocratic base he must cultivate if he wants to challenge Bush in 2004. But=
 the longtime pro-business Democrat risks looking like an opportunistic par=
tisan if he moves too aggressively. ``This wasn't Whitewater. This was bad =
business,'' warns one Democratic lobbyist. ``If they try too hard to connec=
t the dots to the Administration, they might jeopardize the credibility of =
the whole hearings.''=20
It'll be a hard balance to strike, even for a pol like Lieberman, who has c=
ultivated a persona of high-mindedness. Lieberman criticized President Clin=
ton for his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky and split with his party during =
investigations into the 1996 fund-raising practices of Clinton and Vice-Pre=
sident Al Gore. That virtuous image helped him land a spot on Gore's 2000 t=
icket. Says Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political R=
eport: Lieberman is ``good at appearing as though he's earnestly seeking th=
e truth rather than seriously exploiting a situation--even if he is serious=
ly exploiting a situation.''=20
But many Democrats smell GOP blood. Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif=
.), the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, released det=
ails on Jan. 8 of Enron's role in shaping the energy policy drafted last ye=
ar by Vice-President Dick Cheney. With the Justice Dept. opening a criminal=
 investigation, the Labor Dept. and Securities & Exchange Commission conduc=
ting civil probes, and five congressional committees holding hearings, ``th=
e name Enron and its relationship to the Bush family are going to remain in=
 the headlines--and that's not something that displeases your average Democ=
ratic strategist,'' says Kim Wallace, chief political analyst for Lehman Br=
others Inc.=20
Republican leaders aren't counting on Democratic restraint. The GOP-control=
led House is launching its own probes, in part to try to insulate Republica=
ns from charges of favoring the company. And Enron will try to capitalize o=
n both parties' fear of a political backlash. ``The public policy issues th=
at this tragedy raises should not be lost in a partisan food fight,'' says =
Enron's outside counsel, Robert Bennett.=20
Business lobbyists are particularly concerned that losses in Enron's 401(k)=
 plans--which have decimated the pensions of many workers--may lead to stif=
f new regulations. ``When you're dealing with trillions of dollars and the =
retirement prospects of an aging nation, political lines get drawn quickly,=
'' says James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which r=
epresents big employers and pension managers.=20
Congress' full-throated pursuit of Enron should provide fascinating politic=
al theater. But as elections draw near, all sides must avoid overplaying th=
eir parts, lest they get booed off the stage.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE APPOINTEES
Several Administration Officials Held Enron Shares
By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and LESLIE WAYNE

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 -- While much has been made of the huge sums the Enron =
Corporation invested in the political campaigns of President Bush, some sen=
ior members of the Bush administration were also heavily invested in the co=
mpany's stock.=20
Neither President Bush nor Vice President Dick Cheney owned Enron stock whe=
n they took office. But at least 30 senior administration officials and amb=
assadors entered government service last year with personal holdings in Enr=
on stock ranging from several thousand dollars to as much as $50 million, a=
ccording to a comprehensive review of financial disclosure forms.
Many of those officials sold their shares before Enron collapsed, in most c=
ases because they were required to do so under federal conflict of interest=
 rules.=20
The mandated sales were made in the first months of 2001 while the stock wa=
s still trading at $60 to $70 a share; the timing helped at least 20 admini=
stration officials, including Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political strategist, a=
void losing tens of thousands of dollars.=20
But a handful of administration officials who were not required to sell cho=
se to hold their Enron shares through most of last year and presumably sold=
 at a substantial loss after the stock price collapsed.=20
A few officials still hold Enron shares, which last traded at 67 cents befo=
re the company's stock was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange on Tues=
day.=20
John S. Wolf, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, lost appro=
ximately $50,000 on his Enron investment last year. Thomas E. White, who wa=
s vice chairman of Enron's energy services division, became secretary of th=
e Army last summer owning $25 million to $50 million of Enron shares and an=
other $25 million to $50 million of Enron stock options.=20
When he left Enron, Mr. White was paid $1 million and a $13 million ''phant=
om stock award,'' which is a promise to pay a future bonus in appreciated s=
tock or its cash equivalent. A Pentagon spokesman said he believed that Mr.=
 White abided by his agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee to =
sell all his Enron holdings within 90 days of joining the government.=20
The investment in Enron by top administration officials ''shows just how cl=
ose Enron and the Bush administration were,'' said Charles Lewis, executive=
 director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington research group.=
=20
Mr. Lewis said that among the questions raised by these holdings were wheth=
er any administration officials had special knowledge that affected their E=
nron trading decisions or whether their Enron holdings posed any conflict o=
f interest.=20
''I am not suggesting there is evidence of insider trading,'' he said. ''Bu=
t a healthy number of them owned Enron, and it is not an unreasonable quest=
ion to ask how much they owned, when they sold it and why.''=20
Paul C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution,=
 a Washington research group, said, ''The first question is whether any of =
these individuals who had a personal interest in Enron's success were invol=
ved in any policy making.''=20
Mr. Rove sold 1,350 shares of Enron stock on June 7, after waiting several =
months for an opinion from the White House counsel's office on the ethics o=
f his wide array of investments. The delay cost Mr. Rove money; had he sold=
 his holdings when he joined the administration, he would have received a f=
ar higher price.=20
On Jan. 20, Enron stock traded at about $80 a share. On June 7, the share p=
rice closed at $55.=20
Mr. Rove declined to comment. But Anne Womack, a White House aide, said: ''=
He had an account with a broker. He purchased stock through the account, ju=
st like anyone else who would buy stock. It was purchased over a number of =
years.'' She declined to say when Mr. Rove had bought his Enron shares or w=
hat he paid.=20
New appointees to any administration are required by federal law to file a =
financial disclosure statement, which is reviewed by executive branch lawye=
rs, or Congress in the case of positions requiring confirmation. The date w=
hen the statement must be filed varies according to when the person is nomi=
nated.=20
Based on these statements, questions of potential conflicts of interest can=
 be reviewed by the White House, the executive branch's Office of Governmen=
t Ethics, specific agencies as well as by Congress, depending on the post.=
=20
''Concern about any stock or financial interests would be based on the work=
 the nominee would be doing,'' said Thomas F. Zorn, chief of financial disc=
losure at the ethics office. ''Whether this is a conflict would vary from a=
gency to agency. Enron shares might be a problem at one agency, but not at =
another.''=20
Some administration officials who were not required to sell held their Enro=
n shares through most of 2001 and did not sell until the price dropped to l=
ess than $10 a share late last fall.=20
''I'm a victim,'' said Mr. Wolf, the State Department official who lost rou=
ghly $50,000. He bought Enron shares three times between April and June 200=
1, when the stock traded between $55 and $65 a share. By the time he sold i=
n late October, the price had fallen to about $10 a share.=20
Also selling Enron at a loss was Thomas Dorr, under secretary of agricultur=
e for rural development. Mr. Dorr, owner of Dorr's Pine Grove Farm in Iowa,=
 came into the administration with stocks in 115 companies valued at as muc=
h as $4 million. Among them were Enron shares valued at as much as $30,000.=
=20
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman at the Agriculture Department, said Mr. Dorr =
divested all his Enron shares in November. ''They were all sold at a loss,'=
' she said, adding that the shares had been in Mr. Dorr's individual retire=
ment account.=20
One of the wealthier Bush administration officials, Charlotte Beers, the un=
der secretary of state for public diplomacy, owned as much as $250,000 in E=
nron shares in a portfolio of 150 stocks and investments valued at $38 mill=
ion. Ms. Beers, a former advertising executive now in charge of the adminis=
tration's campaign of public diplomacy in the war on terrorism, sold her En=
ron stake after the company collapsed.=20
''Her shares were sold in December 2001 as part of normal portfolio managem=
ent,'' said Nicholas Griffith, a State Department spokesman. ''Enron was so=
ld with a number of other shares and it all took place in December 2001.''=
=20
At the Commerce Department, Grant Aldonis, the under secretary for internat=
ional trade, sold his Enron shares last spring as part of his ethics agreem=
ent. Mr. Aldonis, a lawyer and former trade counsel for the Senate Foreign =
Relations Committee, took office with a portfolio valued at as much as $3.3=
 million, with stock in more than 100 corporations.=20
His Enron holdings, then valued between $15,000 and $50,000, were sold befo=
re his confirmation last spring. At that time, Enron was trading at around =
$60 a share.=20
The other main holder of Enron shares at the Commerce Department was Kathle=
en B. Cooper, under secretary for economic affairs. Ms. Cooper, former chie=
f economist at the Exxon Mobil Corporation, had most of her portfolio, whic=
h was valued at as much as $6.5 million, invested in Exxon shares.=20
Her Enron holdings were sold in June 2001, when the stock traded at around =
$50 a share, said James Dyke, a spokesman for the Commerce Department. Mr. =
Dyke added that the sale was not required under her ethics agreement.=20
As Enron scrambled last fall to prevent a collapse, Enron executives repeat=
edly called Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of treasury for domestic f=
inance, for help -- to no avail. Mr. Fisher spoke six to eight times in Oct=
ober and November with Greg Whalley, Enron's president.=20
Mr. Fisher, a former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York=
, had a portfolio of 66 stocks and mutual funds. Through a trust that will =
come to him upon the death of his parents, he indirectly held Enron shares =
that had been valued at $1,000 to $15,000 but are now virtually worthless.=
=20
Other big holders of Enron shares in the Bush administration are ambassador=
s, most of whom were businessmen before Mr. Bush appointed them to their fo=
reign postings.=20
Heading the ambassadors' list of Enron shareholders is Richard J. Egan, the=
 United States ambassador to Ireland and the founder and chairman emeritus =
of the EMC Corporation, a data storage company. Mr. Egan sold all his share=
s by June on the advice of his money manager. He had reported to regulators=
 that when he joined the administration he owned Enron stock valued at $250=
,000 to $500,000, and that he had capital gains of more than $100,000 on th=
e sale of those shares.=20
Two other White House officials held Enron shares ranging in value from $1,=
000 to $15,000: I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, and Nicholas C=
alio, the assistant to the president for legislative affairs. Mr. Libby sol=
d his Enron shares on Feb. 25 last year, and he made a profit of $14, a Whi=
te House spokeswoman said. Mr. Calio sold his 15 shares of Enron stock last=
 August, she said.

As presidential candidate George W. Bush's top economic adviser in 2000, La=
wrence B. Lindsey was also a paid consultant to Enron Corp. At one point, t=
hose two roles merged.=20
For $50,000 a year, Lindsey attended meetings in 1999 and 2000 of the energ=
y company's economic "advisory board." In those sessions, Enron Chairman Ke=
nneth L. Lay convinced Lindsey of the wisdom behind one of Enron's business=
es, a consulting operation that advised companies on energy efficiency.
"It stuck with me," Lindsey said in an interview yesterday.=20
In fact, Lindsey incorporated Lay's ideas into the Bush campaign's energy p=
olicy. During the campaign, Lindsey described Lay's contribution as key.=20
The cozy relationship -- in which a Bush campaign adviser, being paid by En=
ron, placed an Enron idea on the candidate's agenda -- served as one more r=
eminder of the political influence and reach of the once-giant energy compa=
ny. Its ties extend deep into President Bush's staff, appointments, Cabinet=
 members, friends, family -- and his own past.=20
According to financial records, 35 administration officials have held Enron=
 stock. A few, such as top Bush political adviser Karl Rove, had six-figure=
 holdings. Several others -- Lindsey, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Z=
oellick, Commerce Department general counsel Theodore W. Kassinger, Maritim=
e Administrator William G. Schubert -- served as paid Enron consultants.=20
Bush's secretary of the Army, Thomas E. White, was vice chairman of the Enr=
on business that Lay had described to Lindsey during the campaign. White ha=
d held between $25 million and $50 million in Enron stock in addition to op=
tions and other forms of remuneration. Newly appointed Republican National =
Committee Chairman Marc F. Racicot was an Enron lobbyist. Bush campaign adv=
iser Ed Gillespie, sent in when Bush took office to get the Commerce Depart=
ment up and running, was an Enron lobbyist.=20
Still others, such as Attorney General John D. Ashcroft and Energy Secretar=
y Spencer Abraham, received campaign contributions from Enron, while many m=
ore -- including Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt=
, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood III and Dep=
uty Attorney General Larry D. Thompson -- have indirect ties to Enron or au=
ditor Arthur Andersen. And Enron consulted on policy with top administratio=
n officials such as Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, Treasury Secretary =
Paul H. O'Neill and Vice President Cheney.=20
There has been no indication that the administration's ties to Enron are il=
legal, and the giant company had similar connections to several Democrats a=
nd Republicans in Congress. But the sheer volume of Enron connections to th=
e executive branch offers a study in the long reach of a powerful campaign =
contributor and aggressive corporation. Though the administration says it m=
ade no effort to keep Enron afloat, the extensive ties between the two may =
present Bush with a political difficulty if Democrats can create a percepti=
on of guilt by association.=20
Enron began in 1985 as a traditional gas pipeline company, but transformed =
itself into an innovative trader of gas, electricity and other commodities.=
 Its stock became a Wall Street favorite as it tried to enter markets for f=
iber-optics, movie rentals, paper, even advertising. Many of its businesses=
 were regulated or otherwise affected by federal decisions.=20
Enron and its executives poured millions of dollars into the political proc=
ess -- $1.7 million in the 2000 election alone, according to the Center for=
 Responsive Politics.=20
Over the years, a series of actions by Congress and the FERC, which broke d=
own the old monopoly of utility companies over power plants and transmissio=
n lines, benefited Enron. The company successfully lobbied for a regulatory=
 exemption for futures trading in energy "derivatives," complex financial i=
nstruments that became its most lucrative business and contributed to its d=
ownfall. The Bush administration sometimes rebuffed Enron, however, such as=
 when it refused to embrace an Enron-backed position on combating global wa=
rming.=20
Bush last week played down his ties to Lay. He said he "first got to know K=
en" in 1994, when "he was a supporter of Ann Richards," the Democratic Texa=
s governor whom Bush ousted. In fact, Bush knew Lay from their work on the =
1992 Republican National Convention and the Bush presidential library. The =
current president received $47,500 from Lay and his wife in 1994 -- many ti=
mes what Richards received. Lay has said he supported Bush, not Richards, i=
n 1994.=20
Over the years, Lay and Enron interests have contributed more than a half m=
illion dollars to Bush campaign funds, according to the Center for Public I=
ntegrity, making him Bush's greatest patron. The Bush presidential campaign=
 reimbursed Enron for use of its corporate jets. Lay, who got the nickname =
"Kenny Boy" from Bush, served on Bush's presidential transition advisory te=
am for the Energy Department. Enron employee Cynthia Sandherr served on the=
 transition team for the Commerce Department.=20
In the White House, four senior officials were listed as Enron shareholders=
. Three of them -- Cheney chief of staff I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, congress=
ional liaison Nicholas E. Calio and former communications adviser Margaret =
Tutwiler -- likely sold their interests or were not required to under ethic=
s rules; full details will not be made public until May.=20
The fourth, Rove, whose Enron holdings were valued between $100,000 and $25=
0,000, sold his shares last year after the value had fallen to $68,000; the=
 Enron shares, which the White House said Rove purchased on his own, were p=
art of a portfolio worth more than $2.3 million.=20
White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales acknowledged last June that Rove to=
ok part in meetings that helped shape the administration's energy policy wh=
ile he still owned stock in Enron and other energy companies. Gonzales, how=
ever, said the meetings were general in nature and not specific enough to b=
e barred by conflict-of-interest regulations.=20
Also tied to Enron is Lindsey. His consulting firm, Economic Strategies Inc=
., counted an Enron unit among its many clients. Counting speaking fees and=
 his multi-client business, Lindsey earned more than $1.1 million in 2000.=
=20
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said that Lindsey, before Enron's=
 Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, led a White House "review" that monitored the im=
pact of Enron's woes on energy markets. Lindsey said it was merely part of =
an ongoing monitoring of the energy markets by one or two aides. Democrats =
in Congress yesterday said Lindsey's actions may have violated federal conf=
lict-of-interest regulations. Lindsey said his work was not "Enron-specific=
."=20
Cheney, himself a former Texas energy executive, was on a first-name basis =
with Lay, who met with the vice president to discuss development of the adm=
inistration's national energy policy. In all, the vice president's office d=
isclosed, the energy task force met six times with Enron representatives. R=
ep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), a critic of the task force, said "it seems =
clear that there is no company in the country that stood to gain as much fr=
om the White House plan as Enron."=20
A number of senior Bush aides have had routine or incidental contact with E=
nron. White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. was alerted by Commerce=
's Evans about a call from Lay expressing a desire for government help in t=
he weeks before its bankruptcy. Bush budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr=
. received a call from Lay in October about prospects for the economic stim=
ulus package. That package, as passed by the House, included a tax provisio=
n that would have provided Enron with a $254 million rebate, according to t=
he Congressional Research Service.=20
Even Bush's homeland security director, Tom Ridge, had Enron ties. At Lay's=
 urging, Bush called Ridge in 1997 when he was Pennsylvania governor to hel=
p with Enron's bid -- eventually successful -- to enter the Pennsylvania ma=
rket.=20
At the Justice Department, Ashcroft and staff chief David Ayres -- Ashcroft=
's former campaign manager -- recused themselves from the Enron probe becau=
se of Enron contributions to Ashcroft's campaign funds.=20
The Justice Department decided that deputy staff chief David Israelite and =
communications director Barbara Comstock need not recuse themselves; both h=
ad worked for the Republican National Committee, which received hundreds of=
 thousands of dollars from Enron. Thompson, Ashcroft's deputy, was a partne=
r in a law firm, King & Spalding, that represented Enron, but he disagreed =
with a Democratic lawmaker who said Thompson should disqualify himself.=20
After Commerce's Evans received a call from Lay in which the Enron chief sa=
id he would value government calls to a private credit rating agency, Evans=
 called into his office his counsel, Kassinger. Kassinger had earlier said =
he had provided "legal services" to Enron while a trade lawyer at the firm =
Vinson & Elkins LLP in Houston, Enron's hometown. Ultimately, Evans said, h=
e decided not to intervene.=20
Treasury's O'Neill, who also got a call from Lay concerning Enron's dire fi=
nances, handed the matter over to Peter R. Fisher, the undersecretary for d=
omestic finance. Fisher had holdings in Enron valued between $1,000 and $15=
,000 when he joined the administration, as did Mark A. Weinberger, the assi=
stant treasury secretary for tax policy. Treasury's spokeswoman said Fisher=
's modest holdings were part of a trust that he does not control. O'Neill s=
aid the department provided no help to Enron, although it consulted with le=
nders.=20
Elsewhere in the administration, Trade Representative Zoellick received $50=
,000 in advisory fees from Enron and listed stock holdings between $15,000 =
and $50,000 -- relatively small percentages of his overall earnings and hol=
dings (Zoellick sold his shares after joining the administration).=20
A score of other administration officials had Enron holdings, ranging from =
relatively small stakes held by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Ex=
port Import Bank Chairman John E. Robson to holdings exceeding $100,000 by =
Charlotte L. Beers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy.=20
At the SEC, Pitt faced requests this week from congressional Democrats and =
the watchdog group Common Cause that he remove himself from his agency's En=
ron investigation because he had been a securities lawyer who represented A=
ndersen, Enron's auditor. FERC Chairman Wood, a friend of Lay's, replaced C=
urtis Hebert Jr. Hebert told the New York Times last year that Lay had said=
 he wouldn't back his reappointment unless Hebert changed his views on elec=
tricity deregulation.=20
Even since its bankruptcy filing, the vestiges of Enron continue to touch t=
hose around the president. Bush's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, flew to H=
ouston yesterday for a $500-per-person fundraiser at the home of a former E=
nron president.=20

Accounting for Enron: Investigation Raises Oliver North Problem --- Congres=
sional Testimony Can Taint Prosecutions
By Kathryn Kranhold and Tom Hamburger

Will the Justice Department investigation of Enron Corp. face an Oliver Nor=
th problem?=20
In May 1989, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel was found guilty in the =
Iran-Contra scandal. But his conviction was later reversed, as was the conv=
iction of former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, after two of th=
ree judges in Washington's Circuit Court of Appeals found that witnesses fo=
r the prosecution were tainted by the two men's public testimony before Con=
gress.
Now, the Justice Department is ramping up to investigate Enron as Congress =
is also mounting major investigations. Just as prosecutors start interviewi=
ng people, Congress is negotiating with top executives at Enron and its aud=
itor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to testify at public hearings.=20
People who testify before Congress in such situations are occasionally gran=
ted limited immunity, called "use immunity," that protects them from having=
 their statements used against them in a criminal investigation. But such a=
 grant of immunity presents problems for prosecutors in a subsequent crimin=
al case.=20
Dan Webb, who as deputy independent counsel prosecuted Mr. Poindexter, says=
 prosecutors in any Enron case would have a "huge burden" of proof to show =
that their investigation and witnesses weren't influenced by any congressio=
nal testimony presented under a grant of immunity.=20
"That becomes very difficult and sometimes almost impossible to do," said M=
r. Webb, of Winston & Strawn.=20
It isn't clear whether any of the major players in the Enron affair will be=
 granted immunity in exchange for their congressional testimony. David Dunc=
an, the Arthur Andersen auditor fired this week for shredding Enron documen=
ts, has agreed to cooperate but it is still not determined under what terms=
 he might testify before Congress.=20
Before this week's explosion of revelations, Enron's chairman and chief exe=
cutive, Kenneth Lay, was expected to testify Feb. 4. Enron's former chief e=
xecutive, Jeffrey Skilling, has said he would testify. It isn't clear wheth=
er Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who ran the quest=
ionable partnerships that contributed to Enron's downfall, will also testif=
y.=20
Both Messrs. North and Poindexter were granted limited immunity before Cong=
ress. That meant that prosecutors couldn't use the men's public testimony t=
o aid their investigation, including leading them to evidence or witnesses =
they hadn't discovered on their own. Additionally, witnesses called by the =
prosecution couldn't use Mr. North's congressional testimony to help them r=
emember the details of a significant event or meeting.=20
To ensure Mr. North's statements didn't taint the case, Independent Counsel=
 Lawrence E. Walsh and his team of prosecutors didn't read the newspapers. =
One prosecutor took his glasses off in the subway so that he couldn't read =
the headlines on other passengers' newspapers. While watching television, t=
hey carried remote controls so they could easily hit the mute buttons. Mr. =
Walsh recalls: "We got pretty sharp at that."

Enron: How Governance Rules Failed The audit committee followed all the rul=
es--but it let shareholders down
By Louis Lavelle

01/21/2002
BusinessWeek
28
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

One of the mysteries of Enron Corp.'s fall from grace is how an audit commi=
ttee chock full of talent could have been blind to the company's financial =
sleight of hand. So far, speculation has centered around the apparent failu=
re of Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, to alert the audit committee t=
o the problem until very late in the game. But the truth is, the audit comm=
ittee deserves much of the blame for Enron's collapse--and the corporate go=
vernance movement deserves much of the blame for the Enron audit committee.=
=20
Whatever its flaws, the committee followed all the rules laid down by feder=
al regulators, stock exchanges, and governance experts regarding director p=
ay, independence, disclosure, and financial expertise. Enron collapsed in l=
arge part because the rules didn't accomplish what the experts hoped they w=
ould. For example: -- Paying directors with stock may have aligned their in=
terests with shareholders', but it's just as likely to have created a motiv=
e for not asking the tough questions. -- Disclosure rules may have alerted =
investors to the fact that one audit committee member had a potential confl=
ict of interest, but not that two others did as well. -- The Enron audit co=
mmittee may have been exactly what the stock exchanges had in mind in Decem=
ber, 1999, when they required that members demonstrate financial know-how--=
but the expertise may have been out of date following the changes Enron wen=
t through in the 1990s. In any case, it didn't help the committee make sens=
e of Enron's tangled finances.
Bottom line: It may be time to rethink the rules.=20
Certainly there was nothing unusual about the Enron directors' heavy stock =
ownership. Boards in general have bought into the argument by governance ex=
perts that directors should get paid largely with stock to make sure they a=
ct in the best interest of shareholders. Of the top 200 companies, 99% pay =
directors with stock, up from 81% in 1995. And 62% of director pay comes in=
 equity, up from 24% in 1995, according to pay consultant Pearl Meyer & Par=
tners.=20
Clearly, stock is king. But should it be? Auditors are prohibited by the Se=
curities & Exchange Commission from owning stock in client companies precis=
ely because of its potential to corrupt. Yet audit committee members, like =
all directors, are essentially required to own stock, presumably because it=
 keeps them honest. Three of the six audit committee members owned nearly 1=
00,000 Enron shares worth a total of more than $7.5 million as of Feb. 15--=
shares that surely would have plummeted in value had directors forced manag=
ement to come clean about the risks of some of the company's off-balance-sh=
eet partnerships.=20
The committee's failure to force an earlier and more public explanation of =
Enron's finances suggests to some that the shares, instead of making shareh=
older interests the directors' top priority, did the opposite--in effect bu=
ying their silence. ``Did greed blind them? I think it's very possible,'' s=
ays John M. Nash, co-founder of the National Association of Corporate Direc=
tors. In fact, one lawsuit alleges just that, claiming that Enron insiders-=
-including three current audit committee members--sold 17.3 million shares =
for $1.1 billion to an unsuspecting public while issuing financial statemen=
ts later revealed to be pure fiction. The audit committee members either de=
clined to comment or did not return calls. But Enron says the board since 1=
999 approved the most controversial partnerships, established controls, and=
 acted ``quickly'' in November to restate earnings when the problems became=
 apparent, albeit weeks after Enron's shares plunged amid questions about t=
he partnerships.=20
It's hard to argue that directors shouldn't own shares at all. But banning =
sales by directors for the duration of their terms would motivate directors=
 to preserve a company's long-term value instead of taking a see-no-evil ap=
proach to oversight.=20
If the stock didn't blind the Enron audit committee members, their financia=
l ties to the company may have. It's a problem that governance critics anti=
cipated. But what's troublesome is that SEC disclosure rules required Enron=
 to make known only one of those ties: director John Wakeham's $6,000-a-mon=
th consulting contract. One would need to venture far afield from Enron's s=
ecurities filings to learn from the University of Texas that Enron, Chairma=
n Kenneth Lay, and their foundations had given $332,150 to the school's M.D=
. Anderson Cancer Center since 1999. That's when center President John Mend=
elsohn became an Enron director. Also undisclosed by Enron: $50,000 that th=
e company and the Lay family foundation gave to George Mason University's M=
ercatus Center, where Wendy Lee Gramm has been head of regulatory studies s=
ince she joined the center in 1997. Enron and its employees also made polit=
ical contributions of more than $80,000 to her husband, Senator Phil Gramm =
(R-Tex.), since she became an Enron director in 1993.=20
Governance experts say the audit committee's lack of independence made it l=
ess inclined to question management. ``These are humans,'' says Richard H. =
Koppes, former general counsel for the California Public Employees' Retirem=
ent System. ``You're not going to want to rock the boat.'' At the very leas=
t, investors were entitled to know that half the committee had financial ti=
es to the company. The SEC should move quickly to propose a rule, long soug=
ht by institutional investors, requiring the disclosure of all financial ti=
es with directors--personal, family, business, political and philanthropic.=
 Using that standard, about 30% of the nearly 1,200 companies tracked by th=
e Investor Responsibility Research Center have audit committees that are le=
ss than 100% independent.=20
One of the few areas where Enron disclosed a wealth of information was in t=
he qualifications of board members. On paper, the audit committee was as qu=
alified as any, more than fulfilling the 1999 requirement by stock exchange=
s that members demonstrate financial literacy. Committee Chairman Robert K.=
 Jaedicke was a Stanford University accounting professor for 30 years. Ronn=
ie C. Chan and Paulo V. Ferraz Pereira are executives. Mendelsohn runs a un=
iversity cancer center. Gramm is an economist. And Wakeham belongs to the H=
ouse of Lords.=20
Yet, as a group, they were apparently unable to decipher the tangled web of=
 off-balance-sheet deals that effectively hid Enron's debt and inflated its=
 earnings. Jaedicke, 72, has been retired for more than a decade. Some have=
 suggested privately that he may not have been up to speed on the complex f=
inancing strategies that were so integral to Enron's rapid transformation f=
rom an energy pipeline company into a trading outfit. Some governance exper=
ts now conclude that meeting the textbook definition of financial literacy =
is not a guarantee that directors understand sophisticated financial instru=
ments.=20
The truth is that the ideal audit committee envisioned by the rules governi=
ng independence and financial literacy is to some extent a mythical beast. =
Big global companies are now so complex that insiders are often the only pe=
ople who truly understand them. But only outsiders have the independence to=
 rein them in. And many boards don't exercise the diligent oversight compan=
ies need. A new survey of audit committees at 50 U.S. companies by Joseph V=
. Carcello, an associate accounting professor at the University of Tennesse=
e at Knoxville, found they typically meet just three times a year, only two=
-thirds bother to review their companies' internal audits, and fewer than o=
ne in five have unrestricted access to company records. Enron's committee m=
et five times in 2000; the company's proxy is unclear on whether it reviewe=
d the internal audit or had unfettered access to records.=20
If nothing else, the Enron debacle should occasion some soul-searching on t=
he part of federal regulators and stock exchanges that make the governance =
rules. It would help if audit committees were required to convene meetings =
more frequently, conduct an annual review of the internal audit, and educat=
e members in more than just the balance-sheet basics. ``Ultimately,'' says =
Alan Cleveland, counsel to the New Hampshire Retirement System, an Enron sh=
areholder, ``what it comes down to is what goes on not only in the boardroo=
m but in the minds of these outside directors.'' For governance to work, di=
rectors need to understand that their job is to keep tabs on management--no=
t simply show up.

Costly Lessons
Here's where the Enron board's audit committee came up short and some possi=
ble
fixes.
DISCLOSURE
Companies are required to disclose some, but not all, financial ties with
directors. Critics have cited conflicts at Enron, which correctly disclosed
its consulting contract with one audit-committee member, but not the
charitable contributions made to affiliated organizations of two others.
SOLUTION: Disclose all financial ties.
KNOW-HOW
Audit-committee members must demonstrate basic financial literacy, and one
must have financial expertise. Enron's committee included an accounting
professor, an economist, and two businessmen. But they apparently didn't
understand the risks in some of the company's complex limited partnerships.
SOLUTION: Committees should have to meet more often, review internal audits=
,
and get industry-specific finance training.
COMPENSATION
Most companies pay directors largely in stock to align their interests with
those of shareholders. But at Enron, where some directors sold shares near =
the
August, 2000, high, large holdings may have made directors less willing to =
ask
tough questions.
SOLUTION: Pay in stock, but ban stock sales as long as directors are on the
board.

THE MORTICIANS MOVE IN Lawyers, investment bankers, and accountants could w=
alk away with as much as $300 million
By Dan Carney in Washington, with Emily Thornton in New York and bureau rep=
orts

01/21/2002
BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

When Houston-based energy company Dynegy Inc. pulled out of a deal to buy t=
roubled Enron Corp. last Nov. 28, attorneys at the firm Weil, Gotshal & Man=
ges knew they had to act fast. Enron's stock was plunging below a dollar, i=
ts credit rating had collapsed, and creditors suddenly had the right to cal=
l in loans and seize buildings, pipelines, and other assets the company had=
 put up as collateral. ``We were hearing rumors about unilateral actions by=
 creditors,'' says Weil Gotshal partner Martin J. Bienenstock. ``And we wan=
ted to stop that.''=20
So the law firm, which Enron retained in October, threw everything it had i=
nto the case. Dozens of lawyers worked around the clock preparing a petitio=
n for Chapter 11 protection. When they finished four days later, they immed=
iately filed electronically with bankruptcy court--even though it was 5 a.m=
. on a Sunday morning. By acting so quickly, the lawyers claim they kept En=
ron's creditors from tearing the company apart.
They've been busy ever since. Indeed, Enron's misfortune is proving to be W=
eil Gotshal's blessing. By the time the bankruptcy is over, the firm could =
rake in as much as $30 million in fees. More than a dozen other law firms a=
re also on the case. And the attorneys are joined by a small army of invest=
ment bankers, such as Blackstone Group, which is charging $350,000 a month,=
 plus a $35 million bonus if the company reemerges from Chapter 11. All in =
all, the various hired guns managing history's largest bankruptcy will earn=
 fees of as much as $300 million or more.=20
They are under a tight deadline and operating in a highly charged environme=
nt. On Jan. 9, the situation became even more electric as the Justice Dept.=
 confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into the fall of Enr=
on. That is likely to be a serious distraction for the lawyers, bankers, an=
d accountants, but for now, they are focused almost exclusively on auctioni=
ng a majority stake in Enron's highly successful trading unit, set to be co=
mpleted on Jan. 10. A quick sale is seen as critical because the unit is ra=
pidly losing out to more stable rivals. ``The idea is that this is like rip=
e fruit,'' says one attorney close to the case. ``If it doesn't move quickl=
y, it will rot.''=20
These are boom times for the morticians of the business world. It is a dive=
rse group that also includes accountants and turnaround specialists--manage=
ment consultants, such as Jay Alix & Associates, that specialize in rescuin=
g insolvent companies. Last year, 255 publicly traded companies filed for b=
ankruptcy, breaking the prior record of 176 in 2000, according to Bankruptc=
yData.com. ``It's not as if I get up in the morning and say, `I want to get=
 rich off this,''' says Luc A. Despins, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley=
 & McCloy and lead counsel to Enron's creditors. ``But all of us have tons =
of work right now.''=20
Unlike prior downturns, where bankruptcies have been concentrated in troubl=
ed industries such as airlines and retail, the current wave of failures is =
unusually broad. It runs across a wide swath of businesses, including Pacif=
ic Gas & Electric, LTV, Excite@Home, and Fruit of the Loom. Even though the=
 debtors are more diverse than ever, the bankruptcy business is dominated b=
y a small club. There are perhaps a dozen law firms--and even fewer investm=
ent banks--with the armies of experts a big company in trouble needs on sho=
rt notice.=20
So far, the Enron case has attracted many of the big guns. Among law firms,=
 Weil Gotshal has the most prominent bankruptcy practice. Milbank Tweed is =
the leading specialist in the representation of creditors. Other top bankru=
ptcy shops include Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Me=
agher & Flom; and Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. Top partners at these firms b=
ill $700 an hour and earn more than $2 million annually.=20
What do they do to earn the big bucks? They work day and night to come up w=
ith a restructuring plan that will enable a viable company to emerge from b=
ankruptcy. Corporate boards are more than willing to pay the fees of lawyer=
s who can stave off an all-out fire sale of assets.=20
Bienenstock's goal is to bring Enron out of bankruptcy as soon as a year fr=
om now. Once the trading unit auction is complete, his next major task will=
 be selling overseas assets, including a $2.9 billion power plant in India =
and a power plant, electricity grid, and gas-pipeline company in Brazil. Ma=
ny of the projects are losing money and are joint ventures with those gover=
nments. It is uncertain who would be interested in these assets.=20
Given the company's complexity and potential legal problems, most observers=
 are betting it will take Bienenstock twice as long as he'd like to bring E=
nron around. That could be bad news for the company, since creditors tend t=
o push harder for liquidation the longer bankruptcy proceedings drag on. ``=
I'd put his chances [of a successful reorganization] at about 30%,'' says U=
niversity of Houston Law School Dean and bankruptcy professor Nancy Rapapor=
t. ``At some point, creditors might say, `You've liquidated some, we think =
you should keep going.'''=20
While Weil Gotshal has had some notable successes--including the 1990 restr=
ucturing of Federated Department Stores--it also has plenty of critics. The=
 firm's bruising tactics have earned it the nickname ``We'll Getcha and Man=
gle Ya'' among rivals. It has also occasionally run into trouble with bankr=
uptcy trustees. In 1992, an employee of the U.S. Trustee in Connecticut acc=
used the firm of padding its bills in a case involving gunmaker Colt's Manu=
facturing Co. Weil denies it, and no penalty was imposed. In 1994, though, =
the firm was penalized $1 million for not reporting conflicts in the bankru=
ptcy of Leslie Fay Cos. The trustee in that case was none other than U.S. D=
istrict Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez--the man hearing the Enron bankruptcy. But=
 the two sides have met on cases with no sign of ill will since.=20
Standing side by side with the attorneys in the Enron bankruptcy are the in=
vestment bankers. While not nearly so numerous as the lawyers, they tend to=
 make more money. Indeed, restructuring work is fetching larger fees than e=
ver because of the difficulty of valuing and selling bankrupt assets. Since=
 many bigger investment banks dropped out of the bankruptcy business when t=
he economy picked up in the early 1990s, it is now dominated by boutiques s=
uch as Blackstone, Lazard, and CIBC World Markets.=20
The auction of Enron's trading unit has been largely handled by Blackstone.=
 Boutique shop Batchelder & Partners Inc., meanwhile, has poured over the b=
ooks in search of overlooked assets. Because of the pressure to move quickl=
y, it has been grueling. ``We've been heavily involved on a full-time basis=
, which includes weekends,'' says Steven M. Zelin, a senior managing direct=
or at Blackstone. For Enron's undertakers, that's likely to continue for so=
me time.

Where the Money Is Going
The biggest bankruptcy in history is making a small industry of advisers ri=
ch
ENRON'S LAWYERS
The oil giant has turned to Corporate America's leading bankruptcy counsel,
Weil, Gotshal & Manges. The firm charges $700 per hour for top guns and cou=

CREDITORS' LAWYERS
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy dominates the business of representing
creditors and is expected to earn $15 million to $30 million on the Enron
case.
INVESTMENT BANKERS
Blackstone Group, Enron's lead banker, will get $350,000 a month, plus a $3=

$375,000 a month if the reorganization attempt fails.
ACCOUNTANTS
While Enron is in bankruptcy, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, as well as other
firms, will advise the parties to the bankruptcy. Fees are yet to be
determined, but accountants often earn up to $200,000 a month.

THE PERILS OF J.P. MORGAN Enron, Argentina, the bear market-a year after th=
e merger with Chase, the bank is racking up losses
By Heather Timmons in New York, with Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles

01/21/2002
BusinessWeek
62
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

When Chase Manhattan swooped in to bid $33 billion for white-shoe investmen=
t bank J.P. Morgan in September, 2000, Chief Executive William B. Harrison =
Jr. claimed that the new behemoth would provide ``huge'' growth. The idea w=
as simple: Thousands of Chase's corporate customers would be pushed into J.=
P. Morgan's arms and pay fat fees for takeover deals, securities issues, an=
d the like. Nor was the strategy far-fetched. After all, Citibank and Trave=
lers Group had successfully combined in 1998 to produce a bull-market jugge=
rnaut that was leaving rivals, including Chase, in the dust.=20
The reality has turned out to be a lot different. Instead of striking the n=
ew gusher of profits promised by Harrison, the merged J.P. Morgan Chase & C=
o. has tapped into a seemingly endless well of red ink. As a result, the ne=
w bank is ending its first full year by taking huge write-downs and making =
expensive additions to loan loss reserves. Analysts figure anything from $8=
00 million to over $2 billion will be sliced off the fourth-quarter operati=
ng earnings to be announced on Jan. 16. Piled on top of second-quarter char=
ges of about $1 billion, net income for 2001 could drop as low as $3.5 bill=
ion, down from the $5.7 billion that J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan togeth=
er earned in 2000.
Admittedly, 2001 was the worst year for investment banking in nearly a deca=
de. Mergers and acquisitions dried up, as did stock offerings and syndicate=
d lending. Moreover, as the global economy worsened and the bear market dra=
gged on, corporate lending and private equity took major hits as well.=20
More than bad luck with the timing of its merger could be dogging J.P. Morg=
an, however. Some analysts argue that the bank regularly runs much bigger r=
isks than its rivals and is now paying the price. The bank's exposure to ba=
nkrupt energy trader Enron Corp.'s loans, and energy and derivatives contra=
cts, has grown to $2.6 billion. It has $900 million in exposure to Argentin=
a and its $117 billion commercial loan portfolio is facing a series of high=
-profile losses--thanks to bankruptcies among its telecom customers, as wel=
l as Enron. The value of its private equity portfolio, the largest of any U=
.S. bank, has been a major drag on earnings since the Nasdaq crash in March=
, 2000. And analysts have started to worry that the bank's off-balance-shee=
t assets could be a future source of losses. ``I think their risk profile i=
s greatly understated,'' says Charles Peabody, an analyst with independent =
researcher Ventana Capital.=20
J.P. Morgan executives balk at any suggestion they deliberately court more =
risks than their peers. They argue that investors and analysts are punishin=
g the bank because it has been more scrupulous about reporting potential lo=
sses. The company's stock has sunk 22% since the merger was announced in 20=
00. ``We're a lightning rod for credit issues because we've been more up-fr=
ont than other participants in the market,'' says Chief Financial Officer D=
ina Dublon. Indeed, J.P. Morgan has been more open than others in some matt=
ers. It posts its private equity portfolio online. And it told analysts abo=
ut its Argentina exposure when the country careened toward default. Citigro=
up, by contrast, doesn't detail its private equity holdings. Nor has it giv=
en details on its exposure to Argentina, which analysts estimate at $4 bill=
ion, beyond saying that country contributes less than 2% of earnings.=20
Still, it's unnerving how the bad news keeps piling up at J.P. Morgan. Beca=
use the bank was one of the largest lenders to Enron, as well as an adviser=
 in the aborted Dynegy Inc. takeover bid, analysts weren't surprised when i=
t announced on Nov. 28 that it had $900 million in exposure to the energy c=
ompany. The real shocker was the disclosure on Dec. 19 that the bank's unse=
cured exposure to Enron had tripled, to $1.6 billion, after insurers failed=
 to make good on nearly $1 billion in guarantees on Enron gas contracts. Ca=
lled surety bonds, the guarantees were issued to Mahonia Natural Gas, a J.P=
. Morgan ``special purpose vehicle'' created to handle commodity contracts =
with Enron. The bank is suing the nine insurers to force them to pay up, bu=
t they are fighting back. Meantime, analysts say the belated disclosure has=
 hurt the bank's reputation.=20
Corporate lending problems don't end there. J.P. Morgan and Citi assembled =
a group of banks that lent telecom company Global Crossing Ltd.--now deeply=
 troubled--more than $2.2 billion in its palmier days. Normally, banks take=
 precedence over other lenders in a bankruptcy, but that may not be so with=
 Global Crossing, says Aryeh B. Bourkoff, a distressed-debt analyst at UBS =
Warburg. Because of the way the loan is structured, he says, other creditor=
s could be paid first if Global Crossing goes under. The point isn't academ=
ic: Global Crossing lost $1.9 billion on revenues of $2.4 billion in the fi=
rst nine months of last year, and its bank debt sells for 20 cents on the d=
ollar, far below that of other distressed telecom companies. J.P. Morgan an=
d the other banks have been negotiating to stretch out the loan and cut the=
 interest rates charged on it in exchange for new collateral. In late Decem=
ber, the bankers gave the company until Feb. 13 to reach an agreement. J.P.=
 Morgan insists that its loan is, in fact, secured. CFO Dublon says analyst=
s should look beyond these black marks. ``We're still going to be profitabl=
e,'' she says.=20
Indeed the market may be exaggerating some of J.P. Morgan's risks. For exam=

Still, there's more bad news ahead. J.P. Morgan Partners, the bank's privat=

off-balance-sheet dealings. It founded, and is by far the largest market ma=
ker in, the $1 trillion market for credit derivatives, a form of loan insur=
ance. Issuers of these derivatives lose money if insured borrowers don't re=

$95 million--was borne by J.P. Morgan alone, says Ventana's Peabody, who ex=

``The fall of Enron'' (Cover Story, Dec. 17) stated that Enron's maze of pa=
rtnerships made it very difficult for rating firms such as Standard & Poor'=
s to verify many of its debts. You even went further and stated that, even =
now, nobody really knows what other off-balance sheet liabilities exist. If=
 that is the case, then what about other companies that have similar assets=
 and potential liabilities off their books? What ratings should such firms =
be given?=20
It is high time that rating firms such as S&P informed their clients of suc=
h off-balance sheet items--so that nasty accounting malpractices such as th=
ose that overtook Enron do not take bankers, investors, employees, and cred=

Just four days before Enron disclosed a stunning $618 million loss for the =
third quarter--its first public disclosure of its financial woes--workers w=
ho audited the company's books for Arthur Andersen, the big accounting firm=
, received an extraordinary instruction from one of the company's lawyers. =
Congressional investigators tell TIME that the Oct. 12 memo directed worker=
s to destroy all audit material, except for the most basic "work papers." A=
nd that's what they did, over a period of several weeks. As a result, FBI i=
nvestigators, congressional probers and workers suing the company for lost =
retirement savings will be denied thousands of e-mails and other electronic=
 and paper files that could have helped illuminate the actions and motivati=
ons of Enron executives involved in what now is the biggest bankruptcy in U=
.S. history.=20
Supervisors at Arthur Andersen repeatedly reminded their employees of the d=
ocument-destruction memo in the weeks leading up to the first Security and =
Exchange Commission subpoenas that were issued on Nov. 8. And the firm decl=
ines to rule out the possibility that some destruction continued even after=
 that date. Its workers had destroyed "a significant but undetermined numbe=
r" of documents related to Enron, the accounting firm acknowledged in a ter=
se public statement last Thursday. But it did not reveal that the destructi=
on orders came in the Oct. 12 memo. Sources close to Arthur Andersen confir=
m the basic contents of the memo, but spokesman David Tabolt said it would =
be "inappropriate" to discuss it until the company completes its own review=
 of the explosive issue.
Though there are no firm rules on how long accounting firms must retain doc=
uments, most hold on to a wide range of them for several years. Any deliber=
ate destruction of documents subject to subpoena is illegal. In Arthur Ande=
rsen's dealings with the documents related to Enron, "the mind-set seemed t=
o be, If not required to keep it, then get rid of it," says Ken Johnson, sp=
okesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose investigators fi=
rst got wind of the Oct. 12 memo and which is pursuing one of half a dozen =
investigations of Enron. "Anyone who destroyed records out of stupidity sho=
uld be fired," said committee chairman Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican=
. "Anyone who destroyed records to try to circumvent our investigation shou=
ld be prosecuted."=20
The accounting for a global trading company like Enron is mind- numbingly c=
omplex. But it's crucial to learning how the company fell so far so fast, t=
aking with it the jobs and pension savings of thousands of workers and infl=
icting losses on millions of individual investors. At the heart of Enron's =
demise was the creation of partnerships with shell companies, many with nam=
es like Chewco and JEDI, inspired by Star Wars characters. These shell comp=
anies, run by Enron executives who profited richly from them, allowed Enron=
 to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off its books. But once st=
ock analysts and financial journalists heard about these arrangements, inve=
stors began to lose confidence in the company's finances. The results: a ru=
n on the stock, lowered credit ratings and insolvency.=20
Shredded evidence is only one of the issues that will get close scrutiny in=
 the Enron case. The U.S. Justice Department announced last week that it wa=
s creating a task force, staffed with experts on complex financial crimes, =
to pursue a full criminal investigation. But the country was quickly remind=
ed of the pervasive reach of Enron and its executives--the biggest contribu=
tors to the Presidential campaign of George W. Bush--when U.S. Attorney Gen=
eral John Ashcroft had to recuse himself from the probe because he had rece=
ived $57,499 in campaign cash from Enron for his failed 2000 Senate re-elec=
tion bid in Missouri. Then the entire office of the U.S. Attorney in Housto=
n recused itself because too many of its prosecutors had personal ties to E=
nron executives--or to angry workers who have been fired or have seen their=
 life savings disappear.=20
Texas attorney general John Cornyn, who launched an investigation in Decemb=
er into 401(k) losses at Enron and possible tax liabilities owed to Texas, =
recused himself because since 1997 he has accepted $158,000 in campaign con=
tributions from the company. "I know some of the Enron execs, and there has=
 been contact, but there was no warning," he says of the collapse.=20
Bush told reporters that he had not talked with Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay ab=
out the company's woes. But the White House later acknowledged that Lay, a =
longtime friend of Bush's, had lobbied Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Tre=
asury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Lay called O'Neill to inform him of Enron's s=
haky finances and to warn that because of the company's key role in energy =
markets, its collapse could send tremors through the whole economy. Lay com=
pared Enron to Long-Term Capital Management, a big hedge fund whose near co=
llapse in 1998 required a bailout organized by the Federal Reserve Board. H=
e asked Evans whether the Administration might do something to help Enron m=
aintain its credit rating. Both men declined to help.=20
An O'Neill deputy, Peter Fisher, got similar calls from Enron's president a=
nd from Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary who now serves as a top=
 executive at Citigroup, which had at least $800 million in exposure to Enr=
on through loans and insurance policies. Fisher--who had helped organize th=
e LTCM bailout--judged that Enron's slide didn't pose the same dangers to t=
he financial system and advised O'Neill against any bailout or intervention=
 with lenders or credit-rating agencies.=20
On the evidence to date, the Bush Administration would seem to have admirab=
ly rebuffed pleas for favors from its most generous business supporter. But=
 it didn't tell that story very effectively-- encouraging speculation that =
it has something to hide. Democrats in Congress, frustrated by Bush's soari=
ng popularity and their own inability to move pet legislation through Congr=
ess, smelled a chance to link Bush and his party to the richest tale of gre=
ed, self- dealing and political access since junk-bond king Michael Milken =
was jailed in 1991. That's just what the President, hoping to convert momen=
tum from his war on terrorism to the war on recession, desperately wants to=
 avoid. The fallout will swing on the following key questions:=20
WAS A CRIME COMMITTED?=20
The justice investigation will be overseen in Washington by a seasoned hand=
, Josh Hochberg, head of the fraud section and the first to listen to the F=
BI tape of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky in the days leading to the case =
against President Clinton. The probe will address a wide range of questions=
: Were Enron's partnerships with shell corporations designed to hide its li=
abilities and mislead investors? Was evidence intentionally or negligently =
destroyed? Did Enron executives' political contributions and the access tha=
t the contributions won them result in any special favors? Did Enron execut=
ives know the company was sinking as they sold $1.1 billion in stock while =
encouraging employees and other investors to keep buying?=20
"It's not hard to come up with a scenario for indictment here," says John C=
offee, professor of corporate law at Columbia University. "Enough of the fa=
cts are already known to know that there is a high prospect of securities-f=
raud charges against both Enron and some of its officers." He adds that "on=
ce you've set up a task force this large, involving attorneys from Washingt=
on, New York and probably California, history shows the likelihood is they =
will find something indictable."=20
Enron has already acknowledged that it overstated its income for more than =
four years. The question is whether this was the result of negligence or an=
 intent to defraud. Securities fraud requires a willful intent to deceive. =
It doesn't look good, Coffee says, that key Enron executives were selling s=
tock shortly before the company announced a restatement of earnings.=20
As for Arthur Andersen, criminal charges could result if it can be shown th=
at its executives ordered the destruction of documents while being aware of=
 the existence of a subpoena for them. A likely ploy will be for prosecutor=
s to target the auditors, hoping to turn them into witnesses against Enron.=
 Says Coffee: "If the auditors can offer testimony, that would be the most =
damaging testimony imaginable."=20
WHAT ABOUT OTHER PROBES?=20
Enron is in the cross hairs of at least six congressional panels. In the Se=
nate, the Permanent Investigative Subcommittee got a jump on Jan. 11 by sub=
poenaing documents of 49 Enron executives and, separately, the corporate re=
cords of Enron and Arthur Andersen. The subpoenas, covering the period from=
 1999 through 2001, are aimed at learning "what the officers knew and what =
they did about it," said a committee official. The first hearing this year =
is scheduled for Jan. 24, headed by Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman. The=
 first appearance of Enron chairman Lay is scheduled for Feb. 4 before the =
Senate Commerce Committee.=20
There are now 47 class actions against Enron and its executives and directo=
rs, filed either by shareholders or employees and carrying mainly the possi=
ble penalty of heavy fines. Most allege that Enron failed to disclose its m=
any risky partnerships, which proved to be a large part of its undoing. Tho=
ugh Enron is bankrupt, Arthur Andersen could be liable as well, and Enron's=
 officers and directors have deep pockets. Plaintiffs are seeking to freeze=
 the proceeds of Enron stock sales by those insiders. "Going after director=
s personally is rare. But this case calls for the unusual," says Jim Newman=
, executive director of Securities Class Action Services, which monitors su=
ch cases.=20
WERE FAVORS RECEIVED?=20
At the White House last week junior aides were asking Washington veterans w=
hether they will have to hire lawyers because they attended meetings in whi=
ch Enron issues were discussed. Answer: probably not-- but the question sho=
ws the level of concern. Though there has been no evidence of anything ille=
gal, Enron enjoyed considerable influence from the start of the Bush Admini=
stration. Curtis Hebert Jr., the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission, told the New York Times that Lay offered to support Hebe=
rt's continuing in that role if Hebert would take a friendlier view toward =
energy deregulation. Hebert declined, and the Bush Administration replaced =
him. Lay and other Enron officials met six times with officials led by Vice=
 President Dick Cheney (a former oilman) to craft a new energy policy. That=
 policy, not surprisingly, was friendly to Enron and other energy companies=
.=20
Bush says he first learned last Thursday that Lay had approached his Cabine=
t secretaries for help. Press secretary Ari Fleischer told Bush he should e=
xpect to be asked about any contacts that he had with Lay. Fleischer had re=
searched the matter, and he "refreshed" the President's memory about the la=
st time he met with Lay: in spring 2001, in Houston, at an event hosted by =
Bush's mother. O'Neill was present at the Thursday discussion and said, "Oh=
, by the way, you need to know that I had a conversation with Ken Lay. He c=
alled me." O'Neill described the call as a "heads up" about Enron's financi=
al woes and the potential effects they might have on the larger economy. Bu=
sh nodded. Then Evans, also present, chimed in. "I got a call from Ken too,=
" said the Commerce Secretary, who is Bush's closest friend. "He was asking=
 me to help, but I didn't."=20
While Bush and the Republicans have gained the lion's share of attention fr=
om Enron and Lay, they get at least a little cover from the company's campa=
ign contributions to prominent Democrats, such as Senate Energy Committee C=
hairman Jeff Bingaman and Louisiana Senator John Breaux. Enron and its top =
officials have hired the well-known Democratic lawyers Robert Bennett and D=
avid Boies. And Bob Rubin, the Democrats' high priest of economics and fina=
nce, was caught fishing-- albeit tentatively by all accounts--for Treasury =
intervention on Enron's behalf.=20
WHO WILL AUDIT THE AUDITORS?=20
Mark Cheffers, CEO of Accounting Malpractice.com, says of Arthur Andersen: =
"Even if they're innocent, it looks like a massive cover- up." Andersen rep=
orted its destruction of Enron documents to the SEC and Justice Department =
early last week--just before four congressional investigators arrived at th=
e company's Houston office on Wednesday. Committee officials immediately de=
manded the personal records of the partner and five top executives working =
on the Enron account.=20
The incident further tars the name of venerable Arthur Andersen, which in J=
une settled allegations of fraud stemming from its audit of Houston-based W=
aste Management and paid a $7 million fine without admitting any wrongdoing=
. Last year, again without admitting wrongdoing, Andersen agreed to pay $11=
0 million to settle a class action brought on behalf of shareholders of ano=
ther client, Sunbeam, which had misstated its financial results during the =
1990s. These days, an Andersen competitor observes sardonically, settling a=
 fraud case appears to be good for attracting business from other firms tha=
t want a soft touch for an auditor.=20
With the SEC, the Justice Department and various congressional committees n=
ow scrutinizing Andersen's audit work on Enron, there is little doubt effor=
ts will be made to rein in the industry. "The profession has always done ju=
st enough to get out of a hole," says industry analyst Arthur Bowman. The S=
EC and Congress are looking into Andersen's interpretation of accounting ru=
les that allowed Enron to exclude losses at several partnerships from its b=
alance sheets. But the larger issue will be the objectivity of the entire i=
ndustry. Enron paid Andersen $25 million for its audit last year and $27 mi=
llion for "consulting" and other services. "How can any auditor be independ=
ent when his client is paying this kind of money?" Bowman asks.=20
Two of Enron's senior financial executives had previously worked for Anders=
en in Houston: Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, and Jeffre=
y McMahon, chief financial officer. Although it's not unusual for auditors =
to be subsequently hired by their clients, Andersen has an unusual history-=
-in Waste Management's case, supplying every CFO from 1971 to 1997.=20
CAN 401(K)S BE PROTECTED?=20
There has been some movement in Congress for reform, spurred by the plight =
of Enron workers who had, on average, 62% of their 401(k) savings tied up i=
n Enron stock. Those savings were largely wiped out because the plan offere=
d little opportunity to diversify. Like many corporate plans, Enron's didn'=
t allow participants to transfer stock that had been given to them as part =
of a matching contribution until age 50. And Enron officials actively encou=
raged workers to buy Enron stock. In a memo in August, Lay told employees h=
e'd "never felt better about the prospects of the company. Our growth has n=
ever been more certain." Enron workers were further hamstrung by Enron's sw=
itching of plan administrators and freezing of all asset shifting within 40=
1(k) accounts for at least 10 days, just as Enron stock was taking its dive=
. The result was ruin, as Enron sank from $90 to under $1.=20
Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jers=
ey have proposed that plan assets be limited to no more than 20% of any one=
 stock. Their bill would also reduce tax breaks for companies that make mat=
ching contributions with stock and would free employees to sell matching st=
ock after 90 days. Senator Bingaman wants to allow companies to offer finan=
cial advice without being liable for investment losses, as they currently a=
re.=20
Says David Certner, chief lobbyist for the American Association for Retired=
 Persons: "In 401(k) plans, we are asking people to take the risk and respo=
nsibility for investing, yet we set up this system where we are violating t=
he first basic rule of investing: diversification." Where company stock is =
a savings option, employees invest almost a third of their assets in it.=20
Behind all the front-page headlines last week, Enron was struggling to mana=
ge its bankruptcy reorganization. One key all along has been to keep the va=
unted energy-trading unit operating. That group accounted for 90% of Enron'=
s revenue, and Friday it was sold at auction to UBS Warburg for a price to =
be disclosed this week. The courts must approve the sale, however, which pr=
omises to spark legal fireworks from creditors, who will want to make sure =
the company got a fair price. Not that it will matter much to Enron. The co=
mpany has little chance of emerging from Chapter 11 intact. Says Peter Chap=
man, president of Bankruptcy Creditors' Service: "Assets are being liquidat=
ed for the benefit of creditors." But even if the company disappears, the n=
ame Enron will be with us for a while.=20

THE NATION THE ENRON INQUIRY As Questions Get Louder, Cheney Stays Silent P=

 asserts executive privilege.

WASHINGTON -- The growing Enron debacle is turning up the political heat on=
 Vice President Dick Cheney, who has refused to detail his contacts with co=
mpany officials while developing a national energy policy last year.=20
Amid Democratic charges that he granted Enron undue access--and produced in=
 secret an industry-friendly plan--Cheney's unyielding stance has hampered =
the Bush administration's efforts to distance itself from the scandal.
The flap dominated Thursday's White House briefing, as it had on Wednesday.=
 Press Secretary Ari Fleischer reiterated Cheney's position: that he is def=
ending executive privilege in rebuffing the congressional push, led by Reps=
. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), for the in=
formation on his meetings with Enron officials.=20
Cheney and his aides say neither he nor his energy task force did anything =
wrong. Yet the impression lingers, even some Republicans conceded, that the=
 vice president has something to hide.=20
"Cheney and his staff have violated the most fundamental of all scandal rul=
es: full and fast disclosure," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virgin=
ia political scientist. "A flat refusal to disclose information automatical=
ly makes the public and the press more suspicious, and it guarantees that t=
he headlines about the controversy will be plentiful and unending."=20
Many analysts predict that Cheney ultimately will have little alternative b=
ut to provide the information.=20
Mary Matalin, a senior Cheney advisor, rejected that scenario. She said in =
an interview that Cheney will not abandon his conviction that he is acting =
to protect executive privilege.=20
"There is a principle here that we want to preserve--for not just this admi=
nistration but future administrations," Matalin said. "The powers and prero=
gatives of the executive branch have been eroded, and we're going to stop t=
hat."=20
In resisting disclosure, however, Cheney and his aides are providing Democr=
ats and other critics the opportunity to depict the White House as a shill =
for Enron, the nation's seventh-largest company until it filed for bankrupt=
cy.=20
"It may be a matter of principle, but they are going to get killed for it,"=
 said Charles E. Cook, a Washington-based political analyst. "They are goin=
g to lose a lot of blood and, in the end, they will release" the requested =
information.=20
Cook added: "The question is, how much political pain they are going to sus=
tain before releasing it."=20
"The danger for Cheney in this Enron fiasco is perception," added one top R=
epublican strategist, who requested anonymity. "And perception in politics =
needs to be nipped in the bud--immediately. Right now, they are behind the =
perception eight-ball."=20
Many Republicans and White House allies reject that view--reflecting a vigo=
rous debate that sources say is raging in the West Wing on whether Cheney s=
hould turn over the information sought by Congress.=20
"My advice to him would be to hang in there. Hang tough. I don't think he's=
 hurting himself," said Washington lobbyist Tom Korologos, who has advised =
GOP presidents going back to Richard Nixon.=20
Another factor that has helped thrust Cheney into the glare of the Enron co=
ntroversy is the trust and confidence he enjoys from President Bush.=20
"The problem with being as visibly influential as Cheney has been is that w=
hen things go wrong, he gets some of the blame," said Joel K. Goldstein, a =
St. Louis University law professor and author of "The Modern American Vice =
Presidency."=20
In the eyes of their political detractors, including environmental activist=
s, Bush and Cheney were suspect on energy issues from their first day in of=
fice, given their background in the oil industry.=20
Cheney quickly fueled such concerns when, amid sharply rising energy prices=
, he seemed to discount the importance of conservation in dealing with the =
problem. Then his energy task force released a plan in May that angered env=
ironmentalists and conservationists by proposing, among other things, openi=
ng a small portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy ex=
ploration.=20
Critics also immediately questioned the role of Enron executives in the pla=
n's formulation; Waxman and Dingell have been asking Cheney for months to d=
isclose his contacts with the company. With Enron's collapse late last year=
, those requests have escalated.=20
On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee charged th=
at there are at least 17 policies in the White House energy plan that are "=
virtually identical to positions Enron advocated."=20
Administration officials took strong issue with that assertion. Matalin cal=
led it "transparent election-year politicking."=20
Such unabated exchanges, however, point up the controversy's corrosive effe=
ct on the White House and on Bush's agenda.=20
"The big loser last week was the president's education bill," said a senior=
 GOP strategist, noting that news coverage of the measure's signing was ove=
rshadowed by the media's focus on the Enron story.=20
"Mary Matalin can be flippant all she wants, but this isn't going to go awa=
y," said the Republican, who requested anonymity.=20
Sabato agreed.=20
"Even at this late stage, Cheney's best route out of the controversy is the=
 same as the original one early on--full disclosure," he said.=20
"There is something about the White House that leads each new administratio=
n to believe they are exempt from the usual rules of scandal," Sabato added=
. "Perhaps the headiness of power and popularity produces a kind of scandal=
 amnesia. Cheney exhibits the symptoms."

The Mirror Image of Whitewater
William Schneider

National Journal
Copyright 2002 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Missing documents. Financial wrongdoing. Is Enron another Whitewater? Actua=
lly, Enron Corp. looks like the mirror image of Whitewater: a scandal less =
likely to implicate a President, but more likely to affect public policy.=
=20
Whitewater was about finding a smoking gun that would incriminate President=
 Clinton or his wife. Everyone knew what then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,=
 was getting at when he asked, at the outset of the 1994 Whitewater investi=
gation, "What did the President know, and when did he know it?" In the Enro=
n case, no one is making criminal allegations about President Bush. This ti=
me, a Senator from the opposition party is again chairing the Senate invest=
igation. But Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., set a different tone when he said=
, "There are some interconnections here with the Bush Administration, but t=
hat's not the focus of this inquiry."
Whitewater was a shady land deal of no great public consequence. The collap=
se of Enron, the seventh-largest Fortune 500 corporation, matters a great d=
eal. It wiped out $60 billion in shareholder value. Tens of thousands of pe=
ople got hurt.=20
"The grave consequences of Enron's collapse are economic and personal, not =
political," Lieberman said. Unlike Whitewater, which was intensely politica=
l, it's hard to dispute that the Enron investigation concerns a matter of l=
egitimate public interest. As Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., observed, "Either l=
aws and regulations were followed, in which case those laws and regulations=
 are pitifully inadequate.... [or] laws and regulations were violated."=20
Enron's well-connected executives and directors may have defrauded investor=
s by concealing information about the company's finances. And these officia=
ls may have engaged in insider trading by selling more than $1 billion wort=
h of stock before its price collapsed.=20
Enron virtually financed Bush's political career. The company had ties to h=
igh-level officials in the Bush White House. And Enron was a major contribu=
tor to both political parties. None of that is illegal. But it does raise s=
erious issues. For instance, Enron clearly tried to influence the Bush Admi=
nistration's energy policy in its favor. Enron representatives met with Vic=
e President Cheney's energy task force six times. Enron Chairman Kenneth La=
y pushed, successfully, to replace the head of the Federal Energy Regulator=
y Commission. Clearly, Enron had special access. Were special favors grante=
d?=20
The White House has acknowledged that Lay sought help from top Cabinet and =
Treasury Department officials as the company struggled to avert bankruptcy.=
 Administration officials say they refused to intervene. Bush's supporters =
say that Enron's collapse is proof that the company got no special protecti=
on. "It's a tribute to our capitalism," Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said. "C=
apitalism is the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail and not have a =
government guarantee of success."=20
But the issue is not merely whether the government attempted to protect the=
 company. It's also whether the government protected the public. Rep. Henry=
 A. Waxman, D-Calif., has said: "It is now clear that the White House had k=
nowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protec=
t innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life saving=
s."=20
What is not clear is how much and how early the Bush Administration knew ab=
out Enron's problems. "I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial pr=
oblems of the company," Bush said last week. Moreover, the calls from Enron=
 seeking help came in late October, after the company's financial problems =
had become public.=20
It is also unclear what the Administration could have done. Companies fail =
all the time. Professional auditors and Wall Street analysts didn't raise a=
ny alarms about Enron's finances.=20
What's driving the political story is the fact that the Administration is b=
ehaving so defensively. Why was the White House so reluctant to divulge the=
 records of its energy task force? Why was the Administration so slow to ac=
knowledge contacts between Enron executives and Cabinet officials? In the E=
nron case, the revelations themselves have not been particularly damaging t=
o the Administration. But the fact the Administration has been so secretive=
 about them raises suspicions of a cover-up.=20
So far, the main damage has been to Bush's image. The President may have be=
haved properly, but the company that has been the chief backer of his polit=
ical career is now under criminal investigation. There is no way that can l=
ook good.=20
Enron reinforces a damaging stereotype about Bush, just as Whitewater did a=
bout Clinton. Americans had doubts about Bill Clinton's character from the =
outset. Whitewater brought those problems into focus: Is the President a li=
ar? Americans also started out with a stereotype about George W. Bush: He w=
as a man of limited intellectual ability who raised a lot of money from his=
 rich friends. Enron brings those problems into focus: Is this President a =
front man for the Big Money boys?=20
That image is especially damaging when you have a Republican President born=
 to wealth and privilege in office during an economic downturn. Bush's war =
leadership can counteract that stereotype-for a time. But which will last l=
ongest-the war, the recession, or the Enron controversy? If it turns out to=
 be the recession and the Enron controversy, that combination could be poli=
tically lethal.

Gramms regulated Enron, benefited from ties

The collapse of Enron Corp. has drawn new scrutiny of a powerful Washington=
 couple who between them played prominent roles in deregulating energy trad=
ing to the benefit of the company.=20
The couple, U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and his wife, Wendy Gramm, who s=
erves on Enron's board of directors, both know Enron's top executive, Kenne=
th Lay--and have benefited financially from their relationship with him.
Phil Gramm has collected more than $97,000 in campaign contributions from E=
nron, according to the advocacy group Public Citizen. Wendy Gramm was paid =
between $915,000 and $1.8 million in salary, attendance fees, stock options=
 and dividends over the past eight years, the group concluded.=20
"What has all of this bought" Enron, asked Sheila Krumholz, research direct=
or for the Center for Responsive Politics. "Has this bought them cover?"=20
In the early 1990s, Wendy Gramm, then chairwoman of the Commodity Futures T=
rading Commission, moved to lift governmental oversight of energy contracts=
 that Enron and other companies traded. A short time later, she was appoint=
ed to Enron's board of directors.=20
And in December 2000, Phil Gramm helped clear the way for a bill turning hi=
s wife's deregulation decision into law, something Enron had long wanted.=
=20
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act, of which Phil Gramm was a sponsor,=
 contained a clause making the exemption law. Though it is now called the "=
Enron exemption" on Capitol Hill, a Gramm aide said the senator had not pre=
pared that section of the bill.=20
"We were not involved with that part of it," said Larry Neal. Neither Wendy=
 Gramm nor Phil Gramm could be reached for comment Thursday.=20
Wendy Gramm's role at Enron has drawn congressional attention in the wake o=
f the Enron collapse. She was among those subpoenaed last week by the Senat=
e Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mi=
ch.).=20
Move to Enron's board=20
Although her husband is far better known, Wendy Gramm earned a place of pow=
er for herself in Washington. In 1988 she was appointed chairwoman of the t=
rading commission by President Ronald Reagan. The commission at the time re=
gulated futures trading in electricity, a business Enron hoped to dominate.=
=20
Shortly after President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, and Gramm was set=
 to lose her chairmanship, she pushed through a rule deregulating the tradi=
ng of energy contracts. Enron had been lobbying for exemption from regulati=
on for months.=20
Six days later she resigned. Five weeks later she was on the board at Enron=
.=20
Wendy Gramm served on the audit committee of the board, meaning she was one=
 of the directors responsible for Enron's financial reporting to investors.=
=20
Beginning in the late 1990s, Enron executives hid hundreds of millions of d=
ollars in debt in supposedly unrelated partnerships. The result was to make=
 Enron appear much stronger financially than it actually was.=20
When word of the partnerships surfaced and Enron acknowledged its debt last=
 year, the company's stock price collapsed and it filed for bankruptcy.=20
The members of the audit committee were to oversee the partnerships, accord=
ing to a report by Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins.=20
That means the partnerships were not merely a misstep by a lower- level exe=
cutive but rather were supposed to be known to Wendy Graham and the top lea=
ders of Enron.=20
"The audit committee knew of and approved of those partnerships," said Tyso=
n Slocum, research director of Public Citizen's energy program.=20
Wendy Gramm has known Lay for years.=20
Both were considered possible candidates for Cabinet posts in the Reagan ad=
ministration.=20
"Dr. Gramm's experience in financial and commodities markets will prove ext=
remely valuable to Enron," Lay said in announcing her appointment to the bo=
ard of directors. Wendy Gramm has a doctorate in economics.=20
Role in senator's campaign=20
At the time, Lay and Wendy Gramm said her decision favoring Enron played no=
 role in the company's decision to hire her. Lay said it was "convoluted" t=
o question the propriety of naming her to the board.=20
While federal regulations prohibited Wendy Gramm from lobbying the trade co=
mmission for a time after she left it, no law prohibited her from working f=
or a company she once regulated.=20
Lay, for his part, involved himself in Phil Gramm's career.=20
Besides contributing money to the senator, Lay served as the regional chair=
man of Gramm's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomina=
tion in 1996.=20
Wendy Gramm notified Enron in December 1998 that congressional ethics rules=
 might prevent her family from holding stock in Enron, according to Public =
Citizen. Phil Gramm was preparing legislation that would affect the company=
, triggering the rules.=20
Enron then devised a way to compensate Wendy Gramm, while getting around th=
e problems associated with her ownership of stock in the company, according=
 to Public Citizen.=20
"Enron canceled all of her outstanding shares and provided her with an addi=
tional service fee for a total of $117,000" over the next four years, the g=
roup said.

Bush In The Glare The Enron mess may revive a tough question: Whose side is=

It was supposed to be a week in which George Bush made common cause with th=
e common man, a week of speeches and photo ops to show that the President w=
ho whipped the Taliban could also save our jobs and fix our schools. But wh=
en a gust of news blew the Enron mess from the business section to the fron=
t page, the country saw a tense, cautious President trying his best to dist=
ance himself from one of his biggest campaign contributors, the friend he u=
sed to call "Kenny Boy." In the Oval Office on Thursday, Bush told reporter=
s he hadn't seen "Mr. Lay" since last spring.=20
So far, there is no evidence that anyone in the Administration did anything=
 wrong or that the half a million dollars that Lay and his fellow Enron exe=
cutives invested in Bush's political career over the years bought them any =
special favors. But Bush knows he stands in the line of fire. Democrats hav=
e been unable to hang the recession on him, but many hope that Enron's hapl=
ess employees--whose retirement nest eggs vaporized even as their bosses we=
re selling off more than $1 billion of their own stock--become the image th=
at sticks. The Enron debacle goes to one of the most basic questions Americ=
ans ask about their President: Whose side is he on? Pre-September surveys s=
howed a hardening perception that Bush doesn't care about the concerns of t=
he average person. In a New York Times poll last June, 57% of those surveye=
d said the Administration's policies favored the rich, and 63% said Bush wa=
s a "typical Republican." Though his public approval soared after Sept. 11,=
 White House officials fear Bush has not entirely shaken the idea that he c=
ares more about corporations than about the people who work for them. Kenny=
 Boy reminds folks of that.
The Enron mess has reawakened Washington's instant scandal culture, with th=
e entirely predictable twist that Democrats and Republicans have exchanged =
their well-practiced roles. But there's one obvious comparison that Bush's =
advisers are at great pains to deny. "There is no war room, no task force, =
no team of lawyers working day and night to battle the Democrats," says an =
aide. "This is not the Clinton White House." The Administration finally dis=
closed last week how many meetings Enron representatives had last year with=
 Vice President Dick Cheney or his staff--six, including one as late as Oct=
ober, when Enron was going down the tubes, although those officials say the=
y never discussed its fortunes. But the Administration continues to fight G=
eneral Accounting Office efforts to find out who else Cheney talked to when=
 he was developing his energy plan. A GAO lawyer told TIME the agency is hi=
ring attorneys "with Supreme Court experience" in the event that it proceed=
s with a federal lawsuit to force Cheney to divulge the material.=20
Bush was not above a little Clintonesque shading of the truth last Thursday=
 as he described his relationship with Lay. "He was a supporter of [Democra=
tic incumbent Governor] Ann Richards in my run in 1994," said the President=
, adding that he got to know Lay after that. This came as a surprise to a g=
reat many people in Texas, as Lay and his wife contributed $47,500 to Bush'=
s campaign that year (and a mere $12,500 to Richards') and Enron's politica=
l-action committee and executives donated nearly $100,000 more to Bush, acc=
ording to the watchdog group Texans for Public Justice. Lay had even contri=
buted to Bush's unsuccessful race for Congress in 1978.=20
Amid all their self-congratulatory talk about being forthcoming-- getting "=
in front of the story," as it's known in Washington--Bush officials insist =
they see nothing odd about the idea that it took nearly three months for Co=
mmerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to inform th=
e White House that Lay had come to them seeking help as the company was goi=
ng under. If the White House's story is so clean--Enron asked; we said no--=
why wait three months to tell it?=20
Last week news of the calls to Evans and O'Neill kicked the Democrats into =
high gear, targeting Bush as an enemy of the little guy. The White House, s=
aid Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, "had knowledge that Enron was like=
ly to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and sha=
reholders, who ultimately lost their life savings." And it's not just the W=
axmans of the world that Bush has to worry about. Louisiana Republican Bill=
y Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the first to=
 announce a formal congressional probe, has already sent investigators to t=
he Houston offices of both Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen.=
=20
No wonder Bush tried to change the subject last week. He spoke of fixing th=
e 401(k) pension laws and regulations that let Enron's bankruptcy become a =
personal tragedy for its workers. Bush's first challenge is to convince Ame=
ricans that he didn't use his influence to protect one of his biggest campa=
ign contributors. His larger one is to convince them he will use that influ=
ence from now on to protect them from future corporate shell games. --With =

 the December collapse of Enron Corp., a secretive energy- trading firm and=
 America's seventh-largest company. As the justice department started a cri=

Late to the Party

Copyright 2002 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

Enron World, the media amusement park, has been packed lately, as everyone =
tries out all the fantastic rides and games. The lines have been especially=
 long at Who's to Blame?-a funhouse where laughing journalists race around =
pointing fingers in all directions and throwing pies at the Enron players o=
f their choice.=20
The New York Times won a plush teddy bear for hitting 15 different Enron cl=
own-figures-including Dick Cheney, Larry Lindsey, Marc Racicot, Karl Rove, =
and Texas Gov. Rick Perry-with one 785-word shot, all names in bold. And Ti=
me magazine hasn't missed out on the thrills: "Huge questions loom as to ho=
w widespread the damage will be, who is to blame, and what is going to be d=
one about it.... John Dingell, ranking member of the House Energy [and Comm=
erce] Committee, said it best: `Where was the SEC? Where was the Financial =
Accounting Standards Board? Where was Enron's audit committee? Where were t=
he accountants? Where were the lawyers? Where were the investment bankers? =
Where were the analysts? Where was common sense?' "
Dingell's list of culprits had one notable omission. But he probably didn't=
 want to spoil the fun by asking the question that floats over the Enron st=
ory like a big, silent blimp: Where were the journalists?=20
We are talking, after all, about a huge public corporation, one that was re=
quired by law to release reams of data about itself on a regular basis. Whi=
le top Enron executives appear to have worked hard to conceal the company's=
 true financial condition, the public record has long contained hints of tr=
ouble. They were exactly the kinds of hints that journalists are supposed t=
o be good at noticing: numbers that didn't quite add up, vague references t=
o odd-sounding business arrangements. But in order to see them, you had to =
be looking hard. To get at their meaning, you had to be willing to dig.=20
In early November, with Enron's slide well under way, The Wall Street Journ=
al published a story about a New York money manager named James Chanos. It =
appeared in a Heard on the Street column by Cassell Bryan-Low and Suzanne M=
cGee, and though it has since been recycled here and there in other outlets=
, the story is not broadly known. As the scandal grows larger by the day, a=
nd journalists glory in its delights, it's worth taking a quick look back a=
t Chanos. His story should be a stunning rebuke to the media, for it sugges=
ts we could have had the Enron story long ago, if only we had wanted it.=20
When Enron's annual report came out in the fall of 2000, Chanos went throug=
h it carefully, The Journal reported, "underlining complicated passages and=
 scribbling exclamation points and question marks." One curious section cau=
ght his eye. It said a top Enron executive was the "managing member" of a "=
private investment company" called LJM Cayman. This company had "entered in=
to a series of transactions" with Enron, transactions that the report brief=
ly and murkily described.=20
Chanos didn't understand what this meant, but he thought it was interesting=
. So he did more homework in the public record. "Over time, he would build =
up an 18-inch stack of regulatory filings and other material about Enron," =
the paper reported. He also hit the phones, quizzing expert Enron-watchers =
about the company's operations and health. In the end, Chanos concluded tha=
t Enron was a "hedge fund in disguise"-a very risky enterprise in which he =
didn't believe it was wise to own stock.=20
Now Chanos was not doing all this legwork out of high- minded intellectual =
curiosity or in the interest of the public good. He is well-known in invest=
ment circles as a "short-seller," one who makes money by identifying weak c=
ompanies and betting that their stocks will decline. But when he was poring=
 over all those documents, calling people and begging for information, tryi=
ng to drag the truth out of a stonewalling organization, Chanos was behavin=
g an awful lot like a reporter. (Indeed, when another short-seller made a s=
tink about Enron's refusal to release a balance sheet, the CEO cussed him o=
ut, using the same word that George W. Bush once applied to a pesky New Yor=
k Times reporter.)=20
In one sense, it's kind of stunning that some ambitious business journalist=
 didn't do exactly what Chanos did, then write up a big splash about Enron'=
s coming demise. The word "Cayman" alone should have rung bells for anyone =
who has covered financial shenanigans.=20
But in another sense, the media's Enron failure isn't surprising at all. Th=
e democratization of Wall Street has given most Americans a huge stake in t=
he stock market. Millions of middle-class families have their college and r=
etirement savings- their futures-riding on the health of public companies s=
uch as Enron. Yet most American media companies haven't recognized that the=
y have a gigantic opportunity, and arguably a duty, to cover these companie=
s with the same sort of hard-core accountability journalism they apply to g=
overnment.=20
The fault doesn't really lie with individual reporters. Just digging up the=
 information for routine business stories is hard work, mainly because busi=
ness people have little incentive to help the media. Daily beat reporters c=
an't be expected to be crusading investigators, too: All their sources woul=
d dry up. But if every American news outlet would send its investigative ac=
es- the types who love political dirt-out into corporate America for a few =
years, I bet they'd find a lot more Enrons. And prevent a lot more ruin.=20
"There's much to learn when a stock loses $67 billion in value," observes M=
oney magazine in the headline over an Enron story. There sure is.

Back in the heady days of October 2000, at a sumptuous hotel ballroom in Pa=
lm Beach, the finance committee of Enron Corp.'s board heard then-Chief Fin=
ancial Officer Andrew Fastow describe Enron's need for outside private part=
nerships to help drive the company's explosive growth -- partnerships that =
would sow the seeds of Enron's current woes.=20
According to internal company documents, one outsider also attended that me=
eting: Richard N. Foster, a senior partner with McKinsey & Co.=20
Mr. Foster was an advisor to Enron's board between October 2000 and October=
 2001 and attended about six board meetings, according to a McKinsey spokes=
man. Indeed, the celebrated consulting firm was a major force at Enron almo=
st from the company's birth in the mid-'80s. McKinsey was where former Enro=
n CEO Jeff Skilling worked before jumping to Enron, and McKinsey was instru=
mental in advising Enron during its decade-long transformation from a natur=
al-gas-pipeline company into a massively complex trading operation with far=
-flung interests in water, timber, and high-speed Internet. McKinsey typica=
lly stationed its own personnel at Enron's offices, and dispatched about fi=
ve to 15 consultants to the Houston headquarters to advise on strategy and =
operations, according to former Enron executives.
At a time when Enron's collapse is churning up thorny ethical and legal pro=
blems for its accountants, lawyers and executives, the question arises: How=
 accountable should McKinsey, its strategy advisor, be? Though courts gener=
ally haven't found consultants liable for their advice, McKinsey's long and=
 close relationship to Enron inevitably raises questions about how much the=
 company knew about financial irregularities that only surfaced last summer=
.=20
A McKinsey spokesman said: "In serving Enron, McKinsey was not retained to =
provide advice to Enron or any Enron-affiliated entity with respect to the =
company's financial reporting strategy, methods of financing, methods of di=
sclosure, investment partnerships or off-balance-sheet financing vehicles."=
=20
In exchange for its strategic advice to Enron, McKinsey received millions o=
f dollars in consulting fees. When Enron's stock began to soar, the consult=
ing firm made the Enron success story a cornerstone of the management gospe=
l it preaches in part to woo other clients.=20
In an article published in the March 22, 1997, edition of its academic publ=
ication, McKinsey Quarterly, the authors celebrated Enron's "new breed of t=
ightly focused and vertically specialized `petropreneurs.'" Later in that s=
ame article, Mc-Kinsey writers extolled how Enron had created a trading, fi=
nance and risk management business worth more than $250 million in five yea=
rs, and how "its deployment of off-balance-sheet funds using institutional =
investment money fostered its securitization skills and granted it access t=
o capital at below the hurdle rates of major oil companies."=20
Though such writings suggest McKinsey knew about Enron's extensive use of o=
ff-balance sheet funds, there is no indication that anyone at the consultin=
g firm knew fully how Enron was using those partnerships. Late last year, E=
nron had to restate four years of earnings because of improper accounting f=
or some of those entities.=20
A McKinsey spokesman said it was a 75-year old policy of the firm not to co=
mment specifically on client matters.=20
Enron also played a featured role in McKinsey-partner Mr. Foster's recent b=
ook "Creative Destruction," published last year. "How do the concepts of co=
ntrol, permission and risk fit together?" asked authors Mr. Foster and Sara=
h Kaplan, a former McKinsey employee. "Enron offers one good example of man=
aging these elements to a favorable outcome."=20
Speaking on behalf of Mr Foster, a McKinsey spokesman said "the main thesis=
 of Creative Destruction is that in the long run markets outperform compani=
es because companies have not yet found a way to change at the pace and sca=
le of the markets without losing control." Enron didn't return calls seekin=
g comment about Mc-Kinsey's relationship with Enron.=20
McKinsey has seen rocky times of late. The slowing economy has impacted the=
 firm, forcing McKinsey to trim its work force last year. McKinsey was embr=
oiled in a public display of finger-pointing with a Chinese computer firm l=
ast year, and the firm parted ways with Swissair after an ambitious plan it=
 devised was blamed for the airline's collapse. McKinsey declined to commen=
t on those relationships as well.=20
Enron could represent more than just an embarrassing client for McKinsey. I=
ts plunge into bankruptcy has sparked numerous investigations, as congressi=
onal leaders and others search to understand what drove its collapse, which=
 jolted financial markets and left thousands of its current and former empl=
oyees with little or no retirement savings. McKinsey says it has not been c=
ontacted by government investigators regarding Enron.=20
Though there is no indication that McKinsey may itself become a subject of =
investigation, it could be caught up as a third party in the investigation =
of its client. Legal experts say McKinsey, unlike Enron's lawyers and accou=
ntants, has no privilege of confidentiality that would shield it from discl=
osing information to government investigators.=20
For decades, McKinsey has been revered -- even feared -- for its influence =
in boardrooms and its extensive and powerful old-boy network among major co=
rporations. Its alumni list reads like a who's who of the Fortune 500, incl=
uding the likes of IBM Corp. Chief Executive Lou Gerstner. In recent years,=
 that network has helped privately held McKinsey win lucrative consulting c=
ontracts from companies run by its former partners.=20
Mr. Skilling, a vital bridge between McKinsey and Enron, described McKinsey=
's approach in an interview with this newspaper in 1993, three years after =
joining Enron: "In the old days, we'd do one project and go away," he said =
of his days at McKinsey. But over time, "the relationships got closer and b=
igger."=20
McKinsey was central to Enron's "asset-light" strategy, the notion of build=
ing an industrial powerhouse with few hard assets; McKinsey also advised En=
ron as it considered entering new businesses, according to former Enron exe=
cutives. In one McKinsey Quarterly article in 1999, the consultants praised=
 Enron's water-industry investment, "despite a lack of obvious linkages to =
energy," they wrote, "as a chance to leverage intangibles such as project m=
anagement, network operations, and infrastructure development skills." The =
water foray ended in disaster last October, when Enron took a $287 million =
write-off to exit the business.=20
One former executive who developed and managed power projects said he was o=
rdered to check with McKinsey when he wanted to make an arcane type of gas-=
transmission investment. A team of McKinsey experts was sent to Enron's off=
ices to check out the deal. "They were all over the place," he says.=20
Suggestions that McKinsey was a "decision maker or a necessary review body =
on Enron's asset investments are flat-out wrong," McKinsey says.

Enron Creditors Group Law Firm Has Ties To Co, Creditors
By Kathy Chu

01/18/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20
(This report was first published late Thursday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It seems difficult to find a company that doesn't ha=
ve ties to bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) these days.
Take, for instance, Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP, the New York law fir=
m representing the official creditors committee in Enron's Chapter 11 proce=
edings.=20
Milbank Tweed served as counsel to the bankrupt company in unrelated legal =
matters for at least the past five years - receiving $5.67 million from Enr=
on, or about 1.5% of its more than $350 million in revenue last year - and =
has ties to hundreds of Enron's creditors and interested parties. The firm,=
 which still must get the bankruptcy court's official approval, also repres=
ents Citigroup Inc. (C) and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Enron's largest =
lenders, in matters "unrelated" to Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, accordin=
g to court documents.=20
The disclosure - made in 137 pages of documents filed late Wednesday with t=
he U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York - is another =
sign of the pervasive reach of the once-mighty energy-trading company.=20
It also reveals the need for deftness by interested parties attempting to s=
idestep conflicts in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.=20
Mary Elizabeth Tom, the assistant U.S. trustee for the Southern District of=
 New York, said that while Milbank Tweed's relationships to Enron and some =
creditors may be unusual, few things in these complex proceedings are "comm=
on."=20
"Any law firm would have ties (to Enron)," she said, adding that her office=
 supports Milbank Tweed as counsel to the creditors committee.=20
Enron also has no objection to the arrangement, attorney Martin Bienenstock=
 of Weil Gotshal & Manges has said.=20
Creditors will get a chance to weigh in at the end of this month, at a bank=
ruptcy hearing before Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez.=20
For now, the official creditors committee is considering appointing a speci=
al counsel to handle matters from which Milbank Tweed must recuse itself, a=
ccording to people familiar with the matter.=20
Issues that creditors may take a look at include Milbank Tweed's dealings w=
ith Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services on investment matters =
as recently as last November - a few weeks before the company and its units=
 began filing for bankruptcy.=20
Also, in addition to J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which serve on the cr=
editors committee, UBS AG, which plans to take over Enron's core energy-tra=
ding operations, is on Milbank Tweed's client roster.=20
Milbank Tweed, in the court filing, said it will continue representing thes=
e banks, but plans to stay away from any claims in Enron's bankruptcy case =
by relying on an "information firewall" between its attorneys.=20
The law firm - which has no current ties to Enron - also plans to regularly=
 identify all of its connections with debtors and creditors in the bankrupt=
cy case.=20
This transparency, according to legal experts, will be key to maintaining t=
he confidence of all involved.=20
"The failure to disclose could result in the later disqualification of the =
firm as counsel," said Jack Williams, the outgoing scholar at the American =
Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. "There's a =
major risk that a firm undertakes when they represent a creditors committee=
."=20

Creditors Committee Wants To Move Quickly=20

The appointment of Milbank Tweed - a firm versed in complex bankruptcy proc=
eedings and the energy and capital markets - signals the committee's need t=
o move quickly in Enron's bankruptcy case. Attorney Luc Despins, co-chairma=
n of the firm's financial restructuring group, is the lead lawyer for the u=
nsecured creditors group. He couldn't be immediately reached for comment.=
=20
The committee's actions will be pivotal in determining whether Enron is abl=
e to reorganize in 12 months, as it hopes.=20
One point of favor: Bankruptcy experts say that Milbank Tweed's knowledge o=
f bankruptcy and insolvency law, as well as regulatory and securities issue=
s, will expedite legal proceedings.=20
"I don't think boutique firms would have had this expertise," said Williams=
, of the American Bankruptcy Institute.=20
The New York offices of the international law firm beat out more than a doz=
en rivals for the job - including Thompson & Knight and Coudert Brothers LL=
P - last month.=20
But in order to keep itself in favor with the company and its creditors, th=
e law firm will have to avoid some of its previous missteps.=20
Milbank Tweed hit rough waters last year while representing the official cr=
editors group in PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric bankruptcy.=20
A U.S. trustee in California raised questions about whether Milbank Tweed -=
 as well as other law and accounting firms in the case - had improperly bil=
led for more than $1 million in combined fees during the first four months =
of the case.=20
Late last year, a federal bankruptcy judge rejected some of these fees but =
upheld others. The judge also firmed up billing guidelines, and advised the=
 companies to stick to them.=20

AARON BROWN, NEWSNIGHT CORRESPONDENT: Good evening again from Los Angeles. =
I'm Aaron Brown. We spent much of today trapped in another time, in the '60=

On to Enron we go. Are you seated? This one may shock you. The company fire=

Also today, we got word that Enron managed to avoid paying Federal income t=

There is also a political story to this developing, and for that we turn, o=

O'BRIEN: Good evening, Aaron. The ranking Democrat on the House Government =
Reform Committee, Henry Waxman has just issued a report alleging that 17 po=

of the taxpayer's money.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The allegation by Congressman W=

REPRESENTATIVE HENRY WAXMAN (D) CALIFORNIA: I have made no accusations of a=
ny wrongdoing by anybody in the Bush Administration, and I think it would b=
e unfair to do so until we have a thorough investigation and we get all the=
 facts.=20
O'BRIEN: The administration, citing separation of powers, has made it clear=
 however Congress won't be given any facts about meetings with Enron offici=
als at the White House. That clash could end up in court, as could the deve=
loping clash between Enron and its former accounting firm Arthur Andersen. =
Congressional investigators have uncovered an e-mail, indicating Andersen d=
ecided to retain Enron as a client only after a significant discussion of E=
nron's earning, which it characterized as "intelligent gambling."=20
Enron struck back, firing Arthur Andersen. In an exclusive interview with L=

.=20
JOSEPH BERARDINO, CEO, ANDERSEN: Well, Lou, techni
cally and I hate to be technical but I think it is an important point, when=
 a company goes in bankruptcy, all its relationships are severed.=20
O'BRIEN: No, that's not it at all, said Enron CEO Kenneth Lay. The Andersen=
 firm was fired because it improperly destroyed documents. And then there's=
 Harvey Pitt, the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, who earli=

 more accountable.=20
But what's he doing in all this? As a lawyer in private practice, Pitt used=
 to represent Arthur Andersen. Democrats charge conflict of interest.=20
HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION: I will not only adhe=

Diversify, Diversify, Diversify
By James K. Glassman

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When shares of Enron plunged from $84 earlier this year to practically zero=
, thousands of the company's employees lost not just their jobs but also mo=
st of the value of their 401(k) retirement accounts. For the average employ=
ee, Enron stock represented three-fifths of 401(k) assets, and the energy c=
ompany's meltdown -- after revelations of misleading, probably fraudulent, =
accounting practices -- was a personal calamity.=20
Now politicians, including Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and=
 Jon Corzine of New Jersey, are rushing in to protect other Americans from =
similar disasters. And President Bush has ordered "a policy review to prote=
ct people's pensions." But government intervention would only introduce a d=
angerous idea: that investors shouldn't bear the burden of their own decisi=
ons.
Let's be clear: Enron executives and outside auditors who lied to investors=
 -- including their own 21,000 employees -- bear an enormous responsibility=
, moral and legal. But the employees also bear some responsibility. Most of=
 them had far too large a proportion of their retirement assets tied up in =
their own company. They took a risk.=20
Enron offered a typical 401(k): Employees could invest up to 6% of their ba=
se pay in a wide range of options, including stock mutual funds like Fideli=
ty Magellan, bonds, money-market funds and a self-directed Schwab account t=
hat could buy practically anything. They could also choose Enron stock, pur=
chased at the regular market price. Whatever employees contributed with the=
ir own money, the company matched, up to 50% (that is, 3% of base pay), wit=
h Enron stock.=20
In other words, free Enron stock -- $1,800 worth a year for an employee mak=
ing $60,000 in base pay -- was part of the compensation package. Workers kn=
ew it, and they presumably liked it. Workers also knew that their 401(k) ha=
d a rule, also common to such plans, that they had to keep the company stoc=
k given to them by Enron until they were at least 50 years old. Any Enron s=
tock they bought themselves, of course, they could transfer at will.=20
Enron stock soared in value -- but turned out to be a blessing and a curse.=
 Imagine the case of an employee who joined the company in 1997, when the s=
tock was worth (after adjusting for splits) about $20 a share. If the emplo=
yee bought other assets which grew at 10% a year, by the end of 2000 those =
assets had grown by about one-third while the Enron stock had more than qua=
drupled. His 401(k) account became lopsided, with far more Enron stock than=
 anything else.=20
That was a predicament common to many Enron employees when their company st=
ock crashed. The wise move, as Enron climbed, would have been to buy other =
assets for a separate, taxable plan to balance the company stock. How many =
employees did that? Probably not many -- presumably for some because they d=
idn't have the money. If Social Security had been reformed, they could have=
 directed part of their payroll taxes into broad indexes of stocks and bond=
s, offsetting their Enron holdings. But that's a subject for another day.=
=20
Warren Buffett, the best investor of the last century, is fond of quoting M=
ae West as saying, "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful." But for mos=
t investors, picking the good thing isn't easy. The most important rule, by=
 far, for successful investors is, "Diversify, diversify, diversify."=20
As late as October, even the independent Value Line Investment Survey was g=
iving Enron an "A" rating for financial strength and saying the stock had "=
above-average appreciation potential." If Enron had represented 5% of your =
portfolio -- the maximum for any stock, as far as I'm concerned -- then its=
 bankruptcy would have put only a small dent in your retirement account. In=
stead, a study released in November by the Employee Benefit Research Instit=
ute and the Investment Company Institute found that company stock represent=
s nearly one-third of the total assets in the 401(k) plans of employees of =
firms that offer their own stock as an investment option.=20
That's far, far too much. Right this second, the 37 million Americans with =
401(k) plans should be reviewing them to be sure they're diversified.=20
Instead, they're being told by politicians, don't worry, the government wil=
l fix everything so you can play the stock market with no downside risk. Ms=
. Boxer and Mr. Corzine want a law that would prohibit any one stock from r=
epresenting more than 20% of a 401(k) plan's assets. But all this does is r=
educe investor choice and responsibility while stepping ever closer toward =
some kind of federally mandated retirement system.=20
The big problem is that too few Americans understand what prudent portfolio=
s are. Current laws don't help. Under the Employee Retirement Income Securi=
ty Act of 1974, the guiding federal pension statute, overseen by the Labor =
Department, companies are held liable for investment advice offered to thei=
r employees, even if it is given by independent professionals they hire. So=
 most 401(k) participants get no advice at all. They're forced to choose am=
ong assets they don't understand. A recent study by John Hancock Financial =
Services, for example, found that many investors believe that a diversified=
 stock fund is more risky than their company's stock, and that a bond fund =
is risk-free.=20
Last month, the Labor Department issued an opinion at the request of SunAme=
rica that lightened some of the legal burden and let the investment advisor=
 help employees allocate their assets. More important is the Retirement Sec=
urity Advice Act, introduced by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio), which removes=
 unreasonable employer liability. It's backed by the administration and has=
 passed the House. A similar bill is sponsored in the Senate by Jeff Bingam=
an (D., N.M.).=20
That pension rules are complicated is no excuse for the inaccuracies of the=
 reporting on Enron's retirement plan -- especially the claim that rich man=
agers could sell their stock while lowly workers were "locked in." All plan=
 members, including top executives, were prevented from moving any of their=
 401(k) assets between Oct. 29 and Nov. 13 -- a temporary shutdown, announc=
ed on Oct. 4, supposedly to allow for a transition to a new outside plan ad=
ministrator. By then Enron's stock had already fallen to $13.81 (it decline=
d another $3.83 during the 10 trading days of the freeze).=20
The timing of the changeover does sound a little fishy, and investigators s=
hould examine it carefully. But such shutdowns are common, and there's no n=
eed to ban them. One small change in the law that might be worthwhile is fo=
r companies to be prevented from issuing restricted stock to plan members. =
Other investors aren't barred from selling stock before they're 50; employe=
es shouldn't be either.=20
But let's not lose sight of the main lesson of the Enron disaster: Bad thin=
gs happen to good investors, and diversification is the only protection. Co=
mpanies should design plans that make diversification easier, but, ultimate=
ly, the responsibility for wise investing must lie with the investor. Polit=
icians who say it doesn't are only encouraging risky behavior.=20

Breakingviews: J.P. Morgan May Pay for Creativity --- Insurers Challenge Ba=
nk's Method for Controlling Risks in Enron Dealings
Edited by Hugo Dixon

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal Europe
24
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Why is J.P. Morgan Chase butting heads with a group of insurers in a U.S. c=
ourt? It may be because of the way the investment bank structured its lendi=
ng to Enron. J.P. Morgan used highly esoteric structures to neutralize the =
credit risks it was running. One of these has backfired, possibly leaving t=
he bank with far more credit exposure than it thought.=20
The transactions at issue were forward purchases of gas and oil from Enron =
by a company related to (and financed by) J.P. Morgan. These trades were gu=
aranteed with third-party credit insurers, thus seemingly neutralizing J.P.=
 Morgan's credit exposure. But for this purpose, J.P. Morgan chose not to b=
uy credit derivatives -- instruments that explicitly transfer unsecured cre=
dit risk from one party to another -- but surety bonds. These instruments a=
re more commonly used to insure the physical risks involved in corporate tr=
ansactions. In the case of Enron, such risks might have included pipeline e=
xplosions. J.P. Morgan seems to believe that such transactions were in the =
ordinary course of its energy trading operations. The insurers contend they=
 were disguised loans, and that they hadn't agreed to take unsecured credit=
 risk on Enron. It is hard to tell who is right. But the structure adopted =
by J.P. Morgan allowed Enron to increase the size of its balance sheet with=
out appearing to take on more debt.=20
Indeed, such techniques seem to have allowed it to expand its revenue, givi=
ng the bogus appearance of success. These matters are now the subject of a =
legal dispute. The insurers may yet be obliged to cough up. But J.P. Morgan=
 seems to have tied itself in too many knots trying to service its client. =
The bank's creativity has already dented its reputation for managing risk b=
y forcing it to increase by $1.7 billion (1.93 billion euros) to $2.6 billi=
on the estimate of its total exposure to Enron. It may also cost its invest=
ors dearly.

COMPANIES & FINANCE ENRON COLLAPSE - Duke benefits from traders' flight to =
quality - RIVAL MERCHANT'S RESULTS.
By SHEILA MCNULTY.

01/18/2002
Financial Times
(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Shares in Duke Energy slid more than 6 per cent in New York trading yesterd=
ay after the US power group said fourth-quarter earnings dropped 21 per cen=
t because of mild weather and lower power prices.=20
Fourth-quarter net income was $225m, down from $284m in the year-ago period=
. Excluding items, earnings per share were 35 cents, down from 47 cents. Wa=
ll Street had been expecting 45 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First=
 Call.
Despite yesterday's share price fall, analysts predicted the fourth-quarter=
 results would be among the best of those to come, as reporting got under w=
ay for the energy merchants.=20
"Duke is the blue chip: it's the most stable, the financially strongest (an=
d) has the strongest system," said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Fi=
nance Company, a Washington consultancy. "I think their results will lead t=
he industry."=20
Duke was forced to take a $43m provision for non-collateralised exposure to=
 Enron in the quarter.=20
Nevertheless, the North Carolina-based company reported a record $2.64 in e=
arnings per share in 2001. Full-year revenue grew 21 per cent to $60bn in 2=
001 and earnings before interest and taxes increased to $4.3bn.=20
Part of the gain was attributed to the "flight to quality" in energy tradin=
g following the Enron collapse, as counterparties sought safety in Duke's d=
iversified portfolio and investment-grade credit rating.=20
In general, Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney expects year-on-year earn=
ings per share gains for the industry, but sees a greater potential for "do=
wnside risk". He pointed to the possibility of lower trading volumes result=
ing from Enron's fallout and subsequent credit concerns about the industry.=
 He also cited weak power prices, mild weather and the slow economy.=20
Several energy companies were forced to take steps in the fourth quarter of=
 2001 to reassure investors, creditors and rating agencies that they were n=
ot vulnerable to the financial problems that pushed Enron, the biggest US e=
nergy trader, into bankruptcy on December 2.=20
El Paso, Dynegy, Williams and Mirant all outlined restructuring programmes.=
 These included asset sales, reductions in capital spending, restoring off-=
balance sheet structures to the balance sheet and issuing equity.=20
The restructurings, in addition to several factors specific to some individ=
ual companies, led Mr Niles to lower his average long-term growth outlook f=
or the energy merchant industry to 10-20 per cent, from 15-25 per cent.=20
For power producers such as Calpine - which has also outlined measures to s=
trengthen its balance sheet - Mr Niles belives 2002 may be atransition year=
, as growth targets are slashed and rationalisation takes hold, reflecting =
the cyclical nature of the business.=20

NEW YORK -- Why did the accountant cross the road? The answer used to be to=
 bore people on the other side. In light of the Enron Corp.-Arthur Andersen=
 LLP scandal, it may now be to avoid prosecution.=20
Long the butt of jokes as the epitome of boring and unsung professions -- t=
he greyest of the men in the grey flannel suits -- accountants suddenly fin=
d themselves at the fore of national news with the heat accounting firm And=
ersen is taking.
Andersen's role in the Enron debacle has thrust an accountant to the front =
pages. David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner in charge of reviewing Enron's=
 books, is now enduring the kind of unwanted celebrity usually reserved for=
 the Monica Lewinskys and Gary Condits of the world, after it was revealed =
he ordered the destruction of Enron documents.=20
"None of us want to see our profession cast in this light," said Steven Lil=
ien, chairman of the accounting department at New York's Baruch College. "T=
here's some lousy light being cast on the accountants now."=20
Mr. Duncan has said he was following company instructions.=20
Also altering the traditional milquetoast image of the accountant is Anders=
en managing partner and chief executive officer Joseph Berardino, who has b=
een trying to restore the tarnished image of the firm and taken his case to=
 the public.=20
Mr. Berardino on Wednesday took out full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers =
with an open letter to "respond to recent Enron-related events."=20
There was a time when the world's most famous accountants were the represen=
tatives from Price Waterhouse, annually trotted out during the Academy Awar=
ds to acknowledge their part in tallying the Oscar votes. And no one ever k=
new their names.=20
Sensational scandals, shredded documents, the glare of congressional hearin=
gs and the possibility of high-profile criminal trials could soon have acco=
untants longing for the anonymity of yore.

The Enron Story That Waited To Be Told

FINAL

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Bethany McLean, a 31-year-old Fortune magazine reporter with an impossibly =
soft voice, decided to take a hard look at Enron last January.=20
The Houston energy company didn't like her questions. The CEO, Jeffrey Skil=
ling, called her unethical and hung up on her. The chairman, Kenneth Lay, c=
alled Fortune's managing editor to complain. The chief financial officer, A=
ndrew Fastow, flew to New York to tell McLean and her editors that Enron wa=
s in great shape.
McLean refused to be intimidated. "The company remains largely impenetrable=
 to outsiders," she wrote in Fortune's March 5, 2001, issue. "How exactly d=
oes Enron make its money? Details are hard to come by because Enron keeps m=
any of the specifics confidential. . . . Analysts don't seem to have a clue=
." All this amounted to a "red flag" that "may increase the chance of a nas=
ty surprise."=20
The story sank without a trace. "At that point the coverage of Enron was pr=
etty glowing," McLean says. After all, the stock had soared 90 percent the =
previous year and was selling for $76 a share.=20
Now that the company has collapsed amid charges of financial chicanery, dev=
astating its employees' retirement funds, Enron is the hottest story in the=
 country. Political reporters joined the fray after learning that Enron had=
 sought help from the Bush White House. Teams of business journalists are d=
igging into the largest corporate meltdown in American history.=20
But as in the savings and loan debacle a dozen years ago, it took news orga=
nizations too long to piece together the clues.=20
"It's fair to say the press did not do a great job in covering Enron," says=
 Steve Shepard, editor-in-chief of Business Week magazine, which ran only b=
riefs on the company's financial problems until a cover story in November. =
"Enron was really a systemic failure of all the checks and balances we have=
 on corporate governance: integrity of management, board of directors, audi=
t committee of the board, outside accounting firm, Wall Street analysts and=
 ultimately the press. And all of us failed."=20
There were some notable early efforts. Last May, the Wall Street Journal ra=
n a front-page story on Lay getting a half-hour meeting to lobby Vice Presi=
dent Cheney on the administration's energy program. The story noted that ov=
er the years Enron had donated nearly $2 million to President Bush, Lay's l=
ongtime friend, and that some top administration officials had worked for E=
nron.=20
"I feel pretty good about what we've done on Enron," says Alan Murray, the =
Journal's Washington bureau chief. "What we clearly did not understand was =
that it was heading for a disaster."=20
The problem, he says, is that such stories often turn on "arcane and techni=
cal" practices. "The press doesn't pay as much attention to some of these r=
egulatory issues that have more impact on the world than the political issu=
es we do pay attention to," Murray says.=20
If company auditors -- in this case, Arthur Andersen -- don't raise questio=
ns, "it's very hard to know where to look," says Larry Kramer, chief execut=
ive of CBS MarketWatch.com. "We didn't get a lot of rumblings. Our coverage=
 was robust, but was still based on events after the fact."=20
A dramatic decline in stock is not necessarily a warning of foul play, says=
 Kramer, noting that his own company went public at $97 a share and the sto=
ck is now worth $4. "People just got dazzled by the size of the business," =
he says of Enron.=20
David Morrow, editor of TheStreet.com, says the press is "too reactionary. =
It's too easy for the business press to look at what the analysts are sayin=
g." Most Wall Street analysts had a buy rating on Enron stock.=20
Indeed, only one group wanted Enron's stock to tank: the short-sellers, pro=
fessional traders who bet on a stock's decline. One short-seller, Jim Chano=
s of Kynikos Associates, suggested to Fortune's McLean that she look at Enr=
on's Form 10-K, a required annual filing with the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission.=20
McLean says she understood Chanos's motive but was struck by the document. =
There were "strange transactions," "erratic cash flow" and huge debt. "It m=
ade you wonder, if their business was so phenomenally profitable, why they =
had to be adding debt at such a rapid rate," she says.=20
But the story was hard to write: "You can't just spout off about derivative=
s and mark-to-market accounts and expect people to get it."=20
Ironically, Fortune's own surveys had named Enron America's most innovative=
 firm for six straight years, and much of the coverage was similarly upbeat=
. Last January, a Houston Chronicle story was headlined: "Houston has $100 =
billion company; Enron Corp. sets records for sales, earnings in 2000."=20
There were a few critical pieces, but they mainly focused on politics.=20
In February, the Los Angeles Times reported on the close ties between Lay a=
nd the president, noting that Bush had flown on Enron jets during the campa=
ign. In March, The Washington Post ran a piece on Lay's growing influence. =
In May, the New York Times quoted the federal government's top electricity =
regulator, Curtis Hebert Jr., as saying Lay had offered to support his cont=
inued tenure if he changed his views on energy deregulation. Hebert says he=
 declined. Bush replaced him months later.=20
In August, at a Fortune conference in Aspen, Lay told Rik Kirkland, Fortune=
's managing editor, that Enron really disliked McLean's story. A week later=
, Skilling quit as CEO after just six months on the job, calling it a "pers=
onal decision."=20
"The main point of failure was when Skilling resigned, because unless he ha=
d cancer or something it was inexplicable," Business Week's Shepard says. "=
The failure of the press was not saying, 'What's going on here?' " Business=
 Week talked to Skilling off the record but could shed no further light on =
the situation.=20
To be sure, journalists were skeptical. "The abruptness of the departure le=
ft many analysts questioning whether a series of setbacks the company has s=
uffered played a part in the decision," the New York Times said. Enron's st=
ock, which had fallen by 50 percent since January, dropped another 14 perce=
nt in two days.=20
Some commentators unloaded on the company. "Until they clear this one up, E=
nron's a goner," former money manager Jim Cramer wrote on RealMoney.com.=20
But hard information was scarce. "It's almost as if you have to use forensi=
c accountants when you're doing a company story because many companies are =
using very aggressive accounting techniques that are perfectly legal," Shep=
ard says.=20
Enron fired Fastow in October for overseeing questionable off-the-books par=
tnerships, and in November the company admitted overstating its profits by =
$600 million. But most papers played these stories on their business pages.=
=20
Even Enron's Dec. 2 declaration of bankruptcy failed to make the front page=
s of USA Today, The Washington Post, the Boston Globe and the Philadelphia =
Inquirer. The CBS, NBC and ABC evening newscasts each gave the announcement=
 two sentences. The media were still heavily focused on the war in Afghanis=
tan.=20
Now that Enron's stock has been booted off the New York Stock Exchange, For=
tune staffers can't say enough about the way McLean defied both Enron execu=
tives and conventional wisdom.=20
"It was a gutsy thing to do," Kirkland says. "We trusted her. When you look=
 back it's obvious: Why weren't we all asking these questions?"

Blame Game Has Two Sets Of Standards
By JOHN TIERNEY

01/18/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WHEN bad things happen to bad companies, Washington likes to believe that i=
t's hearing a cry for help from Wall Street. Now that Enron has collapsed, =
politicians are frantically investigating and vowing to protect us against =
greedy corporate executives.=20
Prosecuting fraud and other crimes is certainly a government job, but as po=
liticians rush to make larger reforms of the private sector, it is instruct=
ive to compare the responses to Enron and to a bigger disaster: the failure=
 of Washington to protect Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11.
It's still not clear what, if any, criminal behavior occurred at Enron and =
its auditor, Arthur Andersen, but already the companies involved have suffe=
red serious consequences. Enron is bankrupt, and there is concern that Ande=
rsen will not survive because of the blow to its reputation.=20
Executives at the companies have been fired and suspended. Whether or not c=
riminal charges are filed, both companies are already facing lawsuits from =
shareholders, creditors and other plaintiffs. They also face investigations=
 by four government agencies and six Congressional committees -- all over a=
 company that declared bankruptcy only last month.=20
Meanwhile, more than four months since Sept. 11, politicians still haven't =
taken a hard look at mistakes by the C.I.A. or the F.B.I.=20
Congressional leaders and the White House agreed in late November that it w=
ould be premature to start formal investigations last year. The agencies, f=
ar from facing the threat of bankruptcy, could wind up with budget increase=
s to step up the war on terrorism.=20
As government employees, C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials enjoy immunity against=
 lawsuits for their mistakes, and so far they don't even seem particularly =
embarrassed. The leaders of the agencies haven't resigned, announced dramat=
ic purges or explained what went wrong.=20
Granted, their mistakes were probably not criminal, but then neither were s=
ome of the mistakes being investigated and litigated in the Enron scandal. =
The errors in judgment at the C.I.A. and the F.B.I had far more grave conse=
quences than Enron's collapse, and some of the errors could have been avoid=
ed.=20
Consider a couple of warnings before Sept. 11 that went unheeded:=20
*Reuel Marc Gerecht, a C.I.A. veteran in the Middle East who quit out of fr=
ustration, criticized agency officials for perpetrating the myth that Ameri=
ca had an effective counterterrorism program against Osama bin Laden. In an=
 article published last summer in The Atlantic Monthly, he argued that not =
a single C.I.A. officer had the skills and willingness to infiltrate bin La=
den's operations in the mountains of Afghanistan. ''Operations that include=
 diarrhea as a way of life don't happen,'' a young C.I.A. case officer told=
 him. Mr. Gerecht predicted that unless one of Osama bin Laden's ''foot sol=
diers walks through the door of a U.S. consulate or embassy, the odds that =
a C.I.A. counterterrorist officer will ever see one are extremely poor.'' H=
e criticized George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, for ass=
uring the public that the C.I.A.'s efforts were keeping bin Laden's terrori=
sts ''off-balance.''=20
*The F.B.I. was warned in August by a flight school in Minnesota that a stu=
dent could be planning to use a commercial plane as a weapon, according to =
United States Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota. The =
student, Zacarias Moussaoui, later charged with complicity in the Sept. 11 =
attacks, was arrested in August on immigration charges. But officials at F.=
B.I. headquarters in Washington resisted a broader investigation despite be=
ing urged by the school and by federal agents in Minnesota, and despite a w=
arning from French officials that Mr. Moussaoui was linked to Muslim extrem=
ists.=20
HOW much blame does the F.B.I. deserve? Suppose this private-public interac=
tion had been reversed. Suppose that public officials had warned a private =
airline that a passenger might be a terrorist, and suppose that higher-ups =
at the airline ignored the warnings from the officials as well as suspicion=
s from their own employees.=20
If the warnings proved correct and a plane was blown up, the executives at =
that airline would probably be in about the same position as the ones at En=
ron and Andersen today: contemplating bankruptcy, looking for new jobs, pre=
paring to face a slew of lawsuits and Congressional investigations. They wo=
uld not be anticipating an increase in their budget.=20
If you're going to make that kind of mistake, do it on government time.

ENRON ENLIGHTENMENT LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND A NEED FOR ANSWERS

A-18
(Copyright 2002)

The dramatic failure of the Enron Corp., America's seventh- largest company=
, will soon be examined in depth in an investigation coordinated by the Dep=
artment of Justice and in various congressional hearings.=20
The goal of this necessary inquest should be twofold: to determine whether =
violations of law or regulations took place and to discern whether new legi=
slation or regulation is necessary to avoid -- or mitigate the impact of --=
 future disasters.
As is the American way, there also will be attempts to point fingers. Becau=
se politicians are involved and 2002 is an important election year, there w=
ill be efforts by partisans to pin the blame for Enron-produced damage on r=
ivals.=20
At the very least, there probably are serious lessons to be learned from wh=
at happened. Some of it certainly should not be allowed to be repeated, if =
possible, although companies do fail. The fate of Enron and those responsib=
le for its fall, if dissected properly, should also serve as a shot across =
the bow of other American companies. That goes for firms with something to =
hide, or accounting firms willing to fudge on the clean bills of health the=
y are giving their clients.=20
The Justice Department and Congress need to address some of the following q=
uestions:=20
* Was it legal when Enron's 29 top executives sold off $1.1 billion of comp=
any stock even as they blocked, during the last two months of the company's=
 pre-bankruptcy life, the sale of Enron stock by employees from their 401(k=
) accounts? If such behavior was legal, should it be legal in the future, o=
r do employees need more protection in such circumstances? Ethical question=
s also must be addressed. Putting all of one's retirement fund in the stock=
 of one's employer violates two cardinal rules of investing: 1) Diversify a=
nd 2) Let the Buyer Beware.=20
* Why did accounting firm Arthur Andersen miss or choose not to see Enron's=
 true financial situation, including Enron's now-admitted overstatement of =
company profits by $600 million over five years? And was Andersen's accepta=
nce of an annual $52 million in consulting fees from Enron consistent with =
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations requiring an auditing firm's=
 independence from its clients? Does Andersen's dismissal of the auditor re=
sponsible for Enron answer all of the questions about the destruction of do=
cuments sought by federal regulators?=20
* Did Houston-based Enron's leaders' contributions to, and relations with, =
a former Texas governor, now president of the United States, play any role =
as the company operated and then maneuvered as it began to fall?=20
We tend to see the telephone calls that Enron executives made to Cabinet me=
mbers and other Bush administration officials -- and their "no-bailout" res=
ponse -- as correct. Would anyone have wanted Enron not to have alerted sen=
ior U.S. government officials to the imminent collapse of America's seventh=
-largest company? If there is more to those contacts -- inappropriate, ille=
gal or defensible -- it must come out, in the hearings and in the criminal =
investigation.

I knew something was up when I felt that first frisson of glee shudder thro=
ugh me the day Enron consumed the world like a great tide.=20
It peaked when Paul O'Neill looked at Lou Dobbs on TV that first night and,=
 apropos of the implications for pension and accounting laws, deadpanned, "=
This is not about Enron." Lou and I shook our heads and smiled knowingly.=
=20
Like any postmodern man in the age of self-help and self- absorption, I try=
 to keep abreast of any unusual fluctuations in my emotional state. What I =
was feeling, I realized, went beyond mere schadenfraude, that perverse deli=
ght in another's misery so common among writers and other petty professions=
.=20
No, this was a fuller-blown excitement, reflecting a deep well of despair d=
iscernable only because it was now suddenly producing such a gusher of hope=
: Yes! I thought. Maybe this will at last take a bite out of those Bushies =
and stop their evil domestic agenda in its tracks!=20
Let me step back. As far as I'm concerned, President Bush has been doing a =
fine job on the terror front to date, and I'm praying he and his team conti=
nue to fare well there. And I swear, people who know me will tell you I'm u=

But Bush's overriding domestic thrust -- cutting taxes for the well-off and=
 shorting everything else save defense -- plainly has me undone. Especially=
 because Bush and Karl Rove have been shrewd enough to pretend, successfull=

utless or shameless to stop it.=20
Sometimes you need a little divine intervention. Enron, rightly understood,=
 is obviously the gift of a vengeful Almighty.=20
It's true there may turn out to be no malfeasance by the White House, and I=
'll sidestep that in a second. But there's no denying the potential here. E=
nron is a peerless symbol of truths that conservatives have long purged fro=

markets don't work by themselves. The little guy needs a break.=20
And yes -- drum roll, please -- government can help.=20
These are lessons citizens need to relearn. And now -- with a little coaxin=
g, of course -- they'll play out day after day on the news.=20
Yes, in exploiting this situation I realize I may be yielding to dark impul=
ses that have bloodied humanity since the dawn of time. And rationalizing i=
t as justifiable tit-for-tat after all the bogus garbage Republicans shovel=
ed at Bill Clinton for eight years -- a line of thought that, now that you =

road that's left the Middle East a vale of tears. What's more, like most pe=

"This just keeps getting better and better," Liisa sputters. By that, my wi=
fe means worse and worse. Which is what we're all thinking, isn't it?=20
Before dawn, we are up and tearing into the newspapers at my household. Thi=
s is terrific, heart-racing stuff.
"Look, Enron paid no income taxes four out of five years!"=20
"Forget Enron, Andersen is being paid by the Justice Department to reorgani=

"Get this: Enron had 881 offshore subsidiaries!"=20
"Wow, a professor who became a New York Times editorial columnist was paid =
$50,000 as an Enron advisor!"=20
We're trying not to talk over each other. I'm scribbling notes all over the=
 paper and Liisa is warning me not to make the story illegible. We subscrib=
e to four newspapers. Suddenly it's not enough.=20
This is the juiciest scandal of our lifetime.=20
Why? Because this is not about personal indiscretion, not about sleazy part=
isan politics, not about runaway foreign policy, not about "gotcha."=20
This rotten barrel of apples is all encompassing. Down at the bottom, in th=
e really contaminated slime, Enron/Andersen/et al. is about what we have al=
lowed our nation to become.=20
It's about us. It's about winning at any price--not just winning but trounc=
ing--about seeing what you can get away with. It's about greed and the glor=
ification of greed. It's also the football player who deliberately tries to=
 injure his opponent. It's about parents who beat each other up at their ki=
ds' sports matches. It's about the hand-to-hand combat of getting your chil=
dren into the best colleges so they will be the dog that eats instead of th=
e dog that gets eaten. It's about the ugly edge that has crept into our lan=
guage, so that words such as "intimidation" become virtuous and "honor" a q=
uaint laughingstock. It's about the blue-ribbon professor-cum-economics col=
umnist who acknowledges taking $50,000 from Enron for serving on "a panel t=
hat had no function that I was aware of."=20
Awhile back, we lost sight of the principle that hard work, diligence and s=
ome luck made the man.=20
Inexplicably, we veered from the root ideal of civil in civilization. We to=
ok what we could and called it ours. We created the lottery for the instant=
 chance at more. We demanded that every business "grow" rather than serve--=
which sounds a lot less benign than it became, as we watched ourselves tran=
sformed into jackals feeding from our own wounds. We watched as our politic=
al system was co-opted for pennies by wheeler-dealers who hollowed out the =
laws with fancy regulations and hidden legislative favors until our vaunted=
 democracy became the instrument of our own oppression.=20
We saw simple and honest things devalued. Like the passbook savings account=
. And employee loyalty--or loyalty of any kind, for that matter.=20
You could wish you were high-minded in this age, but weren't you looking fo=
r 25% gains on your retirement holdings too? It didn't matter if a company =
made something, only if it made something happen. It mattered less whether =
a deed was right than whether you were "in" or "out."=20
Where is the smoking gun?=20
It's in our hands.=20
Yes, George W. Bush is culpable: This freight train crashed on his watch. T=
hese were his back-slapping buddies. These are the people he entrusted with=
 government. This is the way-of-life philosophy he championed.=20
Let's not forget that just a few weeks ago he denounced Democrats for stall=
ing on a multimillion-dollar, retroactive tax break for Enron and other gia=
nt companies.=20
Let's remember that his top economics advisor, a former Enron retainer, vie=
ws the collapse of the company as "a triumph for capitalism." Let's not ove=
rlook that his Treasury secretary sees Enron as evidence of the "genius of =
capitalism." Let's not overlook that his choice to run the GOP has decided =
to stay on the payroll of a law firm retained by Enron and reserves the rig=
ht to moonlight as a strategic advisor for the company.=20
But Bush didn't create the scandal. It's been in the works for years. He's =
no more guilty than the people who voted for him, or for those many million=
s who were suckered into this vision of a cutthroat America where values--t=
hat shopworn word--mean nothing at all when measured against the bottom lin=
e.=20
Perhaps all boats float on a rising tide. But reach down. Tastes like sewer=
 water now, doesn't it?=20
I can hardly wait for tomorrow's papers. This is a terrific time. Maybe, fi=

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Enron's Sins

01/18/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A10
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A reformed German Communist named Willi Schlamm once said that the "problem=
 with capitalism is capitalists; the problem with socialism is socialism." =
We've been thinking about that distinction as we try to make sense of Enron=
's self-immolation.=20
The story may be fading away as a political scandal. But merely as a busine=
ss scandal it's a problem for anyone who believes in free markets. The pric=
e for Enron's financial shenanigans won't be paid only by its shareholders,=
 auditors and creditors. Politicians will seize on its sins as another excu=
se to meddle in financial markets, which is all the more reason for market =
believers to be ruthless in cleaning out our own closets.
We do know this isn't a scandal of the usual Washington variety. Though the=
 press corps seized on White House reports of calls from Enron officials, t=
he story fizzled when it turned out nothing happened. As our Washington bur=
eau wrote this Tuesday, the cold reality is that corporate political donati=
ons guarantee little more than a hearing. For all of Enron's political larg=
esse, it couldn't order up a bailout or even the regulatory nod requested b=
y former Treasury Secretary-turned-Enron-lender Robert Rubin. We knew the p=
olitical scandal had gone poof when the Beltway started using Enron as one =
more prop for "campaign finance reform." Yawn.=20
Washington is fascinated nonetheless because of Enron's size and symbolism;=
 Enron's long self-promotion as the vanguard of the New Economy increases t=
he Schadenfreude at its collapse. Above all, this looks like a case of corp=
orate deceit. Whether or not Enron's actions violated any laws, they certai=
nly violated the public trust essential for free markets to work. For that =
alone its managers deserve the public stocks.=20
The details of Enron's now famous off-balance-sheet partnerships remain mur=
ky. But it's clear they were an attempt to disguise losses from bad investm=
ents. The partnerships, backed by Enron shares, moved risky businesses off =
its own balance sheet. If these businesses worked, Enron booked the profits=
, which helped pump up its share price. But when the businesses flopped, En=
ron covered the losses by issuing more of its shares; this worked for as lo=
ng as Enron's stock price stayed high but it became a kind of Ponzi scheme =
once its shares began to fall.=20
This was at the very least deceptive accounting. Adding to their sleazy app=
earance the partnerships paid fees to Enron officials who were also princip=
als in the partnerships. Former CFO Andrew Fastow earned more than $30 mill=
ion from this sweet arrangement. Enron can say all of this was reported in =
its 10-Qs, but the company made its filings as obscure as possible. Financi=
al pros couldn't figure them out, much less employees with their life savin=
gs in Enron stock. The point of accounting is transparency, which means wri=
ting in something other than hieroglyphics.=20
Yes, we know, Arthur Andersen was supposed to blow the whistle on all of th=
is as Enron's outside auditor. But as any junior market reporter knows, aud=
itors almost never discover these schemes. Shredding documents is a more se=
rious matter, but auditors can't sit at every CFO's shoulder like a guilty =
conscience. Even internal auditors rarely discover scams and audit committe=
es of the boards of directors even less often.=20
We're all for a big debate over corporate governance. But somehow we doubt =
the early proposals for a new layer of auditors to watch over the old ones =
is an improvement. As our Holman Jenkins wrote Wednesday, a better idea mig=
ht be to drop the federal mandate for an annual audit, which has become a p=
hony good housekeeping seal of approval. Let CEOs take responsibility for t=
heir own numbers and make a credible audit something of competitive value.=
=20
We'd say it's also impossible to understand Enron outside of the moral clim=
ate in which it flourished. Those were the roaring '90s, when all of Americ=
a reveled in the economic boom. They were also the Clinton years, when we l=
earned that "everybody does it." The culture wanted to believe in Enron's p=
romises, which helps explain why 16 of 17 Wall Street analysts rated Enron =
a "buy" as recently as last October.=20
Enron's failure reveals the underside of that boom. Human nature being what=
 it is -- and capitalists being human -- some will lose their moral bearing=
s, others will make mistakes and try to cover them up. Had Enron merely adm=
itted its bad investments and taken a $20 billion write-off the way most co=
mpanies do, it might still be around. Its managers would no longer be feted=
 as geniuses of the new economy, but that's a better fate than they face no=
w.=20
The burden on the political and financial system now is to clean up Enron, =
and learn from its failures, without doing further damage. In the Washingto=
n tradition, this may mean burning some people or companies at the stake, b=
ut maybe in this case they deserve it. We are sure going to find out.=20
In all of this, we should add, the Bush Administration has so far shown the=
 right instincts. President Bush called early for investigations that are n=
ow taking place, both civil and criminal. His advisers seem to be following=
 the ancient political wisdom, ignored during the Clinton years, that telli=
ng all early is the best defense.=20
A Republican Administration, with its alleged sympathies for markets, has a=
 special burden to police capitalists who abuse their freedom. If the Bushi=
es do this the right way, they can restore trust in markets and ensure that=
 Enron's sins will do less permanent damage to capitalism.

'IF MEN were angels," James Madison wrote in No. 51 of the Federalist Paper=
s, "no government would be necessary." It is one of the most celebrated quo=
tations in American history. Yet it takes some large event every generation=
 or so to remind us how right Madison was.=20
The Enron Moment is a great catastrophe, especially for the thousands of wo=
rkers bilked out of their life savings. But it is also an opportunity to sw=
eep aside the sanctimonious cant upon which a generation's worth of politic=
al arguments were built.
Are markets always self-regulating? No. Is deregulation always the answer? =
No. Are capitalists always well-behaved and public-spirited? No. Can we ign=
ore the impact of our campaign money system on politicians? No. Can we be i=
ndifferent to the undue influence that certain big companies have on our go=
vernment? No. Can rank-and-file employees do without the protections of law=
 against the abuses of more powerful actors in the marketplace? No.=20
In the boom years, many chose to forget the simple genius of the American p=
roposition. It is rooted in what economist John Kenneth Galbraith saw as a =
system of "countervailing power." We put limits on government because we do=
n't want it to dominate our lives. But, in turn, we rely on government to c=
heck concentrations of private power.=20
Americans have always been suspicious of excessive power anywhere - in gove=
rnment or the marketplace.=20
It's true, of course, that Enron went down, and this will be seen by some a=
s the marketplace doing its excellent work of "self- policing." But don't t=
ry to sell this view to Enron employees or investors who relied on the "sel=
f-policing" of private accounting firms and thought Enron's numbers were on=
 the level.=20
Smart capitalists have always understood that the system works only if ther=
e are strong rules to guarantee honest information and to check corporate m=
isbehavior. As Madison might have put it, if capitalists were angels, we co=
uld deregulate everything. But capitalists are no more angelic than anyone =
else.=20
Some members of Congress will thus have to answer for their success in bloc=
king the efforts of Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission, to impose rational restrictions on accounting firms.=
 Levitt - boy, does he look good now - thought it a mistake for firms to do=
 both auditing and consulting work for the same client. Levitt also has arg=
ued recently that publicly traded companies need to include genuinely indep=
endent members on their corporate boards of directors. Otherwise, no one on=
 the inside is keeping the big boys honest.=20
And, speaking of transparency, the public needs to know more than it does a=
bout how corporations such as Enron influence government policy.=20
That's why Vice President Dick Cheney should disclose all the details about=
 his consultations in formulating the administration's energy plan.=20
Full disclosure by the energy task force was once a Democratic cause champi=
oned by Rep. Henry Waxman of California. Now, many Republicans know the adm=
inistration will only deepen public suspicions if it keeps holding back. "I=
t is just basic information that should be provided and isn't all that big =
a deal," says Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, "except for=
 the fact that the administration doesn't want to share it, which makes it =
a big deal."=20
And those who oppose trying to limit the influence of money on politics sho=
uld consider Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision to recuse himself fr=
om the Enron case because he had received campaign contributions connected =
to Enron. The Justice Department explained the recusal in a nicely inclusiv=
e phrase, referring to "the totality of the circumstances of the relationsh=
ip between Enron and the attorney general."=20
If we're worried about how contributions might affect - or be seen to affec=
t - Ashcroft's behavior as attorney general, shouldn't we also be worried a=
bout how contributions might affect the behavior of members of Congress? Sh=
ould there really be such a huge difference between the standards we'd impo=
se on John Ashcroft, attorney general, as opposed to John Aschroft, United =
States senator?=20
What, finally, will President George W. Bush do about the Enron Moment? The=
 question here goes beyond the usual scandal investigations: Has this finan=
cial catastrophe changed any of the president's views on the energy industr=
y and how it should be regulated, or on corporate abuses and how they can b=
e prevented? The real scandal would be to allow the Enron Moment to pass wi=
thout its teaching us that Madison was right all along.

MISCELLANEOUS
ENRON EXECUTIVES DESERVE TO BE HIT BY A TWAIN

01/18/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
REGION
B-1
(Copyright 2002)

Occasionally, I wake up in the morning depressed that Mark Twain will never=
 stare back at me from the bathroom mirror.=20
This is something most columnists learn to accept with practice. After all,=
 it takes a particular set of experiences to be somebody else. And Twain wo=
uld've considered any envy of his life -- stuffed as it was with an abundan=
ce of family tragedies and bad investments - - a peculiar malady indeed.
Still, I think about Twain from time to time and wonder how he might have r=
eacted to the controversies of our day. Were he still with us, he would und=
oubtedly be about the business of skewering the pretensions of our corporat=
e masters, their paid vassals in Congress and their unpaid vassals in the m=
edia.=20
But Twain has been dead for 97 years -- and we're not feeling too good ours=
elves. Those of us who toil fitfully in his shadow carry on as best we can,=
 cursed with a sense of moral outrage that's far less developed. Though our=
 obtuseness keeps us out of trouble, it also greases the wheels of our cont=
inued irrelevance.=20
Some of us flatter ourselves with the most obvious excuse in the world: Bec=
ause we'll never possess Twain's gift for devastating put- downs, we have n=
o choice but to put up with the authoritarian nonsense that's taken root in=
 American life since Sept. 11.=20
So, it may be time to go to the source.=20
Every night on a creepy television program called "Crossing Over With John =
Edward," a media-savvy professional guesser bamboozles the gullible into be=
lieving the dead have nothing better to do than to stand around limbo waiti=
ng for a dull studio audience to call.=20
And no wonder. The spirits Edward chats with nightly appear intent on maint=
aining even more banality in death than they ever mustered in life. So much=
 for ascending to a "higher plane."=20
Still, I'd pay Edward good money if he could corral Twain's ghost for an in=
terview. I'd love to know how the self-styled "Missouri Yankee" thinks Amer=
ica has changed since he left us a century ago.=20
Despite our era's superficial resemblance to the Gilded Age, an era Twain w=
rote about in a best-selling book, I suspect even he would be scandalized b=
y the level of greed and criminal collusion manifested at the highest level=
s of industry and government these days.=20
He'd be appalled, but not surprised, by Enron's collapse. Fresh revelations=
 about how the bankrupt corporation paid no income taxes for four of the la=
st five years draw a bored "it figures" from most ordinary citizens.=20
But Twain's hilariously scathing essay, written in the throes of outrage, w=
ould be circulating by the end of the day. With comic understatement, he'd =
illustrate how campaign contributions to nearly every member of America's p=
olitical ruling class shielded Enron's deceptive business practices long en=
ough for its managers to loot the company's most precious asset -- the reti=
rement portfolios of its workers.=20
Wall Street analysts and editorial writers might consider it a less than nu=
anced treatment of a complex failure, but I suspect only Twain's take on th=
is shameful episode would be enough to generate the universal moral outrage=
 it deserves.=20
This isn't to say that terrific pieces about the Enron scandal haven't been=
 published already. They appear every day, thank goodness. But none have ge=
nerated the level of indignation about political corruption and capitalist =
excess that Twain's pieces about the Gilded Age did more than a century ago=
.=20
There's still time. This scandal is young and congressional hearings might =
turn on a few dramatic moments, but I'm not holding my breath that a single=
 scoundrel will go to jail -- a fate the top layer of Enron executives rich=
ly deserves.=20
In the end, my Twain fixation may be evidence that I'm just a sentimental g=
uy who wants a hero from another age to do my dirty work. Guilty as charged=
! It may be silly, but I can think of worse things than to be haunted by th=
e ghost of Samuel Clemens.

A widow invests her money in one of the most admired companies in America.=
=20
A new father purchases the vehicle of his dreams.
A young high school graduate gets a job that is the envy of her peers.=20
Unfortunately, the company the widow invested in was Enron Corp.=20
The vehicle was a Ford Explorer on Firestone tires.=20
The great new job was at Mitsubishi Motors Corp.=20
All three people trusted. And they should have. They were dealing with high=
ly respected companies.=20
Mitsubishi is one of the largest employers in central Illinois. Its state o=
f the art factory brought badly needed jobs and manufacturing savvy to Amer=
ica's heartland. Yet in 1998 its management also paid $34 million to settle=
 sexual harassment claims against it, from many women like our high school =
graduate.=20
Ford and Firestone are two of the most illustrious names in corporate histo=
ry. Each was founded just over 100 years ago, by individuals so confident i=
n their personal reputations that they put their names on their companies. =
They are two companies that millions of drivers place their trust in every =
time they slide behind the wheel.=20
We don't yet know all the reasons for the series of accidents involving For=
d Explorers and Firestone tires. But we do know that many, many people coul=
d have acted earlier to address the crashes, and did not. And as a result, =
the reputations of two great companies may be irreparably damaged.=20
Of course the true toll from the Firestone/Ford disaster is measured in liv=
es--not dollars--lost. Hundreds of lives snuffed out prematurely because or=
dinary workers, managers, executives and lawyers failed to do the right thi=
ng.=20
Companies that deal with the lives and money of consumers understand that t=
hey are in the trust business. Car companies and airlines and restaurants a=
nd food companies understand that if people don't trust their safety, they =
will not buy their products or services. Banks, brokerages, insurance compa=
nies and accounting firms know that if they aren't trusted, their businesse=
s will dry up. They also know that trust is grounded in integrity. Unfortun=
ately, most businesses haven't viewed trust as their single most important =
attribute.=20
Enron changed that.=20
Enron was on top of the world. We all had good reason to invest in Enron. I=
n 2000, it was the seventh largest company in America. In its February 2001=
 annual reputation survey results, Fortune magazine listed Enron as the mos=
t innovative company in the United States. It also was the second-most-admi=
red company for "quality of management." But it failed by not making integr=
ity--the integrity that is the basis of all trust--the company's highest va=
lue. Failure of trust is ultimately what caused Enron's market value to cra=
sh from $70 billion to less than $1 billion in less than one year.=20
And what Enron's executives failed to understand was that their business--l=
ike every other business--is based on trust. Enron was an intermediary in t=
housands of transactions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. All parties=
 to the transactions needed to trust Enron. After a while, they did not.=20
Enron was the recipient of billions of dollars in loans from banks. Getting=
 such loans required the banks to trust Enron. After a while, they did not.=
=20
Enron's currency was its stock price, which needed the trust of the investm=
ent community to sustain it. Enron lost that, too.=20
Once trust is damaged, it takes enormous effort to regain it. It is not sim=
ply an exercise in damage control. It is a test of integrity and transparen=
cy. It is a test now faced by Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, whose very =
future depends on being able to reclaim the trust of Congress, clients and =
the investing public. Enron and Andersen have become the latest in an unfor=
tunate series of corporate poster children that make the case for the impor=
tance of trust.=20
Underestimating the importance of trust is not just a corporate failing. Po=
or George O'Leary was just two resume falsifications away from college foot=
ball's dream job--coach of Notre Dame--and a multimillion-dollar pay packag=
e. Consider Henry Blodget, the once high-flying Internet analyst at Merrill=
 Lynch & Co. who was forced out of his job because nobody trusted him anymo=
re.=20
These days it seems like there are far too many examples that remind us tha=
t trust is the key to winning for individuals and institutions. The integri=
ty that underlies that trust is the basis for saving our businesses, our ca=
reers, and maybe even ourselves.

As the Enron Corp. scandal unraveled further this week, two dominating Amer=
ican characters for our times began to come into focus.=20
One was the Enron-type boss, who, according to much of the data so far, loo=
ked upon America primarily as a game. The other was the New York policeman/=
firefighter/public servant who saw America as a community to be served.
The news indicated that for three years the Enron higher-ups held back cruc=
ial information that the company was actually failing instead of making all=
 the money it claimed. And all the while, they secured their own fortunes b=
y selling stock, even as uninformed underlings were losing their entire pen=
sion plans and thus their very futures.=20
This same week, New York City announced that ground zero had largely been c=
leared and that the site was now below ground for the first time since Sept=
. 11. That fact only serves, of course, as a further benediction for those =
public servants who so courageously assaulted the collapsing World Trade Ce=
nter, attempting to save their fellow citizens' lives.=20
But perhaps the real benediction for Enron was expressed most vividly by US=
A Today in an article this week: "Analysts for more than a year were compla=
ining they couldn't figure out how Enron made money." One of the problems, =
the national newspaper said, was that the entire system (of which Enron was=
 in many ways the Cinderella) was "unchecked," and that it had come to the =
point at which the people involved should be liable for their actions.=20
Two Americas, and two types of Americans. Two very different worlds, and bo=
th within us.=20
Surely the differences between these worlds would not be so grating were it=
 not for Sept. 11 and its aftermath. The terrorist attacks on New York and =
Washington brought forth, along with so much else, the confident assurance =
that now patriotism would once again reign--unity of nation and of purpose =
would return to us after a long period of ambivalence among our elites abou=
t the American dream.=20
But polls and other indicators show that while putting out flags is popular=
, large numbers of younger Americans embrace an emotional feeling of unity =
without understanding that the underpinnings of strengthening civic educati=
on and teaching U.S. history are crucial to true national unity.=20
At this point, almost as a specter of our divisions, came the Enron scandal=
, which threatens to tell us more than we may have wanted to know about cer=
tain predominant aspects of America's most fashionable--and deceiving--corp=
orate mind and how it differs from the old community mind.=20
The Enron mind, at least as we are seeing it revealed, had executives playi=
ng a game for fame, for money, for power. Its practitioners looked to their=
 corporate form of business not to create products or real wealth, or to up=
grade the status of other Americans, but to make themselves into dominating=
 personalities in America. They looked upon their employees simply as funct=
ionaries in their machine, although there was also a cultish feeling about =
the corporation.=20
Finally, they had no sense of traditional American community, and in fact d=
erided such an outmoded concept, while they never risked anything real.=20
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, former NATO commander during the air war against Koso=
vo three years ago, spoke indirectly of the way in which this elitist Ameri=
can mind-set assumes that others will go overseas to fight for America whil=
e they go about their business.=20
"Everybody says he's patriotic," he remarked to a meeting of the Center for=
 Strategic and International Studies recently, "but I was at a football gam=
e in Arkansas the other day, and I asked several guys whether they were goi=
ng to join up. One said, well, no, he had his business . . . another said, =
no, he was getting married . . . "=20
The public servant mind-set is very different indeed. This mind- set is roo=
ted in American values and principles, and high in that pantheon is a profo=
und sense of family and community. That is why firefighters and police risk=
ed--and why so many gave--their lives. Life is real, and its consequences a=
re real. They look upon others as equals in their quests, and they actually=
 often believe in a human soul.=20
They accept responsibility for their actions as part of the reality of a mo=
ral universe, and they will stand up, even against fashion's inexorable tid=
es, for what they believe is right. They were "we," while the Enron-type pe=
rson is "me,"--and despite Sept. 11, there is no assurance yet which group =
will dominate America in the future.=20

TAKING STOCK
Opportunists may benefit if embattled Kmart files for Chapter 11

For several days now, investors have been scrambling over each other to bai=
l out of Kmart before the U.S. retail giant stumbles over the precipice.=20
The race for the exits may well turn out to have been justified, but it sho=
ws just how skittish the investment community has become in the wake of the=
 bursting tech bubble and the shocking collapse of Enron, a once-prized nam=
e in most debt and equity portfolios.
Unlike Enron, which as we now know faked its numbers, Kmart has been exhibi=
ting the classic symptoms of a company in deep trouble for years. It has be=
en hammered by Wal-Mart and its other major competitors in a brutal retail =
environment. And despite its best efforts, things have gone from bad to wor=
se in recent months.=20
The company was one of the few big retail names that missed its own modest =
Christmas sales targets, and won't come close to meeting forecasts for the =
fiscal year. The president walked the plank yesterday. The board turned its=
elf over to yet another turnaround specialist. It desperately needs more ca=
sh and its bonds are now rated at the bottom end of the junk pile.=20
The result has been a predictable exit by bondholders, a stunning flight by=
 equity investors, and opportunistic buying by the vultures.=20
In a matter of weeks, Kmart has turned from a potential turnaround story be=
ing touted as a cheap way to play the discount retail segment into one of t=
hose investments that must not be held at any price.=20
In heavy trading of 75.6 million shares yesterday, Kmart actually rose 3 ce=
nts (U.S.) to $1.63, briefly halting a slide that has lopped off more than =
60 per cent of its value in a week. On Wednesday alone, 177 million shares =
-- close to a third of all the stock outstanding -- changed ownership, as t=
he price plunged 36 per cent. No other stock traded so heavily.=20
In many cases, fund managers simply had no choice. The stock was dropped fr=
om the S&P 500 this week, as the company's market capitalization fell well =
below $1-billion. It stood at more than $5-billion last August.=20
On the bond side, only distressed debt funds will touch credits like Kmart =
at single-B or triple-C levels. That's where rating agencies place debt the=
y think is in serious danger of default.=20
Now, it could be argued that the debt monitors are being somewhat hasty her=
e. The company doesn't have much borrowing room left, but the banks indicat=
ed in November that they would be willing to negotiate. And so far, at leas=
t on the anecdotal evidence of some major suppliers, Kmart is still paying =
its bills.=20
But the big rating agencies have looked sloppy and slow-footed in failing t=
o take swift action on numerous previous occasions, and it's plain they did=
n't want it to happen again.=20
The latest and most embarrassing case was Enron, which retained its crucial=
 investment-grade rating into November, well after it became clear that it =
was having critical liquidity problems. Earlier, they failed to downgrade t=
wo California utilities until they defaulted.=20
Just a year ago, Kmart was looking like a smart bet. Its savvy and tough ch=
ief executive officer, Chuck Conaway, who had turned the CVS pharmacy chain=
 into a stock market winner, was about six months into a massive restructur=
ing. The company closed smaller stores and earmarked huge sums to revamp it=
s inventory, distribution and sales systems. This included $2-billion for c=
omputer technology in an effort to boost efficiency dramatically and better=
 compete with mighty Wal-Mart and the Target chain, its biggest competitors=
, along with the rising warehouse clubs.=20
Analysts liked Mr. Conaway's strategy and his track record. From January to=
 an August high of $13.55, the stock more than doubled.=20
But as the economic slump worsened and Wal-Mart and Target continued to gai=
n market share at Kmart's expense, it was plain that the company's turnarou=
nd strategy wasn't working. Its prices were simply not low enough to lure c=
ustomers back from Wal-Mart, which outsells Kmart by a margin of nearly two=
 to one per square foot of store space, and it lacked Target's reputation f=
or brand names at good prices. As losses mounted, it actually cut advertisi=
ng expenses, never a sound business strategy during a downturn.=20
In a research note Jan. 2, Prudential Securities retail analyst Wayne Hood =
suggested a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would help get Kmart out of its se=
lf-inflicted pickle. Under the umbrella of court protection, Kmart could sh=
ed costly leases, close hundreds of stores and restructure debt.=20
Noted Wall Street value fund manager Marty Whitman has been buying up Kmart=
 debt, although he won't go near the stock.=20
"Now I don't know if Kmart's going to file or not. Probably not. But I woul=
d be convinced that if they do file, the creditors are going to receive par=
 plus accrued in the reorganization," he said in a television interview.=20
Why the bullishness? Plenty of value in the company's 2,100 stores and its =
$37-billion in annual sales in fiscal 2001.=20
With the debt changing hands at 50 cents or so on the dollar, investors wou=
ld be looking at eventual yields above 75 per cent, although there could be=
 a long wait for a payoff. But if Kmart opts for Chapter 11, shareholders a=
re likely to get nothing. bmilner@globeandmail.ca
