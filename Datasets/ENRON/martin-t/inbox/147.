Attached is a listing of the top 200 customers on EOL ( as provided by Dave Forster's EOL Team). We have gone in and started to cross reference the customer overlay to determine who the PHASE 1 ( top 10 or 15 ) target customer identified as the most important for each business unit/region.

Can you please add your input for your region first thing on Friday A.M.   

Thanks and if there are any questions, please give either Frank Vickers or myself a call.
