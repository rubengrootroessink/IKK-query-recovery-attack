Tom,
 
I received an e-mail from Linda Carter asking about certification.  I assume you will get a schedule tonight at the meeting.  She was asking about David, her son, being certified this year.  The way I read the new rule, is that you have to be 19 to be certified.  I told her I would ask you to ask about that new rule at the meeting tonight to be sure we understand it.  It is posted on their website www.nwal.org .
