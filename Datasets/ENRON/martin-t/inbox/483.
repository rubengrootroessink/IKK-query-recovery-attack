Dan,

Please see attached the format of the guaranty for Houston Pipe Line
Company LP by American Electric Power Company, Inc.

I have revised this format from our standard format to provide Guadalupe
with a format that should be accepting to both parties.

Questions, just let me know.  614-324-6869.

Thank you.
Patty
