Publicized Letter to Lay Involved Struggle Over Enron's Direction
By John R. Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=
ising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=
es was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=
ad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20
The letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=
herron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=
 financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=
s with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=
wn executives could cause Enron to "implode," she wrote. Widespread disclos=
ure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=
le in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=
k bankruptcy-law protection.
Ms. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=
etter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=
nment investigations into the Enron collapse. "She has a compelling story a=
nd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story," Mr. Hilder said=
.=20
But the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=
es a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=
he extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=
tributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =
ranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =
financial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=
hips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=
99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=
 and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =
top company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=
s deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=
=20
However, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=
ips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=
g, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=
nancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=
th Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=
timated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=
s.=20
One of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=
ncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=
n't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=
b as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=
hether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =
on the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon "never raised any b=
roader concerns," she said.=20
However, an Enron spokesman speaking on behalf of Mr. McMahon strongly chal=
lenged that interpretation of events. "There was a very clear conversation =
where Mr. McMahon expressed concerns about a range of conflicts" related to=
 the LJM entities, said the spokesman.=20
Mr. Fastow had been widely viewed within Enron as a close ally of Mr. Skill=
ing, whose sudden resignation last August raised investor concerns and cont=
ributed to the company crisis. For his part, Mr. Fastow believed that Mr. M=
cMahon wanted his job as chief financial officer and that Ms. Watkins was a=
n ally in that effort, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. McMahon =
was named chief financial officer last October when Enron replaced Mr. Fast=
ow because of rising controversy surrounding the partnerships.=20
The Enron spokesman said Mr. McMahon denies that he was seeking the chief-f=
inancial-officer job when he went to see Mr. Skilling. Mr. McMahon knew Ms.=
 Watkins, the spokesman said. Indeed, he added, she initially had written t=
he letter anonymously and first revealed her identity as the author to Mr. =
McMahon. He urged her to identify herself to Mr. Lay and personally express=
 her concerns to the CEO. She later had a meeting with Mr. Lay.=20
Ms. Watkins' attorney, Mr. Hilder, said "We categorically deny that Ms. Wat=
kins was in cahoots with Mr. McMahon regarding trying to oust Mr. Fastow as=
 CFO." He declined to comment on any specific dealings she might have had w=
ith Mr. McMahon.=20
Also expressing concerns about LJM was former Enron Vice Chairman Cliff Bax=
ter, who left the company last May. In her letter, Ms. Watkins said Mr. Bax=
ter "complained mightily . . . about the inappropriateness of our transacti=
ons with LJM." Mr. Baxter couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.=20

Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to Kenneth L.=
 Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K. Skilling resi=
gned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later ident=
ified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at =
Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released excerpts of the let=
ter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:=20
Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get rich=
 over the last few years, can we afford to stay?
Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieti=
es and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its accounting -=
- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle. We do have v=
aluation issues with our international assets and possibly some of our EES =
MTM positions.=20
The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling is =
leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and r=
eported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix th=
e Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have to po=
ny up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.=20
To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow of =
$800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle (Con=
dor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later years. Is t=
hat really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?=20
We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via our =
swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly -- Avici b=
y 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by 80 =
percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't be th=
ere for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these losses=
. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the street that w=
e are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company w=
ith Enron stock in the future.=20
I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scanda=
ls. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume=
, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an ela=
borate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for ''personal reasons'' =
but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and knew this =
stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame =
in two years.=20
Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have tho=
ught and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one big pr=
oblem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we enjoyed=
 wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then try and =
reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the bank in o=
ne year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but investors =
were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120 a share and =
now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and there are p=
robably one or two disgruntled ''redeployed'' employees who know enough abo=
ut the ''funny'' accounting to get us in trouble.=20
What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the all-employee=
 meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and Causey will sit dow=
n and take a good hard objective look at what is going to happen to Condor =
and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?=20
Summary of Alleged Issues:=20
RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk; howe=
ver, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM. If the=
 Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no commitment to=
 contribute more equity.=20
The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of E=
nron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.=20
Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor e=
ntities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.=20
As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the equity=
 derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying securities.=
=20
This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying capitaliza=
tion of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing for reserves=
 against our MTM positions.=20
To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we ''enhanced'' =
the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.=
=20
My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must ''enhance'' t=
he vehicles by $250 million.=20
I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a lot =
of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment. No=
ne of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in t=
he bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of Waste Mana=
gement -- where AA paid $130 million plus in litigation re questionable acc=
ounting practices.)=20
The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the ''a=
ccounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence his inves=
ting decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough understa=
nding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or change the =
accounting.=20
My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the transactions.=
 If adequately explained, the investor would know that the ''entities'' des=
cribed in our related party footnote are thinly capitalized, the equity hol=
ders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the entities comes from=
 the underlying value of the derivatives (unfortunately in this case, a big=
 loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock we swapped, I also don=
't believe any other company would have entered into the equity derivative =
transactions with us at the same prices or without substantial premiums fro=
m Enron. In other words, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have bee=
n much lower. How much lower?=20
Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no one=
 would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to these e=
ntities would decline and the transactions would be less noticeable. All ha=
s gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover, the New Power Company =
and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.=20
I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a clear=
 and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the transac=
tions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities law and acc=
ounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself what he =
believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated damages to =
the company from those discoveries and decide one of two courses of action:=
=20
1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage too =
great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind, writ=
e down these positions/transactions.=20
2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to the =
company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage containment =
plans and disclose.=20
I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly increased =
with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a smoki=
ng gun.=20
Summary of Raptor Oddities:=20
1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.=20
a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a related =
party.=20
b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except En=
ron.=20
c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a contributio=
n of its own shares.=20
One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its e=
quity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't find=
 an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will lose this=
 money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?=20
If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact pattern =
that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.=20
2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.=
=20
a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at what=
 now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have fallen =
away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off this risk=
. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.=20
b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into these =
transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the comp=
ensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such transactions?=
=20
3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question our=
 accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause for =
concern.=20
a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He com=
plained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should=
 be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offe=
red him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the=
 five steps with him.=20
b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen ab=
out the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.=20
c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments g=
roup say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we woul=
d get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The principal investments gro=
up hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These people kno=
w and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about these de=
als. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake deal with=
 Skilling that LJM will never lose money.=20
4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money trai=
l between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at LJM? At R=
aptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?=20
Condor and Raptor Work:=20
1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current decisio=
n includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.=20
2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigate the=
 Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorney-client privilege on =
the work product. (Can't use V & E due to conflict -- they provided some tr=
ue sale opinions on some of the deals).=20
3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or Pricewater=
houseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co. (Enron); PWC (LJM=
).=20
4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our future co=
mmitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For instance: I=
n the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with Raptor 3 (NPW) if w=
e don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3 to commit more ENE sh=
ares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3 deal, committing more EN=
E shares to avoid a write-down.=20
5. Develop cleanup plan:=20
a. Best case: Clean up quietly if possible.=20
b. Worst case: Quantify, develop P.R. and I.R. campaigns, customer assuranc=
e plans (don't want to go the way of Salomon's trading shop), legal actions=
, severance actions, disclosure.=20
6. Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if I'm all wet:=20
a. Jeff McMahon=20
b. Mark Koenig=20
c. Rick Buy=20
d. Greg Walley=20
To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following:=20
1. We've contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities. Since =
it's contingent, we have the consideration given and received at zero. We d=
o, as Causey points out, include the shares in our fully diluted computatio=
ns of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that En=
ron will have to issue the shares in the future. This impacts 2002-2004 ear=
nings-per-share projections only.=20
2. We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 million of los=
t value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down. However, we=
 also booked gains from our price risk management transactions with Raptor,=
 recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from the Raptor entities.=
 That's a $500 million related party transaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000=
 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33 percent of NI after tax.=20
3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviews the cont=
ingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will have enough c=
apital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equity derivatives expire.=20
4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of the contingen=
t Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable that Raptor =
owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a $500 million l=
oss.=20
5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM is whole on a=
 cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value come from? It came=
 from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transaction as $500 million i=
n a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500 million of value in our=
 ''economic interests'' in these entities? Then we would have a write-down =
of our value in the Raptor entities. We have not booked the latter, because=
 we do not have to yet. Technically we can wait and face the music in 2002-=
2004.=20
6. The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions. Don't yo=
u think that several interested companies, be they stock analysts, journali=
sts, hedge fund managers, etc., are busy trying to discover the reason Skil=
ling left? Don't you think their smartest people are poring over that footn=
ote disclosure right now? I can just hear the discussions -- ''it looks lik=
e they booked a $500 million gain from this related party company and I thi=
nk, from all the undecipherable half-page on Enron's contingent contributio=
ns to this related party entity, I think the related party entity is capita=
lized with Enron stock.'' . . . . ''No, no, no, you must have it all wrong,=
 it can't be that, that's just too bad, too fraudulent, surely AA & Co. wou=
ldn't let them get away with that?'' ''Go back to the drawing board, it's g=
ot to be something else. But find it!'' . . . . ''Hey, just in case you mig=
ht be right, try and find some insiders or 'redeployed' former employees to=
 validate your theory.''

HOUSTON -- A detailed road map of Enron Corp.'s aggressive accounting maneu=
vers and an uncannily accurate prediction of the company's collapse were la=
id before Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August in a lengthy memo that be=
came public Tuesday.=20
Excerpts of the memo had been released by congressional investigators Monda=
y, but the full extent of the warnings became known only Tuesday with the r=
elease of the entire text.
The author of the memo, Sherron Watkins, 42, expressed concern that the com=
pany's vaunted business success would eventually become considered "nothing=
 but an elaborate accounting hoax." Watkins, a vice president of corporate =
development at Enron, worked directly under the architect of Enron's comple=
x and highly questionable financial dealings.=20
Watkins focused particularly on what were known as the "Raptor" transaction=
s, in which Enron transferred several marginal investments to a putatively =
independent partnership. The partnership had gone virtually bankrupt by las=
t summer, but Enron still was not disclosing the loss to shareholders, Watk=
ins said.=20
The full text suggests that Watkins did not believe she was telling Lay muc=
h that he did not already know--and that many of the company's financial tr=
ansactions were mere accounting shams.=20
She attempted to persuade Lay either to reverse the offending transactions =
promptly or to disclose them fully to shareholders and "develop damage cont=
ainment plans." Lay did neither.=20
"Her motivation is not vindication or being proven right or bringing down t=
he company," her husband, Richard, said Tuesday from the family home in Hou=
ston. "She's a team player."=20
Watkins went to work at Enron Tuesday morning as news of her memo was splas=
hed across the front pages.=20
"It's a normal day," said her lawyer, Philip Hilder, although he acknowledg=
ed that "it's very difficult for anybody to go to work under these circumst=
ances."=20
Watkins has suffered no retaliation from anyone at the company, the lawyer =
said, although a source close to her said Watkins has been made to feel "an=
 outcast."=20
Sherron Watkins, the daughter of two secondary school educators, grew up in=
 the distant Houston suburb of Tomball and graduated from the University of=
 Texas.=20
Tuesday morning, television news trucks jammed the street in front of the W=
atkins home. Later that day, Richard Watkins praised his wife for doing "so=
mething quite courageous. She has the strength of her convictions. But she'=
s very vulnerable."=20
A neighbor said the hint of moral indignation in Watkins' memo to Lay was g=
enuine.=20
"Clearly she thought it was her moral and professional duty to do what she =
did," said Carrie Wood, who also was Watkins' sorority sister at UT. "Sherr=
on was drawn to the dynamic intellectual challenge of being an Enron vice p=
resident. I don't think she was drawn to the materialistic greed that spran=
g out of it."=20
Word of Enron's accounting irregularities leaked out slowly during the fall=
, depressing the company's already-dropping stock price. Its businesses des=
troyed and its reputation in tatters, Enron finally filed for Chapter 11 ba=
nkruptcy protection Dec. 2.=20
Watkins wrote her memo on the heels of the surprise resignation Aug. 14 of =
Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. The corporate announcement of Sk=
illing's departure ascribed it to "personal reasons."=20
But to Watkins and others inside the company, the move hinted at his deep u=
nease at the accounting irregularities and presaged a difficult period of p=
ublic scrutiny.=20
"I think he . . . looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable, a=
nd would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in 2 years," she wrot=
e to Lay. Moreover, she warned, "the probability of discovery significantly=
 increased with Skillings's shocking departure. Too many people are looking=
 for a smoking gun."=20
Many of Enron's financial maneuvers would not bear that scrutiny, she said,=
 even though they had been formally approved byEnron's outside auditor, And=
ersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen.=20
'We're Such a Crooked Company'=20
This particularly applied to deals Enron had made with LJM, a partnership t=
hat had been set up to trade with Enron and was managed by Enron Chief Fina=
ncial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. The goal was to move debt and other liabili=
ties off Enron's books, where they would have a negative effect on the comp=
any's financial picture, and park them with a putatively independent compan=
y. As long as these liabilities remained secret, Enron's reputation, and it=
s stock price, remained buoyant.=20
The LJM deals inspired deep unease within Enron, Watkins related, quoting o=
ne colleague remarking: "I know it would be devastating to all of us but I =
wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company."=20
Lay responded to Watkins' letter by meeting with her personally and persuad=
ing the Enron board to commission an internal review by Vinson & Elkins, on=
e of Enron's Houston law firms.=20
Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington attorney, defended the company's resp=
onse. The nine-page review of Watkins' concerns by Vinson & Elkins issued O=
ct. 15 shows "the good faith of Ken Lay and the company. . . . It shows tha=
t they meaningfully looked into this."=20
Bennett said the law firm interviewed Watkins but that it put "a lot of fai=
th in Arthur Andersen."=20
Watkins, however, had specifically warned Lay against allowing Vinson & Elk=
ins to conduct the investigation.=20
"Can't use V&E due to conflict," she wrote in her memo. "They provided some=
 true sale opinions on some of the deals."=20
In other words, she argued that the firm would be ruling on the propriety o=
f legal opinions it had itself issued.=20
Moreover, the law firm said in its report, written by Vinson partner Max He=
ndrick III and addressed to Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr., tha=
t it was specifically instructed by Enron not to "second guess . . . the ac=
counting advice and treatment" provided by Andersen. The report stated that=
 Enron and Andersen representatives acknowledged that the accounting treatm=
ent of the suspect transactions "is creative and aggressive," but it did no=
t conclude that it was "inappropriate from a technical standpoint."=20
Vinson & Elkins spokesman Joe Householder declined to discuss whether it wa=
s a conflict of interest for the firm to investigate Watkins' allegations.=
=20
"We are not in a position to talk about our engagements with Enron or any o=
ther client," he said.=20
As it happens, the firm overruled almost all of Watkins' substantive object=
ions to the LJM transactions, although it did acknowledge some "awkwardness=
" arising from LJM's executives serving as Enron officers.=20
"Transactions were negotiated between Enron employees acting [for] Enron an=
d other Enron employees acting for LJM," the law firm's report stated.=20
It also noted that within Enron there was widespread suspicion that the Enr=
on employees representing LJM were enjoying special perquisites, including =
higher compensation. But it said the awkwardness would be eliminated in the=
 future because LJM executives were leaving the Enron payroll and relocatin=
g their offices from its headquarters building.=20
Focus on the 'Raptor' Deals=20
The report did, however, provide indirect evidence of Enron's custom of min=
imizing the public disclosure of the nature of its financial maneuvers. Amo=
ng other things, the company gave its outside lawyers little opportunity to=
 examine closely the financial reports and other documents it was releasing=
 for public consumption.=20
"Enron's practice is to provide its financial statements and disclosure mat=
erials to V&E with a relatively short time frame within which to respond wi=
th comments," the report stated.=20
In her memo, Watkins focused most heavily on several transactions between E=
nron and LJM known as the Raptor deals. The term referred to a special busi=
ness entity that Enron had established to hold several investments that wer=
e expensive and of possibly marginal value, including ownership in a broadb=
and communications company called Rhythms NetConnections and other technolo=
gy and energy companies.=20
To cover the LJM-Raptor acquisition of the investments, Enron pledged share=
s of its own stock and that of some of its subsidiaries. But it also engage=
d in a series of complicated derivatives deals aimed at hedging the possibi=
lity that the value of Rhythms and the other assets would fall.=20
In 2000, Watkins noted, Enron went as far as to record more than $500 milli=
on in revenue from those derivatives deals. That, she said, presented numer=
ous problems.=20
For one thing, Enron had not received the $500 million from LJM. Rather, th=
e payment was conditioned on the value of the underlying investments remain=
ing high; if the investments deteriorated, there was an increasing chance t=
hat Enron would never receive the money.=20
Further, it was likely that a truly independent company would not have paid=
 anywhere near $500 million for the investments at issue--meaning that the =
deal was not legitimately an arm's-length sale.=20
Vinson & Elkins acknowledged this, noting in its report that LJM "permitted=
 Enron to close transactions that otherwise could not have been accomplishe=
d."=20
In fact, as the value of the investments dropped, Enron was obligated to ma=
ke up the difference by paying LJM more of its own stock.=20
Throughout 2001 the underlying investments did fall in value--and so did th=
e value of Enron stock. That meant the company had to contribute vastly mor=
e shares to LJM than it ever anticipated. That was a contingency that was n=
ever fully disclosed to the public or Enron's shareholders, who stood to lo=
se value in their own shares as more were pledged to LJM.=20
"It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a r=
elated company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the fut=
ure," Watkins wrote.=20
Not until Nov. 8 did Enron fully disclose the nature of the Raptor deals--a=
s part of its public announcement that the improper accounting of those tra=
nsactions and others resulted in its overstating its earnings by $586 milli=
on over a nearly five-year period.=20
The announcement all but destroyed any chance that the company would be abl=
e to survive in its existing form.=20
Addiction to Accounting Tricks=20
Enron critic Mark Roberts, president of Off Wall Street Consulting Group, a=
 Cambridge, Mass.-based stock research firm, said the Watkins memo adds to =
the evidence of Enron's addiction to illegitimate accounting tricks.=20
The Raptor deals were derivative transactions "with recourse," meaning deal=
s in which the counter-party would be compensated for any losses, he noted =
in an interview.=20
"If the buyer doesn't have risk, the risk stays with Enron and has to be re=
flected on their balance sheet," said Roberts, whose firm sold Enron shares=
 "short," a bet that they would fall, as early as last May.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE EMPLOYEE
Author of Letter To Enron Chief Is Called Tough
By JIM YARDLEY

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 15 -- In the cutthroat business culture of the Enron Corporat=
ion, where toughness and a sharp tongue were often prerequisites for succes=
s, Sherron S. Watkins could be noticeably tough and sharp.=20
One former colleague described her as ''a bull in the china shop'' at times=
. Others mistook the Texan Ms. Watkins for a brusque New Yorker. But severa=
l former colleagues agreed that her toughness was rooted in a strong sense =
of business ethics and that she was unafraid to deliver difficult news, eve=
n to her superiors.
''In my experience, she was not afraid to speak the truth, even when it was=
 uncomfortable,'' said Stephen Schwarz, a former Enron employee who worked =
with Ms. Watkins and described her as ''the consummate professional.''=20
Ms. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development at Enron, has emerg=
ed as a central figure in the federal investigations into the company, afte=
r a Congressional subcommittee released a letter she sent in August to Kenn=
eth L. Lay, Enron's chairman. [Text, Page C6.]=20
Written months before the company laid off more than 4,000 workers and file=
d for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, the letter warned that =
improper accounting practices threatened to destroy the company even as Mr.=
 Lay was reassuring investors and employees.=20
That Ms. Watkins, who came to Enron eight years ago after working at the Ar=
thur Andersen accounting firm, would confront her bosses with such a pointe=
d message did not startle those who knew her.=20
''Now that I've read what she wrote, I'm not in the least bit surprised tha=
t it was her,'' one former Enron colleague said.=20
Another Enron employee said word that Ms. Watkins had confronted Mr. Lay be=
gan to circulate through the company at some point after she had sent the l=
etter and had a subsequent audience with the chairman.=20
''Rumors were floating that she knew some things that were going on and tha=
t she had apparently voiced some concerns,'' said a former employee of Enro=
n Broadband Services, a division where Ms. Watkins once worked.=20
Ms. Watkins, who is 42 and still works at Enron, declined to comment today,=
 but her lawyer, Philip H. Hilder, said his client had written the letter a=
s an act of conscience.=20
''She thought it was the right thing to do, to ask some questions,'' Mr. Hi=
lder said. ''I think that was her only motivation. She saw that there were =
some problems, and she was concerned.''=20
The investigations into Enron are focused at least in part on a series of o=
ff-the-books partnerships that were reportedly used to inflate the company'=
s profits by hiding its losses, including those involving the company's for=
mer chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. The partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow, who was fired in October amid growing investor concern, are cent=
ral to the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Enron's ac=
counting.=20
Ms. Watkins's lawyer said his client reported directly to Mr. Fastow last s=
ummer after being reassigned to his office from the broadband unit.=20
In her letter to Mr. Lay, Ms. Watkins did not mince words in discussing fou=
r of those partnerships.=20
''Has Enron become a risky place to work?'' she asked. ''For those of us wh=
o didn't get rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?''=20
Like many other Enron employees, Ms. Watkins first worked at Arthur Anderse=
n, the Big Five accounting firm that has also come under federal scrutiny a=
fter it was disclosed that Andersen employees had destroyed thousands of pa=
ges of Enron documents in recent months. One former Enron colleague, whose =
career also began at Andersen, said Ms. Watkins, then Sherron Smith, starte=
d around 1982 as an auditor in Andersen's Houston office.=20
Another employee in the same Andersen office was Jeffrey McMahon, who would=
 later become Enron's treasurer.=20
''She was very good friends with Jeff McMahon,'' a former Enron colleague s=
aid, noting that each had married later in life and started a family.=20
It was Mr. McMahon who in 2000 complained to Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's=
 president, about the partnerships connected to Mr. Fastow, people close to=
 Enron say. Mr. McMahon was later reassigned to another position. Mr. Skill=
ing ascended to chief executive, only to leave abruptly last August after s=
ix months in the post.=20
Ms. Watkins's career at Andersen took her to New York until she left to joi=
n Enron, where she steadily rose to the position of corporate vice presiden=
t. Colleagues say she first worked on international projects.=20
''She could swear up a blue streak,'' said a former colleague who worked wi=
th Ms. Watkins on international deals. ''She came down with a tough New Yor=
ker confidence that could carry her in a predominantly men's world.''=20
While Ms. Watkins could be abrasive, that colleague added, her ethics were =
unassailable.=20
Eventually, she was assigned to the broadband unit, where colleagues say he=
r responsibilities included reining in costs. She earned a reputation as be=
ing outspoken at meetings. One former Enron executive said Ms. Watkins alie=
nated some employees, who pointedly sought not to work for her. But, the ex=
ecutive added, ''I have never heard anyone question her judgment, her integ=
rity and her veracity. I never heard anybody say she cut corners.''=20
Mr. Schwarz, the former broadband colleague who regarded her highly, descri=
bed her as ''a New Yorker amidst Texans.''=20
In fact, Ms. Watkins grew up in a small town north of Houston and later att=
ended the University of Texas. Her husband, Richard, declined to comment to=
day at their home in the city's affluent Southampton neighborhood.=20
A neighbor, Carrie Wood, said she and Ms. Watkins were sorority sisters in =
college and painted a softer picture of her friend. She described Ms. Watki=
ns as a doting mother who dedicated all her time away from Enron to her you=
ng daughter.=20
''She's bright and she's humble and she's thoughtful and deliberate and she=
's morally sound,'' said Ms. Wood, who described Ms. Watkins as an active C=
hristian who participated in Bible study. ''She's a bright, confident busin=
esswoman, too.''=20
Another neighbor, Chris Cagley, an independent accountant who did business =
with Enron, said he had on occasion bumped into Ms. Watkins on their street=
 and in the Enron lobby.=20
''Now that I know that she wrote this mystery memo, I would say I have a ne=
wfound respect for this person,'' Mr. Cagley. ''Because it's not easy to st=
and up and point out things that are wrong in corporate America. It's much =
easier to let it go.''

HOUSTON -- She goes to Bible study class and buys cookies from every Girl S=
cout who comes to the door. She gave $40 to the neighborhood association fo=
r tree planting, which earned her the rank of "regular," not quite "patron"=
 or "sustaining."=20
Sherron Watkins, 42, became a national figure in the Enron Corp. affair thi=
s week after the disclosure of her August letter warning fellow company exe=
cutives of questionable accounting measures. But friends say Watkins, an En=
ron vice president, has tried not to let the growing scandal at her company=
 overwhelm her life.
The last time Carrie Wood, Watkins' neighbor and former sorority sister, sa=
w her friend was Sunday. Wood asked how she was.=20
"I've gotten an SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] subpoena," Watkins=
 said.=20
"For documents? Or for you?" Wood asked.=20
"Both," Watkins said.=20
But she appeared normal, Wood said, noting that "she was going off to buy h=
er daughter some shoes."=20
Watkins lives in Southampton, a pleasant, tree-lined Houston neighborhood w=
ith big but not extravagant houses nestled close together. A few blocks awa=
y is Rice University, where she runs up the stadium steps to keep fit.=20
Watkins and her husband, Richard, who works in oil and gas financing for a =
Canadian company, and their 2-year-old daughter live in a gray saltbox-styl=
e home with a large American flag out front. On Tuesday morning, television=
 news trucks filled the street, but by afternoon they had given up their qu=
est for an interview and left.=20
Like the street, the inside of the Watkins house was quiet, domestic--golf =
clubs on the study floor, family photos on the walls and tables, an empty b=
eer bottle near the door. Richard Watkins had a clipboard on which he was n=
oting who called and what they wanted. It was a long list.=20
The husband didn't want to talk much, but neighbors were glad to offer test=
imonials.=20
"She's very professional--we keep it just neighbors," said Chris Cagley, wh=
o lives across the street.=20
Cagley worked for Enron too, as a contract employee, but he said he never d=
iscussed office matters with Watkins. Her role in calling attention to the =
questionable practices came as a surprise to him when he picked up the Tues=
day paper. He was filled with admiration.=20
"You know how corporations are," he said. "No one wants to stand out, to sa=
y anything bad. But Sherron wanted to inform people, to let them know what =
was going on."=20
Meanwhile, Watkins' attorney, Philip Hilder, was being besieged by the news=
 media in his new downtown offices, which are still under construction. He =
did simultaneous TV interviews, perfecting the art of saying nothing.=20
"We fully anticipate we will be subpoenaed to appear" before Congress and o=
ther regulatory hearings, he said repeatedly.=20
Hilder, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in white-collar crimina=
l defense, responded to one interviewer who asked if he had handled a case =
like this before:=20
"Has anybody handled anything like this before?"

Law Firm Releases Enron E-Mails Detailing Lockdown

01/16/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This story was first published Tuesday)=20

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- One of the law firms representing Enron Corp.'s (E=
NE) employees in their 401(k) lawsuit against the company released two inte=
rnal e-mails showing conflicting dates regarding the start of the lockdown =
period for the company's 401(k) plan.
The press release, issued by Gottesdiener Law Firm, is a possible indicatio=
n of the tactics the plaintiffs will use in pursuing their claims against E=
nron. In the release, Gottesdiener also claims the lockdown wasn't administ=
ratively necessary at all.=20
As reported, some employees of the bankrupt energy concern are suing, claim=
ing a lockdown of the Enron plan to make administrative changes prevented a=
ll employees from selling Enron shares during that time. During the lockdow=
n, the company's stock price collapsed.=20
An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the lates=
t press release. Enron has previously said the lockdown was for 10 days, fr=
om Oct. 29 to Nov. 12, and has defended the move as being essential to allo=
w employee account information to be accurately and completely transferred =
to a new administrator.=20
In the Tuesday press release, Gottesdiener said an e-mail sent on Sept. 27 =
was the company's initial announcement to employees about the lockdown. The=
 e-mail, available for viewing at www.enronsuit.com, told employees that th=
e lockdown would begin on Oct. 19 and last one month.=20
"To ensure that records and individual accounts are converted accurately," =
the e-mail said, "a transition period of approximately one-month will begin=
 Oct. 19."=20
"During the transition period," the e-mail continued, "participants are not=
 able to transfer funds among investment options or request a withdrawal."=
=20
However, a second e-mail, sent on Oct. 25 and also available on the Web sit=
e, appears to provide contradictory information, stating the lockdown would=
 begin Oct. 26.=20
Gottesdiener said the e-mails show that the company issued false informatio=
n, leading many workers to believe that the lockdown began a week earlier t=
han it actually did and causing them to miss the opportunity to sell their =
stock when it was still trading for around $30 a share.=20
Attorney Eli Gottesdiener said Enron issued another e-mail on Nov. 14 at ni=
ght informing employees the lockdown had been lifted Nov. 13.=20
On Dec. 14, Enron had defended criticism of the 401(k) lockdown in a statem=
ent, saying a temporary shutdown is required when companies change 401(k) a=
dministrators in order to allow employee account information to be accurate=
ly and completely transferred to the new administrator.=20
Enron said then that it mailed a notice to the homes of all affected employ=
ees Oct. 4, to announce a transition to the new 401(k) administrator would =
begin Oct. 29. The company said it also sent several internal e-mail remind=
ers between the two dates.=20
Enron said the transition period during which employees couldn't change inv=
estments lasted "just 10 total trading days," from Monday, Oct. 29 to Monda=
y, Nov. 12, and applied to all plan participants, including senior executiv=
es. The company said that from the first day of the temporary plan shutdown=
 to Tuesday, Nov. 13, the first day participants could transfer funds, its =
closing share price fell from $13.81 to $9.98, a drop of $3.83, or 28%.=20
On five days during the lockdown, Enron said, its stock closed below $9.98.=
 On Friday, Oct. 26, the last day before the lockdown began, Enron's stock =
closed at $15.41. - By Stephen Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 201.938.5400

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE INVESTIGATION
Justice Dept.'s Inquiry Into Enron Is Beginning to Take Shape, Without Big =
Names
By DAVID JOHNSTON

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- With Attorney General John Ashcroft and virtually th=
e entire legal staff of the United States attorney's office in Houston disq=
ualified from the Enron criminal investigation, the Justice Department has =
been forced to rapidly assemble a pickup team of prosecutors and investigat=
ors to unravel Enron's collapse.=20
The mammoth white-collar fraud inquiry, which focuses on an energy trading =
company that has been a big Republican donor and supporter of both Presiden=
t Bush and Mr. Ashcroft, is emerging as the most politically sensitive case=
 yet confronted by the Bush administration. Overall, the investigation will=
 be under the direction of Larry D. Thompson, the deputy attorney general, =
and his subordinates in the department's criminal division.
Mr. Thompson is proving to be a reliable second-in-command for Mr. Ashcroft=
 and the White House. A top federal prosecutor in Atlanta during the presid=
ency of Mr. Bush's father, Mr. Thompson won his credentials with the Bush c=
amp in 1991 when he helped guide Clarence Thomas through a tumultuous confi=
rmation as a Supreme Court justice.=20
On Jan. 10, Mr. Ashcroft, along with David Ayres, his chief of staff, recus=
ed himself from the criminal investigation of the company's collapse. The c=
ase was then referred to a Washington-led task force. Mr. Ashcroft's associ=
ates have said he took the step to avoid any criticism of conflict of inter=
est because he had accepted campaign donations from Enron. Mr. Ashcroft rec=
eived more than $50,000 from the company and its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, =
for his 2000 Senate campaign.=20
Some Democratic groups argue that Mr. Thompson, too, has ties to Enron. In =
Atlanta he was a lawyer at the firm King & Spalding, which represented Enro=
n, but he himself did no work for Enron, a Justice Department official said=
 today.=20
So far the department has avoided the appointment of a special counsel, a s=
tep that would force it to relinquish control to an outside prosecutor and =
deepen the impression that the case represents a serious conflict for the B=
ush administration.=20
The criminal investigation itself will be centered in Houston, where Enron =
is based. But the Justice Department is being forced to recruit a fresh tea=
m of prosecutors because Michael T. Shelby, the United States attorney in H=
ouston, and virtually the entire legal staff of Mr. Shelby's office were di=
squalified on grounds that they were acquainted with Enron employees.=20
Mr. Shelby's brother-in-law is a lawyer for Enron North America and was amo=
ng those Enron stockholders who lost substantial sums when the company's st=
ock plummeted. Mr. Shelby said that several of his employees had ties to fo=
rmer and current Enron workers, some of whom could be witnesses in the case=
.=20
Justice Department officials have declined to specify how many lawyers disq=
ualified themselves and said they did not yet know how many will be reassig=
ned to Houston. F.B.I. officials said that a large number of agents trained=
 in forensic accounting would be temporarily moved to Houston for the case.=
=20
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's own task force on the Enron case will=
 be headed by Joseph L. Ford, an F.B.I. agent for 20 years who has led seve=
ral of the bureau's complex health care fraud investigations and helped org=
anize the investigation of the financial transactions behind the Sept. 11 t=
error attacks, government officials said.=20
Law enforcement officials said that the initial focus of the criminal inqui=
ry is on whether the company defrauded investors or federal regulators as i=
t set up risky outside partnership deals that contributed to the company's =
bankruptcy. But privately, some officials said that investigators were at t=
he fledgling stage of the inquiry and had no idea what they would find.=20
For that reason, they said it was far too early to discuss what violations =
they might find as they scour the company looking for documents and coopera=
tive witnesses. Among the areas of scrutiny will be the destruction of Enro=
n-related documents by Arthur Andersen, the company's auditing firm.=20
Justice Department officials said that Joshua Hochberg, head of the departm=
ent's fraud section, would supervise the inquiry with the rank of a United =
States attorney -- making him an equal to other United States attorneys inv=
olved in the case in New York, San Francisco and the District of Columbia. =
Mr. Hochberg will report to Michael Chertoff, head of the criminal division=
.=20
On a day-to-day basis the case will be managed by Leslie R. Caldwell, who w=
as chief of the securities fraud section of the United States attorney's of=
fice in San Francisco. Ms. Caldwell had been a senior trial lawyer in Brook=
lyn until 1999, when Robert S. Mueller III, now the F.B.I. director, recrui=
ted her for the Northern California job while he was United States attorney=
 in San Francisco.=20
The Justice Department criminal inquiry, while potentially the most serious=
 and far-reaching of the investigations, is only one of a number under way =
among executive branch agencies. The Labor Department has been examining ho=
w the company dealt with employee retirement plans in the weeks before Enro=
n's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2. The Securities and Exchange Commission has=
 been investigating transactions between Enron and outside partnership deal=
s and the company's relationship with Arthur Andersen.=20
Today, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat and head of the Senate=
 Banking Committee, said he had asked the Congressional investigative arm, =
the General Accounting Office, to examine laws regulating employee stock ow=
nership in retirement plans and whether failures in accounting practices in=
creased the risks of the company's failure.=20
Two other Senate inquiries are being conducted by Democrats on the Governme=
ntal Affairs Committee. The investigations are emerging as the Democrats' m=
ost significant investigative effort since they took control of the Senate =
in June.=20
Many Democrats were highly critical of Republican-led investigations into a=
ccusations of improprieties by the Clinton administration. Now the Democrat=
s, who have benefited to a lesser extent from Enron contributions, risk bei=
ng accused of staging politically motivated inquiries aimed at a company wi=
th well-known Republican connections.=20
''I am very concerned that this is going to become highly politicized,'' sa=
id Robert S. Bennett, an Enron lawyer and a veteran of Washington scandals =
as a onetime lawyer for former President Bill Clinton.=20
Mr. Bennett added: ''If it does become highly politicized, a lot of people =
are going to get hurt. A lot of reforms which might come about will not be =
enacted, and this will be just a typical major league Washington mess with =
blood all over the place and little accomplished.''=20
But Mr. Bennett's first problem is elsewhere on Capitol Hill. Mr. Lay is sc=
heduled to testify early next month. His appearance could be a turning poin=
t in public perceptions about the company. He must give accurate testimony =
but avoid providing further ammunition for criminal investigators.=20
Mr. Lay will testify before the Senate Commerce Committee, which is investi=
gating how Enron employees who held company stock in retirement plans were =
barred from selling their stock as it plummeted -- leaving many retirees in=
 serious financial straits.=20
On the same day, Mr. Lay will testify before the House Financial Services C=
ommittee. It has focused its inquiry on the impact of Enron's collapse on i=
nvestors and markets.=20
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, headed by Joseph I. Lieberman, D=
emocrat of Connecticut, is conducting an inquiry centered on whether regula=
tors like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and E=
xchange Commission should have uncovered problems sooner. Mr. Lieberman's p=
anel is scheduled to hold a hearing on Jan. 24.=20
One of the Governmental Affairs subcommittees, an investigations panel whos=
e chairman is Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, is conducting its o=
wn inquiry. Mr. Levin's subcommittee has prepared 51 subpoenas for document=
s related to the operations of the company, its executives and its outside =
auditor.=20
Two other House committees are also investigating the company. The House En=
ergy and Commerce Committee has been investigating Enron's accounting pract=
ices. The House Education and Workforce Committee has been looking into emp=
loyees' retirement plans.

NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange said it is suspending trading in En=
ron Corp. and moved to delist the energy company's shares from the Big Boar=
d.=20
The NYSE said that it "has determined that the company's securities are no =
longer suitable for trading on the NYSE." The exchange's action affects not=
 only Enron stock, but also other Enron securities, such as preferred conve=
rtible stock.
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the NYSE's decision wasn't a surprise to=
 the company. "This will have no effect on our business," Ms. Denne said.=
=20
In a separate statement late yesterday afternoon, Enron said its common sto=
ck will be now traded as an over-the-counter security under the symbol ENRN=
Q. Quotation services will be provided by Pink Sheets LLC. Formerly known a=

Enron's collapse last year triggered a huge drop in the company's stock -- =
sending it down to mere pennies a share -- and massive layoffs at the Houst=
on-based company. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on=
 Dec. 2.=20
The NYSE moved to delist Enron after the company's stock traded below the c=
ritical level of $1 for 30 consecutive days, placing it in violation of the=
 Big Board's listing standards.=20
"The exchange notes that today's action is being taken due to the expected =
protracted nature of the company's bankruptcy process and the uncertainty a=
t this time as to the timing and outcome of this process, as well as the ul=

The exchange said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission t=
o delist Enron securities "upon the completion of applicable procedures, in=
cluding any appeal by the company of the NYSE staff's decision."=20
The most recent time that Enron shares traded at the NYSE was Thursday. Tra=

NYSE Moves to Delist Enron Stock

Enron Corp.'s fall Tuesday from the august New York Stock Exchange to the l=
owest tier of securities trading--the unregulated "pink sheets"--reflects d=
eep skepticism about the energy-trading firm's past and future, experts sai=
d.=20
At this point, few financial institutions will allow their names to appear =
in the same news report as Enron if they can help it. The NYSE, in its anno=
uncement Tuesday that it is suspending trading in Enron pending an official=
 delisting, avoided pointed language. Instead, the exchange chose to explai=
n the move by citing the likelihood of a "protracted" bankruptcy, and uncer=
tainty "as to the timing and outcome of this process as well as the ultimat=
e effect on the company's common shareholders."
The NYSE's technical basis for suspending trading--the first step toward bo=
oting the stock off the market--was that Enron's shares have failed to clos=
e above $1 for more than a month. That is one of the grounds for delisting =
under NYSE rules.=20
But the exchange has plenty of leeway in allowing companies to trade even a=
fter a descent into penny-stock territory, if market officials see residual=
 value for shareholders, and a benefit for the NYSE itself.=20
One example is Bethlehem Steel, which has traded below $1 on the NYSE since=
 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Oct. 15. The stock =
ended at 51 cents Tuesday. Also, Finova Group, a finance firm that exited C=
hapter 11 last August, has spent the last two months below $1.=20
The NYSE temporarily halted trading in Enron on Friday, and that halt laste=
d through Tuesday.=20
Enron said its stock now will trade in the so-called pink sheet market unde=
r the symbol ENRNQ. It was quoted there Tuesday at 50 cents.=20
Pink sheet stocks are traded between brokers; prices can be viewed at www.p=
inksheets.com.=20
Shares of bankrupt companies frequently turn out to be worthless when the c=
ompanies reorganize. Thus, many experts say most trading in Enron shares wi=
ll be sheer speculation. "It's just hoping that you buy low and the stock s=
hoots up for a day on some news," said Jon Schotz, head of Santa Monica inv=
estment bank Saybrook Capital. "You're gambling. Red or black."=20
But Lawrence E. Harris, a professor of finance at the USC business school, =
said good reasons may exist for the NYSE and other markets to continue list=
ing companies that have fallen on hard times. Flexibility in selling stock =
to record losses for tax purposes can be important for shareholders, he sai=
d. Also, exchanges may not want to lose listings of bankrupt companies that=
 will emerge, reorganized, as solid operations with new common shares, he s=
aid.=20
Harris also said bond holders and other creditors of bankrupt firms, whose =
claims take precedence, sometimes allow stockholders to retain valuable int=
erests as an incentive to get companies out of bankruptcy more quickly.=20
Enron, however, is a different matter, especially because its accounting ir=
regularities may have been outright fraud and, at the very least, are incon=
sistent with NYSE requirements for accurate financial reporting, Harris sai=
d.=20
"The NYSE does not want its list to be depreciated by a rogue firm," he sai=
d.

Accord for Enron Trading Operations Leaves UBS Free Not to Inject Capital
By Mitchell Pacelle
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s agreement to sell its North American trading oper=
ations to UBS AG doesn't require the Swiss concern to inject any minimum am=
ount of capital into the operations, nor supply any minimum amount of credi=
t, according to documents released yesterday.=20
Furthermore, UBS has the right to terminate the agreement on short notice, =
according to lawyers who have studied the documents. The accord to sell the=
 operations in exchange for a slice of the unit's future profits was detail=
ed in bankruptcy-court filings.
As previously reported, UBS's investment-banking arm, UBS Warburg, won't pa=
y any cash for Enron's trading operations, which were once the company's la=
rgest source of profits. Instead, UBS will pay royalties to Enron amounting=
 to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for as much =
as 10 years.=20
The deal gives UBS a series of options to begin buying out Enron's royalty =
interest in year three of the agreement, the documents say. UBS's options c=
an be exercised in three steps, each representing one-third of the royalty =
stream. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each =
one-third share of royalty eliminated.=20
UBS spokesman David Walker declined to provide details about the new ventur=
e until after a bankruptcy-court hearing on the deal scheduled for Friday.=
=20
"This is an extremely positive deal for Enron and its creditors that confir=
ms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation," Enron Chief Financi=
al Officer Jeffrey McMahon said in a statement.

SWITZERLAND: UBS says has no acquisition plans for Enron Europe.

01/16/2002

ZURICH, Jan 16 (Reuters) - UBS AG has no plans to expand Enron's business i=
n Europe through acquisitions, Peter Wuffli, president of the executive boa=
rd, said on Wednesday.=20
"There are no plans ... for acquisitions in Europe," Wuffli told reporters =
prior to an analysts' briefing. UBS won the bidding for Enron's North Ameri=
can wholesale electricity and natural gas trading business earlier this mon=
th. Wuffli declined to disclose particulars of the deal, citing legal restr=
ictions.
Regarding the banking group's overall strategy, Wuffli said: "I do feel we =
are in a shift in our priorities," following a decade of acquisitions at th=
e group. "For the first time we are happy with our platform...so the focus =
will be quite clearly on organic growth."=20
Regarding staffing levels, especially in investment banking, "we are going =
against the trend," Wuffli said. "We do not feel we have overcapacity." He =

UBS CEO Rules Out Big Acqusitions

01/16/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- After a decade of rapid growth and big mergers, UBS AG=
 (Z.UBS) has the size and scale to grow organically, the Swiss banking gian=
t's top executive said Wednesday.=20
Peter Wuffli, who heads the group's executive board, said his focus is on m=
aking UBS cost-efficient and improving its client base.
"We are still looking at acquisitions and apply our standards, but we don't=
 see any large transformation deals like PaineWebber or the merger with Swi=
ss Bank Corp.," Wuffli said. "We don't have to do a major deal."=20

Wuffli, who took the top job at UBS in late December, said he's sticking to=
 statements he has previously made that UBS won't need to make any major la=
yoffs.=20
He said UBS learned the hard way that, "the cost of disruption, distraction=
, motivation of staff is high."=20
"Positively, there is a premium to stability," he said.=20
This is one reason why UBS won't be following rivals who have announced big=
 cuts in staff over the past two quarters.=20
The other reason, he said, is UBS is confident markets will recover in the =
second half of this year.=20
"We don't want to miss that," Wuffli said.=20
But he said UBS won't veer from its strategy even if a recovery is delayed =
by a quarter or two.=20
The only reason to possibly reassess its personnel stance would be if there=
 were a major unexpected political or financial crisis.=20
UBS wants to increase cooperation between its wealth-management business an=
d their investment banking activities.=20
"There are more synergies to be realized if the units can work more closely=
 together," he said.=20
UBS is stressing improvement of its brand-name. Wuffli said branding hadn't=
 been particularly consistent due largely to all of UBS's mergers with and =
acquisitions of other companies.=20
"We want to raise the profile of our identity for our clients and staff," W=
uffli said.=20

Wuffli said UBS will steer away from using cheap loans as a way to attract =
more lucrative investment banking mandates. Many of the Swiss group's rival=
s have been doing that to beef up investment banking revenues since markets=
 started trending downward.=20
"The cross-subsidized corporate finance with credit just doesn't make sense=
," he said. "We will not buy business with our balance sheet."=20
The issue is a particularly contentious one at UBS, and was believed to be =
a source of tension between group Chairman Marcel Ospel and Wuffli's predec=
essor, Luqman Arnold, who was ousted in a power struggle late last year.=20
UBS Warburg's ties with EchoStar Communications Corp. last year came under =
strain because - unlike rivals - it wouldn't offer the U.S. satellite-TV op=
erator a $3 billion loan to finance its acquisition of Hughes Electronics C=
orp.=20
UBS Warburg didn't win the mandate to handle the acquisition. That was emba=
rrassing for the investment bank, which had been advising EchoStar on its m=
erger and acquisition options.=20
Wuffli has previously denied EchoStar was a factor in the disagreements Osp=
el and Arnold had over business strategy.=20
UBS last week won its bid to buy Enron Corp.'s energy trading activities, a=
nd Wuffli said the group is ready to absorb its activities into UBS Warburg=
.=20
"This is an attractive addition to our trading activities. The Enron busine=
ss will be completely integrated into UBS Warburg," Wuffli said.=20
It will also be integrated into the investment bank's risk-management profi=
le and existing risk limits.=20
He said the acquisition makes sense and should make UBS Warburg stronger.=
=20
"It's an addition to the product line and means a diversification of revenu=
es," he said.=20
He said it will be "quite challenging" to keep Enron's experienced energy t=
raders and, "we will make offers to front personnel and support staff."=20
But he said he couldn't say yet how many people would get offers and what t=
he specifics of those offers would be.=20

CALGARY - A bid by UBS Warburg to take over the trading operations of Enron=
 Corp. assigns little value to its cash-rich Canadian unit, even though it =
claimed to be a viable business despite the bankruptcy of its parent.=20
The agreement, made public yesterday, says UBS will take over at a cost of =
no more than US$4-million the intellectual property and technology, trading=
 staff, office space and equipment of the Canadian affiliate, so it can con=
duct gas and power trading in Canada and with Canadian counterparties "in s=
ubstantially the manner historically conducted by Enron and its affiliates.=
"
Enron Canada Corp. has at least $220-million in cash from the sale last mon=
th of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmo=
nton, and is owed more than $100-million by partners that have not honoured=
 their obligations, its chief executive said last week.=20
The unit unsuccessfully attempted last month to win court backing for a reo=
rganization so it could re-emerge as an independent operation and distance =
itself from its parent's bankruptcy.=20
Now, Enron Canada "is happy to go along with this" and be part of the UBS b=
id, said Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron.=20
Under the broader agreement, UBS, the Swiss investment bank, won't pay anyt=
hing to acquire the trading business, which generated about 90% of the comp=
any's US$101-billion in revenue in 2000, nor assume any of the company's de=
bts, but will share a third of the energy operation's profits with Enron an=
d its creditors.=20
Brian O'Leary, a lawyer representing many Canadian energy firms with ongoin=
g contracts with Enron Canada, said it looks like the contracts will be liq=
uidated, and any left over money used to pay creditors with the rest sent b=
ack to the U.S. parent.=20
"A lot still has to be unravelled here," Mr. O'Leary said. "It's going to t=
ake a while to calculate damages and find out if [contracts] were properly =
terminated and determine the full amount payable. Who is going to do that f=
rom Enron's point of view? That's the big question we have."=20
Jim Joyce, a principal with Risk Advisory, a risk management advisory firm =
in Calgary, said the deal gives Enron Canada a better balance sheet and the=
 ability to start fresh.=20
"They had a lot of cash, but people still weren't dealing with them, becaus=
e they weren't sure of the long-term implications of that cash, whether it =
was going to be funnelled back to the States or not. So, having a big balan=
ce sheet behind it is certainly better than whatever cash Enron Canada had,=
" Mr. Joyce said.=20
It may also mean new jobs for the operation, which recently laid off 75 emp=
loyees in Calgary and Toronto, because UBS doesn't have an energy trading b=
usiness in Canada, Mr. Joyce said.=20
Gary Gault, vice-president of the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary, which ac=
counts for about 10% to 15% of natural gas trading in Canada, said he would=
 also welcome Enron's return. "Enron was a very big market maker and create=
d deal flow in the market place," he said.=20
But he said the company will find the market has changed since its collapse=
.=20
Enron's share of natural gas and power trading has been taken over by compe=
titors, including NGX, which saw a 15% increase in activity.=20
In addition, activity is slower because of reduced commodity price volatili=
ty since last winter's energy crisis and because credit conditions are tigh=
ter across the industry, he said.=20
Enron's activities may be restricted under the new regime.=20
"How much will they let them win and how much will they let them lose? Our =
guess is that they will probably be more scrutinized, that UBS will be very=
 judicious in their management," he said.=20
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships use=
d to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial prob=
lems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading busines=

The Enron Effect: Government's Job Being Rethought
By Gerald F. Seib

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON'S HUNT for the great Enron scandal is on. As it unfolds, keep in=
 mind the cardinal rule of such controversies: The real scandal usually lie=
s not in what's illegal, but in what's legal.=20
If that principle holds true, the long-term impact of the Enron affair won'=
t be some Bush White House ethics controversy, as Democrats hope. It's more=
 likely to lie in a realization that government failed miserably in its rol=
e as regulator of the marketplace.
In that respect, Enron's demise figures to join a list of recent events, in=
cluding the tragedies of Sept. 11, that are helping to swing the political =
pendulum away from the deregulatory trends of the 1980s and 1990s. If Enron=
 -- a company that was both the leading disciple and very symbol of the der=
egulatory mood of recent years -- collapses while regulators were clueless =
about what it was doing, how could the political effect be otherwise?=20
For now, Washington's interest in Enron is a lot less subtle than that: The=
 company run by the president's top political contributor has crumbled, tak=
ing the retirement nest eggs of many rank-and-file employees with it. Did t=
he president's people do any favors for the company's executives in its dyi=
ng days? Did the White House have inside knowledge of the disaster about to=
 befall employees and stockholders that it should have acted upon?=20
So far, the answers appear to be no. In many cases, that would be the begin=
ning of the end of Washington's interest.=20
But not in this instance. Washington's examination of Enron is shaping up a=
s more than a partisan scandal monger's look for Bush-administration ethica=
l lapses. It has the makings of a more serious, bipartisan look at what wen=
t wrong and what government's role should have -- or at least could have --=
 been in stopping it.=20

AS ONE INDICATOR, consider the fact that the most dogged congressional inve=
stigator so far isn't a Democrat, but Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairma=
n of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. His panel has been looking in=
to Enron's collapse for two months, and he has sought documents from Enron =
(twice), from its accounting firm Arthur Andersen (twice) and from the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission.=20
It was Rep. Tauzin's staff that this week unearthed the damning letter from=
 an Enron official to Chairman Kenneth Lay, warning that the company's prac=
tice of hiding its debt in internal partnerships threatened to "implode in =
a wave of accounting scandals." That discovery prompted a Tauzin request fo=
r more documents.=20
Rep. Tauzin seems disinclined to give a break either to Enron or to Arthur =
Andersen for failing to blow the whistle. When it was disclosed that Anders=
en had destroyed Enron documents, Rep. Tauzin advised simply: "Anyone who d=
estroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired; anyone who destro=
yed records intentionally to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted=
." Andersen appeared to take his advice by dismissing a group of employees =
yesterday.=20
It seems clear that the SEC had no real idea how Enron was massaging its bo=
oks, and a limited ability to find out, and that there was no real regulato=
ry-oversight system in place to make sure Andersen was doing its job on beh=
alf of the average shareholder.=20

THE IMPACT transcends the Enron debacle, because the mess comes at a time w=
hen Americans already are rethinking the role government should play in the=
ir lives. In a small way, California's electricity crisis and in a large wa=
y the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have prompted a re-evaluation. On Sept. 12=
, the notion of the government's taking charge of airport security didn't s=
eem like such a bad idea, and Americans who once would have been offended b=
y nosy law-enforcement officials snooping around welcomed the practice.=20
Now one can almost sense some similar rethinking of government's role in th=
e marketplace. Many liberals tend to think government should protect consum=
ers from both risk and deceit in the marketplace. Many conservatives tend t=
o think market forces can take care of both risk and deceit.=20
A search for a middle ground is under way. Liberals will need to concede th=
at individuals clearly have to handle their own risk, and conservatives wil=
l need to agree that government needs to look harder for deceit, and to hav=
e the tools to do the job right. A sign of the times came yesterday, when n=
o less a conservative icon than columnist George Will, in the Washington Po=
st, wrote of the Enron case: "It will remind everyone -- some conservatives=
, painfully -- that a mature capitalist economy is a government project."

Law Firm Reassured Enron on Accounting --- Vinson & Elkins Discounted Warni=
ngs by Employee About Dubious Dealings
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Jeanne Cummings and Tom Hamburger in=
 Washington and Kathryn Kranhold in New York

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A venerable and politically connected law firm advised Enron Corp. official=
s not to worry about a company employee's warnings of questionable accounti=
ng, based on an inquiry that only canvassed Enron executives and its accoun=
tants at Arthur Andersen LLP.=20
The report by Vinson & Elkins partner Max Hendricks III, a copy of which wa=
s obtained by The Wall Street Journal, concluded that Enron's practice of f=
orming special-purpose entities to keep debt off its books was "creative an=
d aggressive," but that "no one has reason to believe that it is inappropri=
ate from a technical standpoint."
In fact, the subsequent widespread disclosure of those partnerships last fa=
ll fueled Enron's downward spiral toward a bankruptcy filing, lawsuits and =
now government inquiries -- including a federal criminal investigation. The=
 Enron executive whose complaints prompted the Vinson & Elkins review also =
warned, in an August letter to Enron's chairman, against using Vinson & Elk=
ins to vet her concerns because she believed there was a conflict of intere=
st.=20
Vinson partner Ronald Astin also was involved in structuring some of the pa=
rtnerships, according to an Enron source.=20
The expanding Enron scandal also is putting political heat on President Bus=
h and his inner circle. Along with Enron, Houston's Vinson & Elkins has bee=
n among the big Texas businesses that have been his biggest political patro=
ns. Of the firm's 341 partners, 165 contributed about $204,000 to Mr. Bush'=
s 2000 campaign, according to Thomas Marinis Jr., a firm partner and boyhoo=
d friend of the president's.=20
The web of friendships and money threatens to raise additional questions ab=
out possible conflicts of interest. For instance, after Commerce Secretary =
Donald Evans received a call for help from Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, amon=
g those he turned to for advice was his department counsel, Theodore Kassin=
ger. Mr. Kassinger is a former Vinson & Elkins attorney who had done work f=
or Enron on international trade and project-financing matters, according to=
 his public resume. Mr. Kassinger declined a request for an interview. But =
a Commerce Department spokesman said Mr. Kassinger worked in Washington and=
 knew nothing about Enron partnerships. He also said Mr. Kassinger hadn't b=
een asked for help by any former law firm colleagues.=20
White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales also is an alumnus of Vinson & Elki=
ns -- or V&E, as the Texas legal and political powerhouse is commonly known=
. Mr. Gonzales left there in 1994, when Mr. Bush, newly elected as Texas go=
vernor, picked him to serve as his attorney.=20
White House spokesman Dan Bartlett says he is unaware of any contacts betwe=
en Vinson & Elkins attorneys and administration officials about Enron. "One=
 thing is clear," he adds. "This administration has taken no action to bene=
fit or to attempt to help the Enron company."=20
Vinson & Elkins's internal inquiry that ended up reassuring Enron was spurr=
ed by an August letter from Enron Global Finance executive Sherron Watkins =
to Mr. Lay. In it, she raised alarms about the energy firm's unorthodox par=
tnerships and their potential danger to the company's finances and public i=
mage.=20
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scand=
als," Ms. Watkins wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the =
Journal. "My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my =
resume, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but =
an elaborate accounting hoax," she added.=20
In her letter, Ms. Watkins specifically points to Enron's creation of a par=
tnership called Raptor to help protect it from falling share prices in comp=
anies in which it owned stock. As she described the situation, Raptor had t=
o pay Enron if the company stock prices fell. In return, Enron had promised=
 to make up Raptor's losses with shares of Enron stock. When Enron's stock =
declined throughout the year, the amount needed to make Raptor whole grew s=
ignificantly.=20
Ms. Watkins also raised concerns about whether Enron had properly disclosed=
 the transactions with the partnerships to investors. And she questioned wh=
ether Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow had a conflict of inte=
rest in forming them.=20
She also specifically cautioned Mr. Lay against using Vinson & Elkins "due =
to conflict." Despite that, Mr. Lay did turn to his longtime allies at the =
firm. The ties between Enron and Vinson & Elkins date to the early 1980s, p=
rior to when Enron's predecessors, Houston Natural Gas and Internorth, merg=
ed. Enron was the law firm's biggest client, though it only accounted for a=
bout 7% of its work.=20
So close were the firms that, at times, Mr. Lay would pick a local charity,=
 and Vinson & Elkins partners were expected to pony up donations along with=
 Enron, say people familiar with the firm. And just as Mr. Lay and Enron we=
re early givers to the Bush presidential campaign, so, too, was Vinson & El=
kins. In early 1999, 140 of its lawyers wrote $1,000 checks in the span of =
a few days, and bundled them for delivery to Bush headquarters, according t=
o an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Both outfits' executiv=
es are among the Bush "Pioneers," supporters who raised at least $100,000 f=
or the candidate.=20
Over the years, lawyers at the firm would move in and out of jobs as Enron'=
s in-house attorneys. Enron's general counsel, James Derrick Jr., was a par=
tner at the firm until he joined the energy company in 1991. It was Mr. Der=
rick, one of the Enron contributors to Mr. Bush, who requested the internal=
 study of Ms. Watkins's concerns. But he imposed two restraints: Don't seco=
nd-guess the Andersen accountants, and don't analyze every transaction.=20
Washington defense attorney Robert Bennett, who is representing Enron, says=
 the limits were imposed because "they wanted an answer to this if they cou=
ld get one soon." But in hindsight, he concedes, "They probably should have=
 done some other things," such as seeking outside expertise on the accounti=
ng questions.=20
Vinson & Elkins investigators zeroed in on four areas -- conflicts of inter=
ests, the accounting treatment of the partnerships in Enron's financial sta=
tement, public disclosures of the partnership transactions and the potentia=
l impact on Enron's financial statements because of stock-price declines.=
=20
In each case, they dismissed Ms. Watkins's worries primarily by relying on =
assurances from Arthur Andersen that the accounting practices were appropri=
ate, according to the report. "In summary, none of the individuals intervie=
wed could identify any transaction between Enron [and the outside partnersh=
ip] that was not reasonable from Enron's standpoint or that was contrary to=
 Enron's best interests," Mr. Hendrick noted.=20
The company believed the conflict of interest largely was resolved when Mr.=
 Fastow severed his connection with the controversial partnerships, but Mr.=
 Hendrick noted that Enron's board twice waived the company's ethics code t=
o allow transactions to go forward.=20
The one area where the investigators saw Enron as vulnerable was in its pub=
lic relations: The transactions could "be portrayed very poorly if subjecte=
d to a Wall Street Journal expose or class action lawsuit," they noted in t=
he report.=20
The report is dated Oct. 15, 2001. The next day, Mr. Lay disclosed that his=
 company had a loss of $618 million in the third quarter. Shortly later, th=
e complex partnership arrangements were exposed, along with the fact that E=
nron had used them to conceal billions of dollars in losses. The revelation=
s rocked the company, and led to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.=20
Mr. Bennett argues that Mr. Lay would have conducted a more thorough invest=
igation of the partnerships if his attorneys had recommended it. "I think t=
his shows Ken Lay's good faith in the matter," he says of the report.=20
Joseph Dilg, Vinson & Elkins's new managing partner, who has worked closely=
 with Enron since the early 1990s, declined to comment on the specifics of =
the firm's investigation of Enron's partnerships and auditing practices.=20
"We remain very comfortable with everything we did," he says.=20
But Mr. Dilg says that while the firm could offer legal opinions on certain=
 Enron transactions, it couldn't conduct a review of its accounting practic=
es because it doesn't have expertise.=20
"We are not competent to render accounting advice," he says.=20
An Andersen spokesmen yesterday declined to comment on the report, referrin=
g only to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino's recent congressional =
testimony. In that appearance, Mr. Berardino said Andersen made a mistake i=
n accepting Enron's accounting for one of the partnerships, and wouldn't ha=
ve approved of another if it had known all the details.=20
Mr. Dilg says the Securities and Exchange Commission and congressional comm=
ittees haven't yet contacted him or his partners. But, he adds, the firm ha=
s retained Washington's Williams & Connolly as its outside counsel. The fir=
m also has hired well-known Houston lawyer Joe Jamail to handle civil litig=
ation. The firm was named in two Enron-related lawsuits, but those have bee=
n withdrawn.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LAW FIRM
Legal Counsel In Many Ways Mirrors Client
By JIM YARDLEY with JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 15 -- The law firm of Vinson & Elkins, which became publicly =
enmeshed this week in the Enron scandal, is often described much like its c=
lient: hugely powerful, international in scope and rich with connections fr=
om the statehouse to the White House.=20
The connections that bind Vinson & Elkins to the Enron Corporation were evi=
dent long before the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded documents=
 from the firm on Monday as part of its investigation into Enron's filing f=
or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. For at least the past five years, Enro=
n has been one of Vinson & Elkins's biggest clients, and last year, Enron a=
ccounted for nearly 8 percent of the firm's $455 million in gross revenues.
''I think that probably made them the largest client,'' said Joseph C. Dilg=
, the managing partner, noting that the firm began representing Enron 15 ye=
ars ago when it was known as Houston Natural Gas.=20
Congressional investigators are looking at a letter sent in August to the E=
nron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, in which a vice president at the company, Sh=
erron S. Watkins, warned that accounting practices involving a series of se=
cret financial partnerships could threaten Enron's future. At the time, Enr=
on asked Vinson & Elkins to investigate the issues raised in the letter but=
 limited the scope of the inquiry.=20
In a nine-page response on Oct. 15, Vinson & Elkins concluded that Enron di=
d not need a larger investigation into the issues raised in Ms. Watkins's l=
etter but warned that the ''bad cosmetics'' of the partnerships could bring=
 ''a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation.''=20
Mr. Dilg said the firm was still reviewing the Congressional request for do=
cuments and other information. ''We're not trying to be evasive, but we do =
have professional responsibilities for the clients we work for, and Enron i=
s one of our clients.''=20
Founded in 1917 by James A. Elkins and William A. Vinson, Vinson & Elkins h=
elped create modern Houston.=20
Today, Vinson & Elkins has 860 lawyers with nine offices worldwide, ranking=
 as one of the 25 largest firms in the country. Partners earn an average of=
 $655,000 a year.=20
According to Texans for Public Justice, a not-for-profit research group tra=
cking money in Texas politics, Vinson & Elkins employees and political acti=
on committees gave $133,000 in campaign contributions to George W. Bush in =
his 1994 and 1998 campaigns for governor. During the 2000 presidential camp=
aign, three of the firm's partners served as ''pioneers,'' each raising mor=
e than $100,000 for Mr. Bush's race.=20
''They have built their practice in part by building political connections =
through campaign contributions,'' said Craig McDonald, director of Texans f=
or Public Justice. ''They are by far the largest law firm contributor in th=
e state of Texas.''=20
There are already a plethora of lawsuits filed over Enron, as shareholders,=
 creditors and other plaintiffs are seek redress from the company and its a=
ccounting firm, Arthur Andersen. Two shareholder groups had initially inclu=
ded Vinson & Elkins in their suits until the firm hired a prominent lawyer,=
 Joe Jamail, who persuaded the plaintiffs to drop the firm as a defendant.=
=20
Larry Doherty, a prominent legal malpractice attorney in Houston, said Texa=
s statutes states that law firms can be sued for malpractice only by a clie=
nt. Still, he predicted that any lawyers who have worked for Enron and were=
 involved in reviewing partnerships and other questionable financial transa=
ctions could be vulnerable to lawsuits.=20
Other lawyers warned against any rush to judgment. Dick DeGuerin, a promine=
nt defense lawyer, compared the current frenzy surrounding Enron to ''the c=
rash of the stock market or the run on a bank.'' He added, ''Everybody's pi=
ling on Enron and to some extent Vinson & Elkins.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE BANKS
Lenders Differ in Disclosing Their Exposure to Troubles
By PATRICK McGEEHAN with RICHARD W. STEVENSON

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The two biggest lenders to Enron have given distinctly different responses =
to questions about their ties to the failed company. While J. P. Morgan Cha=
se rushed to detail its potential losses, Citigroup has repeatedly rebuffed=
 inquiries.=20
But the paths taken by the two investment banks should start to converge ov=
er the next two days as they report their earnings for the fourth quarter o=
f 2001. J. P. Morgan is expected to provide new details on the cost of its =
exposure to Enron today, while Citigroup is expected to end its silence abo=
ut just how deep its financial ties to Enron went when it discusses its ear=
nings tomorrow.
Unlike J. P. Morgan, Citigroup has declined for several weeks to divulge de=
tails of the loans and trading exposures it has to Enron, a giant energy tr=
ading company. Analysts said they did not believe that the amounts involved=
 were so big that they had to be disclosed to investors.=20
Citigroup apparently had enough involvement with Enron, however, to prompt =
Robert E. Rubin, chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, to seek help =
from a senior Treasury Department official.=20
Mr. Rubin, who was Treasury secretary before he joined Citigroup, called Pe=
ter R. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, on=
 Nov. 8 and broached the subject of Mr. Fisher's possibly calling bond rati=
ng agencies in hopes of averting an immediate downgrade of Enron's debt.=20
Mr. Fisher rejected the idea and Mr. Rubin accepted his decision, according=
 to the Treasury Department's account of the conversation.=20
People close to Mr. Rubin said he called Mr. Fisher in part because Citigro=
up was a large creditor of Enron and was working for the energy company in =
an investment banking capacity. But they said Mr. Rubin, who remains promin=
ent in Democratic politics and continues to take a keen interest in public =
policy issues, was also motivated by concern that the collapse of Enron wou=
ld have ramifications for the financial markets and the economy.=20
Citigroup officials declined to comment yesterday on the reasons for their =
public silence about the firm's dealings with Enron. Analysts said the comp=
any usually declines to discuss its lending relationships.=20
Most analysts estimate the net value of Citigroup's exposure to be about $1=
 billion. But they speculated that because Citigroup has not issued any war=
nings to investors about its earnings, the company must not expect to lose =
much of that money.=20
In contrast, J. P. Morgan has already said its earnings will be reduced by =
$220 million for bad loans to Enron, and its trading revenue for the quarte=
r will be reduced by $235 million after the bank marked down the value of t=
rading positions involving the company.=20
A Citigroup spokesman declined to say whether Citigroup executives would ev=
en mention Enron when they announce earnings tomorrow. But analysts said th=
e company would not try to evade questions about its potential losses relat=
ed to Enron.=20
''I think that could create an extremely contentious discussion with the in=
vestment community,'' said Henry McVey, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, who=
 has been recommending Citigroup's shares.=20
Mr. McVey said he did not know how Citigroup's exposure to Enron broke down=
 among its units.=20
J. P. Morgan, in contrast, has said its exposure includes loans and trading=
 positions, as well as certain bonds issued by insurers -- including the pr=
operty-casualty unit of Citigroup -- which were backed by some Enron oil an=
d gas contracts.=20
''For better or worse, J. P. Morgan's investor relations strategy has been =
relatively open over the years,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merri=
ll Lynch. ''They got caught in a jam this time, but their intentions were t=
o give the market as much information as possible.''=20
J. P. Morgan originally estimated its exposure to Enron at $900 million, in=
 part because it had counted on recovering on the bonds. But the insurers h=
ave balked at paying, and J. P. Morgan is suing them.=20
After reassessing all of its potential losses in the Enron debacle, J. P. M=
organ said last month that its total exposure to Enron was actually about $=
2.6 billion. That amount included $965 million on the bonds and $165 millio=
n in a letter of credit, as well as loans secured by a natural-gas pipeline=
 and unsecured loans.=20
Both Citigroup and J. P. Morgan had also served as investment bankers to En=
ron. The two firms were advisers to Enron on the proposed sale to Dynegy th=
at might have saved Enron from collapse. Together, they stood to collect ad=
visory fees of about $90 million if Dynegy went through with that acquisiti=
on.=20
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit also underwrote se=
curities for Enron and the various limited partnerships the company control=
led. And Salomon was one of six brokerage firms that managed the sale last =
May of about $150 million of units in an Enron partnership called Northern =
Border Partners L.P.=20
Daniel Noonan, a spokesman for Salomon, declined to say how many of the par=
tnerships the firm helped to sell or to characterize the scope of the firm'=
s involvement with the partnerships.=20
Citigroup has disclosed so little, analysts said, that anything it says abo=
ut Enron will be an improvement.=20
''If they say that it is immaterial, that is a piece of information,'' said=
 Diane B. Glossman, an analyst with UBS Warburg. ''If you wait until Thursd=
ay afternoon, we will have more information about Enron than we have right =
now.''

Citigroup's Enron Financing Stirs Controversy
By Jathon Sapsford and Mitchell Pacelle
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When Enron Corp. turned to its bankers for money in late October, the energ=
y company needed a quick, big loan to restore investor confidence in its fi=
nances.=20
Citigroup Inc. came up with the cash -- but with a catch.
Enron owed Citigroup $250 million in unsecured debt that was coming due in =
early December, just one portion of the overall debt Enron owes the bank. S=
o Citigroup told Enron it would provide $600 million of a new $1 billion se=
cured loan -- as long as $250 million was used to pay back existing Citigro=
up debt, according to people familiar with the transaction.=20
Now, a number of bankers in the lending syndicate are crying foul. Citigrou=
p, they say, used its influence as a new secured lender to improve the stan=
ding of unsecured loans it had already extended at the expense of other len=
ders. The bankers say they discovered only later that part of the loan faci=
lity was used to prop a Citigroup debt position. Thus, the bankers are like=
ly to challenge Citigroup's arrangement as part of Enron's bankruptcy filin=
g in a New York bankruptcy court.=20
Few can blame Citigroup for trying to reduce its exposure to Enron. But som=
e analysts say the maneuver raises questions about whether Citigroup moved =
unfairly to grab assets. And the deal effectively reduced the pool of colla=
teral available to all of Enron's other creditors in the bankruptcy proceed=
ings. "There's a bit of a conflict there," says Andy Collins, an analyst wi=
th U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.=20
Citigroup declined to comment.=20
At a minimum, the controversy over the Citigroup financing underscores how =
contentious Enron's bankruptcy process could become, as numerous creditors =
fight to secure a piece of a shrinking asset pie. It addition, it raises st=
ill more questions about the multiple hats worn by large lenders such as Ci=
tigroup, and the conflicts that may create with Enron's other creditors.=20
For Enron, the demand was a disappointment. While Enron trumpeted $1 billio=
n in fresh financing to the investing public, it actually received only $75=
0 million in new money, less than it had wanted, according to several peopl=
e involved in the financing.=20
Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon has been telling other credit=
ors that Enron needed cash so badly that Enron had no choice but to go thro=
ugh with the deal. Mr. McMahon was unavailable to comment, but an Enron spo=
keswoman says, "We got the best deal we could at the time." The arrangement=
 was driven by the fact that the $250 million debt in question, linked to f=
inancing for a natural-gas transaction, was soon to come due, according to =
a banker familiar with Citigroup's strategy.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which contributed the remaining $400 million to th=
e $1 billion credit line, also had hundreds of millions of dollars in exist=
ing unsecured exposure to Enron. Unlike Citigroup, it made no demands that =
its own existing loans be rolled into the new credit facility. An official =
at J.P. Morgan declined to comment.=20
The incident sheds some light on the inner workings of Citigroup in the Enr=
on mess. J.P. Morgan has disclosed it is owed some $2.6 billion in Enron-re=
lated exposure.=20
But Citigroup has kept quiet on the subject. Analysts have said it was at l=
east $1 billion, but warn the number could be higher. "Citigroup's disclosu=
re has been lagging," says Mr. Collins.=20
In most bankruptcy cases, unsecured creditors examine all loans extended be=
fore the filing to see whether the collateral was granted properly. If an u=
nsecured debt was paid off, or turned into a secured debt, within 90 days o=
f a bankruptcy, that lender is sometimes accused of receiving a "preference=
" over other lenders.=20
Because such "preferences" clash with a basic aim of bankruptcy law -- to s=
top a race to the courthouse by treating all similarly situated creditors t=
he same -- they can be challenged in court.=20
A potential challenge by some creditors against Citigroup, in essence, woul=
d be that the bank improved its standing in the line of creditors by demand=
ing new collateral on the $250 million of unsecured debt, thereby taking aw=
ay from other creditors assets that might be available pro rata to other un=
secured creditors.=20
Such challenges are often mounted late in the bankruptcy process, when cred=
itors are hashing out how to allocate assets that have been assigned to cre=
ditors.=20
If the Citigroup financing is successfully challenged, the $250 million cla=
im would once again become unsecured, freeing up the collateral for the pot=
ential pool of assets to be divvied up by unsecured creditors.

Enron, Argentina take down J.P. Morgan Chase earnings

NEW YORK (AP) - Hammered by loans to Argentina and the bankrupt Enron Corp.=
 that have gone bad, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. on Wednesday reported a steep =
earnings loss for the fourth quarter. The results were far below analysts' =
estimates.=20
Bad news for the New York financial giant came in almost every division exc=
ept retail, which was boosted by record mortgage originations and higher de=
posit volumes. Operating revenues declined in the fourth quarter in investm=
ent banking and in investment management and private banking, J.P. Morgan s=
aid. J.P. Morgan Partners, its venture capital arm, reported a loss.
William B. Harrison Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said in a st=
atement accompanying the earnings report, that results "were particularly a=
ffected by our exposure to private equity investments, and to Enron and Arg=
entina."=20
He said the bank had moved "aggressively to value those exposures to market=
 and to build loan loss reserves further" to position the bank for stronger=
 earnings when markets recover.=20
The bank said it lost $332 million, or 18 cents a share, in the October-Dec=
ember period. A year earlier, it reported net income of $708 million, or 34=
 cents a share.=20
Excluding merger and restructuring costs, the company earned $247 million, =
or 12 cents a share, for the quarter compared with $763 million, or 37 cent=
s a share, a year earlier.=20
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected operating ea=
rnings of 34 cents a share.=20
The bank said its total nonperforming assets were $3.92 billion at year's e=
nd, including $1.13 billion "related to the Enron surety receivables and le=
tter of credit." That, it said, was the "subject of litigation." Nonperform=
ing assets a year earlier totaled $1.92 billion, the bank said.=20
For the full year, net income was $1.69 billion, or 80 cents a share, compa=
red with $5.73 billion, or $2.86 a share, in 2000. Operating earnings were =

FOCUS Analysts, ratings agencies image hurt by Enron; legal impact unlikely

01/16/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

---- by Leslie Wines ----=20
NEW YORK (AFX) - Public trust in brokerage analysts and debt rating agencie=
s will remain seriously eroded for months by their failure to issue timely =
warnings prior to Enron Corp's Dec 2, 2001 bankruptcy filing, but they face=
 few legal and financial consequences, analysts said.
About 16 brokerage analysts maintained 'Buy" orders on Enron right up until=
 Dec 2, according to Steven Toll, a partner with Washington, DC securities =
law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfield & Toll, which has filed a shareholders'=
 class action case against Enron.=20
Standard & Poor's Corp downgraded the debt of Enron Corp in late November, =
triggering the collapse of merger plans with Dynegy Inc and the bankruptcy =
filing. The downgrade came a full three months after the company first reve=
aled its own problems.=20
Toll said that the extremely late response of analysts was highly disturbin=
g to countless investors who depend on them in large part for investment de=
cision advice.=20
But he said he has no plans to launch a class action suit against brokerage=
s and ratings agencies on behalf of investors because such a case would hav=
e scant chances for success as these institutions do not have a legal fiduc=
iary duty to warn stock buyers.=20
"The problem is they (analysts and ratings agencies) are not paid by shareh=
olders," Toll said. "They are paid by their employers and owe a duty to the=
m. It would be very hard to show that they have a duty to everyone in the m=
arketplace."=20
In addition, a recent US Supreme Court ruling largely restricts fraud litig=
ation to those suspected of committing it directly, such as, in this case, =
certain Enron executives and their auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP.=20
Brokerage analysts, ratings agencies and other additional parties who may h=
ave "aided and abetted fraud" in the Enron case would not be easy to sue un=
der the current US Supreme Court's legal interpretations, Toll said.=20
However, an individual investor who sues his personal broker or analyst mig=
ht have a better chance of success, he said.=20
George Perry, a fellow with the Brookings Institute in Washington, DC, said=
: "This thing is going to upset a lot of people before it's over, but in ge=
neral I don't think that the analysts will be in legal trouble."=20
Margaret Blair, another Brookings Institute fellow and a Georgetown Univers=
ity School of Law professor, said the delayed response of brokerage analyst=
s to the Enron developments intensified a public confidence crisis that beg=
an in 2000 when they failed to warn investors of the technology sector's im=
pending sharp deterioration.=20
"The analysts' reputation was already shot after they contrived to put out =
glowing reports on the internet sector well after the party was over," Blai=

`Lockdowns' of 401(k) Plans Draw Scrutiny --- Enron Employees' Losses Sudde=
nly Put Practice in Spotlight
By Ellen E. Schultz
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Many investors now are painfully aware that "lockdowns" don't just occur in=
 prisons -- they can handcuff employees' retirement-savings plans, too.=20
And for that disclosure, they can thank Enron Corp.
Last fall, amid the growing news of financial woes at the energy-trading co=
mpany, Enron officials "locked down" the employee retirement-savings plan t=
o make administrative changes. Although long-planned, the lockdown was poor=
ly timed: It prevented employees from moving out of Enron stock as its pric=
e continued to plummet.=20
The recent disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay and top aides were a=
ware of significant troubles at the company two months before the lockdown =
-- yet went ahead with it anyway -- have magnified the wrath of employees w=
ho have lost millions of dollars in retirement savings.=20
It also has hastened the examination of lockdowns by investigators. In addi=
tion to a Labor Department investigation, Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa),=
 a ranking member of the Finance Committee, says his staff is examining loc=
kdowns, which also are known as "blackouts" and "quiet periods."=20
The latest developments also signal the possibility for "potential criminal=
 exposure," asserts Marc Machiz, former associate solicitor at the Labor De=
partment in the Plan Benefits Security division. He adds that the lockdown =
by itself isn't the main issue. "If the company deceived employees into han=
ging onto the stock, it could become part of a pattern of fraud that might =
support" a racketeering claim, contends Mr. Machiz, now a member of the Was=
hington law firm Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld, & Toll, who isn't involved in t=
he Enron litigation.=20
Robert F. Bennett, a lawyer for Enron, at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, & =
Flom, says, "We are not aware of any criminal conduct in any fashion relate=
d to the 401(k), and people should not make reckless allegations in this ar=
ea."=20
Lockdowns, though unpopular with employees, hadn't been controversial befor=
e now. They are the equivalent of putting a car up on the blocks when it is=
 getting a tune-up. They occur when a plan is being transferred to a new re=
cordkeeper, or is implementing some structural change, such as a shift to d=
aily valuation from monthly valuation. During this time, employers forbid e=
mployees from moving their savings among funds.=20
Ordinarily, such lockdowns are perfectly legal and routine. But if company =
officials know that a coming lockdown will coincide with grim news that cou=
ld send the stock lower -- falling earnings, lawsuits, layoffs, a regulator=
y investigation -- then as fiduciaries they have a responsibility to protec=
t employees in the plan. Postponing a lockdown would be a prudent move.=20
Companies typically alert employees months in advance to planned lockdowns =
to give them time to shift their investments around if they choose. Normall=
y, a "time out" of several weeks or even a couple of months may not make th=
at much difference to employee savings, as long as the market isn't roiled =
by some disaster.=20
However, the growing prominence of employer stock in retirement plans has m=
ade lockdowns riskier for workers. As more and more employees hold huge pos=
itions in their employers' stock, they face enhanced risks when they are fo=
rced to sit tight for a period of time. As Enron has shown, they can't bail=
 out to limit their losses. (That's assuming they are allowed to sell: Most=
 companies prevent employees from selling shares they receive from the comp=
any until a certain age. Enron employees under age 50 weren't allowed to di=
versify out of company-contributed stock, so even without the lockdown, the=
y were locked into those shares).=20
Conversely, during lockdowns, employees can't sell to lock in gains either.=
 International Paper Inc. locked down its 401(k) plan, which had 43% of its=
 assets in company stock, from Nov. 30, 1999, through Jan. 31, 2000. During=
 that time, the company's stock fell 9% to $47.63.=20
The company in prior months had notified employees of the coming "quiet per=
iod," which occurred while the company made improvements to the plan. Thoma=
s Johnson, a manager with the company for 38 years who was planning to reti=
re the following summer, planned to sell his shares when the stock was in t=
he $50 range to diversify.=20
Although the shares hit a high of $60 during the lockdown, Mr. Johnson coul=
dn't make a move. In contrast, filings show that IP insiders sold millions =
of dollars in shares during the period when the employees were locked down.=
=20
Unlike Enron employees, Mr. Johnson didn't see his savings evaporate. But h=
is situation raises questions about whether employees close to retirement a=
re more at risk in lockdowns. A spokesman for IP says that the company comm=
unicated the planned lockdown for many months ahead of time and that the ch=
anges improved employees' ability to diversify.=20
If nothing else, Enron's lockdown will lead to closer scrutiny of how well =
companies communicate these events. Some Enron employees allege that the co=
mpany sent them an e-mail on Sept. 27 erroneously stating that the lockdown=
 would start Oct. 19, though it didn't start until Oct. 26. As a result, th=
ey missed an opportunity to sell the stock when it was selling for almost $=
30 a share, they say. On Oct. 26, the last day employees could trade their =
accounts, the stock closed at $15.40 a share; by the end of the lockdown on=
 Nov. 13, it had fallen to $9.98.=20
An Enron spokesman says that the company sent out a brochure and additional=
 e-mails throughout October, and that this apparently got the message acros=
s, because on the last trading day before the lockdown, Oct. 26, 187 employ=
ee investment transfers were made.=20
In an e-mail the company sent to employees shortly before midnight of the f=
inal day to make transfers, the company acknowledged that employees wanted =
to postpone the lockdown, but said it was going ahead anyway.=20
"We understand that you are concerned about the timing" of the lockdown and=
 "we understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition p=
eriod as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both =
the Plan in total, or your account in particular," the e-mail said. "Rememb=
er that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long=
-term financial goals."

Computer sleuths searching for deleted Enron e-mails

WASHINGTON (AP) - The job of recovering the missing Enron Corp. accounting =

 of the delete button.=20
They've been called on before in high-profile cases, looking for suspected =
spy transmissions and missing Clinton White House e-mails.
And now they'll be asked to recover documents from the computers of Arthur =
Andersen LLP, which acknowledges its employees destroyed thousands of e-mai=

Computer sleuths move quickly to preserve hard drives and backup tapes befo=

Andersen has said its Houston auditors started deleting Enron e-mails on Oc=
t. 23 and stopped Nov. 9. Bedser said his firm has been able to recover Lot=

Enron faces Congress probe over its own tax returns=20
WASHINGTON (AP) - Even as it neared collapse, Enron Corp. was in the forefr=
ont of a business lobbying campaign to scrap the corporate alternative mini=
mum tax. Now, Congress is turning its attention to Enron's own tax returns.=
=20
Repeal of the alternative minimum tax was backed by dozens of companies inc=
luding Enron and was part of President Bush's economic stimulus plan. The H=
ouse added a provision that would have given Enron a $254 million infusion =
of cash, but the package ultimately failed.=20
Now, the Senate Finance Committee is "interested in whether Enron has been =
complying with federal tax laws" particularly those governing tax shelters,=
 said the panel's spokesman, Mike Siegel.=20
Whether Enron used any shelters viewed by the Internal Revenue Service as s=
et up mainly to avoid paying taxes is one key point.=20
Enron, the Houston-based energy conglomerate, faces investigations from a g=
rowing list of congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission following its collapse late last year in th=
e nation's biggest corporate bankruptcy. The Finance Committee is one of tw=
o congressional panels with access to Enron's tax records.=20
Even as its failure loomed last fall, Enron maintained a high-profile lobby=
ing effort on a variety of tax issues. Enron led the AMT Coalition for Econ=
omic Growth, a business group dedicated to repeal of the corporate alternat=
ive minimum tax, which is intended to guarantee that companies pay at least=
 a minimal amount of income taxes.=20
Bush also pushed for repeal in his economic stimulus package, arguing that =
the provision hits corporations hardest in down years.=20

Paper Trail: Andersen Fires Partner It Says Led Shredding Of Enron Document=
s --- It Claims Disposal Effort Started After SEC Asked Energy Firm for Dat=
a --- Was He Following Orders?
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Ken Brown, Greg Hitt, Steve Liesman =
and Jonathan Weil

Capping a series of stunning disclosures, Arthur Andersen LLP fired a partn=
er it charged with directing the hurried destruction of thousands of e-mail=
s and paper documents related to its audit of troubled Enron Corp., declari=
ng that he acted after learning that federal regulators were probing the en=
ergy giant's finances.=20
In an extraordinary statement, Andersen said David Duncan -- the Houston-ba=
sed lead partner on the Enron account -- led "an expedited effort to destro=
y documents" after he learned "that Enron had received a request for inform=
ation from the SEC about its financial accounting and reporting." In additi=
on to firing Mr. Duncan, Andersen placed three other Houston partners respo=
nsible for the Enron audit on administrative leave.
The purge marked an effort by Andersen to contain the Enron affair to its H=
ouston office and shield itself from more serious charges, as Congress and =
the Justice Department intensify their scrutiny of the case. "If they can s=
how that this was a rogue partner, acting beyond his authority, that will h=
elp them fashion a defense," said Joseph di Genova, a former U.S. attorney =
in Washington, D.C., who isn't involved in the case.=20
Just what more senior officials at Andersen knew, and when they knew it, wi=
ll become central questions, as the embattled firm struggles to salvage its=
 tattered reputation and credibility, and to limit its possible civil and c=
riminal liability.=20
While Andersen insisted that its higher-ups didn't know until recently abou=
t the destruction of documents, a person close to Mr. Duncan and speaking o=
n his behalf said the firm is unjustly trying to pin the blame on him. Mr. =
Duncan merely was following instructions in an Oct. 12 e-mail from an Ander=
sen lawyer that advised the Enron auditors to follow company procedure that=
 allows for the disposal of many documents, this person said. Congressional=
 and Justice Department investigators expect to question Mr. Duncan in Wash=
ington, D.C., today.=20
Separately, even as Andersen moved to contain the damage to its Houston off=
ice, there were new indications yesterday that Andersen's Chicago headquart=
ers knew details about controversial Enron financing arrangements that cont=
ributed to the company's downfall. These arrangements included partnerships=
 that kept huge amounts of debt off the company's balance sheet and inflate=
d earnings.=20
After investigating an Enron employee's warnings in August about improper a=
ccounting for the partnerships, the company's outside law firm, Vinson & El=
kins, wrote in a report to Enron that "all material facts" about the partne=
rships were "disclosed and reviewed by Arthur Andersen." The Oct. 15, 2001,=
 report, a copy of which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, said that=
 Andersen officials in Houston consulted with colleagues in Chicago about t=
he accounting treatment of the partnerships. The nine-page report made clea=
r that Enron's board of directors approved of the outside partnerships and =
had suspended its code of ethics to allow the partnerships to be headed by =
a top Enron executive who stood to benefit financially from them.=20
Asked for comment on the Vinson & Elkins report, an Andersen spokesman yest=
erday would only refer to the recent congressional testimony of Andersen Ch=
ief Executive Joseph Berardino. Mr. Berardino told lawmakers that in one ca=
se, Andersen made an error in judgment in accepting Enron's accounting for =
one of its off-balance-sheet financing vehicles. In another case, he said t=
hat if Andersen had known everything about the deal it wouldn't have signed=
 off on it.=20
Deepening financial problems related to its hidden debt and overstated earn=
ings forced Enron in December to become the biggest company ever to file fo=
r bankruptcy-court protection. Its collapse has been painful to investors, =
and especially Enron employees, who have seen once-valuable company stock b=
ecome almost worthless. In recent weeks, attention increasingly has focused=
 on Andersen's failure to flag the giant energy-trading company's problems =
in audits and on Enron's unsuccessful efforts to use its influence in Washi=
ngton to keep the company from going under.=20
The scandal widened last Thursday with the disclosure by Andersen, initiall=
y with few details, of the document destruction. On Monday, congressional o=
fficials revealed a letter written by an Enron employee last August, expres=
sing worry that the company would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals=
." It also emerged Monday that Vinson & Elkins, in its Oct. 15 report, had =
concluded that nothing wrong had gone on at its client, Enron.=20
In its announcement yesterday, Andersen depicted a frantic effort last Octo=
ber, allegedly directed by Mr. Duncan in its Houston office, to get rid of =
sensitive documents. The disposal took place as troubles mounted at Enron a=
nd after questions arose about accounting deficiencies that may have contri=
buted to the company's downfall.=20
Andersen said in its statement: "The effort [to destroy documents] was init=
iated following an urgent meeting the lead partner called on Oct. 23 to org=
anize the expedited effort to dispose of Enron-related documents. This meet=
ing occurred shortly after the lead partner learned that Enron had received=
 a request for information from the [Securities and Exchange Commission] ab=
out its financial accounting and reporting. This effort was undertaken with=
out any consultation with others in the firm and at a time when the engagem=
ent team should have had serious questions about their actions. Nothing in =
an Oct. 12 e-mail, almost two weeks earlier, or so far as we know, other co=
nversations around that time, authorized this activity."=20
The firm added that the document destruction "appears to have ended shortly=
 after the lead partner's assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on =
Nov. 9 -- the day after Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC -- tellin=
g them to `stop the shredding.' " By that time, huge volumes of e-mails and=
 written documents had been destroyed. Andersen said, "These activities wer=
e on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen=
's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated."=20
Andersen said that it couldn't assure that document destruction ended after=
 the firm officially came under scrutiny in the SEC investigation. "The fir=
m is still looking into this issue," Andersen said, noting that "if anyone =
is found to have acted in this way, they will be dismissed."=20
The Andersen spokesman wouldn't comment yesterday on whether people in any =
office other than Houston knew about the document shredding as it was happe=
ning.=20
Andersen's Mr. Berardino said in a brief interview that he first learned of=
 the document destruction on Jan. 3 and that the firm notified the Justice =
Department and the SEC the following day. "We came out with this as soon as=
 we had enough facts," he said. It is "too early to say" what the debacle's=
 impact will be on Andersen's ability to attract new clients, he added. In =
an advertisement appearing in today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Berardino sa=
id, "In the near future Andersen will announce comprehensive changes in our=
 practices and policies that we believe will reaffirm confidence in the ind=
ependence and quality of our work."=20
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the latest revelation=
s from Andersen. But Mr. di Genova, the former federal prosecutor, predicte=
d that the accounting firm's fast action signals it may seek to cooperate w=
ith the government's criminal investigation.=20
"If prosecutors can cut a deal with Arthur Andersen, they may be able to ge=
t to the bottom of what happened at Enron pretty quickly," said Mr. di Geno=
va, who is now a private white-collar defense lawyer. The purge and admissi=
on about document shredding amount to "a really nice piece of evidence [for=
 prosecutors]," he said. If it can be shown that anyone at Andersen destroy=
ed documents "in the middle of a criminal or congressional investigation," =
that person could be charged with obstruction of justice, a crime punishabl=
e by prison time, he said.=20
On Capitol Hill, the investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committ=
ee, led by Republican Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, is accelerating rapidly=
. Boxes of documents are pouring into the panel's office from Enron and And=
ersen. Committee aides are preparing for a series of imminent interviews wi=
th central players in the financial drama.=20
Mr. Duncan is scheduled to be interviewed today by investigators from the c=
ommittee, as well as by officials with the Justice Department, congressiona=
l aides said. "Now that he's been fired he may have a little more motivatio=
n to cooperate with us," said Mr. Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson. "Today, =
we heard one side of the story. Tomorrow we'll hear the other."=20
The firing and other actions by Andersen mirror classic strategy in white-c=
ollar criminal-defense cases: Hand prosecutors a few scalps and pledge coop=
eration in hopes of gaining lenient treatment in the future. Securities-law=
 specialists say it's likely only the beginning of a wave of acts of contri=
tion by Andersen in an attempt to restore its reputation and appease author=
ities.=20
In its prepared statement, Andersen took care to cite the document destruct=
ion as the only reason that Mr. Duncan and the other partners were being fi=
red or placed on leave. The firm didn't link Enron's audit failure to the p=
ersonnel actions. In past cases of audit failures, such as those involving =
Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., Andersen chose not to fire the par=
tners responsible for those companies' audits, partly out of concern that t=
hey would turn against the firm in subsequent litigation.=20
Taking action against employees doesn't necessarily shield Andersen from be=
ing criminally prosecuted itself, Ted Fiflis, a securities-law professor at=
 the University of Colorado at Boulder, said.=20
Andersen's Houston office has been one of its biggest and most successful, =
employing more than 1,400 people, out of Andersen's world-wide work force o=
f 85,000. The firm said it has the largest operation of any of the Big Five=
 accounting firms in Houston, even though it is the smallest of the Big Fiv=
e overall.=20
Mr. Duncan, 42 years old, has been at the firm since 1981, except for a nin=
e-month period in 1992, and was made partner in 1995. He has been the Enron=
 "engagement partner" since 1997, and over the past three years has taken o=
n broader responsibility within Andersen, people close to him said. In 1999=
 and 2000, he was part of a firm-wide strategic advisory council and last y=
ear, Mr. Berardino asked him to be on the chairman's advisory council, a gr=
oup of 21 partners who discuss firm-wide issues. He was informed of his dis=
missal in a phone call yesterday morning, the people close to him said.=20
These people said that no Enron documents had been destroyed before Houston=
 officials received the e-mail from an Andersen lawyer on Oct. 12. That lon=
g and detailed policy statement, while ordering auditors to save crucial do=
cuments, told them to destroy many other documents. If the firm wanted the =
auditors to save all the Enron-related documents, it should have sent a dif=
ferent memo, a person close to Mr. Duncan said.=20
"When you want to preserve documents, you say it with bold-faced letters wi=
th exclamation points," this person added. "The notion that there was some =
kind of instruction from him that there be some form of expedited, extraord=
inary activity, it's just not correct," the person close to Mr. Duncan said=
. Mr. Duncan is cooperating fully with government investigators, according =
to the people close to him.=20
The Houston-based Andersen partners put on administrative leave for their r=
oles in the Enron document destruction are Thomas H. Bauer, Debra A. Cash a=
nd Roger D. Willard. Peter Anderson, an attorney for Mr. Willard, denied th=
at his client had been involved in any wrongdoing. Andersen's "action sugge=
sts that my client has done something wrong or had acted in violation of th=
e firm's policy, and we have no evidence . . . that has been communicated t=
o us or that we're even aware of that would suggest that that's the case," =
he said.=20
Mr. Anderson said he was told by attorneys for Andersen that the leaves wer=
e imposed "out of an abundance of caution." The attorney added that his cli=
ent, Mr. Willard, "acted in a belief that he was acting in accordance with =
Andersen policy."=20
Mr. Bauer and Ms. Cash didn't return phone calls to their homes and offices=
.=20
The firm also relieved four Houston-based partners of their management resp=
onsibilities. They are D. Stephen Goddard Jr., Michael M. Lowther, Gary B. =
Goolsby and Michael C. Odom. None of the four returned calls to their homes=
 and offices.=20
Even as attention yesterday was focused on the document destruction, invest=
igators continue to probe the controversial aspects of Enron's accounting. =
One of the central questions has been how much Andersen -- and in particula=
r top-level partners -- knew about certain partnerships, including some run=
 by Enron's officers. One of the partnerships, whose existence Enron didn't=
 disclose for four years, was part of an arrangement that inflated earnings=
 by several hundred million dollars. And Enron's debt level was much higher=
 than it revealed, thanks to the off-balance-sheet treatment.=20
Andersen partners were apparently concerned enough about the structure of t=
hese deals that they "consulted with its senior technical experts in its Ch=
icago office," according to the report to Enron from Vinson & Elkins, the o=
utside law firm.=20
The report also suggested ongoing contact between Enron and Andersen over t=
he partnerships. "The relationship between Enron and AA was an open one," t=
he report said, citing Enron's chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, a =
former Andersen employee. "Enron consults AA early and often on accounting =
and audit issues as they arise."=20
On more than one occasion, Mr. Causey told other company officials that And=
ersen's Houston office took decisions about the accounting treatment of the=
 partnerships to the accounting firm's top levels in Chicago, an Enron insi=
der said in an interview. "Duncan would run these things way up the chain,"=
 this person said. The company insider didn't know who specifically in Ande=
rsen's Chicago headquarters received the information.=20
Asked about whether Andersen's Houston office routinely sought approval fro=
m the Chicago headquarters in this manner, an Enron spokeswoman said, "We w=
ere aware that in many cases the Houston office of Andersen consulted with =
the national office on the accounting treatment of various partnerships."=
=20
While many big companies have close relationships with their outside audito=
rs, the relationship between Enron and Andersen was particularly close. In =
1993, when Andersen took over Enron's internal-audit operation, 40 people m=
oved from the company's payroll to Andersen's. Andersen employees occupied =
a large space in Enron's office tower.=20
Mr. Duncan, the Andersen audit partner, was a frequent golfing partner of M=
r. Causey, the chief accounting officer for Enron. And Mr. Duncan also move=
d in some of the same philanthropic circles as Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairma=
n and chief executive. The two men both serve on the 36-member board of dir=
ectors of a nonprofit organization called the American Council for Capital =
Formation, according to the council's Web site. The organization says its m=
ission is to promote "economic growth through sound tax, regulatory, and en=
vironmental policies."=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS
For Andersen and Enron, the Questions Just Keep Coming
By FLOYD NORRIS

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Arthur Andersen tried yesterday to salvage its reputation by firing a partn=
er who it said had directed the destruction of Enron documents. But the act=
ions it said the partner took have left Andersen facing the likelihood of c=
riminal investigations even as it tries to reassure the public, and its cli=
ents, that its audits can be trusted.=20
''This is very, very bad,'' said Alan M. Cohen, a former federal prosecutor=
 in New York and now a partner at the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers. ''Ther=
e is little doubt that prosecutors will view this as an act of obstruction.=
 It is inconceivable to me that the partner and Andersen would not be subje=
cts of a criminal investigation at a minimum.''
He noted that even though Andersen says the destruction was not authorized =
by the firm, the law says a business has ''vicarious liability'' for acts c=
ommitted by its agents or employees.=20
Paul R. Brown, the chairman of the accounting department at the Stern Schoo=
l of Business of New York University, said of Andersen: ''They have taken a=
 permanent hit to their reputation.''=20
Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive, tried=
 to put the best face on the situation as he announced the firing. ''Based =
on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not t=
olerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation o=
f our policies,'' he said.=20
Only a month ago, Mr. Berardino said the Enron case showed that reforms wer=
e needed in accounting rules, and he blamed Enron management for deceiving =
his auditors. But now the focus is clearly on Andersen itself.=20
''The integrity of this firm is in question,'' Mr. Berardino said in a tele=
phone interview. ''Our reputation is our most important asset.''=20
David Ruder, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission wh=
o is now a professor of law at Northwestern University, said Andersen was '=
'doing what they can to repair the damage by firing the person and changing=
 the management down there.'' But he said the firm should also undertake a =
broad review of its entire internal enforcement procedures to make sure its=
 auditors will walk away from a client when necessary.=20
Andersen said the fired partner, David B. Duncan, ordered the destruction o=
f documents the day after Enron said the S.E.C. was asking questions about =
the financial statements that Andersen had audited.=20
Just what was in the destroyed documents is not known. Nor is it clear what=
, if anything, was wrong with the audits of Enron that Mr. Duncan had super=
vised since 1997. But prosecutors assume that a person with nothing to hide=
 does not destroy documents after an investigation has been disclosed.=20
''The destruction of documents would indicate some intent to deceive,'' sai=
d Franklin B. Velie, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at th=
e Salans law firm in New York. ''Where there's smoke there's fire, and wher=
e there is a lot of smoke, like the destruction of documents, there is a lo=
t of fire. This is really beginning to look like a fraud scenario.''=20
Andersen's reputation was hurt last year when the S.E.C. filed a civil frau=
d case against the firm concerning its audit of Waste Management. It was th=
e first such charge in decades against a major accounting firm, and the all=
egations reached to the very top of the firm.=20
The S.E.C. said Richard L. Measelle, when he was the firm's managing partne=
r, had concurred in the decision not to force Waste Management to correct f=
aulty accounting that Andersen's auditors had uncovered. Mr. Measelle was n=
ot accused of wrongdoing.=20
Andersen settled the case without admitting or denying wrongdoing and paid =
a $7 million fine. Two partners were fined and banned by the S.E.C. from au=
diting public companies for three years but kept their jobs.=20
Why was no one fired then? ''You need to be fair to people who are trying t=
o do a good job,'' Mr. Berardino said yesterday.=20
Formal documents accepting an S.E.C. censure in the Waste Management case w=
ere signed by Gary B. Goolsby, then Andersen's director of global risk mana=
gement. Yesterday he was one of four partners relieved of management duties=
 in Andersen's Houston office.=20
A lawyer for Mr. Duncan, the Andersen partner who was fired yesterday, said=
 his client had done nothing wrong but was just following directives on doc=
ument retention and destruction that had been sent to Houston by a lawyer a=
t Andersen's Chicago headquarters on Oct. 12. Andersen says nothing in thos=
e directives would have justified Mr. Duncan's actions.=20
The directives encourage the destruction of documents that are not needed a=
s work papers to support an audit. They say that all documents should be re=
tained if there is a threat of litigation. But they do not say explicitly w=
hether that would apply when the S.E.C. has started an informal investigati=
on of a client, like Enron disclosed on Oct. 22, or even when the investiga=
tion has become a formal one, as Enron disclosed on Oct. 29. But lawyers no=
t involved in this case say it is clear that documents should be preserved =
after an accounting firm learns of an official investigation.=20
The case against Andersen regarding Waste Management was based almost entir=
ely on internal Andersen documents indicating that Andersen believed that W=
aste Management's accounting was improper but approved it anyway. Many of t=
hose documents need not have been maintained under the current Andersen pol=
icy.=20
The official listed as the author of Andersen's directives on document rete=
ntion was Robert V. Kutsenda, the firm's director of global risk management=
 when the directives were issued in February 2000, while the Waste Manageme=
nt investigation was under way. He retired from Andersen last year after th=
e S.E.C. said he had ''engaged in highly unreasonable conduct'' in the Wast=
e Management case. The S.E.C. barred him from auditing public companies for=
 a year.=20
Andersen said yesterday that Mr. Duncan had directed ''the deletion of thou=
sands of e-mails and the rushed disposal of large numbers of paper document=
s.'' It said the ''activities were on such a scale as to remove any doubt t=
hat Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated.''=20
But if it was that clear that Andersen's policies were being violated, it d=
oes not appear that any of the Houston personnel involved in the activities=
 complained to their superiors at the Chicago headquarters. Mr. Berardino s=
aid yesterday that he did not hear anything about the document destruction =
until Jan. 3.=20
That could indicate that to some at Andersen, the lesson learned from the W=
aste Management case was not the lesson that the S.E.C. wanted to send -- t=
hat auditors run great risks if they sign off on accounts they know to be w=
rong. Instead, they may have concluded that the error was in keeping the do=
cuments around for the S.E.C. to subpoena them later.=20
The services of an accounting firm are of no use to a company if investors =
will not trust the auditor's report. That is clearly a risk Andersen faces,=
 even if it manages to avoid charges.=20
But Andersen may be helped by the fact that there are now only five major a=
ccounting firms, a number reduced from eight by mergers in recent years. Th=
e companies that hire auditors do not want to see even less competition.=20
For most companies that report on a calendar-year basis, audits for 2001 ar=
e under way, and changing an auditor would be extremely difficult. But chan=
ging after that audit is completed would be far easier. It is then that it =
may become clear how badly Andersen has been damaged.

Andersen Dismisses Lead Enron Auditor; Partner Said to Lead Document Shredd=

Accounting giant Arthur Andersen yesterday fired the partner who ran its au=
dits of Enron Corp., saying he had directed a "rushed" destruction of docum=
ents after learning that federal regulators were beginning to look into Enr=
on's books.=20
The document destruction didn't stop, Andersen said, until the partner's as=
sistant sent a "stop the shredding" e-mail in November, the day after Ander=
sen received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The big accounting firm also placed three other partners on administrative =
leave and demoted four managers in its Houston office, where Enron and its =
auditors are based. "The message we're delivering today -- highly unusual -=
- is we are not going to tolerate anything less than the highest standards,=
" Andersen chief executive Joseph F. Berardino said in an interview.=20
The dismissal of David B. Duncan came less than a week after the accounting=
 firm disclosed that thousands of e-mails and a large number of paper docum=
ents related to the Enron audit had been destroyed. "These activities were =
on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's=
 policies and reasonable good judgment were violated," Andersen said.=20
Andersen has not described the content of the lost records. The firm said t=
he shredding was undertaken "without any consultation with others in the fi=
rm and at a time when the [Enron] engagement team should have had serious q=
uestions about their actions."=20
Enron's collapse is being investigated by the Justice Department, the SEC a=
nd several congressional committees, and the revelations of document destru=
ction have fueled questions about Andersen's role as well.=20
Enron, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December and whose stock wa=
s dropped by the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, disclosed in November t=
hat it had overstated its annual profits by nearly $600 million and had imp=
roperly kept more than $1 billion in debt off its books since 1997. Anderse=
n had endorsed Enron's financial statements.=20
Duncan, the fired partner at Andersen, met Monday with lawyers from the Jus=
tice Department and the SEC, according to sources close to the probe. Dunca=
n, who reported to executives in Houston and at Andersen's Chicago headquar=
ters, is scheduled to meet with House Energy and Commerce Committee investi=
gators today.=20
"Mr. Duncan is cooperating with all investigations of this matter. He prope=
rly followed the instructions of an Andersen in-house lawyer in handling do=
cuments," said a lawyer for Sullivan and Cromwell, which is representing Du=
ncan. He declined to say what information was contained in the documents an=
d e-mails but stressed that work papers from the audit were not destroyed.=
=20
Work papers document the final conclusions auditors reach, among other thin=
gs. They would not necessarily include many records of potential use to inv=
estigators, such as notes, early drafts of papers, client records, messages=
 between auditors or correspondence with clients.=20
Andersen policy generally calls for work papers to be kept for six years, a=
nd it prohibits the destruction of any "related information" in cases of "t=
hreatened litigation."=20
Under federal law, it is a felony to "corruptly" persuade another person to=
 destroy records with an intent to impair their "availability for use in an=
 official proceeding." The law says the proceeding "need not be pending or =
about to be instituted at the time of the offense."=20
As Andersen's problems multiplied, more details came to light about the all=
egations that an Enron insider made about the company's financial practices=
 last summer.=20
The full text of the letter Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay received in Augus=
t from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, warning that the company might=
 "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," was released yesterday by the =
House committee. Separately, Robert S. Bennett, a Washington attorney for E=
nron, released the findings of an investigation of Watkins's charges by the=
 company's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins.=20
Her accusations are at the center of the probes of Enron, which are seeking=
 to determine whether company officials concealed a deteriorating financial=
 condition from investors and employees -- a charge Enron has denied. Watki=
ns did not sign the letter but then identified herself to Lay and met with =
him about her concerns.=20
In the letter, she alleged:=20
* Lay should choose someone other than Andersen and Vinson & Elkins to inve=
stigate her allegations because both were involved in approving some of the=
 transactions she complained about. Lay chose instead to have the company's=
 outside law firm conduct a limited investigation without "second-guessing"=
 the accounting practices.=20
* Other senior Enron executives challenged then-chief executive Jeffrey Ski=
lling about conflicts of interest in the operations of partnerships the ene=
rgy-trading company set up with its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=
 Jeffrey McMahon, then Enron's treasurer, was "highly vexed" about the conf=
licts, "complained mightily" and suggested a list of remedies.=20
* She knew that a lot of accountants, including Andersen, "have blessed the=
 accounting treatment [used by the partnerships in question]. None of that =
will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright l=
ight of day."=20
* Enron had failed to describe its partnership obligations adequately in it=
s financial statements. If the partnerships had been fully explained, inves=
tors would have seen that Enron was exposed to hundreds of millions of doll=
ars of potential losses.=20
"My 8 years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume, [and]=
 the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elab=
orate accounting hoax," Watkins wrote.=20
In Vinson & Elkins's Oct. 15 report on the letter's charges, the law firm s=
aid the disputed partnerships had been established with the approval of Enr=
on's board and its audit committee.=20
In its report, Vinson & Elkins said Enron and Andersen acknowledged that th=
e accounting treatment of the partnerships "is creative and aggressive" but=
 said that "no one has reason to believe it is inappropriate from a technic=
al standpoint."=20
After interviewing Andersen auditors, Vinson & Elkins reported that Anderse=
n "is comfortable" with the explanations provided to investors in Enron's f=
inancial statements. Vinson added that it was Enron's practice to give the =
law firm "a relatively short time" to review the key financial information =
that Enron was disclosing in those statements.=20
Under a "Bad Potential Cosmetics" heading, Vinson & Elkins said that partne=
rship transactions cited by Watkins "could be portrayed very poorly" in a n=
ewspaper expose{acute} or a lawsuit by shareholders. "It could be argued" t=
he transactions were questionable because Enron had underwritten the risks =
of partnership investors, the law firm said.=20
Vinson & Elkins concluded that the facts it found did not warrant "a furthe=
r widespread investigation" by independent lawyers and auditors.=20
Enron attorney Bennett said Lay was not aware of the issues Watkins raised =
until he received the memo. Lay had told his general counsel "to get to the=
 bottom" of Watkins's charges, Bennett said. "The notion that this was a wh=
itewash is not borne out. . . . It was mostly an appearance problem," he sa=
id.=20
The document destruction Andersen described yesterday makes its position in=
 civil litigation "close to indefensible," said John C. Coffee Jr., a law p=
rofessor at Columbia University. It is likely the firm will face "heavy lia=
bility," he said.=20
"Whether or not this is a crime, it's a colossal blunder," Coffee said.=20
The accounting firm has disclosed that Nancy Temple, a senior Andersen lawy=
er, had sent an Oct. 12 internal memo to remind the Enron audit team of the=
 firm's document retention and destruction policy.=20
In its statement yesterday, Andersen said Duncan called an "urgent meeting"=
 on Oct. 23 to organize the destruction of Enron-related records, soon afte=
r Duncan learned that the SEC had asked Enron for information about its acc=
ounting.=20
Andersen spokesman David Tabolt couldn't say yesterday why Temple did not a=
ct to preserve documents as soon as the firm learned of the SEC's inquiry O=
ct. 22. In its statement, Andersen said that "nothing in [her] Oct. 12 e-ma=
il . . . or so far as we know other conversations around that time, authori=
zed this activity."=20
"There is a lot we don't know about what people did and didn't do," Tabolt =
said in an interview.=20
As Andersen described the timing, the destruction of records continued afte=
r Enron disclosed on Oct. 31 that the SEC's preliminary inquiry had become =
a formal investigation.=20
In the interview, Berardino said he was not aware of any records being dest=
royed after Andersen received an SEC subpoena on Nov. 8. But he added that =
he could not rule out the possibility.=20
Duncan joined the company in 1981, became a partner in 1995 and was put in =
charge of the Enron account in 1997.=20
Andersen said it placed on administrative leave partners Thomas H. Bauer, D=
ebra A. Cash and Roger D. Willard and it relieved four others of management=
 responsibilities: D. Stephen Goddard Jr., Michael M. Lowther, Gary B. Gool=
sby and Michael C. Odom.=20

Scandals Put Andersen's Future at Risk; Enron Case Is Just Latest to Put De=

On Vault.com, graduating college seniors who have been offered jobs at acco=
unting giant Arthur Andersen ask plaintively into the ether whether they sh=
ould still go.=20
Some e-mail responders tout the company's history and tradition of excellen=
ce. Others volunteer that they're Andersen employees -- and say they're loo=
king to get out.
Several large Andersen clients, such as Marriott International Inc., say th=
ey remain committed to Andersen. But many others won't say, and the cities =
of Seattle and Chicago are reconsidering their longtime links to the firm, =
according to the Chicago Tribune.=20
The firm's admission that it destroyed subpoenaed documents from its audit =
of failed energy trader Enron Corp. is just the latest serious blow for the=
 89-year-old firm, founded by Arthur Andersen in 1913, which has prided its=
elf for decades on its stolid, Midwestern sense of propriety and diligent, =
rigid accounting standards.=20
University of Chicago accounting professor Roman L. Weil puts the company's=
 odds of survival at only "50-50." He said the company could end up being h=
arshly disciplined by the Securities and Exchange Commission; could be merg=
ed into another firm, perhaps one of the other Big Five accounting firms; o=
r could go bankrupt if scandal-averse clients turn tail and sever their tie=
s to the firm.=20
"Their future is at risk, and there are many factors for that," said Arthur=
 Bowman, editor of Atlanta-based Bowman's Accounting Reports. "The most obv=
ious is financial. Defending the company will be expensive, even if they do=
n't pay out a dime. There will be many, many lawsuits."=20
"Arthur is rolling in his grave as we speak," Bowman said. "This company, w=
ith its great history, its great legacy. People would have said it was the =
most arrogant firm in the business, but they wouldn't say that today."=20
Andersen is one of the the Washington region's largest corporate contributo=
rs to charities. Last year, it gave more than $1 million to local charities=
, and it permitted its employees to spend many hours engaged in volunteer w=
ork for nonprofit organizations.=20
Andersen employees here, in Texas and around the country have been devastat=
ed by the company's internal problems, Bowman said. The firm's partners, wh=
o have been earning on average about $500,000 a year, are expected to soon =
be asked to help foot the bill for the company's defense. They are facing d=
ifficult choices about whether to stay or leave.=20
Andersen announced yesterday that it would dismiss the lead partner on the =
Enron account and place three others on administrative leave. It also said =
it is putting new management in charge of the Houston office, where the aud=
iting and accounting work for the now-bankrupt energy firm was headquartere=
d.=20
Andersen said it would also take action against anyone found to have purpos=
efully deleted Enron-related e-mails or letters, as congressional investiga=
tors have alleged occurred. The firm said it is continuing to investigate t=
he matter, and other employees found to have been involved will also be fir=
ed.=20
"Based on our actions today, it should be perfectly clear that Andersen wil=
l not tolerate unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful viol=
ation of our policies," said Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partn=
er and chief executive.=20
Arthur Andersen had prospered through the 1990s, enjoying double-digit inco=
me growth annually through the 1990s. Its revenue rose from $3 billion in 1=
992 to $9.3 billion in 2001, fueled by the firm's entry into new lines of b=
usiness outside of its auditing. It now has 85,000 employees worldwide.=20
One source of income growth came from outsourcing. The firm took over the i=
nternal accounting functions within many companies, including Enron, allowi=
ng those firms to focus on their businesses and reduce their payrolls and e=
xpenses. It was an especially easy transition if Andersen was also already =
handling the firms' auditing work.=20
Also, about a decade ago, the firm's accounting arm began offering consulti=
ng services, including management advice and information technology assista=
nce, to some longtime clients -- a practice that later had dire consequence=
s on the management level as the firm's consulting wing vehemently proteste=
d the incursion into its home turf.=20
With that, the baby boomers who headed the firm's consulting and accounting=
 divisions, Jim Wadia and George Shaheen, began a divisive ground war among=
 themselves, in a dispute so extended that some observers at the time liken=
ed it to Vietnam. The consulting arm took the matter to an international ar=
bitrator to decide how best to split the two groups apart, resulting in a p=
rolonged bout of negative publicity about the leadership turmoil -- an unat=
tractive prospect for organizations that sold themselves on the basis of th=
eir management expertise.=20
"It was pretty ugly," Bowman recalled. "They hated each other. It affected =
their every breathing moment they were consumed by it."=20
The arbitrator partitioned the two firms into separate entities in July 200=
0. The accounting arm, which had hoped to receive a multibillion-dollar win=
dfall from the consulting arm for the value of the brand name, was disappoi=
nted to receive far less. Andersen Consulting dubbed itself Accenture, and =
Arthur Andersen, the accounting arm, now often drops the "Arthur."=20
Wadia resigned and then went to an international law firm called Linklaters=
 in October 2001; Shaheen went to Webvan, an online grocery that has since =
failed. Other prominent executives left soon afterward.=20
Last year, Andersen was forced to pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit brou=
ght by shareholders in the Sunbeam Corp. appliance company alleging that th=
e accounting firm signed off on a company audit that included fictitious pr=
ofits. On Monday, former Sunbeam chief executive Albert J. Dunlap, nickname=
d "Chainsaw Al" for his job-cutting enthusiasm, agreed to pay $15 million t=
o settle a similar lawsuit by shareholders.=20
Andersen similarly agreed to pay part of a $220 million class-action settle=
ment and a $7 million SEC fine in a case in which another of its clients, W=
aste Management Inc., overstated its income by more than $1 billion.=20
Andersen now finds itself in the position that it often warned its clients =
against risking. In a 1999 report, Andersen executives Andrew Flaig and Glo=
ria Chang told the firm's hospitality industry clients that they needed to =
be wary of financial reporting fraud, or what Flaig and Chang called "cooki=
ng the books."=20
The executives warned that "widespread publicity involving disclosure of fi=
nancial statement fraud is clear evidence of how damaging this is to a comp=
any."=20
They said that the resulting costs could include "precipitous drops in mark=
et value, . . . multiple shareholder lawsuits and damages material to the e=
ntities' financial statements, damaged employee morale and retention and ex=
tensive amounts of time diverted."=20
In the report, they urged their clients to be wary of these warning signs: =
"Inadequate leadership at the top, weak internal controls, autocratic senio=

Politics & Policy
Arthur Andersen May Lack Insurance To Cover Judgments

In dealing with lawsuits stemming from its actions as Enron Corp.'s outside=
 auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP likely won't be able to pass the bulk of any =
potential judgments against the big accounting firm on to insurance compani=
es because Andersen, in large part, serves as its own insurer.=20
Andersen already has been hit with shareholder lawsuits seeking class-actio=
n status in connection with its audits of the energy-trading firm, which fi=
led for bankruptcy-court protection late last year. Securities-law speciali=
sts said Andersen's ability to successfully fight the lawsuits took a hit y=
esterday with its announcement that it was firing its lead auditor on the E=
nron engagement, on the heels of its announcement last week of document des=
truction by certain employees.
The coverage available for litigation in cases like that of Enron would fal=
l under Andersen's errors-and-omissions liability coverage. It is unclear h=
ow much coverage Andersen purchased from insurance carriers. And like the o=
ther Big Five accounting firms, Andersen carries a large deductible, which =
means it is on the hook for smaller claims, said Leo Beus of Beus Gilbert P=
LLC, a Phoenix law firm, that has won several suits against the big account=
ing firms and in the process has become familiar with their insurance cover=
age.=20
For payments that exceed the coverage limits on its outside insurance, Ande=
rsen would tap into an insurance pool that it jointly funds with other big =
accounting firms, including some outside the U.S., according to Mr. Beus. T=
his pool, based in Bermuda, operates as an insurance company would, investi=
ng its assets and paying claims as needed.=20
An Andersen spokesman declined to comment about the firm's insurance covera=
ge.=20
Mark Cheffers, chief executive of AccountingMalpractice.com, which advises =
accounting firms on how to reduce liability risk, said the Big Five are sec=
retive about their insurance coverage because they don't want plaintiffs' a=
ttorneys to know how large a pool of money they maintain to pay judgments.=
=20
In a 1994 speech before a House subcommittee, J. Michael Cook, then-chairma=
n of Deloitte & Touche, said the big accounting firms "have virtually no ou=
tside insurance." He said the firms, due to tremendous growth of litigation=
 against them, "pooled our own risks."=20
Mr. Cheffers said it was unlikely that Andersen's insurance coverage -- inc=
luding the deductible and pooled portion -- for any single year would be gr=
eater than $300 million. "At the end of the day it's designed so it's large=
ly self insurance," Mr. Cheffers said.=20
Mr. Cheffers said plaintiffs' attorneys generally are hesitant to push any =
one firm into dire financial straits. "The one thing Andersen has going for=
 it is that the class-action attorneys recognize that they don't want to ki=
ll the goose, and that they can get more money out of Andersen in 10 years =
than in one."=20
For its part, Enron is expected to tap into $300 million in directors-and-o=
fficers liability coverage provided by several big insurance companies, as =
previously reported.

SEC, Accounting Firms Redrafting Audit Rules; Agency Chairman Draws Fire fo=

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and the accounti=
ng industry are scrambling to craft a new system for policing auditors in a=
n effort to shore up confidence in the financial reports of publicly traded=
 companies.=20
The new plan, which could be unveiled within days, is designed to head off =
criticism in the wake of the Enron Corp. fiasco that the current system of =
self-regulation does not work. The effort is being driven by Pitt, who face=
s complaints from some lawmakers that he should distance himself from the S=
EC's investigation.
Pitt represented the five major accounting firms as a private lawyer before=
 he was appointed by President Bush to take over the SEC on Aug. 4.=20
Sens. Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) and Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) have said Pitt's=
 previous ties to the industry should require him to declare a hands-off po=
licy. "I think Harvey Pitt has a high degree of integrity," said Corzine, a=
 former partner with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "But I do believe for appeara=
nce' sake . . . Pitt ought to do what Attorney General John Ashcroft has do=
ne and clearly step aside from the process."=20
But Pitt disagreed. "To talk about recusals at this point misperceives how =
this agency operates," he said in an interview.=20
Pitt said he has done and will continue to do his job in accordance with et=
hics rules, which forbid -- but with some exceptions -- the SEC chairman fr=
om taking any action concerning a former client for a year after taking off=
ice.=20
The SEC, which regulates financial markets, is also responsible for the ove=
rsight of accounting firms, which are supposed to certify that financial re=
cords give a fair portrait of a company's finances.=20
With the Enron collapse focusing criticism on accounting firms, the SEC is =
facing conflict-of-interest questions, not only because of Pitt's former ti=
es to the industry, but also because Bush's two nominations for vacant seat=
s on the five-member SEC come from big accounting firms.=20
Pitt yesterday would not comment on how he voted last fall, when the commis=
sion agreed to launch an investigation into the Enron affair. That investig=
ation is examining the role played by Enron officials and the company's out=
side auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
Pitt also would not specify what he would do if the SEC staff were to come =
before the commission again, at the conclusion of its investigation, with r=
ecommendations that actions be taken against companies or accounting firms.=
=20
"Enforcement inquiries are conducted by our staff and the SEC commissioners=
 do not have any involvement in the myriad decisions that our enforcement s=
taff will be called upon to make," Pitt said.=20
"It is not the function of the chairman of the SEC or any commissioner to m=
anage any investigations. If and when I am asked to do anything on this mat=
ter, I will follow both the letter and the spirit of the ethical requiremen=
ts of this office. Any suggestion that I would do otherwise is an attempt t=
o politicize the workings of an independent agency."=20
Pitt also would not comment on the negotiations he is having with the top f=
ive accounting firms and the industry trade group, the American Institute o=
f Certified Public Accountants -- all of them former clients -- on how to r=
evamp oversight of the profession. An SEC spokesman said those discussions =
are permitted by ethics rules and are appropriate.=20
Industry sources said that talk about a regulatory overhaul, a topic that h=
as been kicked around for years, was given new impetus after Enron's failur=
e. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 after being forced to restate earnings=
. The industry wants to unveil its proposal before Congress reconvenes next=
 Wednesday and begins hearings into what caused the energy company's proble=
ms, sources said.=20
The new framework would create a private-sector regulatory organization, si=
milar to those that the SEC now permits the securities markets to use to di=
scipline members and establish guidelines for what is accepted and unaccept=
able behavior, industry sources said.=20
But the organization would not be controlled by accounting firms, the sourc=
es said, because it would be governed by boards whose members would come la=
rgely from outside the accounting industry. Accounting industry officials a=
cknowledge that the reforms may not go far enough to quell criticism from c=
onsumer groups and some lawmakers, who say self-regulation is at the root o=
f the accounting profession's problems.=20
The five major accounting firms declined to comment on the proposal.=20
The major accounting firms, in the past, have fought such a proposal, insis=
ting that the current system, which includes industry self-regulating group=
s and state licensing boards, are sufficient. But in missing seemingly egre=
gious misstatements and incorrect reports at Enron, the Arthur Andersen tea=
m raised anew questions about how well the nation's system of private accou=
ntants, paid by their audit clients, serves the nation's investors.=20
The federal government gave the accounting industry the valuable franchise =
to audit companies that sell shares to the public after the stock market cr=
ash of 1929. In return, auditors are supposed to serve the public interest,=
 and maintain independence from their clients.=20
"The true client is society in an audit -- yet the client that is paying yo=
ur fee is the corporation," said Stephen Loeb, professor of accounting and =
business ethics at the University of Maryland. With this system, "you have =
a conflict of interest. It's always going to be there," he said.=20
In addition, many accounting firms earn large sums by selling consulting se=
rvices to their clients. For instance, Andersen was paid $52 million last y=
ear by Enron -- $25 million for auditing and $27 million for consulting ser=
vices.=20
Accountants argue that they are professionals who can and do stand up to th=
eir clients when that is necessary. And, they add, ultimately their livelih=
ood depends on retaining the public's trust. Otherwise, they say, audits wo=
uld lose their value.=20
That, though, is exactly what is happening, some critics charge.=20
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the SEC during the Clinton administration, p=
roposed prohibiting accounting firms from selling certain consulting servic=
es to corporations whose books they audit in 2000. But that proposal was be=
aten back by the accounting industry and was opposed by several members of =
Congress.=20
In addition, generally accepted accounting principles, the rules that accou=
ntants must follow in auditing public companies, allow considerable flexibi=
lity in evaluating what a business has done. Some lawmakers question whethe=
r those rules give accounting firms too much latitude.=20
"Does the Enron debacle (and cases like it) rest on activity that is allowa=
ble under generally accepted accounting principles and standards, or that c=
onstitutes clear violations of those principles and standards, or some comb=
ination thereof?" Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking minority member o=
f the House Commerce Committee, asked the SEC last month.=20
Auditing problems are not new. The late 1990s saw a wave of "restatements,"=
 in which many major companies, including Rite-Aid Corp., Sunbeam Corp., Wa=
ste Management Inc. and Cendant Corp., were forced to admit that profits re=
ported earlier had been vastly overstated.=20
Some cases involved fraud, which auditors said they are ill-prepared to det=
ect. Critics have said that auditors should do more extensive checks of con=
tracts, deliveries and other aspects of a company's operation. But accounta=
nts warn that would make routine audits far more expensive. They say that i=
n fierce competition for clients, the lowest cost auditor often wins.

O'Neill says US derivatives rules may need modernising in wake of Enron cas=

AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said US derivatives regu=
lations may need modernising, in the wake of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp.=
=20
"In this case, I think it's fair to say it may be that our rules and regula=
tions have gotten behind practices," O'Neill said in an interview on the PB=
S Charlie Rose program.
At heart of the Enron bankruptcy was the firm's dealing with derivatives tr=
ading, he explained, which "got away from them."=20
Derivatives that are four to five levels deep from the original product the=
y are based on are extremely complex, he said, and the laws and regulations=
 addressing information disclosure need to be modernised.=20
A second factor is that some of Enron's actions possibly "didn't pass muste=
r when they're held up against what the law required" under existing rules,=
 he added. To the extent that anybody broke the law, "they should go to jai=
l."=20
O'Neill also said he would not have made the call former Treasury Secretary=
 Robert Rubin made to a senior current Treasury official concerning interve=
ntion with credit rating agencies and Enron's banks.=20
According to the Treasury, Rubin called Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fishe=
r and brought up the possibility of Fisher calling the ratings agencies and=
 encouraging them to work with Enron's banks to avoid a credit downgrade.=
=20
O'Neill said it was up to Rubin to decide whether the call was appropriate,=
 but that he would not have made such a call.=20
Separately, O'Neill said he believes he has 100 pct backing in his position=
 from President George Bush, in face of criticism from politicians and the =
media on his job performance.=20
Regarding the US economy, O'Neill said the US has now "put in place the con=
ditions that in a reasonably quick period of time will restore growth" to 3=
.0-3.5 pct.=20
Europe and Japan need to do the same, he said, to ensure the world's three =
major economies are driving global development.=20
Asked about Argentina's crisis, the Treasury Secretary said Bush told him "=
the concept here is friendly amigo," with the US offering technical and pol=
icy advice to the new government, to help it establish a program that can r=
estore growth.=20
However, he drew a distinction between Argentina and Mexico, which in 1995 =
received a multi-billion dollar bailout from the previous Clinton administr=
ation.=20
In the Mexican situation, US aid was collateralised with Mexican oil revenu=
es.=20
In Argentina's case, however, "they don't have anything left to collaterali=
se," he said.=20
O'Neill also said the US only "reluctantly went along with the notion at th=
e IMF that they should be given one more chance," last August, when the IMF=
 boosted its loan program for Argentina by 8.0 bln usd.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE DONATIONS
Enron's Ties to a Leader of House Republicans Went Beyond Contributions to =
His Campaign
By ALISON MITCHELL

01/16/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- It is well known that the Enron Corporation lavished=
 money and attention on political figures all over the nation's capital. Bu=
t for an insight into how carefully the company cultivated members of Congr=
ess, look no further than its efforts to please its home state powerhouse, =
Representative Tom DeLay.=20
Like other members of the Texas delegation, Mr. DeLay, a Republican whose d=
istrict is in the Houston suburbs near Enron's headquarters, received sizab=
le personal campaign donations from Enron -- $28,900 since 1989, according =
to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Yet Mr. DeLay, the House majority whip, is not just another lawmaker. The d=
onations were only a starting point.=20
Enron used as lobbyists two influential members of Mr. DeLay's informal kit=
chen cabinet, Ed Buckham and Karl Gallant.=20
Mr. Buckham, a former chief of staff for Mr. DeLay, has worked closely on s=
trategy with Mr. DeLay's political action committee, Americans for a Republ=
ican Majority. And Mr. Gallant, who once served as that committee's directo=
r, went on to run the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group widely =
considered close to Mr. DeLay, whose allies once hoped that the issues comm=
ittee would serve as a counterweight to unions by financing get-out-the-vot=
e efforts for conservative candidates.=20
Records also show that Enron and its executives made sizable donations to e=
ach of the groups. The 2000 disclosure statement for Mr. Gallant's committe=
e includes a $50,000 contribution from Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, an=
d a $25,000 contribution from Joseph W. Sutton, a vice chairman of Enron wh=
o left the company in November. Before that year, disclosure was not requir=
ed for gifts to issues groups.=20
Americans for a Republican Majority received a $10,000 corporate contributi=
on from Enron in 2000 for its unregulated ''soft money'' account. And accor=
ding to the Center for Responsive Politics, the group also received $47,250=
 in regulated contributions in 1995 through 2000 from Enron, its political =
action committee or individuals tied to the company.=20
Mr. DeLay's spokesman, Stuart Roy, said there was nothing unusual about Mr.=
 DeLay's relationship with Enron. He described the company as ''an equal-op=
portunity political donor and an equal-opportunity employer, as well, hirin=
g lobbyists who were both Republicans and Democrats and giving money to bot=
h sides, including a third of House Democrats and half of the Senate Democr=
ats.''=20
Mr. Gallant said he would not discuss his dealings with Enron, citing a con=
fidentiality clause in his contract. Mr. Buckham did not return a phone cal=
l, and an aide said he would be unavailable until later this month.=20
Mr. DeLay has been unabashed about demanding that business support Republic=
ans, whom he considers commerce's natural ally. Aides said he froze Enron o=
ut of his office for some of the past year because it had hired Linda Robin=
son, a Democrat who was a senior Treasury official in the Clinton administr=
ation, to run its Washington office.=20
Mr. DeLay has previously urged lobbying firms and trade associations to ins=
tall more Republicans in executive positions. Indeed, the House Ethics Comm=
ittee wrote a warning, but took no official action, after he tried to persu=
ade a lobbying group not to hire a Democrat as its president in 1998.=20
Still, whatever the tensions last year, Mr. Delay and Enron had a natural a=
lliance. In his days in the Texas Capitol, Mr. DeLay was called Dereg by so=
me because of his support of business. And in Congress he has been a longti=
me proponent of energy deregulation, an issue dear to Enron.=20
Moreover, last year he was the chief Republican strategist who pushed throu=
gh the House energy legislation that was favored by Enron and many other en=
ergy companies. Three years ago, when Enron lost out to a Japanese company =
in bidding to build a power plant in the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana I=
slands, a United States territory in the Pacific, Mr. DeLay asked for the b=
idding to be reopened.=20
In some ways, Mr. DeLay's support for Enron was a matter of constituent ser=
vice. Mr. Roy said that Enron's success had always been important to Mr. De=
Lay because of the hundreds of people the company employed in his Congressi=
onal district and the thousands of others in nearby Houston.=20
''Obviously, DeLay would not be doing his job if he were not trying to help=
 job creation by a major company in Houston,'' Mr. Roy said.=20
He said Mr. DeLay had never asked that the company hire his former aides as=
 lobbyists.=20
It is also the case that Enron cultivated the other side of the aisle. For =
example, Michael Lewan, a former chief of staff to Senator Joseph I. Lieber=
man, the Connecticut Democrat who is running one investigation into the com=
pany's collapse, worked for Enron for a time, a spokesman for Mr. Lieberman=
 confirmed. The spokesman, Dan Gerstein, said Mr. Lewan, who remains a poli=
tical adviser to Mr. Lieberman, had severed his ties to the company.=20
Enron officials in Washington referred questions to a company official in H=
ouston who did not return a call.=20
Having a lobbyist who is close to a lawmaker can help a company get attenti=
on. In 1999 Mr. Buckham told Mr. DeLay that the Japanese company had succes=
sfully bid to build the power plant in the Northern Marianas. Mr. DeLay wro=
te his letter asking that the bidding be reopened.=20
Mr. Roy said there had been rumors at the time that some bidders had been l=
ocked out of the competition. He said Mr. DeLay's letter did not advocate o=
n behalf of Enron, but for ''a fair and open bidding system.'' Mr. Roy said=
 he did not know who won the final contract.=20
A former aide to Mr. DeLay who did not want to be identified said of Enron,=
 ''They certainly through Ed Buckham got more attention than people who did=
n't have Ed Buckham.''=20
After Enron hired Ms. Robertson for its Washington office in late 2000, rel=
ations with Mr. DeLay became more distant. ''Relations were chilly all last=
 year,'' Mr. Roy said.=20
But as the member of the House Republican leadership shepherding Mr. Bush's=
 program through the House, Mr. DeLay pulled off a stunning upset and built=
 a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to pass energy legislation sought=
 by many companies, including Enron.=20
Mr. Roy said Mr. DeLay had received no warnings that Enron was in deep fina=
ncial trouble. With many of the hard-pressed Enron employees in his distric=
t, Mr. DeLay called the situation ''heartbreaking'' in an interview with a =
Houston television station this week and said his goal now was to find out =
whether there had been criminal wrongdoing by the company.

Hooley and Blumenauer return Enron cash

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Reps. Darlene Hooley and Earl Blumenauer, both Oregon De=
mocrats, became the latest politicians to return campaign contributions fro=
m Enron, the failed energy giant.=20
Enron went bankrupt Dec. 2 after disclosing that its faulty accounting prac=
tices concealed huge losses. Top executives sold millions of dollars of sto=
ck before the collapse, but many employees were barred from selling shares =
held in their company 401(k) plans.
"The news over the past several weeks of the financial collapse of Enron ha=
s been devastating for individuals and families throughout the United State=
s," Hooley wrote to Enron CEO Kenneth Lay on Dec. 21, enclosing a check for=
 the $1,000 the company's political action committee had sent her.=20
"They, like most Americans, are not analysts and experts in the field of fi=
nancial investment," Hooley continued. "They believed in your company's fin=
ancial projections. They believed you and your board of directors."=20
Enron was widely noted for its political influence. Since its demise, sever=
al politicians from around the country, including Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore,=
 have returned or donated contributions.=20
Upon hearing of the company's bankruptcy filing and realizing she had gotte=
n money from its PAC, Hooley initially tried to send the money to employees=
 who have sued the company, said her chief of staff, Joan Mooney.=20
But taxes would have eaten up more than half of the donation, and the payof=
f to individual employees or investors would have been negligible.=20
Blumenauer announced Wednesday that he is donating $2,200 in campaign donat=
ions made by Enron's PAC to a private nonprofit group that is retraining la=
id-off Enron employees.=20
"I am pleased to give the money from Enron's corporate PAC to a good cause,=
 especially when so many Oregonians have been hurt by the company's collaps=
e," Blumenauer said in a statement.=20
Blumenauer also got contributions from people employed by companies bought =
out by Enron, including Portland General Electric.=20
The congressman said he is not returning those donations because they were =
made by longtime supporters and personal friends.

The Essentials Of a Washington Scandal; Enron Has Possibility. But Somethin=

It's still early, but, yes, it's possible. If everything goes to form, and =
everyone executes according to the playbook, this one could go all the way:=
 The collapse of Enron Corp. could turn out to be another Incomprehensible =
Washington Scandal.=20
An IWS is one of those events that, like Halley's comet, periodically light=
s up the sky. It fascinates some and disappoints others -- but it mostly ba=
ffles everyone else.
In the beginning, you understand the basic plot of an IWS. Somebody in high=
 office allegedly did something he wasn't supposed to do. But soon the leak=
ed memos start colliding with the press conferences, which pile into the tr=
anscripts and the congressional hearings. Lawyers and spokesmen materialize=
.=20
Soon, you've lost it. The simple story becomes so barnacled with facts and =
accusations, so encumbered with major and minor players, that the core is n=
o longer recognizable. You struggle to keep pace, but it's not long before =
you're being lapped by the field.=20
By definition, an IWS is so convoluted that it is understood only by partic=
ipants, partisans, lawyers and a few very nerdy journalists -- all of whom =
are paid to pay attention anyway. An IWS involves allegations about things =
that might have been said, on dates that are in dispute, by people who may =
or may not have had the legal authority to do what they (allegedly) did. Al=
l IWSes inspire congressional hearings, although early in the process the h=
earings take place before panels with names like the House Subcommittee on =
Intra-government Affairs, Federal Rules and Oversight Operations Management=
.=20
A new IWS erupts about once every 18 months, give or take, which means Enro=
n's timing could be just about perfect. IWSes rarely overlap, the media and=
 political classes' endurance being what it is. The Asian Fundraising Scand=
al followed Filegate, which followed Travel Officegate, which followed Whit=
ewater, which followed the House Post Office Scandal, which followed the HU=
D Debacle, which followed the Savings & Loan Scandals, which followed Iran-=
contra. And so on back to Teapot Dome.=20
What with its destroyed documents, suspect accounting reports and eye-glazi=
ng concepts like "off-balance sheet partnerships," Enron is halfway to clas=
sic IWS status. Almost every IWS involves money, but not money alone. It al=
so needs some Byzantine connection (or plausibly imputed connection) to som=
e kind of official influence-peddling. This distinguishes an IWS from a Sim=
ple Washington Scandal (SWS), which is usually about sex, and therefore not=
 especially perplexing (everyone understands sex, or thinks they do).=20
So: Wilbur Mills's fling with stripper Fanne Fox was an SWS, as was Gary Ha=
rt's friendship with Donna Rice, as were Bill Clinton's problems with Paula=
 Jones and Monica Lewinsky. Bob Packwood's personnel-management techniques =
were an SWS, as were Clarence Thomas's movie preferences. Gary Condit's rel=
ationship with Chandra Levy was an SWS, but with an asterisk: It involved s=
ex and the suspicion of violence.=20
Perhaps the easiest way to tell a bona fide IWS from an SWS is by the media=
 that cover it. CNN, the New York Times and The Washington Post take on bot=
h kinds (although they are much later to an SWS than an IWS). The National =
Enquirer and the Star were all over Lewinsky et al., but don't expect to re=
ad much about "off-balance sheet partnerships" in them.=20
Further, there are few, if any, telegenic props associated with an IWS. The=
re is never a stained dress or a yacht called Monkey Business. There are, m=
ostly, memos.=20
We'll know for sure when Enron has become a full-blown IWS when it achieves=
 the following milestones of every true IWS:=20
* A catchy name. All IWSes require a spiffy nickname. So far, Enron hasn't =
gotten there, but there have been some rudimentary attempts.=20
The media continues to shorthand Enron as "the biggest corporate bankruptcy=
 in U.S. history," which is accurate, but hardly headline-ready.=20
New York Times columnist William Safire, pointing to the failings of accoun=
ting firm Arthur Andersen, dubbed this aspect of the story "Andersen-gate,"=
 "-gate" being the predictable suffix for every IWS and SWS since Water-.=
=20
The Democratic National Committee last week was floating "Enron-omics" as a=
 way to disparage the Bush Administration's tax and budget initiatives. Ala=
s, this falls short, too, if you're trying to gin up an IWS. The "-omics" s=
uffix ("Reaganomics") merely suggests a style of policy, not corruption. If=
 it turns out someone illegally cut corners, maybe this one will become kno=
wn as "End-ron."=20
* Buzzwords. No IWS is fully realized until certain legal and quasi-legal p=
hrases start flying: "subpoena," "grand jury," "special counsel," "nolo con=
tendre." We're not there yet. All we've been able to muster so far are the =
hoary soporifics of every two-bit D.C. dispute: "conflict of interest," "ap=
pearance of a conflict of interest," and the unlovely "suggestion of the ap=
pearance of a conflict of interest."=20
* Regrettable catchphrases. One of the great subsidiary values of an IWS is=
 that it sometimes throws off a preposterous or startling catchphrase. Agai=
n, Enron is not fully developed enough to generate entries into the rhetori=
cal pantheon that includes "I'm not a potted plant," "No controlling legal =
authority," and the ultimate: "I am not a crook."=20
* The Lawyer as Character. Count on the media to elevate some unglamorous, =
balding guy in a baggy gray suit to the status of Righteous Crusader for Ju=
stice, or at least Colorful Rogue during a long-running IWS. Brendan Sulliv=
an got there during Iran-Contra. David Boies made it during the Microsoft a=
ntitrust trial (technically, not an IWS, but very close). No sightings on E=
nron yet.=20
* The Dragon Lady. Even the dreariest IWS eventually coughs up one or two s=
emi-glamorous women to enliven the proceedings. The woman in question may b=
e a key player, or she may hold a minor role. Doesn't matter. Either way, s=
he's bound to look good next to all the balding lawyers in baggy gray suits=
. Remember Fawn Hall, Deborah Gore Dean, Susan McDougal and Mo Dean?=20
* The Non-Denouement. Quick: What was the result of every IWS of the past 1=
5 years? Surely, after all those special prosecutors, all that media covera=
ge, all that distracting government focus, there was some outcome. Wasn't t=
here?

The fast developing Enron story has now reached Washington scandal status.=
=20
Adding to the frenzy, some Democratic leaders sound as though they regret t=
he demise of the independent counsel legislation, something most of them ap=
plauded when it happened in 1999. If that legislation had not expired, thes=
e critics would have been able to demand that the Bush administration reque=
st an independent counsel and then make political hay when the administrati=
on refused. This would have been reminiscent of the Republican onslaught ag=
ainst Atty. Gen. Janet Reno for refusing to request an independent counsel =
to investigate charges of campaign financing misdeeds in the 1996 Clinton c=
ampaign.
Instead, the critics can only call for the Justice Department to appoint a =
special counsel. Yet on the basis of the facts known so far, this would be =
wrongheaded and inconsistent, nothing more than a return to the familiar pa=
rtisan political game of "gotcha!"=20
Enron's collapse may indeed justify investigations by Congress, the Securit=
ies and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, all of which are un=
derway.=20
The attorney general and his chief of staff have properly recused themselve=
s because of political contributions made by Enron, and a special Justice t=
ask force has been created to conduct the investigation.=20
There appears to be no reason that the professional prosecutors on this tas=
k force cannot be trusted to be objective and thorough.=20
Then what was the necessity for past independent counsels, which Congress l=
egislated after the Watergate scandal?=20
That legislation never was intended to replace the Justice Department as th=
e official law enforcement arm of the federal government; Congress could no=
t constitutionally do this. Rather, the independent counsel legislation was=
 aimed at the rare circumstance in which an attorney general would be faced=
 with a serious conflict of interest in having to investigate substantial a=
nd credible criminal charges against the president or a high Cabinet offici=
al.=20
In Watergate, exactly such a conflict existed for Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Rich=
ardson when criminal charges were pending against President Nixon's top sta=
ff and former Cabinet members, charges that implicated the president. At th=
e time, Richardson appointed a regulatory special prosecutor, Harvard law p=
rofessor Archibald Cox. Only after Nixon fired Cox did the Senate Watergate=
 Committee conclude that new legislation was needed.=20
I believe this legislation worked well from 1978 to the mid-1980s. It was u=
sed sparingly and had the confidence of the public. But beginning with the =
Iran-Contra investigation and through the numerous investigations involving=
 the Clinton administration, it was overused. It became publicly and politi=
cally unpopular and so was not reenacted by Congress.=20
So far, nothing made public about Enron would have justified the appointmen=
t of an independent counsel. There are no charges that President Bush, Vice=
 President Dick Cheney or any member of the Cabinet had complicity in Enron=
's financial failure. Yes, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was a major financ=
ial supporter of Bush and thus had access to the president and Cabinet memb=
ers. But such access has always been an inherent feature of the American po=
litical system. With no evidence of improper favors, it is at most an impro=
priety. The remedy is campaign financing reform.=20
The administration has disclosed that in October, just as Enron was going u=
nder, Lay contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secreta=
ry Don Evans and may have asked for help in protecting Enron's credit ratin=
g. But it seems that no such help was given. Apparently, the administration=
 did nothing to prevent the company's financial failure and the resulting l=
osses to shareholders and employees. It is not clear what the administratio=
n could have done, even in October. But if anyone in the administration had=
 intervened to save Enron, the critics would now be making even more seriou=
s allegations. The investigations should go forward without a supplemental =
independent investigator. With regard to possible criminal charges, the Jus=
tice task force should conduct an aggressive investigation. The accounting =
practices used to falsely report huge profits, misleading investors and emp=
loyees, need to be exposed and those responsible made accountable.=20
The congressional and SEC investigations must thoroughly examine the role o=
f corporate directors, auditors and large accounting firms to determine whe=
ther outside audits are truly independent.=20
Tragic as it is to so many investors and employees, Enron's failure could s=
erve as a wake-up call for American politics and business.

Washington -- narcissistic and even solipsistic, as usual -- thinks Enron's=
 collapse is primarily a Washington, meaning a political, story. Actually, =
the debacle is, so far, primarily a tale of two other cities. Houston is En=
ron's hometown. New York is the center of the financial system that Arthur =
Andersen is supposed to serve. Andersen is the document-destroying accounti=
ng firm that failed -- assuming, generously, that it tried -- to report acc=
urately Enron's activities.=20
However, Washington will star in subsequent acts of this drama that may liv=
e on, in litigation, longer than anyone reading this column. Events since S=
ept. 11 have confirmed Randolph Bourne's 1918 axiom that "war is the health=
 of the state." Enron's collapse is a reminder that economic scandal, too, =
causes the state to wax.
It will remind everyone -- some conservatives, painfully -- that a mature c=
apitalist economy is a government project. A properly functioning free mark=
et system does not spring spontaneously from society's soil as dandelions s=
pring from suburban lawns. Rather, it is a complex creation of laws and mor=
es that guarantee, among much else, transparency, meaning a sufficient stre=
am -- torrent, really -- of reliable information about the condition and co=
nduct of corporations.=20
Always necessary to economic health, transparency has increasingly become c=
rucial to civic health because of the changed demographics of stock ownersh=
ip. A nation in which a majority of households own equities is neurological=
ly wired to the stock market. Hence corporate corruption quickly begets pol=
itical demoralization and cynicism.=20
Off and on over the years, a few capitalists have done more to delegitimize=
 capitalism than America's impotent socialist critics ever did or today's m=
oribund left could hope to. It is the Republicans' special responsibility t=
o punish such capitalists.=20
Democrats are properly put on the defensive by corruption in organized labo=
r and the ditziness of the cultural left. Similarly, Republicans, beginning=
 with their post-Civil War entanglement with corporate America (tariffs and=
 all that), have had a special responsibility to police business outlaws.=
=20
Fortunately, those in the Bush administration who were approached on Enron'=
s behalf evidently did exactly what government should do for fools and clev=
er knaves who are ruining a corporation: nothing. But now there are things =
to be done.=20
Indignation is a precondition for whatever new laws and regulations are req=
uired to prevent behavior such as Enron's. It has been said that the absenc=
e of honest emotion is the shared characteristic of American politics and p=
rofessional wrestling. One would like to hear from President Bush, regardin=
g Enron's executives, the sort of anger he expressed over the possibility t=
hat the crybaby Secret Service agent whose behavior caused an American Airl=
ines pilot to bar him from a flight might have been a victim of illegitimat=
e profiling.=20
Instead, we have heard Bush's slippery -- Clintonian, actually -- assertion=
 that Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, "was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1=
994" for governor. Well, yes, but no. Lay contributed to Richards. And he c=
ontributed much more to Bush.=20
When the president finds his proper voice, he should say:=20
Arthur Andersen was both accountant and consultant for Enron. The resulting=
 relationship reeked of conflict of interest, and surely helped produce Enr=
on account books that should be filed under "fiction." Enron never reported=
 even a bad quarter before collapsing. Consulting by accounting firms shoul=
d be proscribed. And what is the point of "peer reviews" by the big account=
ing firms of one another's work if they do not discern an approaching train=
 wreck such as Enron's?=20
A few senior Enron executives sold their Enron stock when they realized the=
y were steering their ship onto the rocks. In some crucial final days, empl=
oyees, locked in steerage like the lower orders on the Titanic, were blocke=
d from selling the Enron stock that comprised, on average, 62 percent of em=
ployees' 401(k) holdings. (At 120 large corporations, employees' 401(k) pla=
ns have at least one-third of their value in their employers' stocks.) If i=
nsider trading and other laws do not proscribe such things, they should.=20
Amid the debris of Enron, the functions and liabilities of boards of direct=
ors need fresh scrutiny. Many boards have proved themselves unwilling (ther=
e are myriad forms of coziness between corporations and their directors) or=
 unable to stop the most scandalous practices regarding senior executives' =
compensation, practices not easily distinguishable from the looting of shar=
eholders' wealth. Let us have, at a minimum, congressional hearings that em=
barrass the looters, if they are capable of embarrassment.=20
Now Washington takes center stage. By casting a cool eye on Enron's debris =
and those who made it, government can strengthen an economic system that de=

Media Split on Import of Enron

Judging by the sudden media explosion, the Enron saga is a high-octane poli=
tical scandal of the first order.=20
Or, some journalists say, it's a badly hyped bit of Beltway intrigue that w=
ill run out of gas because the Bush White House did nothing wrong.
A senior administration official blames the coverage on "a bunch of scandal=
-thirsty reporters who are dying to hit the bottle, even though it's not al=
coholic."=20
In the days since the White House revealed that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay calle=
d two Cabinet officers shortly before his energy-trading company collapsed =
in the largest bankruptcy in American history, the press has jumped on the =
story with Whitewater-like intensity. But since the administration refused =
to help Lay, a long time friend and financial backer of President Bush, the=
 coverage has an almost schizophrenic quality.=20
Jonah Goldberg, editor of National Review Online, sees journalists firing a=
t their favorite targets.=20
"Bush has gotten a really good ride out of the press during the war for a l=
ong time, and rightly so," he says. "All of a sudden there's this huge stor=
y that Democrats, for reasons good and ill, are trying to make hay out of. =
You can see the press saying we have to go back to our muckraker roots and =
get to the bottom of it. It's natural for the press to want to show that bu=
siness is evil."=20
But Robert Scheer, a Los Angeles Times columnist who has called Enron a "ca=
ncer on the presidency," maintains the press has gone soft. "Journalists sh=
ould be asking the question 'What did you know and when did you know it?' "=
 he says. Scheer argues that "the media backed off" on White House coverage=
 after Sept. 11 and have been "cheerleading" for Bush.=20
This philosophical split is reflected in the news reports. "The rapidly exp=
loding Enron inquiry presents all the elements of earlier Washington scanda=
ls," the New York Times said Friday, "including carefully phrased denials a=
nd accusations of improper influence."=20
The Washington Post took a similar tack: "It's too soon to say whether Enro=
n Corp.'s spectacular collapse will become a bona fide Washington scandal, =
but the classic elements suddenly burst into view yesterday -- disclosures =
of destroyed documents, White House phone calls from a big political contri=
butor, an attorney general's recusal and damage control efforts by the pres=
ident."=20
But the Washington Times cast Bush as a reformer, relegating the White Hous=
e calls to the eighth paragraph: "President Bush yesterday decried the 'awf=
ul bankruptcy' of Enron Corp. and ordered a review of pension disclosure la=
ws to help protect the life savings of workers at other troubled firms." An=
d USA Today went with the headline: "Bush Seeks Review of 401(k) Law."=20
"I couldn't find anything improper or illegal in Enron officials calling Ca=
binet secretaries," says Washington Times correspondent Bill Sammon. "I'm n=
ot going to join people who are throwing around a lot of innuendo and insin=
uation. . . . Of course the White House was defensive, in response to accus=
atory questions from the press."=20
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer faults The Post for including "disclosu=
res of destroyed documents" in the article's first sentence before explaini=
ng that the papers were shredded by auditor Arthur Andersen & Co. "The velo=
city with which this story has taken off in the minds of the Washington pre=
ss corps is way ahead of the pace of the facts," Fleischer says.=20
Conservatives, noting that Enron also gave sizable sums to Democrats, ridic=
ule the notion that the White House/Enron story should be covered like Bill=
 Clinton's scandals. White House adviser Mary Matalin told radio host Don I=
mus that Bush's critics "act like there's some billing records or some catt=
le scam or some fired travel aides or some blue dress."=20
"The comparison to Whitewater really doesn't hold," says Goldberg. "No one =
is alleging that Bush gained personally from this." (As it turned out, the =
Clintons lost money on their Whitewater land deal.)=20
There is little dispute that the Enron meltdown is a major-league financial=
 scandal in which company insiders dumped their stock before employees star=
ted losing their life savings. But despite the Houston firm's Dec. 2 bankru=
ptcy filing, the story was largely relegated to the business pages and rare=
ly mentioned on television. Exceptions included the New York Times and Wall=
 Street Journal -- as well as the Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Chron=
icle, where local interest was fueled by Enron's role in California's energ=
y crisis.=20
As late as Aug. 28, after the former CEO abruptly resigned, the Houston Chr=
onicle was cautious in a front-page report: "Even though nothing major appe=
ars to be wrong at Enron Corp., investor confidence in the world's largest =
energy trader remains shaky."=20
Jim Cramer, a former money manager and co-host of CNBC's "America Now," say=
s an Enron executive complained to his bosses months ago when he charged th=
at the company was "unraveling" and that its stock was going to zero.=20
"My producer and I have been saying for weeks, 'Are we the only guys who th=
ink this is a big story?' " Cramer says. "Everyone just kept quoting the sa=
me analysts, saying it's all much ado about nothing. The Wall Street analys=
ts worked at firms that were doing massive amounts of investment banking bu=
siness with Enron."=20
Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who now teaches at Georgetown University=
, says Enron deserves far more coverage than the Monica Lewinsky melodrama.=
 "Clinton having an affair is pretty much between him, his wife and his gir=
lfriend," Begala says. "It didn't hurt America. Nobody lost their savings. =
This is a very big deal."=20
Begala says Bush hurt himself by claiming last week that Lay supported Ann =
Richards over him for Texas governor in 1994 -- a claim that was prominentl=
y debunked by Texas newspapers but only briefly mentioned elsewhere.=20
"The lesson I learned from the Lewinsky thing is a president must never lie=
," Begala says. Bush "got off very, very easy," he says, because the press =
is "a bunch of cream puffs."

Politicians weren't the only ones getting gobs of cash from Kenneth L. Lay,=
 the embattled chairman of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trading co=
mpany that collapsed last month amid allegations of accounting hanky-panky =
and management misdeeds.=20
In recent years, Lay or Enron contributed thousands of dollars to Resources=
 for the Future and the American Enterprise Institute. Lay also serves on t=
he board of directors of the two high-profile Washington-based think tanks.
"Enron has contributed periodically to RFF since 1990, with gifts ranging f=
rom $10,000 to $45,000" to the general fund, said Jonathan Halperin, direct=
or of communications planning and strategy at RFF. The $45,000 contribution=
 was made last fall to honor the 50th anniversary of the think tank, which =
researches issues related to natural resources and the environment.=20
And yes, "the check did clear," reported Ted Hand, RFF's vice president for=
 finance and administration.=20
In addition, the Linda and Ken Lay Foundation pledged in 2000 to endow a re=
search chair at RFF. In 2000, the foundation contributed a total of $15,000=
, Halperin said.=20
The Enron chairman briefly served on the RFF board of directors in the mid-=
1980s. He rejoined the board in April 2000.=20
Lay has served on AEI's board of trustees since 1994. AEI officials decline=
d to say how much Lay or Enron has contributed to the tank.=20
"We have a firm rule about not discussing the amount of contributions or wh=
ere they come from," said Executive Vice President David Gerson, though he =
noted wryly that AEI got less than RFF did last year.=20
AEI is the intellectual home of Lynne V. Cheney, wife of Vice President Che=
ney and an AEI senior fellow. The vice president and Lay were on a panel to=
gether at AEI's World Forum on June 24, the White House said in a letter to=
 Congress released last week.=20
GETTING TOGETHER: Here's another unexpected consequence of the Sept. 11 ter=
rorist attacks: "Whites trust blacks more, Asians trust Latinos more, and s=
o on, than these very same people did a year ago," reports Harvard politica=
l scientist Robert Putnam.=20
Putnam, the intellectual guru of the civic engagement movement, based his s=
urprising claim on a new analysis of surveys conducted by the Saguaro Semin=
ar at Harvard. The first poll was conducted in 2000. Last October, research=
ers returned to the same people and posed the questions again to see if the=
ir attitudes had changed following the attacks on the World Trade Center an=
d the Pentagon.=20
They had. "Evidence of enhanced trust across ethnic and other social divisi=
ons is especially striking and gratifying," Putnam writes in the American P=
rospect due out this week. For example, the proportion of whites and Asians=
 who said they trusted blacks "a lot" increased from 22 percent to 29 perce=
nt, Putnam reported.=20
VOUCHING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE: School vouchers didn't make the final cut in th=
e recent education bill, but they're still a smoking hot topic in Washingto=
n with the Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments in the Cleveland vouche=
r case next month.=20
With this timing in mind, the Cato Institute announced the launch of the Ce=
nter for Education Freedom, to be run by new hire David Salisbury. The cent=
er will run on an annual budget of $450,000 and start with a staff of four.=
=20
"We'll be looking at proposals in the 50 states, including tuition tax cred=
its, scholarship tax credits like they have in Arizona, and how to decrease=
 the role of the federal government in special education," Salisbury said. =
"We're also looking at for-profit and nonprofit educational entrepreneurs w=
ho are providing options for managing schools and educating kids outside th=
e government."=20
Salisbury, a former education professor at Florida State University, comes =
to the libertarian tank from Utah, where he spent five years running the Su=
therland Institute, a small, free-market think tank.=20
(Perhaps there's some sort of East-West libertarian exchange going on. Cato=
's previous education expert, Darcy Olsen, left the District last fall to b=
ecome the executive director of the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute.)=20
On a related subject, the Center for Education Reform, a pro school-choice =
advocacy group, just released the seventh edition of its National Charter S=

analyses of enrollment and growth, and a ranking of state laws.=20

Enron highlights risks of employee stock plans

Back in the late 1950s, a lawyer called Louis Kelso co-authored a book call=
ed The Capitalist Manifesto. In it, he posited that democracy suffered when=
 money was confined to the hands of the wealthy. Workers should have a chan=
ce to participate in capital, not just in some nominal fashion but as true =
shareholders.=20
With the Enron collapse on the front pages, and much media attention paid t=
o the many employees who lost the bulk of their life savings because their =
retirement funds contained little other than Enron stock, Mr. Kelso's lesso=
ns for us bear revisiting.
The essence of property, as Mr. Kelso wrote, "is the right to receive its p=
roduct." Workers needed equity assets and, crucially, the freedom to manage=
 them. After this radical change, the United States would stabilize and wou=
ld no longer suffer periods like that of Mr. Kelso's own youth, the Great D=
epression.=20
Mr. Kelso created a device to mount his revolution: the employee stock owne=
rship plan, Esop. A Kelsonian spirit also infused the subsequent developmen=
t of the now widespread employee pension plan, the 401(k), an RSP-like vehi=
cle.=20
The 401(k) gives companies the option -- it is important to note this is vo=
luntary -- to deposit company shares or cash into accounts of individual em=
ployees. Tax incentives then encourage workers to match the company contrib=
ution made in their name with their own cash savings. There are also confis=
catory penalties for those who do not wait until retirement to claim the pr=
oceeds.=20
All this comes to mind when we consider the fate of Enron employees who los=
t their 401(k) shirts when the Enron stock they held evaporated. One could =
argue -- from the left -- that the Enron case shows worker stock ownership =
is inherently dangerous. But the truth is that Enron's pension crisis occur=
red because 401(k)s are not Kelsonian enough.=20
Consider the nature of 401(k)s. While workers have nominal title to their p=
ensions while they are employed, both the government and company sponsors p=
lace all sorts of constraints on their ownership. In 401(k) plans, worker i=
nvestments are routinely limited to an array of mutual funds, chosen by the=
 company, and to company shares. They may not invest their 401(k) money in =
assets that are not on the prescribed menu, such as individual properties. =
They are, as mentioned, subject to rules that punish any withdrawals before=
 retirement. What is more, pension law encourages employers to play the mur=
ky role of principal investment "educator" to employees. Many of these rule=
s were written in the name of protecting the workers. But the net result is=
 that, during the working years, the rights of ownership of 401(k) plans do=
 not reside with the worker alone. Instead, they are shared between him and=
 his employer. Worker ownership has generated enormous good, just as Mr. Ke=
lso foresaw.=20
The existence of Esops and 401(k)s in the 1980s and 1990s meant that worker=
s could participate in great economic expansions. The fact that companies c=
ould offer their own stock to workers meant that they shared out far more t=
han they might otherwise have done.=20
The second benefit of employee stock ownership was that it did indeed give =
workers a personal stake in their companies. Companies figured out that wor=
ker-owners would be less likely to shirk. This is one reason why U.S. produ=
ctivity growth stands out internationally. But Enron illustrates the disadv=
antages of the half-ownership arrangement.=20
First is the problematic rule that drives employers to play the role of inv=
estment educator. This creates a form of pension paternalism that in turn g=
enerates a false sense of security. If Enron employees had been talking to =
an independent financial planner instead of their go-go bosses, that planne=
r would have told them that it was crazy to have 98% of their pension in En=
ron stock. The advisor would also have told them that their Enron pension p=
lans were insufficient. He or she would have said it was unwise for middle-=
aged workers to be taking the same risks as 20-year-olds at Internet start-=
ups.=20
The second problem was a rule that gave Enron -- and other such firms -- th=
e discretion to enforce a "black-out" period when workers are not allowed t=
o alter their investments. Just such a black-out was in effect when Enron s=
tock price was plummeting. This denied workers the right of the true owners=
 to, receive their capital's product, as Mr. Kelso put it. If they had been=
 able to do so, they could have sold the shares in a timely manner.=20
The third problem rule is one that gave Enron the discretion to block sales=
 by workers until they reached a certain age. Had workers truly controlled =
their capital, they would have been free to act more quickly. The logical n=
ext step therefore is to unmuddy the pension law and make clear what owners=
hip is and what it is not.=20
If employees are to have 401(k) investments -- and they should -- their own=
ership should be something closer to outright. The law should encourage the=
m to seek independent advisers and to cast a skeptical eye on their employe=
rs' enthusiasms. The worst thing would be to heap on new constraints and "p=
rotections," as legislation proposed by senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corz=
ine would do. This would stop companies from contributing to these voluntar=
y plans altogether.=20
Most important to recall, at this dire moment, is that the profit-sharing i=
deal did achieve its lofty aim. For the tens of thousands of Enron workers =
in trouble, there are millions more who have seen benefits. It would do mor=
e damage than a dozen Enrons to disturb the progress of Louis Kelso's revol=
ution.

The Worst Thing About Enron: Checks and Balances Failed

Enron was supposed to be the next new thing, a new-economy company with sub=
stance to it.=20
Unlike flaky Internet start-ups that substituted ethereal yardsticks such a=
s "eyeballs" and "stickiness" for revenue and profits, Enron had real busin=
esses, real assets, real revenue and what seemed to be real profits. It own=
ed natural gas pipelines and electric generating plants and water companies=
.
Not only would it do well, it would improve the planet by substituting the =
efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of government regulation. =
And it seemed to work. From humble beginnings as a natural gas company, Enr=
on rose in a mere 15 years to No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list, doing $100 bil=
lion of business in 2000. Along the way, Enron became one of America's most=
 admired companies and a perennial favorite on best-places-to-work lists.=
=20
But Enron turned out to be another bubble. Unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, w=
hose implosions did little damage outside of costing dice-rolling speculato=
rs some money and techies some jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grena=
de. Today, Enron is a smoking ruin, the biggest corporate bankruptcy filing=
 in American history.=20
A year ago, the stock market valued Enron at more than $60 billion. Its sto=
ck has since lost 99 percent of its value -- and still seems overpriced. St=
ockholders and lenders are out tens of billions of dollars. Many of Enron's=
 20,000 employees lost their retirement savings when the company collapsed.=
 About 5,000 of them, from computer jocks in Houston to newsprint recyclers=
 in New Jersey, lost their jobs, too.=20
By contrast, Chairman Ken Lay made $205 million in stock-option profits in =
the past four years alone, and other big hitters and board members made out=
, too. What's especially galling is that a handful of executives and outsid=
ers made millions by investing in off-balance-sheet deals with Enron that p=
layed a large role in destroying the company.=20
The collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthu=
r Andersen, Enron's outside auditing firm, which disclosed last week that s=
ome employees destroyed documents. Andersen's reputation has been tarnished=
 to the point that the Big Five accounting firms might shrink to the Big Fo=
ur. Wall Street's credibility has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, f=
or which Enron was the model, is now on the back burner.=20
The spectacle of impoverished, unemployed Enron workers has thrown a harsh =
spotlight on the risks of 401(k) accounts stuffed with company stock. Confi=
dence in financial markets has been shaken -- and rightly so. With the acti=
on in Afghanistan slowing down, Enron shock waves have finally reached Wash=
ington, raising the specter of another 'Gate.=20
Life would be simple if we could blame the whole thing on Enron Chairman La=
y. Or on George W. Bush, who goes way back with Lay, the biggest individual=
 contributor to Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaigns. But =
Enron isn't that simple. It's something far more scary: a wholesale systemi=
c failure.=20
The multi-layered system of checks and balances that is supposed to keep a =
company from running amok completely broke down. Executives of public compa=
nies have legal and moral responsibilities to produce honest books and reco=
rds -- but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors are supposed to =
make sure that a company's financial reports not only meet the letter of ac=
counting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair and accurate pict=
ure of what's going on -- but Arthur Andersen failed that test. To protect =
themselves, lenders are supposed to make sure borrowers are creditworthy --=
 but Enron's lenders were as clueless as everyone else. Wall Street analyst=
s are supposed to dig through company numbers to divine what's really happe=
ning -- but almost none of them managed to do that. Regulators didn't regul=
ate. Enron's board of directors didn't direct.=20
Why did all these people look the other way for so long? Money talks. Or, w=
ith Enron, shouts. The company put lots of money in the pockets of people a=
nd institutions who were supposed to police it. Enron's incessant dealmakin=
g generated huge fees for Wall Street investment-banking houses. And guess =
what: Wall Street loved Enron, with most analysts rating its stock and bond=
s as the greatest thing since money was invented, at least until they final=
ly heard Enron's death rattle.=20
Enron paid huge fees -- $52 million in 2000 -- to Arthur Andersen for audit=
ing and consulting services. Andersen allowed it to get away with accountin=
g that was at best aggressive and at worst criminal. If Andersen had stood =
on principle, Enron would doubtless have changed accountants.=20
Enron famously made heavy political contributions. Pols got peanuts compare=
d with what Wall Street and Andersen got, but it was enough to help Enron r=
un over regulators at both the national and state levels.=20
The Enron fallout promises to be severe and far-reaching. With a criminal i=
nvestigation underway, some of the Enron players face the possibility of sp=
ending time in the Big House. The only questions about Arthur Andersen is h=
ow much the partners will have to pay to settle this mess and whether the c=
ompany can survive as an independent entity. The accounting profession is w=
ishing it were again faceless and colorless, instead of being in the harsh =
spotlight. Financial conglomerates such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup =
are going to be scrutinized over their multiple and often conflicting roles=
 at Enron: lenders, trading partners, investors, advisers, investment banke=
rs.=20
The bottom line: Enron wanted to change the world. It did. But not quite th=
e way that it had in mind.=20

Watchdogs and Lapdogs
By Burton Malkiel

01/16/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A16
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The bankruptcy of Enron -- at one time the seventh-largest company in the U=
.S. -- has underscored the need to reassess not only the adequacy of our fi=
nancial reporting systems but also the public watchdog mission of the accou=
nting industry, Wall Street security analysts, and corporate boards of dire=
ctors. While the full story of what caused Enron to collapse has yet to be =
revealed, what is clear is that its accounting statements failed to give in=
vestors a complete picture of the firm's operations as well as a fair asses=
sment of the risks involved in Enron's business model and financing structu=
re.=20
Enron is not unique. Incidents of accounting irregularities at large compan=
ies such as Sunbeam and Cendant have proliferated. As Joe Berardino, CEO of=
 Arthur Andersen, said on these pages, "Our financial reporting model is br=
oken. It is out of date and unresponsive to today's new business models, co=
mplex financial structures, and associated business risks."
It is important to recognize that losses suffered by Enron's shareholders t=
ook place in the context of an enormous bubble in the "new economy" part of=
 the stock market during 1999 and early 2000. Stocks of Internet-related co=
mpanies were doubling, then doubling again. Past standards of valuation lik=
e "buy stocks priced at reasonable multiples of earnings" had given way to =
blind faith that any company associated with the Internet was bound to go u=
p. Enron was seen as the perfect "new economy" stock that could dominate th=
e market for energy, communications, and electronic trading and commerce.=
=20
I have sympathy for the Enron workers who came before Congress to tell of h=
ow their retirement savings were wiped out as Enron's stock collapsed and h=
ow they were constrained from selling. I have long argued for broad diversi=
fication in retirement portfolios. But many of those who suffered were more=
 than happy to concentrate their portfolios in Enron stock when it appeared=
 that the sky was the ceiling.=20
Moreover, for all their problems, our financial reporting systems are still=
 the world's gold standard, and our financial markets are the fairest and m=
ost transparent. But the dramatic collapse of Enron and the rapid destructi=
on of $60 billion of market value has shaken public trust in the safeguards=
 that exist to protect the interests of individual investors. Restoring tha=
t confidence, which our capital markets rely on, is an urgent priority.=20
In my view, the root systemic problem is a series of conflicts of interest =
that have spread through our financial system. If there is one reliable pri=
nciple of economics, it is that individual behavior is strongly influenced =
by incentives. Unfortunately, often the incentives facing accounting firms,=
 security analysts, and even in some circumstances boards of directors mili=
tate against their functioning as effective guardians of shareholders' inte=
rests.=20
While I will concentrate on the conflicts facing the accounting profession,=
 perverse incentives also compromise the integrity of much of the research =
product of Wall Street security analysts. Many of the most successful resea=
rch analysts are compensated largely on their ability to attract investment=
 banking clients. In turn, corporations select underwriters partly on their=
 ability to present positive analyst coverage of their businesses. Security=
 analysts can get fired if they write unambiguously negative reports that m=
ight damage an existing investment banking relationship or discourage a pro=
spective one.=20
Small wonder that only about 1% of all stocks covered by street analysts ha=
ve "sell" recommendations. Even in October 2001, 16 out of 17 securities an=
alysts covering Enron had "buy" or "strong buy" ratings on the stock. As lo=
ng as the incentives of analysts are misaligned with the needs of investors=
, Wall Street cannot perform an effective watchdog function.=20
In some cases, boards of directors have their own conflicts. Too often, boa=
rd members have personal, business, or consulting relationships with the co=
rporations on whose boards they sit. For some "professional directors," lar=
ge fees and other perks may militate against performing their proper functi=
on as a sometime thorn in management's side. Our watchdogs often behave lik=
e lapdogs.=20
But it is on the independent accounting profession that we most rely for as=
surance that a corporation's financial statements accurately reflect the fi=
rm's condition. While we cannot expect independent auditors to detect all f=
raud, we should expect we can rely on them for integrity of financial repor=
ting. While public accounting firms do have reputations to maintain and leg=
al liability to avoid, the incentives of these firms and general auditing p=
ractices can sometimes combine to cloud the transparency of financial state=
ments.=20
In my own experience on several audit committees of public companies, the a=
udit fee was only part of the total compensation paid to the public account=
ing firm hired to examine the financial statements. Even after the divestit=
ure of their consulting units, revenues from tax and management advisory se=
rvices comprise a large share of the revenues of the "Big Five" accounting =
firms. In some cases auditing services may be priced as a "loss leader" to =
allow the accounting firm to gain access to more lucrative non-audit busine=
ss.=20
In such a situation, the audit partner may be loath to make too much of a f=
uss about some gray area of accounting if the intransigence is likely to je=
opardize a profitable relationship for the accounting firm. Indeed, audit p=
artners are often compensated by how much non-audit business they can captu=
re. They may be incentivized, then, to overlook some particularly aggressiv=
e accounting treatment suggested by their clients.=20
Outside auditors also frequently perform and review the inside audit functi=
on within the corporation, as was the case with Andersen and Enron. Such a =
situation may weaken the safeguards that exist when two independent organiz=
ations examine complicated transactions. It's as if a professor let student=
s grade their own papers and then had the responsibility to hear any appeal=
s. Auditors may also be influenced by the prospect of future employment wit=
h their clients.=20
Unfortunately, our existing self-regulatory and standard-setting organizati=
ons fall short. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has =
neither the resources nor the power to be fully effective. The institute ma=
y even have contributed to the problem by encouraging auditors to "leverage=
 the audit" into advising and consulting services.=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has often emphasized the correct f=
orm by which individual transactions should be reported rather than the sub=
stantive way in which the true risk of the firm may be obscured. Take "Spec=
ial Purpose Entities," for example, the financing vehicles that permit comp=
anies such as Enron to access capital and increase leverage without adding =
debt to the balance sheet. Even if all of Enron's SPEs had met the narrow t=
est for balance sheet exclusion (which, in fact, they did not), our account=
ing standard would not have illuminated the effective leverage Enron had un=
dertaken and the true risks of the enterprise.=20
Given the complexity of modern business and the way it is financed, we need=
 to develop a new set of accounting standards that can give an accurate pic=
ture of the business as a whole. FASB may have helped us measure the indivi=
dual trees but it has not developed a way to give us a clear picture of the=
 forest. The continued integrity of the financial reporting system and our =
capital markets must be insured. We need to modernize our accounting system=
 so financial statements give a clearer picture of what assets and liabilit=
ies on the balance sheet are at risk. And we must find ways to lessen the c=
onflicts facing auditors, security analysts, and even boards of directors t=
hat undermine checks and balances our capital markets rely on.=20
One possibility is to require that auditing firms be changed periodically t=
he way audit partners within each firm are rotated. This would incentivize =
auditors to be particularly careful in approving accounting transactions fo=
r fear that leniency would be exposed by later auditors.=20
And, in the end, we need to create a powerful and effective self-regulatory=
 organization with credible disciplinary authority to enforce accounting ru=
les and standards. It would be far better for the industry to respond itsel=
f to the current crises than to await the likelihood that the political pro=
cess will do so for them.=20

In ''Minimizing the Enron Taint'' (editorial, Jan. 12), you imply that ''an=

But it may be that such action to stem the economic calamity caused by Enro=

POINT OF VIEW: Beyond Enron, A Wider Crisis Of Confidence
By Michael Rapoport

01/16/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20
(This report was originally published Tuesday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) has a lot to answer for. And it ma=
y be even more than you might realize at first.
Already the rippling scandal has claimed a long list of victims - from the =
thousands of Enron employees who've seen their retirement savings wiped out=
 to the reputation of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's beleaguered auditor.=20
But what may turn out to be the most far-reaching effect of the Enron scand=
al is more amorphous and less obvious. Simply put, the problem is this: Aft=
er Enron, and after conflicts of interest and earnings tricks at other comp=
anies that have shaken the confidence of investors over the past couple of =
years, who can investors trust?=20
Because of these happenings, investors are going through "a crisis in confi=
dence like I've never seen before," said Pat McConnell, an accounting analy=
st for Bear Stearns & Co. Their faith in something as basic as the accuracy=
 of financial statements has been eroded, she said - and "that's not a good=
 and healthy thing."=20
Enron, after all, amounts to a poster child for a lot of what's been wrong =
with the market in recent years. Manipulation of financial statements to ma=
ke the company look like it's in better shape than it really is? Check. Aid=
ing and abetting in its misdeeds, apparently, by an auditor who may have be=
en more concerned about its fees than in the accuracy of the figures it was=
 auditing? Check. Fawning praise from stock analysts too lazy or too confli=
cted to raise the questions about the company's business that should have b=
een raised? Check.=20
As a result, investors feel a little like the rug has been pulled out from =
under them. They've had enough, said McConnell, who spoke Thursday in New Y=
ork at a Directors' Roundtable seminar on how companies should report their=
 earnings. With their confidence damaged, she said, there's "a lot of skept=
icism" among investors about the information they're being given.=20
This lack of confidence has all kinds of effects, none of them favorable. F=
or one thing, McConnell noted, it increases the cost of capital for compani=
es: If investors don't feel they can trust in the accuracy of the informati=
on they use to make investment decisions, they're going to demand a bigger =
return on their investments to compensate.=20
And look at what's happened to Tyco International Inc. (TYC). The SEC close=
d an accounting probe of Tyco in 2000 without taking any action, and the co=
mpany insists that everything is on the up-and-up - and yet persistent inve=
stor skepticism about Tyco's accounting has weighed on the stock in recent =
days. Investors no longer know who to believe.=20
This slippage in investor confidence in the most basic of the market's unde=
rpinnings is worrisome, and it should be a wake-up call. It should concern =
every company out there that's tried to game the figures to paste a smiley =
face on its financial condition, and every auditor and analyst who's helped=
 them do it.=20
Because if investors' confidence slips too far, the market is going to suff=
er some damage that it's going to be hard to recover from. A free market is=
 built on the free and equitable distribution of information in whose accur=
acy investors can trust when using it to make financial decisions. Without =
that accuracy and that trust, we might as well be Argentina.=20

THE WORLD World Press Tries to Unknot Tale of Bush and the Pretzel Reaction=

LONDON -- Was it an Al Qaeda plot? An Enron end run? Or was it, as Presiden=
t Bush said, just a wayward pretzel that briefly felled the leader of the f=
ree world?=20
With the only witnesses to the presidential fainting spell two canines, the=
 international press has been left to speculate about what happened and whe=
ther Bush can watch TV and chew pretzels at the same time.
"George Bush attempted to taste the biscuit with his attention focused on a=
 football game--a combination of actions that, it appears, proved difficult=
," said the Greek daily To Vima.=20
The media responded to the pretzel pratfall with jokes, queries about Bush'=
s mental and physical health and detailed explanations of the knotted Ameri=
can-style pretzel.=20
"Though not to everyone's taste, they are not considered a health hazard," =
London's Independent newspaper informed readers dryly.=20
True to form, the Germans consulted pretzel experts, the French contemplate=
d Americans' "complicated relationship with food," and the Italians looked =
to the religious roots of the pretzel. The Saudis worried that the scare wi=
ll prevent Bush from focusing attention on Israel's oppression of the Pales=
tinians, while Britons offered Bush a few backhanded compliments.=20
The incident proved Bush is "a man of the people," London's Daily Telegraph=
 said in an editorial. "This is exactly the sort of accident that befalls H=
omer Simpson, night after night."=20
The conservative paper noted in its news pages that the president "was not =
eating something foreign or in any way fancy when he passed out." The paper=
 was cheered by the fact that the leader of the international war on terror=
ism still has time for Sunday football. "He has shown himself, once again, =
to be completely in tune with the tastes and instincts of the people he lea=
ds," its editorial said.=20
Of course, most Americans didn't end up prone with facial bruises at the en=
d of the game--at least not from pretzels. The Independent labeled the offi=
cial story "Hard to Swallow."=20
"Was he poisoned perhaps? Has the stress of fighting the war on terrorism w=
hile fending off inquiries about the collapse of his friend Ken Lay's Enron=
 overwhelmed him? Was there maybe some family tiff?" the paper asked in an =
editorial. It concluded that "the vanquisher of Al Qaeda may have met his m=
atch."=20
Germany's mass-circulation Bild, the daily of choice for blue-collar German=
s, also asked if there wasn't more to the story: "Has the president's alcoh=
ol problem been taken up again?"=20
Expressing concern for the president's health, Saudi Arabia's English-langu=
age Arab News said that while no one believes there is anything seriously w=
rong with Bush, his pretzel mishap has led to speculation about the impact =
of an ailing president on the world.=20
"These are particularly dangerous times internationally. The United States =
has assumed considerable responsibilities and powers in its campaign agains=
t global terrorism. In order to bring together a coalition of support withi=
n the Arab world, the White House had to focus its attention more construct=
ively on Israel's oppression of the Palestinians," the paper said in an edi=
torial.=20
"If, however, Bush's unusual collapse is a symptom of more serious medical =
problems, we can be absolutely sure that, lacking any clear direction from =
a troubled White House, Washington's foreign policy will click back on its =
traditional Zionist track. Palestinians will continue to choke on Israeli a=
ggression while the U.S. president may again choke on a typical Yiddish pre=
tzel," it said.=20
No, no, said the Italian press. The American-style pretzel was invented by =
a 16th century German monk as a reward for children who memorized their pra=
yers, La Repubblica newspaper said. The word derives from the Latin prex, o=
r prize, it said.=20
Leave it to the British tabloids to challenge the Italians on Latin. London=
's Daily Mail declared that the word "pretzel" comes from pretiola--Latin f=
or "little reward." The dough is folded to look like a child's arms in pray=
er, and the three holes represent Christianity's holy Trinity. And it was G=
erman and Dutch immigrants who took the pretzel across the Atlantic when th=

Pretzel is brezel in Germany, where the Berliner Morgenpost sought out the =
opinion of a master baker on the safety of the U.S. snack food--and the lik=
elihood that it could have caused the president's swoon.=20
"I have no reason to doubt the quality of the American pretzel," opined Ebe=
rhard Groebel, speculating that Bush's spell was due to his ignoring "the 5=
0-gram rule." That is a German etiquette adage that holds that one should n=
ot try to talk with more than 1.75 ounces of food in one's mouth.=20
"Even in his wildest dreams, Osama bin Laden couldn't have managed what one=
 tiny pretzel did this weekend," began a story in the Berliner Zeitung dail=
y. "According to reports from the White House, it not only brought the migh=
tiest man in the world to his knees but flat out on the floor."=20
Spain's national daily, ABC, reported that after an exhaustive investigatio=
n, the FBI, CIA and Secret Service had "rejected [the possibility] that the=
 biscuit in question came from Afghanistan and have certified that it is a =
genuine American salted pretzel."=20
Russian newspapers, perhaps reflecting the more somber tone of the Vladimir=
 V. Putin era, restrained themselves. The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda ran a =
detailed diagram of Bush's anatomy, with the location of the pretzel blocka=
ge marked with a star.=20
"Bush's organism, although weakened and unconscious, managed to cope with t=
he indisposition," wrote the daily Gazeta. "The organism first rejected the=
 pretzel but later swallowed it and digested without mercy."=20
Ah, but Bush shouldn't be overconfident, the French and British press warne=

 his grave with his teeth. . . . Especially when he comes from a society th=
at obviously has a complicated relationship with food."=20
Added London's Mirror tabloid: "Attila the Hun survived bloody battles only=

Former Enron Corp. employees hawking items from bankrupt company in Interne=
t auction

HOUSTON (AP) - Former Enron Corp. employees are hawking dozens of company i=
tems on Internet auctions, including the embattled company's 64-page code o=
f ethics and a commemorative stock certificate.=20
Former Enron employee Matt Mitchell is selling one of his two copies of a b=
roadband risk management manual used by the former energy giant, which cont=
ains tips on increasing creditworthiness and timing of reported earnings. I=
t is among the priciest of more than 100 Enron-related items for sale in eB=
ay auctions.
"It's not entirely deceptive, but it isn't showing what's actually happenin=
g," Mitchell said Tuesday of risk management techniques employees learned f=
rom the manual, which he hopes to sell for at least $150. The auction ends =
Friday.=20
Other items for sale on the site range from freebies that Enron gave employ=
ees, such as golf balls, baseball hats and paperweights with the company lo=
go.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said former employees can sell Enron artifact=
s with the company's blessing.=20
"The whole situation is unfortunate, and we've always had resourceful, inno=
vative employees. This is just the latest demonstration," she said.=20
Mitchell, 29, was among hundreds of employees laid off from Enron's money-l=
osing broadband services unit in July last year, six months before 4,500 lo=
st their jobs in December after Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in histo=
ry. He worked as a sales engineer for Enron for 14 months, consulting with =
traders who made telecommunications-related trades.=20
Mitchell found another job for less pay with a small software company in Ho=
uston in September and watched his former employer implode in a whirlwind o=
f questionable accounting practices, deflated shares and erosion of investo=
r and trader confidence. Stock that traded near $80 a year ago was delisted=
 from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, having stagnated at less than=
 $1 for weeks.=20
Mitchell said he thought the risk management manual might generate a snicke=
r or two and pique interest from some bidders. He said risk management tech=
niques used for energy and electricity trading were tweaked to apply to bro=
adband in the manuals.=20
"This was just old information rewritten," Mitchell said. "It does not go i=
nto specific laws about what you can do with taxes and ownership, but there=
 are cases of where it focuses on what you can do and accepted accounting p=
ractices that are allowed."=20
For example, the manual said companies can re-categorize expenses "in such =
a manner as to improve the perceived financial performance."=20
Mitchell said layoffs were common for broadband employees working for an un=
profitable venture, but they benefited from the company's severance plan.=
=20
Those laid off after the bankruptcy filing received $4,500 each, as approve=
d by a U.S. bankruptcy judge in New York. Mitchell received nearly $40,000 =
as entitled under company policy, as did others laid off before Enron's dem=
ise.=20
"I was one of the lucky ones," Mitchell said. "I was lucky enough to get an=
other job, with a substantial pay cut, in September. I feel worse for all m=
y co-workers, who had no notice whatsoever and no idea it was coming."=20
