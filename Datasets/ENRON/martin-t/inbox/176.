Tom,

Attached are EOL customers between July 1, 2001 and Nov. 30, 2001, broken out by Physical and Financial...  The only physical customers I remember non EOL are Imperial Sugar and Texas Energy... I'm also checking this list against other non-EOL deals Eric or Joe might have done, but for now take a look at this... O
