Any response yet from John regarding Jim Schwieger being part of the PRC process.  I think he should be included.  Please advise.

Tom

Should Jim Schwieger be included as he has been in prior PRC meetings.  He knows all the gas traders and middle marketers and has been valuable to this process in the past.
