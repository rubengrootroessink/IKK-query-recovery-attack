Staff Saw Document Shredding at Enron --- Three Former Employees Say Destru=
ction Took Place After Investigation Began

Three former Enron Corp. employees say documents were shredded in the accou=
nting department of the company's Houston headquarters after federal invest=
igators had begun a probe into possible illegalities at the energy giant.=
=20
In interviews with ABC World News Tonight and later with The Wall Street Jo=
urnal, Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive whose office was right a=
cross from the accounting department on the 19th floor, said shredding of d=
ocuments apparently continued through the middle of January, when she left =
the company. Separately, two other former Enron employees told the Journal =
they saw several trash bags full of shredded documents in the same area in =
November.
According to Ms. Castaneda and one of the other employees, the shredded doc=
uments appeared to relate to controversial partnerships used by Enron to hi=
de debt and inflate its profits. Ms. Castaneda is in possession of shreds o=
f Enron accounting documents marked "confidential" and dated December 2001.=
=20
One of the shreds contained the word "Jedi," likely a reference to the Enro=
n-controlled Joint Energy Development Investment partnership. Another shred=
ded document seen by one of the two other employees contained the phrase "L=
JM $150 million." LJM is the name of two partnerships set up and run by for=
mer Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Ms. Castaneda -- who said =
she planned to use the shredded paper for packing material -- is a plaintif=
f in one of the dozens of employee and shareholder suits seeking class-acti=
on status against Enron.=20
Last night, Enron counsel Robert S. Bennett issued a statement saying Enron=
 is "investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documen=
ts. In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron empl=
oyees world-wide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light o=
f pending litigation."=20
"If anyone violated those directives," Mr. Bennett added, "they will be dea=
lt with appropriately."=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2 following a loss of i=
nvestor confidence after the company issued several restatements of earning=
s dating back to 1997 and disclosures about several questionable partnershi=
ps run by its top executives.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into possible violatio=
ns of securities laws at Enron in late October. Around the same time, the c=
ompany's legal department sent out a series of circulars demanding that emp=
loyees safeguard all correspondence, written or electronic, related to the =
partnerships and other transactions.=20
On Nov. 1, at least one of the memos was copied directly to David Duncan, t=
he head of the Houston office of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. Mr. =
Duncan was dismissed by Andersen last week for having overseen the destruct=
ion of documents. Mr. Duncan, in turn, has told congressional investigators=
 that he was trying to follow the advice of an attorney in Andersen's Chica=
go headquarters, Nancy Temple, who sent an Oct. 12 e-mail reminding Houston=
 personnel of the firm's document-retention and -disposal policy.=20
Mr. Duncan has told investigators that he didn't think there was anything w=
rong with destroying Andersen-owned documents because the SEC inquiry begun=
 in late October concerned Enron, not Andersen. Andersen has said the shred=
ding stopped on Nov. 9, Ms. Temple sent an e-mail message for Mr. Duncan te=
lling him the SEC had issued a subpoena to Andersen, and that all Enron-rel=
ated documents must be preserved. However, that doesn't explain why the shr=
edding wasn't halted until eight days after Mr. Duncan apparently received =
the Enron memo saying documents should be safeguarded.=20
But a person close to him said Mr. Duncan expected that Andersen's in-house=
 counsel would tell him when and if documents in the accounting firm's poss=
ession needed to be preserved. "The first time he received such an instruct=
ion was Nov. 9," this person said, "and he immediately did so."=20
Meanwhile, congressional investigators examining Enron's collapse met for f=
our hours yesterday with Ms. Temple, the Andersen in-house counsel who left=
 the voice-mail message for Mr. Duncan about preserving documents. She was =
asked about the reason for her reminders to Andersen employees about her fi=
rm's policy on retaining and destroying documents. According to people fami=
liar with the questioning, Ms. Temple said yesterday that her reminders wer=
e simply routine restatements of Arthur Andersen policy and weren't intende=
d as anything more.=20
Ms. Temple is considered likely to be asked to appear at a House Energy and=
 Commerce subcommittee hearing Thursday examining document destruction. Her=
 attorney didn't return calls seeking comment.=20
As for Mr. Duncan, his lawyer, Vince DiBlasi, said, "It is premature to req=
uire him to testify." But the chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Rep.=
 Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, has said he would subpoena Mr. Duncan if ne=
cessary.=20
Ms. Temple sent an Oct. 12 e-mail to Michael Odom, head of risk management =
for Arthur Andersen's Houston office, according to people with knowledge of=
 Mr. Odom's interview with congressional investigators. He told them he for=
warded it to Mr. Duncan, who oversaw the shredding of documents until Nov. =
9 when Ms. Temple sent him a voice-mail message.=20
In addition to those two communications, Ms. Temple sent out a terse remind=
er of the policy on Oct. 19 to John Stewart, Andersen's director of U.S. ac=
counting standards, who holds a powerful regulatory position within the pro=
fession as a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging =
Issues Task Force. The memo also went to Amy Ripepi, an Andersen executive =
who heads the SEC regulations committee for the American Institute of Certi=
fied Public Accountants.=20
This is the first indication that Andersen executives with leading regulato=
ry positions in the accounting profession were issued reminders about the f=
irm's document-retention and -destruction policies.=20
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, said he didn't know why Ms. Temple =
sent out the Oct. 19 memo. He said Mr. Duncan exercised "extremely bad judg=
ment" by destroying documents related to Enron "with full knowledge of an S=
EC investigation."

Ex-Enron staffer details shredding
Firm ordered all data be kept=20
By ROSANNA RUIZ and PATTY REINERT=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20

A former Enron Corp. executive said Monday she witnessed the mass shredding=
 of financial documents at the energy company's accounting office, a practi=
ce that began around Thanksgiving and continued through at least last week.=
=20
Maureen Castaneda, Enron's former director of foreign exchange, has turned =
over to a lawyer several boxes containing mounds of shredded documents date=
d from November and December. The shreds reveal words that refer to Enron's=
 off-the-books business ventures, the partnerships that led to the company'=
s collapse.=20
In an ABC-TV interview that aired Monday night, Castaneda said that around =
Thanksgiving she saw several boxes of papers being pulled from storage area=
s and then shredded, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion that had begun the month before.=20
Castaneda said the shredding continued through her final day on the job las=
t week and that she used paper-filled boxes she found in the hallway to pac=
k her belongings. She could not be reached for comment by the Chronicle aft=
er the ABC broadcast.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer, however, said that company officials had direc=
ted employees when the SEC investigation began to retain all documents, to =
destroy nothing.=20
"We don't know the significance nor the pertinence of the documents that th=
e plaintiffs' lawyers are parading in front of the media," Palmer said Mond=
ay.=20
"But we do know what we have been telling employees sinceOct. 25. We have t=
old them repeatedly that they are to retain all documents or materials rela=
ted to Enron transactions, statements to the public and investors, handwrit=
ten notes -- in short, any method of information recording."=20
The company issued four directives via e-mail about the document retention,=
 Palmer said. An Oct. 25 e-mail warned employees: "You should know that thi=
s document preservation requirement is a requirement of federal law and you=
 could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail =
to follow these instructions."=20
Bill Lerach, an attorney representing New York-based Amalgamated Bank in a =
lawsuit against Enron executives, said Monday he will seek a restraining or=
der in federal court today to prevent the destruction of any other evidence=
.=20
Amalgamated Bank, which manages pension funds that hold Enron stock, sued i=
n November, alleging that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 bill=
ion in Enron stock during the past three years while not disclosing that th=
e stock price was overvalued.=20
Lerach said that while he knows of several former Enron employees who saw t=
he shredding, Castaneda was the only one who has come forward.=20
"From what we have learned, destruction of evidence at Enron was open and n=
otorious and widespread," Lerach said. "They even shredded on Christmas Day=
."=20
He said he will have the shredded files in court today.=20
"We believe the Enron employees were destroying documents at the same time =
Andersen people did," said Lerach, referring to Enron's former auditor. "Th=
e question of whether there was a coordinated effort is something to look i=
nto."=20
In Washington, investigators pushed for public testimony from former Arthur=
 Andersen auditor David Duncan, fired last week after the company said he o=
rdered the destruction of Enron documents last fall.=20
Duncan since has cooperated with investigators, telling them that Andersen =
executives had plenty of information to evaluate Enron's controversial use =
of offshore partnerships.=20
The partnerships allowed Enron to hide millions of dollars of debt for year=
s and mislead investors and its employees about Enron's financial health.=
=20
Duncan "did not sit there and say, `Enron hid all this information from us =
and therefore we couldn't count right,' " Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who he=
ads the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, told The Associate=
d Press. "It was more of ... `we made mistakes.'"=20
Greenwood, speaking about comments Duncan made to lawmakers last week, said=
 that rather than a mea culpa, Duncan gave "a wea culpa; he did not point t=
he finger at Enron."=20
Duncan is scheduled to testify before Greenwood's panel Thursday, one day a=
fter lawmakers return to Capitol Hill from their winter break. Duncan's law=
yers had tried to delay his testimony, saying he needs more time to prepare=
, but Greenwood rejected the request, threatening to subpoena Duncan if nec=
essary.=20
Duncan "doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron=
," Greenwood told the AP. "We're focused on the destruction of documents."=
=20
Enron and Arthur Andersen have come under fire in the wake of the Houston c=
ompany's implosion last year. Once the world's largest energy trading compa=
ny, Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, costing thousands of employees their=
 jobs and their retirement nest eggs, much of which were tied up in now vir=
tually worthless company stock.=20
At least nine congressional investigations are under way, as are probes by =
the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justic=
e Department, which is looking into possible criminal violations.=20
In addition to the congressional investigations, lawmakers also will turn t=
heir attention to legislation aimed at preventing a another debacle like En=
ron.=20
On Monday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she will introduce a bill thi=
s week ensuring that auditors remain independent from the companies they au=
dit.=20
The bill comes in the wake of revelations that Andersen received $52 millio=
n in annual business from Enron, about half of it from its auditing account=
 and half in consulting fees.=20
Joseph Berardino, chief executive officer of Andersen, has dismissed concer=
ns that his company overlooked Enron's accounting practices to preserve oth=
er business with the company.=20
However, appearing on NBC-TV's Meet the Press over the weekend, Berardino s=
aid Andersen is considering whether to end its consulting services and focu=
s on its auditing business.=20
Also on the congressional agenda in the coming months will be legislation t=
hat Boxer sponsored with Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., to protect employee reti=
rement accounts.=20
The Boxer-Corzine Pension Protection and Diversification Act, introduced la=
st month, encourages workers to diversify retirement investment plans by li=
miting to 20 percent the investment an employee can have in any one stock i=
n his 401(k).=20
The bill also would allow employees who receive their own company's stock a=
s part of their employer's matching contribution to their retirement saving=
s plan to sell the stock 90 days after it arrives in their accounts.=20
In Enron's case, employees were not allowed to sell matching stock until ag=

Second Executive Tells of Andersen E-mail --- Version of Events Bolsters Fi=
red Auditor's Account Of Shredded Documents
By Tom Hamburger and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Bolstering the account of a fired Arthur Andersen LLP auditor=
, an executive in the accounting firm's Houston office told congressional i=
nvestigators that an e-mail from headquarters reminding employees of Anders=
en's document-disposal policy was unprecedented, people familiar with his i=
nterview say. The Oct. 12 e-mail arrived shortly before Houston personnel b=
egan destroying papers relating to Enron Corp.=20
The account by Michael Odom, the head of risk management for the Houston of=
fice, is consistent with that given to lawmakers by Enron's lead auditor, D=
avid Duncan, who Andersen fired last week for overseeing the document destr=
uction. It also helps lawmakers to focus their probe on the role top Anders=
en officials played in the downfall of Enron, one of the nation's biggest c=
ompanies until it filed for bankruptcy-court protection last month amid que=
stions about its accounting practices.
The document destruction, which continued after the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission began inquiries into Enron's financial statements in late Octob=
er, will be the subject of a hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Commi=
ttee hearing Thursday. Messrs. Duncan and Odom and the Andersen lawyer who =
sent the Oct. 12 e-mail likely will be invited to testify.=20
Mr. Odom's lawyer, Peter Fleming, said his client is cooperating fully with=
 investigators. "Mike Odom has done nothing wrong, and is unaware of any wr=
ongdoing," Mr. Fleming said. Andersen has portrayed the shredding of docume=
nts as an isolated case of poor judgment and has disciplined several people=
 in the Houston office, including Mr. Odom, who was stripped of his managem=
ent responsibilities.=20
Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino said on NBC's "Meet the Press" ye=
sterday that Mr. Duncan was fired after "he displayed extremely poor judgme=
nt in the destruction of documents issue." Mr. Berardino blamed Enron's dem=
ise on a failed business model, not accounting errors. "A company has faile=
d and it has failed because the economics didn't work," he said.=20
Mr. Duncan last week told congressional investigators that he ordered subor=
dinates to begin destroying documents related to the Enron account after he=
 received an e-mail from Nancy Temple, a senior lawyer in Andersen's Chicag=
o office. The Oct. 12 e-mail -- sent to Mr. Odom, who passed it on to Mr. D=
uncan -- was a reminder of Andersen's longstanding document-retention and d=
estruction policy, which called for the disposal of nonessential papers.=20
Both Messrs. Odom and Duncan told congressional investigators that they had=
 never before been sent such a reminder, according to people familiar with =
their interviews. Ms. Temple was a member of an "extended review team" of H=
ouston and Chicago officials created to take a closer look at Enron as ques=
tions arose about its condition. Members of the team talked with each other=
 several times a week, Mr. Odom told congressional investigators.=20
Mr. Duncan told investigators he didn't think there was anything wrong with=
 destroying Andersen-owned documents because the SEC inquiry begun in late =
October concerned Enron, not Andersen. The shredding stopped on Nov. 9 when=
 Ms. Temple left a voice-mail message for Mr. Duncan telling him that the S=
EC had issued subpoenas and that all documents must be preserved.=20
A person close to Mr. Duncan says he forwarded that voice mail to the entir=
e Enron audit team and instructed his secretary to send an e-mail repeating=
 the instruction. The next day, Ms. Temple reiterated the message in a foll=
ow-up e-mail to Mr. Duncan and others involved with the Enron account.=20
The implication of the account offered by Mr. Duncan and bolstered by Mr. O=
dom is that the document destruction began only when the office was reminde=
d of Andersen's document-destruction policy by Ms. Temple and stopped only =
when the office heard from her again about the subpoenas.=20
But Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said Ms. Temple never instructed the=
 Houston office to begin shredding Enron documents, nor did she intend to o=
rder them to stop the shredding, because she didn't know it was going on in=
 the first place. The November messages from Ms. Temple constituted "an inn=
ocent and appropriate reminder from the legal department to the staff in Ho=
uston of what the procedures are when somebody receives a subpoena," he sai=
d.=20
The finger-pointing over document destruction is part of a larger battle ov=
er responsibility for Enron's collapse. Evidence uncovered by lawmakers sug=
gests the Enron account was watched closely by officials at Andersen's head=
quarters.=20
For example, top Andersen officials have portrayed as routine a meeting con=
vened on Feb. 5 to discuss whether to retain Enron as a client. Andersen's =
Mr. Berardino said yesterday it was "part of a normal process we go through=
 every year" for all clients. But Mr. Duncan told investigators that he mad=
e a point of including top Andersen executives, including several via phone=
 from Chicago, because he was concerned that the Enron account posed "signi=
ficant risk," a person present when he was questioned said.=20
An Andersen spokesman said he didn't know why particular executives were in=
vited to the meeting and declined to say whether routine retention meetings=
 normally include several top executives. Other evidence points to active i=
nvolvement in the Enron account by top Andersen executives. Enron CEO Kenne=
th Lay told employees in an online exchange on Sept. 26 that financial tran=
sactions being questioned at the time had all been approved by Andersen -- =
"in many cases, not only" by Houston-based auditors but also by "Andersen's=
 headquarters office from some of the world's leading experts in these type=
s of financing," according to a transcript released by lawyers for Enron em=
ployees suing the company over stock losses in their retirement accounts.=

when the office heard from her again about the subpoenas.=20
But Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said Ms. Temple never instructed the=
 Houston office to begin shredding Enron documents, nor did she intend to o=
rder them to stop the shredding, because she didn't know it was going on in=
 the first place. The November messages from Ms. Temple constituted "an inn=
ocent and appropriate reminder from the legal department to the staff in Ho=
uston of what the procedures are when somebody receives a subpoena," he sai=
d.=20
The finger-pointing over document destruction is part of a larger battle ov=
er responsibility for Enron's collapse. Evidence uncovered by lawmakers sug=
gests the Enron account was watched closely by officials at Andersen's head=
quarters.=20
For example, top Andersen officials have portrayed as routine a meeting con=
vened on Feb. 5 to discuss whether to retain Enron as a client. Andersen's =
Mr. Berardino said yesterday it was "part of a normal process we go through=
 every year" for all clients. But Mr. Duncan told investigators that he mad=
e a point of including top Andersen executives, including several via phone=
 from Chicago, because he was concerned that the Enron account posed "signi=
ficant risk," a person present when he was questioned said.=20
An Andersen spokesman said he didn't know why particular executives were in=
vited to the meeting and declined to say whether routine retention meetings=
 normally include several top executives. Other evidence points to active i=
nvolvement in the Enron account by top Andersen executives. Enron CEO Kenne=
th Lay told employees in an online exchange on Sept. 26 that financial tran=
sactions being questioned at the time had all been approved by Andersen -- =
"in many cases, not only" by Houston-based auditors but also by "Andersen's=
 headquarters office from some of the world's leading experts in these type=
s of financing," according to a transcript released by lawyers for Enron em=
ployees suing the company over stock losses in their retirement accounts.=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
EX-OFFICIAL SAYS ENRON EMPLOYEES SHREDDED PAPERS
By JONATHAN D. GLATER and MICHAEL BRICK

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron employees were shredding documents at the company's Houston offices a=
s recently as last week, a former executive said yesterday. Her statement w=
as the first indication that documents were destroyed at Enron amid investi=
gations of the company's collapse by Congress and the Justice Department an=
d followed reports of document shredding by accountants at Enron's auditor,=
 Arthur Andersen.=20
The company said last night that it was looking into the claims by the exec=
utive, Maureen Castaneda, who was Enron's director of foreign exchange and =
sovereign risk management. Enron said that it had repeatedly directed worke=
rs to preserve all documents once it learned in October that the Securities=
 and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation of its accounting pract=
ices.
Lawmakers investigating Enron's collapse and former prosecutors said that e=
vidence of document destruction would play a central role in Congressional =
and criminal inquiries into the company's fall.=20
''If anyone in Enron, or for that matter Arthur Andersen, is shredding docu=
ments that have anything to do with this entire matter, they are going to b=
e in a whole lot of trouble,'' said Representative James C. Greenwood, Repu=
blican of Pennsylvania, who is chairman of a House subcommittee that will h=
old a hearing Thursday into shredding by Andersen. Ms. Castaneda described =
the shredding by Enron employees on ABC News last night.=20
As for Arthur Andersen, an internal document shows that as early as Novembe=
r 2000, the accounting firm had concluded that Enron's Internet services un=
it, which the company considered crucial to its growth, had such poor contr=
ols that there was a ''high risk'' that its financial results would be misr=
epresented.=20
Andersen continued to sign off on the results, and the performance of the u=
nit, Enron Broadband Services, rapidly deteriorated with the bursting of th=
e Internet bubble. After losing $60 million in all of 2000, the unit report=
ed losses of $494 million in the nine months that ended last Sept. 30.=20
The stock market's decline as the air went out of the new-economy boom appa=
rently also took a harsh toll on the finances of Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's ch=
airman. Though he received more than $200 million in compensation and profi=
ts from exercising Enron stock options over three years, Mr. Lay was forced=
 to borrow millions more from the company last year to meet his obligations=
.=20
In a telephone interview yesterday afternoon, Ms. Castaneda said that docum=
ent shredding at Enron began before Christmas and continued through last we=
ek.=20
Ms. Castaneda said that employees in Enron's accounting department, which h=
ad offices across the hall from her own on the 19th floor of an Enron offic=
e tower, collected about 15 boxes of documents after Thanksgiving. She watc=
hed as the department employees searched through the boxes, Ms. Castaneda s=
aid, and later noticed that shredded paper was accumulating in trash bins.=
=20
''I can't tell you what they were searching for, but they were definitely i=
nterested in picking out certain documents,'' Ms. Castaneda said.=20
Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer representing Enron, said that the company was i=
nvestigating the reports of shredded documents.=20
''In October 2001 the company issued several directives to all Enron employ=
ees worldwide that all relevant documents should be preserved in light of p=
ending litigation,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''If anyone violated those directive=
s, they will be dealt with appropriately.''=20
The company said that it had sent employees four e-mail messages on documen=
t retention since Oct. 25, most recently last Monday.=20
Legal experts said it would be a crime deliberately to destroy documents th=
at might be sought by the S.E.C. or other government agencies.=20
''It is really dumb,'' said Michael J. Shepard, former chief of the special=
 prosecutions division in the United States attorney's office in Chicago an=
d now a partner at Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe in San Francisco. Destro=
ying documents makes it very difficult to argue that their content was not =
incriminating, he said.=20
''Maybe,'' he said, ''the document says, 'Man, did we cheat, and the roof i=
s about to fall in.' Maybe the document is really, really bad. But in a lot=
 of cases, it can be better to have the documents because you can explain t=
hem.''=20
Another former Enron employee, who asked not to be identified, said yesterd=
ay that she witnessed two to five people shredding documents in a room in l=
ate November or early December.=20
The former employee was unable to identify the people and said she had obse=
rved them only casually. She added that she was not aware of any orders not=
 to shred documents but said that several Enron employees later indicated t=
hat they had also seen the shredding taking place.=20
Ms. Castaneda said that she collected a box of shredded documents at the su=
ggestion of G. Paul Howes, an investigator for the law firm of Milberg Weis=
s Hynes Bershad & Lerach, which has filed a suit against Enron and its offi=
cers and directors on behalf of investors.=20
The shredded pages include accounting records, expense reimbursement reques=
ts, wire fund transfer requests and what appear to be insurance records. So=
me of them are dated after Enron said it sent out notices about preservatio=
n of documents, and some include the words ''post-petition,'' which Mr. How=
es said suggested they were related to the company's bankruptcy filing.=20
Some of the shredded strips have the names of secretive partnerships --JEDI=
 II and Raptor -- that have been linked to transactions allowing Enron to k=
eep some of its debt hidden from investors.=20
Bill Lerach, a partner at Milberg Weiss, said last night that he planned to=
 take the box of shredded documents before a judge in Houston today and ask=
 that other Enron documents be taken into the custody of the court immediat=
ely.=20
Congressional hearings begin on Thursday before both the Senate Governmenta=
l Affairs Committee and Mr. Greenwood's House Energy and Commerce subcommit=
tee. The House hearing will focus on the admission last week by Andersen th=
at employees in its Houston office destroyed thousands of Enron documents s=
hortly after learning that the S.E.C. was investigating Enron.=20
Last week, Andersen fired the lead partner on the Enron audits, David B. Du=
ncan, saying that he orchestrated the shredding. Mr. Duncan has told invest=
igators that he was following a directive from a lawyer in Andersen's home =
office in Chicago, Nancy Temple, who in an Oct. 12 e-mail message re-emphas=
ized the firm's document-destruction policy. Mr. Duncan has told investigat=
ors that it was ''unusual'' for the firm to re-emphasize that policy, accor=
ding to people close to the investigation. Officials with the House subcomm=
ittee said Ms. Temple was likely to testify Thursday.=20
In his interview with investigators, Mr. Duncan also attributed some blame =
for accounting errors to himself, Mr. Greenwood said. Mr. Greenwood said hi=
s staff members had told him that ''the bottom line'' from Mr. Duncan's tes=
timony was that ''he did not point the finger at Enron, and he did not clai=
m that Enron hid information from him.''=20
''Our hearing will be focused on the destruction of documents,'' Mr. Greenw=
ood said. ''Did Arthur Andersen destroy documents strictly pursuant to its =
normal protocol, or was there an aggressive attempt to destroy documents to=
 cover up? These are the questions we need to get to in our hearing.''=20
The analysis by Andersen of Enron Broadband Services examined the company's=
 efforts to limit the financial risk in 10 of the unit's business areas. Th=
e report found that half of the areas reviewed had inadequate financial con=
trol; the other half were rated ''satisfactory.'' None of the areas receive=
d the next highest rating, which was ''good.''=20
The Andersen report, in many passages, is critical of the Enron management'=
s ability to keep track of the unit's financial commitments, saying that th=
e company lacked many of the formal procedures that would allow its top off=
icers to spot problems early.=20
An Andersen spokesman declined to comment, saying he did not have a copy of=
 the report. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said that since Andersen serv=
ed as the company's internal auditor, it was the accounting firm's responsi=
bility to detect trouble spots in Enron's financial controls.=20
''As part of that job, they would offer suggestions on how to fix any probl=
ems that they found,'' Mr. Palmer said.=20
Even as the market for broadband capacity and services collapsed in 2000, E=
nron Broadband reported significant gains from equity investments in other =
companies, sales of fiber optic cable among a group of partnerships affilia=
ted with Enron, and other transactions.=20
But in November, when Enron restated its earnings going back to 1997, that =
performance proved illusory. The division's year-end loss of $60 million cl=
imbed to $357 million by the third quarter of 2001, according to S.E.C. fil=
ings.=20
The Andersen analysis found that for its investments in projects involving =
large cash commitments in fixed assets, like a fiber optic network, Enron B=
roadband's ''current conditions indicate informal processes, lack of overal=
l communication and coordination and monitoring controls.''=20
Andersen, which rated the controls for capital projects as ''inadequate,'' =
wrote that there was no formal policy at the company for approving such inv=
estments, and that there was no management process in place to track the st=
atus of projects after they began.=20
The Andersen report also found controls in numerous other areas inadequate.=
 It cited deficiencies that prevented the company from identifying and disp=
osing of obsolete inventory. It also found that the company historically bo=
ught services without proper authorizations or documentation. All told, the=
 report says, the division had no formal procurement policy.=20
Even in the areas where the financial controls were rated as ''satisfactory=
,'' shortcomings were found, according to the Andersen report.=20
In the division's merchant investing business, the report said that Enron e=
xecutives responsible for placing a value on possible investments were not =
always consulted before a decision was made to commit the company's money.=
=20
Moreover, the report said, policies to prevent employees from profiting on =
their knowledge of the division's decisions were inadequate.=20
The report contains a long list of ''management action plans'' to address t=
he problems. But the plans, all of which are labeled ''tentative and prelim=
inary,'' failed to impose the controls that the division needed, former exe=
cutives said.

THE ENRON INQUIRY Former Exec Says Enron Destroyed Documents

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. shredded documents after the company came under fede=
ral investigation, attorneys for shareholders said Monday, and the energy c=
ompany said it would review the allegations.=20
The claim that shredding took place in Enron's accounting offices was made =
Monday by a former Enron executive who was laid off from the company this m=
onth.
The executive, Maureen Castaneda, collected a box of shreddings and will be=
 a witness for plaintiffs suing over stock losses in the Enron collapse, sa=
id attorney William Lerach, who represents a group of shareholders.=20
"Not just one document was destroyed, but it looks like hundreds of thousan=
ds were destroyed."=20
Lerach said he intended to raise the issue at a federal court hearing here =
today.=20
Castaneda, a director in Enron's foreign investments section, said in an in=
terview with ABC News that she witnessed the shredding of documents that be=
gan around Thanksgiving and continued at least until she left the company i=
n the second week of this month.=20
Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, previously acknowledged that thousands o=
f documents related to Enron were shredded by its Houston office. But Casta=
neda is the first to say publicly that Enron destroyed relevant papers.=20
Paul Howes, an attorney working with Lerach, said text was legible in some =
of the shredded documents and included references to controversial partners=
hips such as Jedi II and Chewco. Losses by such off-the-book partnerships p=
layed a key role in triggering Enron's collapse.=20
Based on statements from witnesses, Lerach estimated that possibly hundreds=
 of thousands of documents were destroyed.=20
"We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of docu=
ments," Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney who is representing Enron, sa=
id in a statement issued late Monday.=20
Bennett said Enron had issued "several directives" in October to all employ=
ees saying that "all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pen=
ding litigation."=20
"If anyone violated those directives," Bennett said, "they will be dealt wi=
th appropriately."=20
Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said =
congressional investigators will look into the allegations.=20
"This whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute," he said. "It'=
s one thing to make bad business decisions. It's something else entirely to=
 try to cover up bad business decisions."=20
Howes said fired Enron employees were told to gather their work papers in b=
oxes and turn them over to company officials, who went through them and shr=
edded numerous documents.=20
He said the shredding began with the layoffs triggered by Enron's Dec. 2 de=
claration of bankruptcy, and accelerated during the Christmas and New Year'=
s holidays. He said the shredded documents were dated from at least 1994 th=
rough Dec. 20, 2001.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company does not "have any knowledge o=
f the material that the plaintiffs' attorneys are parading in front of the =
media." But he said that if the allegations prove true, the people responsi=
ble will be fired.=20
The company sent e-mails to employees on Oct. 25, Oct. 26, Oct. 31 and Jan.=
 14 instructing them to retain all documents dealing with "related-party tr=
ansactions, SEC requests, or any Enron transactions or accounting for those=
 transactions," he said.=20
The January e-mail was sent as a reminder after it was revealed that Anders=
en had shredded Enron-related documents.=20
"These e-mails were very specific that employees who did not follow these p=
rocedures were liable for civil or criminal penalties," Palmer said.=20
Palmer confirmed that Castaneda was an employee at Enron who left the compa=
ny in a recent round of layoffs.=20
She was director of "foreign exchange and sovereign risk," analyzing curren=
cy exchange rates and the possibility that companies outside the U.S. would=
 nationalize assets.=20
Phil Schiliro, chief of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a se=
nior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said that if docu=
ments were destroyed, it "raises the real possibility of obstruction of jus=
tice. We need to know if Enron is destroying documents, and if they are, le=
arn what Enron is trying to hide."=20
Though many companies routinely shred old or sensitive documents, business =
experts expressed surprise Monday that Enron might have destroyed key recor=
ds, particularly after the company became the target of numerous lawsuits a=
nd government investigations.=20
On Oct. 22, the company disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on had launched a preliminary inquiry into some of the company's partnershi=
ps.=20
"Under the circumstances, this could be a very serious issue," said Nichola=
s Economides, business professor at New York University's Leonard N. Stern =
School of Business.=20
"'When someone destroys documents, people start wondering what was in those=
 documents," Economides said. "Even if they didn't say something horrible, =
a bad impression remains. And at Enron, there's no justification. Certainly=
 no one could say they destroyed documents because they thought they were u=
nimportant."=20
Former employees reacted with concern and anger to the new charges.=20
"It does take it to a new level," said Maritta Mullet, 58, a 10-year employ=
ee who lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement benefit wh=
en the company crashed. "It's criminal. You just don't destroy evidence."=
=20
The accusations of document shredding at Enron came as congressional invest=
igators continued preparations for a hearing scheduled Thursday into the de=
struction of thousands of documents by Chicago-based Andersen.=20
Congressional investigators said they will issue subpoenas today for key wi=
tnesses who fail to commit to testifying at Thursday's hearing.=20
The House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee turned down an ap=
peal Monday from David B. Duncan for more time to prepare. Duncan was Ander=
sen's lead partner on the Enron account until he was fired last week for al=
legedly destroying documents. Duncan maintains he was following company ord=
ers.=20
"Apparently [Duncan] would like to have more time to refresh his memory abo=
ut events," said Johnson, who works for committee Chairman Rep. W.J. "Billy=
" Tauzin (R-La.).=20
"The bottom line is he will agree to testify by [today] or he will be subpo=
enaed," Johnson said. "All the witnesses have been put on notice that they =
are expected to appear and will face contempt-of-Congress charges and crimi=
nal penalties if they do not."=20
In a letter to the committee Monday, Duncan's attorney, Robert Giuffra, sai=
d it is premature to require his client's testimony. Giuffra said Duncan wa=
nts to review boxes of documents that Andersen gave the committee but has n=
ot yet shared with him.=20
At issue is Andersen's destruction of documents relating to Enron, shreddin=
g that took place even after the accounting firm was aware that the SEC was=
 looking into the company's collapse.=20
In firing Duncan, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chie=
f executive, asserted that the 42-year-old executive had organized the dest=
ruction of records. The firm, he said, would not tolerate "unethical behavi=
or, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies."=20
In private interviews with congressional staffers last week, Duncan and ano=
ther Andersen official, Michael C. Odom, indicated that others at the accou=
nting firm were "at the table" when the memo regarding the destruction of m=
aterial was discussed, one congressional investigator said Monday.=20
Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent a memo Oct. 12 reminding employees of t=
he company's long-standing policy to get rid of nonessential documents.=20
"Duncan and Odom said there were other partners and managers at the table w=
hen the retention policy was handed out," said an investigator, who spoke o=
n the condition of anonymity. "Employees were told to do no less or no more=
 than the policy called for."=20
A month later, and nearly three weeks after Enron disclosed it was the subj=
ect of an SEC probe, Temple wrote another memo instructing company employee=
s to preserve Enron documents. As of late Monday, she was the only one of f=
our Andersen executives summoned who has told investigators she will appear=
 on Capitol Hill for the Thursday hearing.=20
The inquiry has been called to investigate who was involved in the destruct=
ion of evidence, which documents were destroyed and why.=20
Odom, who was in charge of risk management at Andersen's Houston office, wa=
s told Monday that he would be called to testify. The subcommittee also has=
 summoned Berardino, who has been given the option of sending a proxy and w=
ho is familiar with his company's internal investigation into the document =
destruction.=20
In an appearance over the weekend on NBC's "Meet the Press," Berardino did =
not indicate his plans for the hearing.=20
Enron's bankruptcy is widely considered to have the potential to become a p=
olitical scandal because of the donations--almost $6 million over the last =
decade--to both parties from the company's officers, directors, employees a=
nd political action committee. Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief e=
xecutive, was one of President Bush's top donors.=20
A number of legislative efforts have been proposed to prevent a reoccurrenc=
e of Enron's unraveling.=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Monday that she plans to introduce a bil=
l this week that would prohibit accounting firms from also serving as consu=
ltants for the companies they are auditing.=20
The practice, which in the case of Enron allowed Andersen to earn more in c=
onsulting fees than from actual audit charges, has been widely derided in t=
he wake of the bankruptcy as a clear-cut conflict of interest.=20

The Nation Enron's Lay Met With Executive on 'Improprieties,' Lawyer Says A=
ccounting: Sherron Watkins was said to be assured the board was studying th=
e matter. No findings were issued.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay held several meetings in lat=
e October with a vice president who had urged him to clean up a series of "=
improprieties," her lawyer said in an interview Saturday.=20
Lay first met with Sherron S. Watkins, Enron's vice president for corporate=
 development, for half an hour Aug. 22, shortly after she wrote him an anon=
ymous letter detailing her fears that the energy company would "implode in =
a wave of accounting scandals." But Philip Hilder, Watkins' lawyer, said "t=
here were also subsequent meetings in October."
At one of the meetings, Lay told Watkins that the Enron board had formed a =
committee to look into the accounting issues, Hilder said. But he declined =
to provide further details of the meetings, which have not been previously =
reported.=20
By October, the energy company was indeed beginning to implode. On Oct. 16,=
 Enron announced an unexpected charge against earnings of more than $1 bill=
ion. On Oct. 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry. O=
n Oct. 24, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow took a leave of absence. O=
n Oct. 31, the board announced the formation of the special committee, whic=
h has not yet issued any findings.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said Saturday that she had no details about the Lay-Wa=
tkins meetings in October.=20
Hilder also provided a better timeline for how the 42-year-old Watkins disc=
overed and acted on the accounting irregularities, which involved so-called=
 special purpose entities, some of which were based in the Cayman Islands, =
a haven for tax shelters.=20
An eight-year veteran of Enron, Watkins had spent less than two months work=
ing for Fastow when, in the course of reviewing which assets could be sold,=
 she "stumbled across" details on the entities, Hilder said.=20
"The numbers just didn't add up," Hilder said.=20
He said Watkins didn't confront Fastow. "She felt he knew what was going on=
 and, if she confronted him with it, that would have been the end of her at=
 Enron," the lawyer said.=20
When Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling resigned Aug. 14 after only six=
 months on the job, Watkins had her opening. Skilling's abrupt departure fo=
r "personal reasons" stunned the company, and Lay scheduled an Aug. 16 meet=
ing at the Hyatt Regency here for all concerned employees. He invited them =
to submit questions in advance--anonymously, if they wished.=20
Watkins wrote a one-page letter, saying, "Skilling's abrupt departure will =
raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues . . . . I=
 am incredibly nervous."=20
The meeting with employees didn't produce the resolution Watkins wanted, Hi=
lder said, so her next step was to call a friend at Andersen, Enron's accou=
nting firm. "She went to him as a sounding board," Hilder said. "Here she f=
eels she is hanging out all alone. These deals must have been looked at by =
the accountants, maybe the lawyers, the top company brass. She had some dou=
bt that maybe she had gotten it wrong."=20
Watkins ultimately sought and was granted an Aug. 22 meeting with Lay, at w=
hich she gave him a six-page memo that detailed her questions and talked ge=
nerally about the high level of employee worry. "I wish we would get caught=
," she quoted one Enron manager as saying in the memo. "We're such a crooke=
d company."=20
Lay later asked Vinson & Elkins, Enron's principal outside law firm, to con=
duct the review. Watkins had urged him not to hire that firm, saying Vinson=
 & Elkins had a conflict because they had provided opinions on some of the =
deals.=20
By the beginning of September, Watkins had transferred out of Fastow's offi=
ce. On Oct. 15, Vinson & Elkins issued its report, which basically gave the=
 special partnerships a clean bill of health.=20
Watkins' reaction to the report, the lawyer said, "is probably pretty obvio=
us, given her feelings about them looking into the matter . . . ."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE ANGER
Enron Fired Workers for Complaining Online
By ALEX BERENSON

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation fired at least two employees in the last two months f=
or posting information or negative opinions about it on Internet message bo=
ards.=20
One of the fired employees, Clayton Vernon, had asked Kenneth L. Lay, Enron=
's chairman, during an earlier internal online discussion whether Enron had=
 used aggressive accounting to overstate its profits. It is unclear whether=
 Mr. Vernon's question to Mr. Lay, which came in September, two months befo=
re he was dismissed, played any role in his firing. But a coarsely worded m=
essage critical of Mr. Lay that Mr. Vernon posted in November under a scree=
n alias was traced back to him in less than a day.
The second fired employee, according to Enron, was the person who revealed =
in early December on the Internet that Enron had paid $55 million in retent=
ion bonuses to top managers and executives just before it filed for bankrup=
tcy protection and laid off 4,000 workers on Dec. 2. The bonuses were sharp=
ly criticized by Enron employees, many of whom had their retirement savings=
 wiped out by Enron's collapse. Enron declined to identify the second fired=
 employee.=20
Enron also declined to comment on any other details of the two firings, and=
 it would not say whether it had dismissed any other employees because of I=
nternet postings. Mr. Vernon confirmed that he had been fired for postings =
that the company viewed as offensive.=20
''We're not going to discuss internal security actions,'' said Mark Palmer,=
 a spokesman for Enron. ''But we will say that we will protect very vigorou=
sly the corporation's property.''=20
Both firings involved material posted in an online forum about Enron on Yah=
oo, whose message boards are among the most heavily used on the Internet.=
=20
It was not clear how Enron identified the employees behind the postings. Pe=
ople who post messages on Yahoo often believe that they cannot be traced if=
 they do not use their real names. But many companies have the technical me=
ans to track the online activities of employees who use company computers a=
nd servers.=20
In addition, Yahoo's privacy policy allows it to disclose personal informat=
ion about people who post messages that it deems abusive or ''invasive of a=
nother's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionab=
le,'' or that reveals confidential corporate data.=20
Even so, a Yahoo spokeswoman said Yahoo had not given Enron any information=
 about anyone who posted a message. Despite the disclaimer in its privacy p=
olicy, she said, Yahoo generally divulges personal information about users =
only in response to a court order.=20
In any case, Enron apparently had little difficulty finding Mr. Vernon, who=
 posted most of his messages from the company's Houston headquarters, where=
 he worked designing computer-based models to estimate the value of Enron's=
 energy trades.=20
A native of Midland, Tex., who describes himself as a political progressive=
, Mr. Vernon said that when he joined Enron in December 1999, he hoped that=
 the company would be diverse and a meritocracy.=20
But in the course of two years working at Enron, he said, he ''realized it =
was just another Houston, Texas, corrupt thing -- that we grow in this town=
 -- where the rich white Republicans think they can write any law they want=
 to at any time.''=20
His frustration grew, he said, when Mr. Lay took part in an online chat wit=
hin the company on Sept. 26 and brushed off Mr. Vernon's question about the=
 way Enron had accounted for deals it had made with supposedly independent =
partnerships. Enron began to collapse after it became known in November tha=
t it had used the partnerships to overstate earnings by at least $600 milli=
on.=20
By mid-November, with Enron's stock plunging, Mr. Vernon had begun to post =
dozens of messages a day on the Yahoo discussion board under the screen nam=
e ''utlonghornsrule,'' referring to the University of Texas, where he recei=
ved a master's degree in economics.=20
His messages warned investors away from Enron's stock, and many sharply cri=
ticized Enron and Mr. Lay. ''We were just sitting there with nothing to do,=
'' Mr. Vernon said of the period when he posted the messages. ''We were jus=
t sitting there watching our stocks go down.''=20
The final straw for him came Nov. 19, he said, when Enron canceled its Chri=
stmas party. At 5:16 p.m. that day, in a (not always grammatical) message s=
prinkled with vulgarities, Mr. Vernon wrote that Mr. Lay had ''just cancell=
ed the Enron christmas party so he wouldn't have to show up for his own par=
ty with armed bodyguards.''=20
He went on, ''Lied and said employees were ambivalent. Trust me, nobody bel=
ieves a word'' that Mr. Lay says, the posting said, using a vulgar epithet.=
 ''People have enjoyed the company spending a few dollars on them and givin=
g them a chance to laugh and dance a bit. Esp since most of us adore our co=
workers.=20
''Ken Lay is the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been associated with,=
 a truly evil and satanic figure.''=20
Other people quickly posted responses defending Mr. Lay, including one who =
wrote, ''1) You are an embarrassment to UT -- so shut up. 2) You don't know=
 what you are talking about -- You don't run with the big dogs.'' Mr. Verno=
n said the style of that note led him to think that it was the work of a se=
nior Enron employee.=20
It did not take long for Enron to find out the identity of ''utlonghornsrul=
e.'' The day after his vituperative posting, Mr. Vernon said, he was called=
 into a meeting with his manager and a top human resources officer. ''My bo=
ss said, 'What were you doing?' and I said, 'I was frustrated,' '' Mr. Vern=
on said. ''They escorted me out immediately.'' He said he had been paid his=
 salary, but no severance pay.=20
Mr. Vernon said he understood why he was fired. ''I was using their equipme=
nt,'' he said, ''I was in their building, and it was a flagrant violation o=
f company policy to do what I did. I'm not going to litigate it. I don't th=
ink it was unfair.''=20
He does not see himself as a whistle-blower, he said, and he is embarrassed=
 by the language his anger led him to use -- but he is still angry.

Murky Waters: A Primer on Enron Partnerships --- As Details Surface, They A=
ppear Central In Firm's Collapse
By John R. Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith

With names such as Marlin and Rawhide, Braveheart and Raptor, they sound li=
ke fancy bar drinks or maybe top-secret military missions.=20
They are, in fact, a few of the myriad entities that Enron Corp. helped set=
 up over the past decade and that now find themselves at the heart of one o=
f the biggest corporate scandals in history. Government investigators are s=
till sifting through the complex financial structures of these partnerships=
, limited-liability companies and other affiliates -- domestic and foreign =
-- trying to determine what, if any, accounting rules and laws may have bee=
n violated.
At this stage, many details remain murky. But one thing is certain: The par=
tnerships -- which Enron often told investors little or nothing about -- hi=
d hundreds of millions of dollars of losses and debt from public view. As i=
nformation about the partnerships began surfacing, they were a major factor=
 in the company's filing for bankruptcy-court protection in December.=20
Here is a primer on what is known so far:=20

Q: Why did Enron create the limited partnerships and related entities?=20
A: Several reasons. By setting up partnerships, partly owned by the company=
, Enron could draw in capital from outside investors, such as banks, insura=
nce companies, pension funds and even wealthy individuals. If structured pr=
operly, including at least 3% of their equity obtained from outside investo=
rs, the partnerships could also be kept separate from Enron. As a result, a=
ny debt incurred by the partnership could be kept off the company's balance=
 sheet. This was an important consideration for a fast-growing energy-tradi=
ng company that feared too much debt would damage its credit rating. Anothe=
r, more personal incentive arose over time as Enron executives headed and p=
artly owned some of the partnerships, which provided a lucrative source of =
outside income for those involved. For instance, Enron has said that its fo=
rmer chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, made more than $30 million fro=
m two partnerships that he ran.=20

Q: How many partnerships were there?=20
A: Many hundreds, and perhaps even thousands, though the exact number isn't=
 known. In all, Enron had about 3,500 subsidiaries and affiliates, many of =
them limited partnerships and limited-liability companies, which are a sort=
 of hybrid between corporations and partnerships. Many of the limited partn=
erships were of the plain-vanilla variety and very much like those set up b=
y other energy companies as a way to spread their risk. In the partnerships=
' simplest form, Enron and outside partners would each put up money to inve=
st in specific projects, such as a pipeline or power plant, and then split =
any profits when the partnership ended. It isn't clear how many of these pa=
rtnerships made money and how many didn't.=20

Q: Were there partnerships that were more complicated?=20
A: Yes, and increasingly so as time went on. In some of these partnerships,=
 Enron parked assets that were troubled and falling in value, such as certa=
in overseas energy facilities or stock in companies that had been spun off =
to the public by Enron. Putting the assets in the partnerships hid losses t=
hat Enron otherwise would have had to report. But there was a price to pay =
for this. Enron in some cases promised to compensate partnership investors =
down the road, often by issuing them Enron stock. As the value of the asset=
s in the partnerships fell, the burden of meeting these down-the-road oblig=
ations became ever larger. Compounding the problem, Enron's stock price was=
 falling as part of the broad stock-market retreat over much of last year.=
=20
Conversely, some of the partnerships were used to produce large bursts of e=
arnings for Enron through the use of complex financial transactions. In one=
 case, involving the partnership Braveheart, Enron booked more than $100 mi=
llion of income over a six-month period from a venture that never really go=
t off the ground; Braveheart was part of a plan to deliver movies to homes =
over Enron's high-speed fiber-optic network, but the venture was in its inf=
ancy and never made it beyond the test phase. Enron later had to remove tho=
se earnings from income. Recently, Enron has had to take hundreds of millio=
ns of dollars in charges to earnings from other partnerships that it had pr=
eviously been adding to the company's reported income.=20

Q: So were these the partnership problems that helped sink Enron?=20
A: Eventually. But the crisis was triggered by disclosures concerning three=
 outside partnerships that were run and partly owned by Enron executives. T=
he three were Chewco Investments LP, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment L=
P. The last two were started in 1999 and run by Mr. Fastow, who was Enron's=
 CFO until last October.=20

Q: What are the concerns over partnerships run by executives?=20
A: Conflict of interest is the biggest worry. The partnerships did hundreds=
 of millions of dollars of transactions with Enron itself, in some cases bu=
ying assets from the company or selling assets to it. The problem is this: =
Where do the executives' loyalties lie? Are they trying to negotiate the be=
st deal for the company that employs them and the shareholders who own the =
company, or the best deal for the partnership where they have an ownership =
stake?=20

Q: Why would Enron's board of directors allow such a situation to occur?=20
A: The reason the company and its board gave for approving these executive-=
run partnerships was speed. By having people intimately familiar with Enron=
's complex operations run the partnerships, the entities supposedly could m=
ake much quicker decisions about whether to take part in a particular trans=
action. This nimbleness, it was argued, could benefit both the company and =
the partnerships. To protect itself in dealings with these partnerships, th=
e company says that it set up safeguards that required top company officers=
 and the board to review and approve deals between Enron and the partnershi=
ps.=20

Q: Did the safeguards work?=20
A: In the end, certainly not for Enron shareholders. There are also some qu=
estions as to whether the executive-run partnerships received favored treat=
ment. For example, internal documents from the LJM2 partnership indicate th=
at on at least one occasion, the partnership renegotiated a deal that saved=
 it millions of dollars, seemingly at Enron's expense. Like others, these e=
xecutive-run partnerships were used to keep debt and losing ventures off En=
ron's books. Yet an even bigger problem these particular partnerships posed=
 for Enron was one of perception. Critics say they seem to be evidence of a=
 company that tolerated self-dealing by its own executives. When public att=
ention started focusing on these partnerships in October, it opened the doo=
rs to concerns about a raft of problems facing Enron that were buried in it=
s complex web of partnerships. With all this attention, investor confidence=
 in Enron collapsed like a sandcastle at floodtide, and by December the com=
pany found itself forced to file for bankruptcy-court protection.=20

Q: Had Enron been keeping these partnerships secret?=20
A: There is scant, if any, public information on many of the hundreds, or e=
ven thousands, of Enron-related financial entities. And even in cases where=
 there was disclosure, the details were often limited and some of the discl=
osure came belatedly. Chewco, for instance, was created in 1997 but didn't =
show up in any Enron Securities and Exchange Commission filings until last =
November. At that time, the company revealed that it had improperly account=
ed for dealings with the partnership and, as a result, was lopping off near=
ly $400 million, or more than 10%, from its reported earnings for the prior=
 four years. Enron said Chewco and a related partnership shouldn't have bee=
n treated as separate entities and therefore couldn't have been engaged in =
third-party deals with the company. Because the LJM partnerships were run b=
y a senior-enough Enron executive, the CFO, the company dutifully noted the=
ir existence in SEC filings over the past two-plus years. But the company's=
 descriptions of the partnership dealings were so complicated as to be prac=
tically indecipherable.=20

Q: So, should people in a position to know have called attention to the pot=
ential problems posed by the partnerships?=20
A: Yes, any number could have and should have, critics say. Arthur Andersen=
, as Enron's accounting firm from 1985 forward, was intimately involved in =
the company's financial strategy. As auditor, it was entrusted to make sure=
 Enron's reports were free of material misstatements, according to accounti=
ng standards, and fairly represented the company's financial condition. But=
 Andersen itself was potentially conflicted since it operated as inside acc=
ountant, outside auditor and consultant to Enron, reaping tens of millions =
of dollars a year in fees.=20
Enron's outside lawyers, led by the Houston firm Vinson & Elkins, reviewed =
many deals that now look suspect. The SEC was supposed to review Enron's fi=
nancial statements. But the SEC's former chief accountant Lynn Turner said =
last week that the agency was so busy reviewing the flood of initial public=
 offerings from new companies in the 1990s that it didn't have the resource=
s to fully scrutinize more-established companies. And in a 1994 decision, t=
he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it didn't have the obligation =
or authority to review wholesale energy-trading operations like the one run=
 by Enron.=20
As FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell said recently, "Everyone who has touched=
 Enron should be looking in the mirror."=20
--- The Art of the Enron Deal

Enron used outside partnerships to monetize assets and move debt off
its balance sheet. But the company at times was deeply involved in
funding the partnerships. Here is how such transactions in recent
years were typically structured:

1. Enron transfers asset to special-purpose entity, or partnership,
to move the asset and debt off its balance sheet and to recognize a
gain from the transfer.

2. Outside investor injects at least 3% of partnership's capital.
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board rules, a 3% outside
investment allows Enron not to classify the partnership as a
subsidiary.

3. In some cases it appears Enron helped provide some or all of the
3% of capital injected by the outside investor.

4. Banks typically loan up to 97% of capital needed by the
partnership. The partnership is expected to repay the loan from cash
generated by the Enron assets it acquires or through the sale of
assets upon liquidation of the partnership.

5. Enron guarantees bank loan, in some cases with Enron shares or a
pledge to make up any shortfall. As the company's fortunes declined
last year, these guarantees were sometimes in the form of cash.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MARKET PLACE
For Chief, $200 Million Wasn't Quite Enough Cash
By FLOYD NORRIS

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Over three years starting in 1999, Kenneth L. Lay has reported receiving mo=
re than $200 million either from Enron directly or through exercising stock=
 options. Yet, his lawyer now says, he was forced to borrow millions more f=
rom the company last year to meet his obligations.=20
The disclosure of Mr. Lay's financial problems, made by Earl Silbert, his p=
ersonal lawyer, was aimed at countering the impression that Mr. Lay, Enron'=
s chairman and chief executive, might have disposed of Enron stock in late =
August because he feared a collapse of the company.
Instead, the new information could leave an impression that his personal in=
vestments produced very large losses that he was unable to support despite =
his large income from Enron.=20
Assuming that Mr. Silbert is correct, Mr. Lay joins a short list of chief e=
xecutives whose pay in the 1990's was astronomical, and who ended up with s=
evere financial problems because they borrowed too heavily against assets w=
hose high value proved to be temporary. The others known to have such probl=
ems are Bernard J. Ebbers, the chief executive of WorldCom, whose margin lo=
ans were guaranteed by the company and whose shares are now worth less than=
 he owes, and Steven Hilbert, the former chief executive of Conseco, who bo=
ught Conseco shares with money borrowed from the company before the stock p=
rice collapsed and he was fired.=20
Mr. Lay appears to have parlayed his paper gains in Enron to buy other secu=
rities that also declined in value. His known investments, which are no dou=
bt only a fraction of the actual investments, were concentrated in areas th=
at did well when the stock market was soaring and have since suffered. They=
 include stakes in Compaq Computer, i2 Technologies and NewPower Holdings.=
=20
In fact, Mr. Silbert indicated that Mr. Lay first repaid a company loan wit=
h stock last February. Enron was then selling for more than $68 a share, so=
 it appears that the sale was forced by the declining value of Mr. Lay's ot=
her investments.=20
Just how much Mr. Lay is now worth is unclear. Nor is it clear how much, if=
 any, money he still owes, or just what expenditures would have caused him =
to go through so much money so quickly. But his stake in Enron, which consi=
sts mostly of stock options, is now worthless after the collapse of the com=
pany.=20
Mr. Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which Mr. Sil=
bert said was raised to $7.5 million at some point in 2001. He said that Mr=
. Lay took out money from that loan, and then repaid it, on 15 separate occ=
asions from February through October.=20
In each case, he repaid it by turning over stock to Enron. He appears to ha=
ve obtained some of those shares by exercising options, while in other case=
s he returned shares he already owned. Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay took out th=
e loans from the company when he expected that he was likely to face margin=
 calls from other lenders.=20
If those 15 repayments averaged $4 million, then they totaled $60 million, =
which would represent the value of stock he returned to the company. Mr. Si=
lbert declined to give exact figures, and formal disclosure of the transact=
ions is not required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules until Feb.=
 14.=20
From 1999 through 2001, Mr. Lay received salary and cash bonuses from Enron=
 totaling more than $17.1 million. That figure does not include a salary fo=
r 2001, although he was supposed to earn $1.3 million. Presumably, it was p=
aid until the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 3.=20
But he brought in far more from cashing in his stock and options in the com=
pany. In 1999, Enron filings show, he realized $43.8 million from cashing i=
n stock options. The next year, he realized $123.4 million from that source=
. And his filings show that he earned a profit of $20.7 million from cashin=
g in options and selling stock in the first seven months of 2001.=20
All told, that amounts to about $205 million over those three years. But th=
at was not enough. According to Mr. Silbert, the loan proceeds from the com=
pany were needed when other loans needed to be paid.=20
Mr. Lay has also sought to raise cash from other sources. Late last year Mr=
. Lay put up for sale several houses and properties he owns in Aspen, Colo.=
=20
Functionally, disposing of stock by using it to pay off loans is the same a=
s selling the stock. But legally it differs in two ways, although it is not=
 clear which, if either, was important to Mr. Lay.=20
The first is that while normal sales of stock by a top corporate official m=
ust be disclosed quickly, within 10 days of the month in which the sale was=
 made, the return of stock to a company to repay a loan need not be disclos=
ed until the next year.=20
The second concerns the sanctions against insider trading. In general, an e=
xecutive is barred from buying or selling his company's stock when he has m=
aterial nonpublic information. But transactions are not barred if the entit=
y on the other side of the trade has the same information.=20
''If he is selling it back to the company, the company may have the same in=
formation he had,'' said Jack Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbi=
a. He said that while a prosecutor could argue that the board did not have =
the information, and therefore the company did not have it, it would be a d=
ifficult case to prove.=20
There is one other exception to insider trading rules, stemming from a rule=
 issued by the S.E.C. in 2000. An executive may adopt a plan to sell stock =
regularly and then sell stock pursuant to it even after learning of materia=
l nonpublic information. But no such plan can be filed by an executive afte=
r he or she obtains such information, unless the information is made public=
.=20
Mr. Lay took advantage of that rule repeatedly in 2001, filing plans to sel=
l stock for three-month periods. His last plan expired at the end of July, =
by which time he had taken in $29.9 million from selling shares and earned =
a profit of $20.7 million. The share price had fallen to $45.35 by the end =
of the month.=20
After that, Mr. Lay did not file a new plan and has not reported selling an=
y additional shares in public markets. ''The reason he stopped selling was =
that he thought the stock was going to go up,'' a lawyer for Enron, Robert =
S. Bennett, said last week.=20
After July 31, there was no shortage of news affecting Enron. On Aug. 14, J=
effrey Skilling resigned as Enron's president and chief executive, leading =
to Mr. Lay's reassuming the chief executive title he had surrendered earlie=
r in the year. The next day, Sherron S. Watkins, an Enron employee, wrote t=
o Mr. Lay of her concerns about the company's accounting, expressing the pr=
escient fear that ''we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.''=20
In October, the last month that Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay repaid a company l=
oan by turning in stock, Enron's report on third-quarter results set off an=
 avalanche of bad publicity that led to the company's unraveling over the n=
ext month. The S.E.C. inquiry also began in October.=20
By repeatedly borrowing from Enron, and then turning in stock to repay the =
loan, Mr. Lay was taking out cash directly from the company when the compan=
y's need for cash was growing.=20
Had he exercised options and sold the stock to the public as he sought to p=
ay his debts, Enron would have gained cash that now could be used to pay cr=
editors. As it is, there is less cash available for that.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: TRANSACTIONS AT ISSUE
ENRON CHIEF SAYS HIS SALE OF STOCK WAS TO PAY LOANS
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 -- Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive of =
the Enron Corporation, repeatedly used millions of dollars in Enron stock t=
o repay loans made to him by the company last year as Enron shares declined=
 in value, his lawyer said today.=20
The lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Lay had=
 put up shares of his Enron stock as collateral for other investments, whic=
h he said he could not identify. As the value of Enron stock plummeted last=
 year, he said, Mr. Lay anticipated that lenders would demand additional co=
llateral.
So Mr. Lay's decision to dispose of Enron shares late in the year reflected=
 a need to raise cash, not a concern about the health of Enron, and was not=
 tied to a warning about the company's finances made by an Enron vice presi=
dent, Mr. Silbert said today. He added that the majority of the transaction=
s related to the credit had occurred before August. Three months later, Enr=
on restated earnings and began its spiral into bankruptcy.=20
On at least 15 occasions between February and October of last year, Mr. Sil=
bert said, Mr. Lay returned shares in Enron to the company to repay $4 mill=
ion he had received through a credit line.=20
Each time the loan was repaid, Mr. Silbert said, Mr. Lay subsequently borro=
wed the amount available and used a substantial portion of it to repay some=
 of the money owed on his other investments. Sometime last year, the credit=
 line was increased to $7.5 million, Mr. Silbert said, adding that he did n=
ot know if Mr. Lay still owed any money to Enron.=20
If Mr. Lay is facing financial difficulties, he went through an extraordina=
ry amount of money during the years when Enron was riding high. From 1989 t=
hrough 2001, the total of his salary, bonuses and profits from stock option=
s topped $300 million, with most of that coming from 1998 through 2000.=20
Some of the nation's wealthiest men found themselves in trouble last year, =
after they either invested at the height of the market mania or failed to t=
ake profits and reduce their debt in good times, a mistake that became appa=
rent when technology stocks in particular plunged in value.=20
For example, some members of the Bass family of Texas sold shares in Disney=
 to raise some cash last year, and Craig McCaw, the telecommunications entr=
epreneur who foresaw the cellular phone market, has put up for sale houses,=
 yachts, a wine collection and even an island as his holdings have declined=
 in value.=20
Much of Mr. Lay's fortune was in Enron stock and options, now worthless, bu=
t his overall investment portfolio is unknown.=20
Late last year, he still owned about $8 million in stock in Compaq and Eli =
Lilly, and he has several properties. But around the time of Enron's demise=
, he put some property on the market and began selling some of those Compaq=
 and Lilly shares as well.=20
Late last year, Mr. Lay put up for sale several houses and properties he ow=
ns in Aspen, Colo., the exclusive ski resort.=20
Lawmakers and Enron employees have harshly criticized Mr. Lay for promoting=
 Enron's stock as the company's finances grew increasingly shaky last fall.=
 In one case, Mr. Lay used an online chat on Sept. 26 to urge employees to =
buy Enron shares, telling them that the stock was ''an incredible bargain''=
 and predicting that the value of the company would increase 800 percent or=
 more in the next decade.=20
The recent disclosure that Mr. Lay returned some stock to the company to re=
pay a loan has fueled concern that he was exiting his position as he was en=
couraging others to buy.=20
Another lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, who represents Enron, previously disclos=
ed that Mr. Lay used some stock to repay a loan late last year.=20
Mr. Lay exercised options on Aug. 20 and 21, which was shortly after a comp=
any vice president, Sherron S. Watkins, warned him that the company might '=
'implode in a wave of accounting scandals.''=20
She said it was in danger of being found out as an ''elaborate accounting h=
oax.''=20
Today, Mr. Silbert acknowledged that around Aug. 21, Mr. Lay disposed of so=
me stock by using it to repay a loan. He emphasized that the disposal of th=
ose shares had nothing to do with the warning from Ms. Watkins. He also sai=
d that Mr. Lay exercised options to acquire 68,000 shares on Aug. 21, and h=
e still owns those shares.=20
When Mr. Lay faced a financial strain, Mr. Silbert said, he took the course=
 that showed the most confidence in the company. ''When the stock of Enron =
went down and the value of the collateral went down,'' Mr. Silbert said, ''=
you had two choices: sell the Enron stock, or pay down the loan. And he cho=
se to pay down the loan rather than sell off his stock.''=20
Mr. Silbert said that Mr. Lay's faith in Enron was also evident in how he h=
ad diversified his portfolio. To make other investments, Mr. Lay put up sha=
res of Enron and borrowed against them -- instead of selling the shares and=
 paying in cash. That reflected Mr. Lay's belief that the Enron stock would=
 appreciate, Mr. Silbert said.=20
The transactions between Mr. Lay and Enron will be included in regular fili=
ngs with the Securities and Exchange Commission next month.=20
Proxies filed early last year showed that Mr. Lay had significant holdings =
in four companies in addition to Enron. That five-stock portfolio was a poo=
r performer last year as the overall stock market sagged. The best stock in=
 the group fell nearly 16 percent in 2001, while the worst two lost nearly =
all their value.=20
Mr. Lay, who recently resigned from the boards of Compaq and Eli Lilly, sol=
d stock in those two companies, the best performers, in the final days of O=
ctober.=20
He acquired 10,000 shares in Lilly in February at $74.13 a share and sold 1=
0,000 shares at a small profit, for $77.75 apiece, in October. He sold near=
ly 125,000 shares of Compaq for $1.15 million at the end of October. Combin=
ed, those sales generated nearly $2 million.=20
Along with his dwindling stake in Enron, whose stock plunged from $83 at th=
e beginning of the year to under a dollar after its filing for bankruptcy, =
Mr. Lay's stakes dwindled in NewPower, which Enron helped finance, and i2 T=
echnologies, which provides business-to-business Internet solutions. Shares=
 of NewPower have lost nearly all of their value, and i2's shares fell 85 p=
ercent last year.=20
In early 2001, Mr. Lay sold Enron shares on every business day, shares he h=
ad acquired by exercising options. Cumulatively, he made a profit of $21 mi=
llion on those sales. Enron's stock had fallen from a high of $90.75 to hal=
f that amount, $45.35, at the end of July, when Mr. Lay stopped selling sha=
res.=20
''The reason he stopped selling was that he thought the stock was going to =
go up,'' Mr. Bennett said earlier this month.=20
After turning down previous requests, Mr. Lay has agreed to testify on Feb.=
 4 before a Senate Commerce subcommittee, which is investigating Enron's co=
llapse, Mr. Silbert said yesterday.=20
In all, at least 10 Congressional committees are investigating Enron. The f=
irst hearings begin Thursday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committ=
ee and a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The House=
 hearing will focus on Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, which admitted las=
t week that employees shredded Enron-related documents beginning in late Oc=
tober, after the disclosure of a government investigation into Enron.=20
Today, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of one subcomm=
ittee investigating the company, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'=
' that in the wake of Enron's collapse, Congress would have to ''significan=
tly tighten'' the nation's securities laws, giving the S.E.C. broad new pow=
ers.=20
Citing the disclosure last week that Enron paid no income taxes in four of =
the last five years, Mr. Levin also said, ''We've got to change our tax law=
s.''=20
On NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardin=
o, said that Enron had collapsed because ''its business model failed.''=20
In an interview today, the lawyer for Ms. Watkins, Philip Hilder, said his =
client had been contacted by federal officials about testifying. Mr. Hilder=
 said no date had been set, and he declined to elaborate on which governmen=
t authorities had contacted her. In addition to Congress, the Justice Depar=
tment and the S.E.C. are also investigating Enron's collapse.=20
Mr. Hilder said his client had initially complained to Mr. Lay by anonymous=
ly dropping a one-page note into a suggestion box. Mr. Lay had invited empl=
oyees to leave their concerns in the box after Jeffrey Skilling, the chief =
executive, had unexpectedly resigned on Aug. 14. Those concerns were discus=
sed at an employees' meeting led by Mr. Lay on Aug. 16 at a downtown Housto=
n hotel.=20
But Mr. Hilder said his client had not been satisfied that her complaint ha=
d been fully addressed so had taken up Mr. Lay's offer to meet personally w=
ith any employee. According to documents released by Congressional investig=
ators, her meeting with Mr. Lay was scheduled by Aug. 20, and they met on A=
ug. 22.=20
''His response was that he would have the matter investigated,'' Mr. Hilder=
 said. ''He treated her with courtesy and was very professional.''=20
By the end of October, Mr. Hilder said, Ms. Watkins had two meetings with M=
r. Lay in his 50th-floor office of the Enron skyscraper in Houston. During =
one meeting, Mr. Lay told her the company had created a special committee t=
o investigate its financial problems. Mr. Hilder, while declining to offer =
details, suggested that the primary topic of conversation had been Ms. Watk=
ins's memorandum.=20
''They were following up with concerns that she had previously raised,'' he=
 said.

Lay sold off Enron stock to pay loans
Spokesman: Enron chairman wasn't bailing out on company=20
By DAVID IVANOVICH=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20

WASHINGTON -- Chairman Ken Lay repeatedly sold his Enron stock to pay off l=
ines of credit advanced to him by the corporation, not because he had lost =
faith in the company, an Enron spokesman said Monday.=20
Critics have pointed to Lay's frequent stock sales in questioning whether t=
he company's senior executives knew the energy and trading giant was in fin=
ancial peril.=20
But company officials contend Lay was merely liquidating some stock he was =
awarded as part of his compensation.=20
"Throughout the year, Ken was using a company-provided line of credit," Enr=
on spokesman Mark Palmer said Monday.=20
"The line of credit was for Ken to use as he saw fit. It's a form of compen=
sation and quite common in large corporations for a CEO to have a line of c=
redit available to him.=20
"Of course, Ken had to pay it back, under a certain term and at a certain i=
nterest rate," Palmer said.=20
Lay repaid those lines of credit using some of his Enron stock holdings.=20
Since the price of Enron's stock fell through much of the year, he had to c=
ough up more and more shares to repay the same loan amount.=20
Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, told the New York Times that on 15 occasio=
ns between February and October, Lay returned Enron shares to repay $4 mill=
ion he had received through a line of credit.=20
That credit line was later expanded to $7.5 million, the Times reported. Si=
lbert could not be reached for comment Monday.=20
Silbert said Lay also had put up shares of his stock as collateral on other=
 investments, which he would not identify. As the Enron stock price continu=
ed to fall, Lay anticipated his lenders would require additional shares.=20
In November, Lay and his wife, Linda, put three of their four Aspen, Colo.,=
 properties up for sale, seeking a total of $16.2 million, a Colorado real =
estate broker said.=20
Lay's stock sales, however, were not all related to repaying lines of credi=
t or other debts.=20
Like many CEOs, Lay would sell a portion of the stock he got as part of his=
 compensation, Palmer said. But he stopped at the end of July because he th=
ought Enron's stock at that time was undervalued, Palmer said.=20
"I know that he bought and held Enron stock in July and August -- stock tha=
t he still holds today," Palmer said.=20
Lay exercised options to acquire 25,000 shares of Enron stock on Aug. 20 fo=
r $20.78 a share or a total of $519,500, company records show. The next day=
, he acquired another 68,620 shares at $21.56 a share, for a total value of=
 nearly $1.48 million.=20
By the time Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection on Dec. =
2, Lay still held about 75 percent to 80 percent of his previous Enron stoc=
k holdings, Palmer said.=20
Jon Crystal, a senior partner in the executive search firm SpencerStuart's =
Houston office, agreed that granting a top executive a line of credit is a =
fairly common corporate practice.=20
Often, these lines of credit are parceled out to help executives buy compan=
y shares. The idea is that an executive who owns a sizable stake in the com=
pany will share his stockholders' financial interests.=20
Sometimes, a company might forgo requiring the executive to pay interest on=
 the loan or even forgive the loan outright as a form of additional compens=
ation, Crystal said.=20
Lay's habit of taking out a line of credit, paying off the debt and then ta=
king out another loan is more unusual, said John Challenger, chief executiv=
e officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement f=
irm.=20
"The question is what kind of oversight was there," Challenger said. Such a=
n amount of activity "might stir up some warning signals."=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: TEXAS JUDGE
Enron Ruling By Nominee To U.S. Court Is Being Noticed
By JIM YARDLEY

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 21 -- A Texas Supreme Court justice who has been nominated by=
 President Bush to fill a vacant federal judgeship could face a fierce Sena=
te confirmation fight because her critics say she once wrote an opinion tha=
t saved the Enron Corporation about $15 million after accepting campaign co=
ntributions from the company.=20
Liberal groups, who had already opposed the nomination of the justice, Pris=
cilla Owen, because of her conservative voting record, now plan to use her =
connections to Enron to try to derail her nomination.
''I think the combination of campaign contributions from Enron and the fact=
 that she ruled clearly in Enron's favor in that case could be a subject of=
 significant concern by the committee,'' said Elliot M. Mincberg, legal dir=
ector of People for the American Way, a liberal group that monitors judicia=
l nominations.=20
Justice Owen, 47, could not be reached for comment. She is considered by le=
gal analysts in Texas to be among the most conservative members of the Texa=
s Supreme Court, which, in turn, is considered one of the nation's most con=
servative supreme courts. Last year, Mr. Bush nominated her for a seat on t=
he United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Senate Judicia=
ry Committee has not scheduled a hearing for Justice Owen.=20
Unlike many other states, Texas elects its judges, and candidates in compet=
itive state Supreme Court races can spend more than $1 million on a race. J=
ustice Owen was elected in 1994, and Enron's political action committee and=
 executives gave her $8,600. In 1996, Justice Owen's critics note that she =
wrote the majority opinion in a unanimous decision that reversed a lower co=
urt order and reduced by about $15 million the amount of school taxes paid =
by Enron.=20
A study released last month by Texans for Public Justice, a nonprofit group=
 that tracks campaign contributions in Texas, found that since 1993, Enron =
has contributed $134,058 to members of the state Supreme Court, including t=
he donation to Justice Owen. That total was the most donated by any corpora=
tion.=20
The study found that Enron had a high success rate on cases before the cour=
t. In three cases brought by Enron, the court ruled in its favor twice. In =
three cases brought against Enron, the court ruled in the company's favor e=
ach time.=20
''Texas's high court judges are all tainted by campaign-related conflicts o=
f interest,'' said Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice. '=
'Two months ago, Bush might have been able to put an Enron judge on the app=
eals court. But he's not likely to get away with it now.''=20
Justice Owen, who attended Baylor College of Law, has often been considered=
 a member of the Texas court's conservative bloc, led by Justice Nathan Hec=
ht. As governor, Mr. Bush appointed four justices to vacant seats on the Su=
preme Court, all of whom were considered by legal analysts to be more moder=
ate than Justice Owen.=20
Dick Trabulsi, chairman of the political action committee for Texans Agains=
t Lawsuit Reform, a conservative judicial reform group, said any criticism =
of Justice Owen because she sided with Enron was misguided. ''We think it's=
 very unfair in a state that elects judges to be making connections between=
 the way a judge rules and a donation that is made,'' he said.=20
''We have always found she exercises exceptional judgment,'' he added, call=
ing her a person of integrity.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PROSECUTOR
A Specialist in Tough Cases Steps Into the Legal Tangle
By JO THOMAS

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 -- Leslie R. Caldwell, the Federal prosecutor who will ove=
rsee the day-to-day investigation of the collapse of Enron, has an eye for =
corporate books that have been cooked and defendants who will talk, her for=
mer colleagues say.=20
At 44, she has been involved in more than 50 jury trials and big, complicat=
ed investigations, first in Brooklyn. Later in San Francisco, she became in=
volved when stockholders of McKesson HBOC lost $9 billion as share prices f=
ell nearly 50 percent in one day.
In September 2000, when Ms. Caldwell announced the indictments of the forme=
r co-presidents of HBO and Company, a Georgia medical software company, on =
charges that they had used undisclosed agreements and sham sales to inflate=
 the company's sales and profits before selling it to McKesson, a distribut=
or of prescription drugs, she minced no words.=20
''I'm hoping cases like this will send a message to corporate boardrooms an=
d suites that they actually could go to jail for this,'' she said. ''This i=
sn't just managing your numbers or tweaking accounts here and there. This i=
s putting your whole company at risk, and if you do that, there are going t=
o be serious consequences.''=20
Ms. Caldwell, who is chief of the securities fraud division of the United S=
tates attorney's office in San Francisco, will eventually set up offices in=
 Washington and Houston. Almost all of the members of the legal staff of th=
e United States attorney in Houston have been disqualified because they are=
 acquainted with Enron employees, so Ms. Caldwell and the task force of law=
yers she is still recruiting will find office space somewhere else in the c=
ity.=20
In the meantime, she is working from what Matthew J. Jacobs, an assistant U=
nited States attorney in San Francisco, described as a virtual office, ''wh=
erever the action is.''=20
This week she will be in Washington, where Larry D. Thompson, the deputy at=
torney general, is in charge of the inquiry. Attorney General John Ashcroft=
 has recused himself. The department is expected to assemble as many as 10 =
prosecutors to work under Ms. Caldwell on the Enron investigation, which is=
 likely to last many months.=20
In building a white-collar criminal case, government investigators try to f=
ind the easiest initial steps that can provide witnesses. Legal experts sai=
d the government would almost certainly first break off a manageable piece =
of the case involving potential witnesses to broader aspects of the collaps=
e.=20
For that reason, these experts said, prosecutors will probably spend much o=
f their initial effort looking into the document destruction at Arthur Ande=
rsen, Enron's accounting firm. If a criminal case can be brought, these exp=
erts said, the government would have its first strong negotiating lever.=20
It is likely that Ms. Caldwell and the Justice Department will have to nego=
tiate with Congressional panels that are calling witnesses and demanding to=
 see company documents. Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron chairman, is scheduled to=
 testify before a Senate Commerce subcommittee in February.=20
Speaking of such Congressional witnesses, Joseph E. DiGenova, a former Unit=
ed States attorney and former independent prosecutor, said: ''It would be u=
nwise for them to testify without immunity, and the Department of Justice w=
ould object to that. It's too early to tell who knew what and when.''=20
A grant of Congressional immunity makes a subsequent criminal prosecution a=
lmost impossible, as the government learned after the convictions of John M=
. Poindexter and Oliver L. North were overturned in the Iran-contra case.=
=20
Ms. Caldwell is no stranger to either complexity or difficulty. She was a r=
elatively new Federal prosecutor in 1989 when she was given a major role in=
 prosecuting two dozen defendants in a southeast Queens drug trafficking ca=
se that included Lorenzo Nichols and Howard Mason. They were also suspected=
 of ordering the killings of a police officer and a parole officer.=20
She was faced with thousands of wiretapped conversations and a flood of pre=
trial motions from defense lawyers, but she won the drug convictions. She p=
ressured Mr. Nichols into pleading guilty to conspiring in the murder of hi=
s parole officer. Mr. Mason was convicted on charges of ordering the killin=
g of Officer Edward Byrne. Mr. Nichols got a 40-year sentence; Mr. Mason is=
 serving a life sentence.=20
Ms. Caldwell, a native of Pittsburgh who received her law degree from Georg=
e Washington University Law School in Washington, went on to win a string o=
f highly publicized cases involving neighborhood-level organized crime. She=
 got life sentences for Gerald Miller, leader of a drug ring in Queens, and=
 for Clifford Wong, a Chinatown business leader who was convicted in Januar=
y 1995 of murder, extortion and racketeering. Another Chinatown civic leade=
r, Paul Lai, pleaded guilty to murder-conspiracy and racketeering in 1996.=
=20
That year Ms. Caldwell oversaw the prosecution of the Raysor Organization, =
a violent gang that prosecutors said dominated the Bedford-Stuyvesant crack=
 trade.=20
Jerry Roth, a criminal defense lawyer in San Francisco who worked with Ms. =
Caldwell as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in Bro=
oklyn, said she had ''terrific rapport.''=20
''In dealing with the crack cases,'' he said, ''she found that some of the =
co-operators had a language they were speaking among themselves -- they cal=
led it bebop -- so she learned it. She would speak it to them, and it both =
created rapport and eliminated their ability to talk behind her back.''=20
As chief of the United States attorney's violent criminal enterprises secti=
on in the Eastern District of New York, Ms. Caldwell led a team of 10 prose=
cutors. She later became a senior trial counsel and prosecuted securities f=
raud in small-cap stock markets. In December 1998, Robert S. Mueller III, n=
ow head of the F.B.I. but then the United States attorney in San Francisco,=
 announced that she would become chief of his securities fraud unit.=20
Valerie Caproni, who worked as a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before beco=
ming the regional director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's offi=
ce in Los Angeles, praised the appointment. ''She was a star from the begin=
ning,'' said Ms. Caproni, who is now in New York as a defense lawyer with S=
impson Thatcher & Bartlett. ''Not everyone can relate to an illiterate, ign=
orant violent drug dealer and to the chief financial officer of a corporati=
on. She can do both.''=20
''What she is really good at,'' Ms. Caproni added, ''is getting people to c=
ooperate with the government and using their talents to figure out the shor=
test distance through a forest of information. She has good judgment about =
what is appropriately viewed as a criminal case, and she is not afraid to s=
tand up and say, 'This just isn't a crime -- as terrible as the results may=
 have been.' ''

Accounting for Enron: SEC Feels Heat Over Exemptions to Enron --- In 1993, =
Agency Ruled Two of Firm's Units Needen't Register
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/21/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is coming under heat i=
n Congress for a 1993 decision that freed units of Enron Corp. from complyi=
ng with a utility holding company law that would have given regulators stro=
nger oversight of the company's operations.=20
The SEC is reviewing a 1993 staff ruling to absolve the Enron units from re=
gistering under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, a 1935 law that giv=
es the agency extensive supervision of corporate structure and business ope=
rations of registered utility holding companies, according to people with k=
nowledge of the matter. If the decision is found to have been erroneous, it=
 could change the way other utility holding companies are regulated.
Two Enron entities received waivers from the public utility holding company=
 rules. In one case, Enron's Portland General Electric Co. unit in Oregon c=
learly qualified for an exemption that applies to holding companies that ow=
n and operate a utility in a single state. But in late 1993, Enron Power Ma=
rketing Inc., Enron's wholesale power-selling unit, successfully argued tha=
t it too shouldn't be regulated by the SEC.=20
In what isn't a clear-cut case, utility lawyers say that the SEC could have=
 been within its authority to require Enron Power Marketing to register. In=
stead, an SEC staff attorney issued the Enron unit a "no-action letter," or=
 waiver, without addressing the legal issues in the Enron unit's applicatio=
n.=20
On Capitol Hill, the Enron scandal has spurred a debate over sweeping power=
 utility deregulation legislation, which among other provisions would repea=
l the utility holding company law. With debate on the legislation scheduled=
 for next month in both the House and Senate, some Democrats vow to block t=
he repeal unless the bills contain stronger consumer protections. They also=
 say they will scrutinize the SEC's performance overseeing utility holding =
companies.=20
"In light of Enron, I think the Congress needs to thoroughly investigate th=
e SEC's rather poor record of administering Puhca," said Rep. Ed Markey (D.=
, Mass.).=20
Spokesmen for the SEC and Enron declined to comment.=20
The Depression-era law was passed to avoid the abuses committed by utility =
holding companies in the 1920s. Back then, holding companies had complicate=
d "pyramiding" structures with subsidiaries owning other holding companies =
engaged in risky businesses unrelated to power generation. The activities l=
ed to utility bankruptcies and massive losses for shareholders who believed=
 they were buying conservative investments.=20
The law directs the SEC to regulate the activities of large, multistate ele=
ctric or gas utility holding companies and to limit their diversification i=
nto nonutility businesses. Under the law, the SEC enforces special accounti=
ng requirements, limits on utility mergers and expansion, and tough restric=
tions on affiliate relationships. Thirty-five companies are covered by the =
law.=20
"If Enron had been regulated under Puhca, I seriously doubt that the types =
of transactions that brought this company down would have occurred," Mr. Ma=
rkey said.=20
While the SEC action on Enron's units predated many of the financial activi=
ties that led to Enron's downfall, Tyson Slocum, a utility expert at Public=
 Citizen, a consumer advocate organization, argues that Enron developed int=
o precisely the kind of utility holding company structure the law was desig=
ned to block. The Houston energy company, originally a utility that produce=
d and transported natural gas and electricity, increased in complexity as i=
t shifted its focus to energy trading. In its financial statements filed wi=
th the SEC, Enron lists more than 5,800 subsidiaries and affiliates.=20
Supporters of repealing Pucha say it has created anticompetitive regulatory=
 barriers to new investment in electricity generation and transmission faci=
lities. Repeal is expected to greatly accelerate mergers to consolidate the=
 $315 billion electricity and natural-gas sectors.=20
Indeed, the SEC has favored repeal for more than a decade, arguing its prov=
isions duplicate existing disclosure rules or are better administered by th=
e Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. But in the aftermath of the Enron d=
ebacle, critics of repeal may have gained the upper hand in the debate.=20
To address critics' issues, Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chair=
s the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and air quality, has=
 said if the utility law is repealed, there must be a strong "mechanism" fo=
r accounting, reporting and bookkeeping.=20

A group of former Enron employees has asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to appo=
int a committee to represent their interests in the company's Chapter 11 pr=
oceedings.=20
"We need representation for the common employees," said Rod Gardner, chairm=
an of the Severed Enron Employees Coalition, which represents more than 250=
 former workers.=20
The bankruptcy case already has a creditors committee made up mostly of lar=
ge banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. One former Enron employee=
, Michael P. Moran, a lawyer who lives in Montgomery, was appointed to the =
creditors committee.=20
When it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, Enron suggested that employees who =
wanted more severance pay should file claims with the bankruptcy court.=20
Gardner said the coalition has hired Miami lawyer Scott Baena, a senior par=
tner with Bilzin Sumberg Dunn Baena Price & Axelrod, to represent its inter=
ests in seeking more compensation.=20
Adding extra committees in a bankruptcy case is rare, but Enron's proceedin=

E-WORLD
Jilted by Enron, Workers Turn to Web to Find Community, Job Leads
By Thomas E. Weber

01/21/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

THE ENRON IMPLOSION was well under way when Katie Walthall lost her job on =
Nov. 12. Ms. Walthall, an outside contractor at the ill-fated energy compan=
y, was given a box, told to pack up and shown the door.=20
Now she's back at work, with help from an online community of former Enron =
employees. By keeping tabs on message-board discussions and tracking down f=
ormer colleagues by e-mail, Ms. Walthall, 26 years old, found a new job at =
MRE Consulting. "These sites have been awesome," she says.
Cut off suddenly from colleagues and friends, thousands of former Enron emp=
loyees have come together online in surrogate communities. These electronic=
 gathering places serve as a combination alumni club, career-services depar=
tment and water cooler for those who no longer have an office.=20
The speed with which Enron's jilted workers have regrouped on the Net says =
a lot about their drive and skills. It's also a fresh reminder of the reach=
 of online communications. What just a few years ago would have required ph=
one calls, photocopies and faxes can be accomplished online in minutes. The=
se days, it's easy to take that power for granted.=20

MONDAY, DEC. 3, was the last day in the office for some 4,000 Enron employe=
es laid off in Houston. Jose Lazo, a 21-year-old database analyst, was one =
of them. He had an idea for a Web site to help ex-Enron employees, and he a=
pproached Techxans, a Houston group that holds networking events for techno=
logy professionals, for help.=20
The next day, EnronX.org was up and running, thanks to an all-nighter by An=
thony Huang, a Houston entrepreneur who works with Techxans. "Everyone was =
amazed," Mr. Huang says. "It used to take dot-coms months of work to put up=
 a site."=20
The EnronX.org home page parodies the look of Enron's corporate site, repla=
cing a photo of a buff cyclist with a picture of a football player with his=
 gut hanging out. Below that is a calendar of events (a "Surviving a Layoff=
" lecture, job fairs) and links to the latest Enron news stories.=20
Other sections point to job-training resources and sources of health insura=
nce. There are links to debt counselors and relief funds. Law firms post an=
nouncements seeking people willing to join in class-action suits, and repor=
ters list their e-mail addresses in hopes of snagging tips on the scandal. =
Mr. Huang says the site is being run on a volunteer basis, though it has ac=
cepted advertising from insurers and law firms to defray costs.=20
Most relevant for the typical EnronX.org visitor, however, are the job list=
ings, which cover everything from energy-trading jobs at giant utility Exel=
on to a sales-associate post at a local Circuit City. A determined job hunt=
er could spend hours e-mailing resumes to all of the employers listed on th=
e site.=20
But actually finding a job is a lot tougher than just firing off e-mails, a=
s any ex-Enron employee will tell you. "You've got 1,000 positions being fo=
llowed up on by 3,000 people," says Rudy Sutherland, 35, who was a manager =
on a power-trading risk-analysis desk and is still job hunting.=20
Sacked workers say old-fashioned networking remains the key to landing a jo=
b, but their networking has been supercharged by the alumni sites. At 1400s=
mith.com, named after the street address of Enron's Houston headquarters, t=
here's a directory of more than 5,700 people. Former Enron employees can vi=
sit the site, add contact information to the directory and look up former c=
o-workers.=20

CONSIDERING HOW MANY Enron workers had communicated mainly by office e-mail=
 or phone and didn't have home addresses or phone numbers for colleagues, t=
he directory has become a lifeline. Preston Ochsner, 27, spent his job-hunt=
ing days looking up former co-workers and then keeping in touch with them b=
y phone, e-mail and AOL Instant Messenger. His networking paid off when he =
learned from a laid-off colleague about an Enron alum at AES NewEnergy who =
had information about positions there. "People need to meet face to face an=
d by phone," says Mr. Ochsner, who just joined AES as a supply analyst. "Re=
sponding to postings is easy, but personal contacts worked for me."=20
The 1400smith.com site was launched by former Enron Webmaster Brandon Rigne=
y and Charles Turcich, who worked for Enron as a contractor. Besides the di=
rectory, it has an active message board. Though some of the discussions are=
 given over to general griping, with one disgruntled visitor bashing Enron =
CEO Kenneth Lay as "Osama Ken Layden," most of the postings are related to =
job hunting, benefits and other severance issues.=20
Enron alumni abroad have their own outposts. EnronX.net (not affiliated wit=
h EnronX.org) and Kenron.net both serve workers in the U.K. and throughout =

Enron Was No Friend to Free Markets
By Jerry Taylor

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

While it's still unclear exactly what caused the implosion at Enron, ideolo=
gical playwrights are already busily casting the company in the starring ro=
le for their pet political morality plays. The most common scripts being wr=
itten have cast Enron CEO Ken Lay as Adam Smith on steroids and the corpora=
tion itself as the avatar of irresponsible, run-amuck capitalism.=20
Those of us who've been involved in the energy debates of the 1990s know di=
fferent. Enron was less the 21st-century incarnation of Robber Baronry than=
 it was the latter-day inheritors of the mantle worn by Archer-Daniels Midl=
and, the corporation that would hardly exist were it not for government fav=
or and regulatory help.
Enron is most famously known for pioneering wholesale electricity and natur=
al gas trading. Since ending the legally protected franchises that utilitie=
s had on those services was a prerequisite for Enron's strategy, the compan=
y lobbied aggressively for competition and "consumer choice" for gas and el=
ectricity services.=20
But while donning the garb of Ronald Reagan on the one hand, the company wa=
s donning the mantle of Ralph Nader when it came to the transmission and di=
stribution side of the energy business. Enron, you see, was worried that th=
e incumbent utilities would either under-price the non-utility competitors =
that Enron wanted on their trading floors or, alternatively, would charge s=
uch high prices for access to their transmission systems that non-utility g=
as and electricity providers would be unable to effectively compete for bus=
iness.=20
So Enron insisted that electric utilities be forced by law to get out of th=
e generation business, that strict price controls be set for the rates char=
ged for access to the various transmission grids, and that the day-to-day o=
peration of the electricity distribution systems be handed over to state of=
ficials who were directed to govern those systems at the behest of the syst=
em's "stakeholders" (read: Enron and friends). So Reaganite competition, ac=
cording to Enron, required new micromanagerial rules about industrial organ=
ization and the de-facto nationalization of the transmission systems by off=
icials who'd have to answer to Enron.=20
Many times over the past decade I found myself in meetings or on conference=
 panels with Enron officials. On each and every occasion, the "jungle capit=
alists" from Houston were apoplectic over arguments that the grid should be=
 deregulated like the wholesale power markets. They also ranted against the=
 idea that companies should be able to charge whatever they wished for acce=
ss to their property, that the grids should be left in private hands, or th=
at government cannot know a priori how best to organize private enterprises=
 and should thus refrain from imposing arrangements on the market.=20
While most legislators got a full dose of Enron's regulatory agenda, some w=
ere hearing from the company that, well, grid owners should be left alone t=
o do as they wanted. Those legislators, however, came from regions where En=
ron had managed to buy the transmission systems in question before the deba=
te was settled. So officials from Texas, Louisiana, and various parts of So=
uth America in charge of the gas pipelines that Enron had bought were heari=
ng one story while the rest of the political world was hearing another.=20
That pattern of regulatory opportunism extended virtually everywhere, but p=
erhaps no more so than on the environmental front. Enron, for instance, man=
aged to pick up several near-bankrupt wind and solar power companies over t=
he years and treated them like political lottery tickets. Wherever Enron we=
nt, pious campaigns for the virtues of renewable energy subsidies (in effec=
t, subsidies for Enron) were sure to follow.=20
Likewise, Enron saw spectacular business opportunities in the trading of gr=
eenhouse gas emission permits and accordingly argued for aggressive action =
to address global warming. And given that natural gas would be less disadva=
ntaged by carbon emission controls than would competitor fuels like coal an=
d oil, Enron was more than happy to link hands with nearly every environmen=
tal activist that crossed its path to undertake war against America's carbo=
n-based energy economy.=20
Whether it was de facto support of the Kyoto Protocol, the outspoken embrac=
e of Clinton's proposed BTU tax (which would give Enron a competitive advan=
tage in the marketplace), or the occasional attempt to secure a tax on oil =
imports (necessary back in the 1980s to save one of its pipelines in Florid=
a), Enron was more than happy to hammer energy consumers with the power of =
government to fatten its own bottom line.=20
While Enron was adept in putting together these coalitions to expand the re=
gulatory state, it was no slouch at more conventional raids on the public t=
reasury. Since 1996, for instance, Enron managed to bag $450 million to und=
erwrite its investments in India, Brazil, and Guatemala through the auspice=
s of the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Another=
 $135 million was liberated from the Export-Import Bank over that same peri=
od to underwrite Enron's investments in Venezuela. There was virtually noth=
ing that the corporation did that wasn't worth a handout from the taxpayers=
, according to Enron lobbyists.=20
On balance, Enron was an enemy, not an ally, of free markets. Enron was mor=
e interested in rigging the marketplace with rules and regulations to advan=
tage itself at the expense of competitors and consumers than in making mone=
y the old fashioned way -- by earning it honestly from their customers thro=
ugh voluntary trade. Indeed, Enron would probably still be a small-time pip=
eline company were it not for the statist conceit that consumers are better=
 off under the regulatory boot of government than with the invisible hand o=
f the marketplace. There's a morality play here all right, but it's the opp=
osite from that being readied for a political theater near you.=20

THE ENRON INQUIRY Enron Refuels Energy Debate Politics: The power industry =
moves to fight growing skepticism of deregulation after the collapse of its=
 most vocal proponent and the crisis in California last year.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's energy industry is mobilizing in the aftermath o=
f Enron Corp.'s collapse against attempts to slow down or reverse deregulat=
ion of power markets, setting the stage for the biggest debate over the iss=
ue since the California energy crisis last year.=20
Electricity suppliers and other energy players are talking with James J. Ho=
ecker, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and now =
a Washington lobbyist, about creating a coalition of deregulation proponent=
s that will lobby Congress, testify at forthcoming hearings, file comments =
on proposed rules and, if necessary, take legal action to block efforts to =
re-regulate the industry.
"Our concern is that some people are now saying that Enron could not have a=
massed such an inflated stock value and done the things that it did if not =
for the fact that energy markets have become much freer in the last three y=
ears," said Hoecker, insisting that Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2 instea=
d appears to have been caused by accounting practices unrelated to energy d=
eregulation.=20
The national debate over energy deregulation was largely overshadowed by th=
e Sept. 11 terrorist strikes. But Enron's collapse has reignited the issue,=
 with critics of deregulation saying energy is too vital to the public good=
 to be left to volatile markets. Some lawmakers are advocating a go-slow ap=
proach on further deregulation of energy markets.=20
"There is a lot more skepticism about deregulation now," said Howard A. Lea=
rner, executive director at the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicag=
o-based advocacy organization that favors a hybrid model of competition and=
 government oversight.=20
Hoecker, who has been criticized by California leaders for not doing more t=
o help the state during last year's energy crisis, said he expected a decis=
ion about the new coalition to be made shortly, but declined to identify sp=
ecific participants.=20
Some companies, such as Dynegy Inc., already have deployed their lobbying f=
orces.=20
One factor propelling the lobbying push was FERC's Jan. 15 announcement tha=
t it was moving quickly to hire a director for the newly created Office of =
Market Oversight and Investigations, which will be responsible for overseei=
ng and auditing the nation's energy markets.=20
FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III floated the new office last fall, but ind=
ustry leaders fear that FERC may try to give the office sweeping new powers=
 in light of the Enron debacle.=20
Wood, a former Texas utility regulator appointed by President Bush, decline=
d to be interviewed.=20
FERC Commissioner Nora M. Brownell, another Bush appointee who favors dereg=
ulation and competitive markets, said the industry need not worry about pun=
itive responses from FERC's new oversight division. She said the California=
 energy crisis, in which some suppliers were accused of creating electricit=
y shortages to inflate prices, highlighted the need for a greater federal r=
ole.=20
"To make the markets work, you have to have a market oversight function tha=
t people believe in," Brownell said. "Before, there wasn't a place people c=
ould go. When the industry understands that this is going to be fair, they'=
ll calm down."=20
Enron Leaves Lobbying Void=20
Houston-based Enron had been the most vocal supporter of deregulation, but =
its tumble into Bankruptcy Court has forced other industry players to step =
up to the plate to fill the lobbying void.=20
"Enron was the 800-pound gorilla for deregulation," Learner said. "With Enr=
on out of the picture, now everyone else in the industry can't piggyback on=
 its political and financial juices."=20
Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's larg=
est energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled one in four wholesale=
 deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.=20
Because Enron helped keep energy trading exempt from oversight by FERC and =
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, deregulation supporters are braci=
ng for an effort to bring the energy markets--and particularly online tradi=
ng--under more government supervision.=20
Energy companies also fear that an Enron-related backlash might cause some =
states to rethink their deregulation plans or prompt new federal regulation=
s that would limit how much they can charge and what their access to differ=
ent markets might be.=20
California, for one, has taken a big step back from deregulation.=20
To stabilize prices, the state purchased more than $10 billion of power for=
 utility customers in the last year and won't be out of the power-buying bu=
siness until at least 2003.=20
What's more, the Legislature created a public power agency that is authoriz=
ed to build more power plants if private industry fails to come through wit=
h adequate supplies.=20
With these and other factors causing uncertainty, California politicians ar=
e debating whether the solution lies in more or less government regulation.=
=20
State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who helped craft California's 1996 der=
egulation plan in the Legislature, said California politicians and business=
 leaders must unite to fight Hoecker's agenda. The chief beneficiaries of t=
he sort of "wild West" form of deregulation Hoecker's group espouses, Peace=
 said, are bound to be big oil and gas companies based out of state.=20
Peace argues that California's experiment with deregulation failed not beca=
use it was poorly constructed but because federal regulators in Washington,=
 unduly influenced by companies such as Enron, refused to referee the marke=
t.=20
Hoecker disagrees: "There's a big difference between reasonable oversight a=
nd re-regulation."=20
Other energy lobbyists stress that Enron's demise was largely unrelated to =
its energy business.=20
"The failure of Enron wasn't a failure of the competitive markets," said Dy=
negy spokesman David Byford. The Houston-based energy company, which abrupt=
ly called off a proposed purchase of Enron in November, is dispatching its =
lobbyists to Capitol Hill and regulatory agencies to urge Washington not to=
 overreact to Enron's implosion.=20
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a member of the House Energy and Co=
mmerce Committee, rejected the notion that Enron's meltdown should cause Co=
ngress to rethink deregulation.=20
"Enron could have been in the Hula-Hoop business and done exactly the same =
thing," he said.=20
Enron's swift demise last fall after disclosures of more than $600 million =
in losses and the existence of several complex, off-balance-sheet partnersh=
ips is being investigated by several federal agencies and members of Congre=
ss.=20
Still, because of the California electricity crisis, further deregulation o=
f energy markets was already in some trouble. Now critics of deregulation a=
re pouncing on Enron's troubles to bolster their case.=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has called an electricity deregulation=
 bill the "One Last Gift for Enron Act."=20
But deregulation supporters say that Enron's troubles have nothing to do wi=
th energy markets.=20
A spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of a House energy sub=
committee, said her boss was pressing ahead on his electricity restructurin=
g bill.=20
Barton believes that "Enron's problems were Enron-based. They weren't demon=
strative of a greater flaw in the energy markets or industry," Samantha Jor=
dan said.=20
Deregulation Push Expected to Lose Steam=20
"We need to figure out how to prevent future energy collapses like Enron," =
Waxman said during a recent debate. "The answer will require more regulatio=
n and oversight and oversight of energy marketers--not more deregulation."=
=20
Waxman contends that the theory advanced by deregulation proponents is base=
d on a belief that large energy companies will always bet right in the ener=
gy market.=20
But as Enron proves, that's not the case, he said, contending that some of =
the company's problems eventually will be traced to bad decisions about ene=
rgy purchases.=20
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the House Ener=
gy and Commerce Committee, expects the Enron collapse to damp enthusiasm fo=
r deregulation because lawmakers will want to sort out the implications of =
the Enron collapse for the energy markets.=20
Although some in Congress argue that Enron's collapse has nothing to do wit=
h their core energy businesses or the energy markets, Markey spokesman Davi=
d Moulton said he doesn't know how anyone can reach that conclusion without=
 further study.=20
"We don't know the full extent of Enron's 'book'--that is, the long-term en=
ergy contracts or derivatives that they entered into with other firms. It i=
s quite possible that there could be issues with some of those other trades=
, but we won't know for sure unless we look," Moulton said. "We're opposed =
to taking the government out of the business of overseeing the electricity =
markets. You can't just take the government out of the business and expect =
to get a good result."=20
Learner of the Environmental Law & Policy Center said the regulatory "black=
 hole" may have enabled Enron to inflate the amount of revenue it was colle=
cting from trades.=20
The debate is likely to pick up Jan. 29, when Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), =
chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has schedule=
d a hearing on what Enron's collapse means for energy markets.=20
More than $12 billion of investment in new power plants has been shelved in=
 recent weeks as financial markets effectively raised the cost of capital a=
nd began more closely scrutinizing the debt and balance sheets of borrowers=
, energy experts say. Such cutbacks could lead to power shortages and highe=
r costs for consumers.=20
Enron Collapse Didn't Rock Energy Market=20
But Craig Goodman, president of the National Energy Marketers Assn., and ot=
hers contend that the Enron collapse proved that deregulation works because=
 it did not result in immediate price spikes, trading hiccups or loss of co=
nfidence among energy traders.=20
"The fact that Enron's demise caused literally no dislocation in the market=
place proves that deregulation can work," he said. "Indeed, dozens of new a=
nd old wholesale players, with huge amounts of real assets, not just paper =
assets, have stepped in to fill the void left by Enron."=20
According to FERC's Brownell, "The markets worked with ruthless efficiency.=

Enron Properties Outside the U.S. Hit Auction Block
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SEOUL, South Korea -- Enron Corp.'s assets overseas are starting to go on t=
he auction block.=20
Tractebel SA, a Belgian energy and infrastructure company, has submitted a =
bid to buy Enron's 50% stake in South Korea's SK-Enron Co., which distribut=
es natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, said Marc Josz, president and c=
hief executive of Tractebel Asia Ltd. in Bangkok. Enron invested about $240=
 million for the 50% stake in SK-Enron.
In India, creditors to Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Co. project are se=
t to put it up for sale.=20
The developments come after Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankru=
ptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever. The move shi=
elds Enron from creditors as the company seeks to pare debt and reorganize =
operations.=20
In the Korean case, Tractebel's Mr. Josz said companies were invited in Dec=
ember to present their competitive strategies to Korean energy regulators; =
he expects a final decision on the bids in a week. He confirmed Korean medi=
a reports that Royal/Dutch Shell Group, the British-Dutch oil powerhouse, a=
nd Houston-based El Paso Corp. had bid. A Shell spokesman declined to comme=
nt. At El Paso, a spokesman said he had no knowledge of a bid for Enron's K=
orean assets. The other half of SK-Enron is owned by South Korea's SK Corp.=
, an energy and chemicals company.=20
SK-Enron, an energy holding company, holds about 25% of South Korea's natur=
al-gas-distribution market and 50% of the liquefied-petroleum-gas-distribut=
ion market.=20
In India, Industrial Development Bank of India is overseeing bidding for En=
ron's power plant, about 150 miles south of Bombay. The Overseas Private In=
vestment Corp., a U.S. agency that financed the project with $340 million i=
n loan guarantees and political risk insurance, is helping the creditor gro=
up find a new buyer.=20
"People are trying to put together a bidding process, and we're working wit=
h everybody over there to make sure that happens," Lawrence Spinelli, an OP=
IC spokesman, said yesterday. He said creditors decided to launch the biddi=
ng at a Singapore meeting last month.=20
The project has been the subject of political bickering, unpaid bills and u=
nproven allegations of bribery since its conception in the early 1990s. In =
May 2001, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board stopped paying for power =
from the plant in a dispute largely about pricing. A few months later, with=
 the board $240 million in arrears, Enron said it would gladly sell its sta=
ke in the project.=20
Enron owns 65% of the project, General Electric Co. and construction compan=
y Bechtel Corp. each own 10% and the Maharashtra board owns 15%.=20
Dabhol filed a $180 million claim with OPIC last month, arguing that the Ma=
harashtra board's failure to pay its power bills was tantamount to expropri=
ation -- an act that would be covered by the OPIC policy.

Accounting for Enron: U.S. Fought for Company's Project in India
By Michael M. Phillips
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- When Richard Celeste gave his farewell speech as President Cl=
inton's ambassador to India, he lectured Indians about the sanctity of cont=
racts. It was clear to the audience he was referring to Enron Corp.'s frust=
ration trying to build a $2.9 billion power plant outside Bombay.=20
After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwil=
l wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the t=
op of the Bush administration's commercial agenda.
"I want to be frank," Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Comme=
rce and the Indo-American Society. "These disputes have darkened India's in=
vestment climate."=20
Across party lines and administrations, Enron has had an active ally in Was=
hington throughout its battle with Indian officials over the Dabhol electri=
c-power project. From the early 1990s, when Enron waded into its Indian qua=
gmire, right up until it filed for bankruptcy protection last month, the Ho=
uston energy company counted on the U.S. government to argue its case.=20
At least one energy secretary, four commerce secretaries, three U.S. ambass=
adors and Vice President Dick Cheney are among the senior American official=
s who prodded the Indians to resolve the Enron dispute. President Clinton a=
ssigned a senior aide to monitor the project. President Bush has a Dabhol "=
working group" to help Enron's cause. From conception to collapse, the U.S.=
 government pushed the deal, financed the deal and attempted to salvage the=
 deal amid political bickering, unpaid bills and unproven allegations of br=
ibery in India.=20
The administration's motives are muddied by Enron's close financial ties wi=
th senior members of both parties, including President Bush. Enron executiv=
es and employees have contributed nearly $6 million to politicians since th=
e 1990 election cycle, 74% of it to Republicans, according to federal data =
compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog=
 group. Enron and its executives gave $736,800 to Mr. Bush for his gubernat=
orial and presidential campaigns, as well as his presidential inaugural fun=
d and election-recount war chest.=20
U.S. officials uniformly explain their assistance as a natural extension of=
 American foreign policy, unrelated to the considerable political clout of =
Enron or its chairman, Kenneth Lay. Both the Clinton and Bush administratio=
ns have encouraged developing nations to open their borders to U.S. compani=
es, and Enron's is the largest investment India has ever received.=20
Frank Wisner, U.S. ambassador in New Delhi from 1994-97, argued Enron's cas=
e frequently and vociferously, including with the staff of then-Prime Minis=
ter Narasimha Rao. After leaving India, Mr. Wisner became a director of an =
Enron-affiliated company, Enron Oil & Gas, and he is chairman of the U.S.-I=
ndia Business Council.=20
"I'd do it all over again," Mr. Wisner said of his advocacy. "It was the ri=
ght policy. I only regret it didn't work, for India's sake as well as the i=
nvestors." John Hardy, Enron's vice president of global finance, and Linda =
Robertson, head of its Washington office, didn't return calls seeking comme=
nt.=20
Enron's power plant is a saga of failure that began when the Indian governm=
ent invited foreign investors to provide electric power for India's growing=
 economy.=20
Mr. Lay joined then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a trade mission to Indi=
a in early 1995. Weeks later, Enron closed the initial funding on a deal th=
at eventually would give it 65% of the Dabhol Power Co. General Electric Co=
. and Bechtel Corp. owned 10% each, and the local power company, the Mahara=
shtra State Electricity Board, held the rest. The board also agreed to buy =
the electricity the plant would produce, an accord that became the heart of=
 the project's downfall.=20
Two U.S. government agencies, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Priva=
te Investment Corp., teamed up to provide Dabhol $642 million in financing =
guarantees and risk insurance. Both agencies describe the financing as exac=
tly the kind of support they are supposed to give to American companies. Th=
eir money is in turn guaranteed by Indian banks, in the Ex-Im Bank's case, =
or the Indian state or central governments, in OPIC's case.=20
But not long after the deal was signed, a Hindu nationalist party, Shiv Sen=
a, took power in Maharashtra state and canceled the project. The party accu=
sed its predecessors and Enron of corruption and complained that Dabhol's e=
lectricity was too expensive for the state power company. Then-Energy Secre=
tary Hazel O'Leary was among the U.S. officials who traveled to India at th=
at time and warned authorities that India was tarnishing its reputation wit=
h foreign investors.=20
Late in 1995, Enron and the state authorities struck a deal, with the compa=
ny agreeing to lower rates. President Clinton had a senior aide monitor the=
 project. At one point or another during the dispute, President Clinton's c=
ommerce secretaries -- Mr. Brown, Mickey Kantor and William Daley -- all to=
ok up Enron's case, according to Raymond E. Vickery Jr., who was assistant =
secretary for trade development under all three. "It was the leading U.S. f=
oreign direct investment in India, and the status of the Dabhol power plant=
 came up at virtually every mission," Mr. Vickery recalled.=20
In May 1999, electricity began flowing and financing for an expansion arran=
ged, but the project didn't run smoothly. In May 2001, the state electricit=
y board stopped paying its Dabhol bills in a dispute largely about pricing.=
 A few months later, with the board $240 million in arrears, Enron gave up =
and said it would gladly sell its stake in the project.=20
Enron's contacts with the U.S. government, which by then meant the Bush adm=
inistration, continued through that period. In June, Vice President Cheney =
raised Enron's concern about being paid for electricity generated by Dabhol=
 in a meeting in Washington with Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress Party=
, which now controlled Maharashtra. Another party leader accompanying Ms. G=
andhi told reporters of the conversation afterward, and the White House con=
firmed it last week. White House officials said the vice president brought =
the subject up because it was in briefing papers prepared by the National S=
ecurity Council, and because OPIC had money in the project.=20
"It is an important project to create jobs in America, and there's also a t=
axpayer exposure" through OPIC, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Fr=
iday. Indeed, Dabhol Power Co. filed a $180 million insurance claim with OP=
IC last month, arguing that the electricity board's failure to pay its bill=
s amounts to expropriation.=20
The Enron connections reached deep into the administration, however. OPIC r=
eleased documents last week under the Freedom of Information Act revealing =
that the National Security Council leads an administration working group de=
dicated to Enron's cause in India; Treasury, State, Ex-Im and OPIC also are=
 represented in the group. Mr. Fleischer confirmed a New York Daily News re=
port that top Bush economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey had been told by the W=
hite House counsel to recuse himself from matters involving Dabhol because =
he had served a consultant to Enron.=20
In July, Christina B. Rocca, assistant secretary of State, discussed India'=
s investment climate at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries=
 and announced that "many of India's problems in this regard can be summed =
up in the five-letter word, Enron."=20
On Oct. 15, as Enron was collapsing, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans hooked=
 Mr. Lay up with Sig Rogich, a Las Vegas-based Republican public-relations =
man with connections to the Indian government. Mr. Rogich, an Evans friend,=
 had been a special assistant to former President George H.W. Bush, and had=
 worked on the Bush-Cheney campaign. The conversation was first reported in=
 Newsweek.=20
Indian officials wanted Mr. Rogich to help them improve the country's image=
 in the U.S., and Mr. Evans suggested Mr. Rogich talk to Mr. Lay about Enro=
n's woes. Mr. Evans called Mr. Lay, Mr. Lay called Mr. Rogich, and Mr. Rogi=
ch says he raised Enron's complaints last month with senior Indian official=
s, including the powerful home minister, Lal Krishna Advani. Mr. Advani vis=
ited President Bush and other officials in Washington this month, but it is=
n't clear whether the Enron debacle came up during his trip.=20
Although Mr. Lay and Mr. Evans spoke about Enron's financial situation at t=
he end of October, the Indian project apparently didn't come up between the=
 two again until mid-November, when Mr. Lay called the secretary at his off=
ice to provide "an update" on Dabhol, according to Commerce spokesman Jim D=
yke. A couple of weeks later Enron filed its bankruptcy-court petition.=20

racts. It was clear to the audience he was referring to Enron Corp.'s frust=
ration trying to build a $2.9 billion power plant outside Bombay.=20
After presenting his credentials this summer, Ambassador Robert D. Blackwil=
l wasted no time in warning the Indians that Enron's problems were at the t=
op of the Bush administration's commercial agenda.=20
"I want to be frank," Mr. Blackwill told the Indo-American Chamber of Comme=
rce and the Indo-American Society. "These disputes have darkened India's in=
vestment climate."=20
Across party lines and administrations, Enron has had an active ally in Was=
hington throughout its battle with Indian officials over the Dabhol electri=
c-power project. From the early 1990s, when Enron waded into its Indian qua=
gmire, right up until it filed for bankruptcy protection last month, the Ho=
uston energy company counted on the U.S. government to argue its case.=20
At least one energy secretary, four commerce secretaries, three U.S. ambass=
adors and Vice President Dick Cheney are among the senior American official=
s who prodded the Indians to resolve the Enron dispute. President Clinton a=
ssigned a senior aide to monitor the project. President Bush has a Dabhol "=
working group" to help Enron's cause. From conception to collapse, the U.S.=
 government pushed the deal, financed the deal and attempted to salvage the=
 deal amid political bickering, unpaid bills and unproven allegations of br=
ibery in India.=20
The administration's motives are muddied by Enron's close financial ties wi=
th senior members of both parties, including President Bush. Enron executiv=
es and employees have contributed nearly $6 million to politicians since th=
e 1990 election cycle, 74% of it to Republicans, according to federal data =
compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog=
 group. Enron and its executives gave $736,800 to Mr. Bush for his gubernat=
orial and presidential campaigns, as well as his presidential inaugural fun=
d and election-recount war chest.=20
U.S. officials uniformly explain their assistance as a natural extension of=
 American foreign policy, unrelated to the considerable political clout of =
Enron or its chairman, Kenneth Lay. Both the Clinton and Bush administratio=
ns have encouraged developing nations to open their borders to U.S. compani=
es, and Enron's is the largest investment India has ever received.=20
Frank Wisner, U.S. ambassador in New Delhi from 1994-97, argued Enron's cas=
e frequently and vociferously, including with the staff of then-Prime Minis=
ter Narasimha Rao. After leaving India, Mr. Wisner became a director of an =
Enron-affiliated company, Enron Oil & Gas, and he is chairman of the U.S.-I=
ndia Business Council.=20
"I'd do it all over again," Mr. Wisner said of his advocacy. "It was the ri=
ght policy. I only regret it didn't work, for India's sake as well as the i=
nvestors." John Hardy, Enron's vice president of global finance, and Linda =
Robertson, head of its Washington office, didn't return calls seeking comme=
nt.=20
Enron's power plant is a saga of failure that began when the Indian governm=
ent invited foreign investors to provide electric power for India's growing=
 economy.=20
Mr. Lay joined then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on a trade mission to Indi=
a in early 1995. Weeks later, Enron closed the initial funding on a deal th=
at eventually would give it 65% of the Dabhol Power Co. General Electric Co=
. and Bechtel Corp. owned 10% each, and the local power company, the Mahara=
shtra State Electricity Board, held the rest. The board also agreed to buy =
the electricity the plant would produce, an accord that became the heart of=
 the project's downfall.=20
Two U.S. government agencies, the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Priva=
te Investment Corp., teamed up to provide Dabhol $642 million in financing =
guarantees and risk insurance. Both agencies describe the financing as exac=
tly the kind of support they are supposed to give to American companies. Th=
eir money is in turn guaranteed by Indian banks, in the Ex-Im Bank's case, =
or the Indian state or central governments, in OPIC's case.=20
But not long after the deal was signed, a Hindu nationalist party, Shiv Sen=
a, took power in Maharashtra state and canceled the project. The party accu=
sed its predecessors and Enron of corruption and complained that Dabhol's e=
lectricity was too expensive for the state power company. Then-Energy Secre=
tary Hazel O'Leary was among the U.S. officials who traveled to India at th=
at time and warned authorities that India was tarnishing its reputation wit=
h foreign investors.=20
Late in 1995, Enron and the state authorities struck a deal, with the compa=
ny agreeing to lower rates. President Clinton had a senior aide monitor the=
 project. At one point or another during the dispute, President Clinton's c=
ommerce secretaries -- Mr. Brown, Mickey Kantor and William Daley -- all to=
ok up Enron's case, according to Raymond E. Vickery Jr., who was assistant =
secretary for trade development under all three. "It was the leading U.S. f=
oreign direct investment in India, and the status of the Dabhol power plant=
 came up at virtually every mission," Mr. Vickery recalled.=20
In May 1999, electricity began flowing and financing for an expansion arran=
ged, but the project didn't run smoothly. In May 2001, the state electricit=
y board stopped paying its Dabhol bills in a dispute largely about pricing.=
 A few months later, with the board $240 million in arrears, Enron gave up =
and said it would gladly sell its stake in the project.=20
Enron's contacts with the U.S. government, which by then meant the Bush adm=
inistration, continued through that period. In June, Vice President Cheney =
raised Enron's concern about being paid for electricity generated by Dabhol=
 in a meeting in Washington with Sonia Gandhi, leader of the Congress Party=
, which now controlled Maharashtra. Another party leader accompanying Ms. G=
andhi told reporters of the conversation afterward, and the White House con=
firmed it last week. White House officials said the vice president brought =
the subject up because it was in briefing papers prepared by the National S=
ecurity Council, and because OPIC had money in the project.=20
"It is an important project to create jobs in America, and there's also a t=
axpayer exposure" through OPIC, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Fr=
iday. Indeed, Dabhol Power Co. filed a $180 million insurance claim with OP=
IC last month, arguing that the electricity board's failure to pay its bill=
s amounts to expropriation.=20
The Enron connections reached deep into the administration, however. OPIC r=
eleased documents last week under the Freedom of Information Act revealing =
that the National Security Council leads an administration working group de=
dicated to Enron's cause in India; Treasury, State, Ex-Im and OPIC also are=
 represented in the group. Mr. Fleischer confirmed a New York Daily News re=
port that top Bush economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey had been told by the W=
hite House counsel to recuse himself from matters involving Dabhol because =
he had served a consultant to Enron.=20
In July, Christina B. Rocca, assistant secretary of State, discussed India'=
s investment climate at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industries=
 and announced that "many of India's problems in this regard can be summed =
up in the five-letter word, Enron."=20
On Oct. 15, as Enron was collapsing, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans hooked=
 Mr. Lay up with Sig Rogich, a Las Vegas-based Republican public-relations =
man with connections to the Indian government. Mr. Rogich, an Evans friend,=
 had been a special assistant to former President George H.W. Bush, and had=
 worked on the Bush-Cheney campaign. The conversation was first reported in=
 Newsweek.=20
Indian officials wanted Mr. Rogich to help them improve the country's image=
 in the U.S., and Mr. Evans suggested Mr. Rogich talk to Mr. Lay about Enro=
n's woes. Mr. Evans called Mr. Lay, Mr. Lay called Mr. Rogich, and Mr. Rogi=
ch says he raised Enron's complaints last month with senior Indian official=
s, including the powerful home minister, Lal Krishna Advani. Mr. Advani vis=
ited President Bush and other officials in Washington this month, but it is=
n't clear whether the Enron debacle came up during his trip.=20
Although Mr. Lay and Mr. Evans spoke about Enron's financial situation at t=
he end of October, the Indian project apparently didn't come up between the=
 two again until mid-November, when Mr. Lay called the secretary at his off=
ice to provide "an update" on Dabhol, according to Commerce spokesman Jim D=
yke. A couple of weeks later Enron filed its bankruptcy-court petition.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: LENDERS
2 Early Enron Lenders Didn't See the End Coming
By PATRICK McGEEHAN

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron's modern era dates back to the mid-1980's, and throughout that period=
 Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase have been there to lend with both hands.=
=20
The two giant banks were the biggest lenders to Enron when it collapsed lat=
e last year, tacking a painful ending onto long-running and mutually benefi=
cial relationships. Both were also around in the early days of Kenneth L. L=
ay's tenure as Enron's chief executive: J. P. Morgan Chase helped to financ=
e the merger that created Enron in 1985 and Citigroup helped Mr. Lay pay of=
f a corporate raider a year later.
Over the years, Enron and the partnerships it controlled paid Citigroup and=
 J. P. Morgan Chase, and their corporate predecessors, for a variety of len=
ding, investment banking and insurance services. Last week, Citigroup discl=
osed that its exposure to Enron easily exceeded $1 billion, making it one o=
f the company's biggest lenders. J. P. Morgan Chase had even more exposure =
to Enron at the end.=20
The ties have been so broad and deep that it is possible one or both of the=
 banks will have made money from Enron even after the big losses they estim=
ated they would suffer. Together, they took more than $680 million in charg=
es against their fourth-quarter earnings to cover potential losses related =
to the company.=20
Officials of both banks declined to discuss details of their relationships =
with Enron.=20
Banking industry executives and analysts are not surprised the nation's two=
 biggest and most aggressive banks were the biggest lenders to Enron, a com=
pany so active in deal making that some investment bankers described it as =
the ''fifth-biggest wallet on Wall Street.'' Indeed, some are not altogethe=
r surprised that two giant banks that pride themselves on being smart lende=
rs did not seem to see the Enron debacle coming.=20
''Banks have a habit of making mistakes,'' said Henry T. C. Hu, a professor=
 of banking and finance law at the University of Texas. ''There's a long tr=
adition there.''=20
Mr. Hu traced the banks' Enron mistakes in part to the way they are organiz=
ed and the way they reward employees. In the minds of midlevel bankers, he =
said, the danger of missing out on doing business with a ''deal machine'' l=
ike Enron surely outweighed the risk that the company would implode.=20
''When you're talking about making loan decisions and the like, especially =
when you're confronted with a client that is at least by outward appearance=
 successful and rapidly growing, you as an individual banker hate to be the=
 one who raises his hand and says the emperor has no clothes,'' Mr. Hu rema=
rked.=20
The banks' judgment may also have been clouded by the length of their relat=
ionships with Enron. Citigroup's bond was forged in 1986, when it helped th=
e company fend off Irwin Jacobs, an aggressive Minnesota investor who was a=
ccumulating a big stake in Enron stock. Another financial company, Leucadia=
 National, had bought a smaller stake.=20
Enron had been formed in mid-1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and =
InterNorth. Among the banks providing financing for the deal was one that l=
ater became part of what is now J. P. Morgan Chase.=20
The presence of the two big investors as Enron stockholders was most unwelc=
ome, coming as it did in Mr. Lay's first year as the company's chairman and=
 chief executive. To fend them off, he and Enron's other directors decided =
to buy back the shares for more than they were worth, a practice known as W=
all Street as greenmail.=20
Enron paid $357 million to buy back 7.6 million shares, or 16.4 percent of =
those outstanding, from Mr. Jacobs and Leucadia. At $47 a share, Enron was =
buying its own stock at 6 percent above the market price, which had risen o=
n speculation that Enron would be taken over.=20
The company resold the shares to a newly created Enron employee stock owner=
ship plan. The plan used $230 million Enron said was left over when it merg=
ed the pension plans of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. That drew criti=
cism from T. Boone Pickens, another aggressive investor of the 80's who was=
 chairman of Mesa Petroleum. ''Greenmail is a symptom of weak management, a=
nd Enron's executives have folded in a big way,'' Mr. Pickens said a week a=
fter the buyback.=20
To help pay for the shares it bought, Enron borrowed more than $100 million=
 from Citibank, now a unit of Citigroup, and another bank. The assistance t=
hat Citibank gave Mr. Lay then formed the cornerstone of the complex relati=
onship between Enron and Citigroup in recent times.=20
Citibank has since lent Enron large amounts for everything from working cap=
ital to building a power plant in India. Citigroup's investment banking uni=
t, formerly called Salomon Smith Barney, has underwritten bonds the company=
 sold and has advised it on acquisitions.=20
Salomon Smith Barney was an adviser to the company on its failed effort to =
sell itself to Dynegy last fall. The firm also played a role in structuring=
 and raising money for some Enron partnerships and invested more than $10 m=
illion of its own money in one named LJM2.=20
A spokesman for the firm declined to discuss its role in creating the partn=
erships.=20
Since J. P. Morgan Chase came up with some of the money for the merger that=
 created Enron, the bank has also played several roles in the company's gro=
wth. It was the lead manager of a $500 million bond offering in 1999 and co=
-manager with Salomon Smith Barney on a convertible bond offering last year=
.=20
J. P. Morgan also advised Enron on a series of acquisitions, including seve=
ral in Brazil. In 1998, it advised Enron on the purchase of a controlling s=
take in Elektro Eletricidade e Servico, a state-run utility in Sao Paulo. I=
n 1999, it advised a subsidiary, Enron Oil and Gas, on a purchase of its ow=
n stock from Enron.=20
Despite all those connections and all of the smart investment bankers, comm=
ercial bankers and analysts who were charged with closely monitoring Enron'=
s financial condition, the banks are stuck with big unpaid debts. Of all ba=
nks, Mr. Hu said, J. P. Morgan was supposed to be too smart for that.=20
''What does this say about the quality of their risk management?'' he said.=
 ''Banks have to compete with each other on the basis of their ability to p=
rovide good judgment.''=20
J. P. Morgan's pitch, Mr. Hu added, was that it was ''the one bank you coul=
d trust, not only unimpeachable but really smart and unassailable in terms =
of these credit issues.''

Accounting for Enron: Bankruptcy Court Filing Causing Ethical Quandary for =
Law Firms
By Richard B. Schmitt
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A8
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp.'s filing for bankruptcy-court protection is posing a growing et=
hical quandary for law firms.=20
As Enron's main bankruptcy counsel, for example, New York law firm Weil, Go=
tshal & Manges stands to earn millions in fees. But another marquee Weil Go=
tshal client, Arthur Andersen LLP, is rapidly turning into one of Enron's b=
iggest adversaries. Last week, the energy company fired Andersen and is now=
 believed to be considering a suit against its former auditor for malpracti=
ce or fraud.
Weil Gotshal says that because it won't be representing Andersen in any mat=
ter involving Enron, there isn't any conflict of interest. But the U.S. tru=
stee in the Enron case has asked the law firm to disclose more information =
about its roster of clients, including Andersen.=20
"We are trying to get sufficient information so people can determine whethe=
r the interrelationships are conflicts to be concerned about," said Carolyn=
 Schwartz, U.S. bankruptcy trustee in New York. "Disclosure, while not a pa=
nacea, at least puts everything on the table."=20
The dilemma shows how, like the regulators who once lobbied for Enron, or t=
he politicians whose pockets were lined with campaign contributions from th=
e company, law firms involved in the Enron mess are scrambling to avoid pot=
ential conflicts of interests.=20
Such problems have become especially acute as law firms have grown and dive=
rsified in recent years, with the development of bankruptcy departments, on=
ce the purview of specialized legal boutiques, in large, full-service pract=
ices. The sheer size of the Enron case has made it almost impossible to fin=
d lawyers without some possible conflict.=20
As a result, law firms are getting special waivers from clients in order to=
 get a piece of the action. Others are establishing elaborate firewalls to =
avoid the sharing of confidential information.=20
New York's Sullivan & Cromwell, which has done lobbying and commodities-reg=
ulation work for Enron, recently got special permission from the company to=
 represent David Duncan, Andersen's former lead auditor on the Enron accoun=
t, whom Andersen recently fired.=20
Davis Polk & Wardwell, one of Andersen's principal outside law firms in the=
 Enron case, is also acting as counsel to one of Enron's biggest creditors,=
 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Christopher Mayer, a Davis Polk partner, said both=
 clients were fully informed and have consented.=20
Martin Bienenstock, a Weil Gotshal partner who is heading up the Enron case=
, said the firm isn't involved in examining any potential claims that Enron=
 may have against Andersen. "All Enron-Arthur Andersen matters will be deal=
t with by other attorneys," he said. He notes that Weil disclosed that Ande=
rsen was and is a client in court documents when Enron filed for Chapter 11=
 bankruptcy-court protection in December. He added that the firm expects to=
 make additional disclosures soon in response to Ms. Schwartz's request.=20
Among other matters, Weil represented Andersen in connection with a bitter =
split with its Andersen consulting group a few years ago. The firm earned f=
ees of roughly $11 million in that matter. Its revenue last year was $573 m=
illion.=20
Ethics rules prohibit law firms from filing a lawsuit against an existing c=
lient. Separate bankruptcy-court rules require that lawyers for companies i=
n bankruptcy proceedings be "disinterested." A hearing to consider court ap=
proval of Weil, Gotshal as Enron's law firm is set for next week.=20
In 1994, Weil Gotshal had its fees slashed by a bankruptcy judge for failin=
g to disclose potential conflicts in connection with its handling of the Ch=
apter 11 case of apparel maker Leslie Fay Cos. The trustee in that case was=
 Arthur Gonzalez, who is now the judge overseeing the Enron case.

Were Auditor and Client Too Close-Knit?
By Thaddeus Herrick and Alexei Barrionuevo
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -- Big companies and their outside auditors often have close relati=
onships, but few become as cozy as the ties that developed between Enron Co=
rp. and Arthur Andersen LLP.=20
Questions are being raised about whether they were so tight that they hinde=
red Andersen from scrutinizing Enron's books as thoroughly and independentl=
y as it should have.
Indeed, the distinctions between the dozens upon dozens of Andersen workers=
 assigned to the Enron account and Enron's own workers were so blurred that=
 many at the energy-trading company's headquarters here couldn't tell the d=
ifference.=20
Andersen auditors and consultants were given permanent office space at Enro=
n headquarters here and dressed business-casual like their Enron colleagues=
. They shared in office birthdays, frequented lunchtime parties in a nearby=
 park and weekend fund-raisers for charities. They even went on Enron emplo=
yees' ski trips to Beaver Creek, Colo. "People just thought they were Enron=
 employees," says Kevin Jolly, a former Enron employee who worked in accoun=
ting. "They walked and talked the same way."=20
Many Andersen accountants in Andersen's Houston office, one of its biggest,=
 eventually became Enron employees as the energy-trading company sharply in=
creased its hiring of Andersen workers in the late 1990s. While other compa=
nies also hire talent from their auditors, so relentless was Enron's hiring=
 that Andersen in the late 1990s grew uncomfortable and discussed solutions=
, including capping the number of people who could be hired, said a current=
 Enron employee and a former Enron employee.=20
Neither Andersen nor Enron will say how many Andersen employees were hired =
away. An Andersen spokesman declined to comment on such a cap, saying only =
that "it's not an issue that is addressed in one of our standard agreements=
" with a client. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says he was unaware of a cap.=
=20
Andersen's close ties to Enron raise a conflict-of-interest issue, says Joh=
n Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. N=
oting that Andersen-Enron relationship evolved into an informal alliance, a=
n unusual arrangement for a Big Five accounting firm to have with a client =
when it is supposed to keep watch on the books, Mr. Markese notes, "All tha=
t closeness goes a long way toward breaking down barriers of independence."=
=20
Andersen, while conceding errors in judgment in its handling of the Enron a=
ccount, has defended its work, saying that Enron in some cases didn't provi=
de Andersen auditors all the information they needed. Enron fired Andersen =
last week, days after Andersen officials disclosed that the firm's employee=
s destroyed documents related to Enron's financing arrangements.=20
Andersen has drawn fire for signing off on accounting practices related to =
Enron's partnerships, which allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance shee=
t and has made it the subject of a federal investigation. Another problem, =
critics say, is that auditors are reluctant to question their big clients' =
books too much because they earn such large fees, not just for the auditing=
 work but for nonaudit services, such as consulting.=20
Enron paid Andersen $27 million for nonaudit services, including tax and co=
nsulting work, compared with $25 million for audit services, making Enron o=
ne of its biggest clients. "We would marvel at the amounts of money we were=
 spending" with Andersen, says a former Enron analyst, whose job was to str=
eamline costs.=20
Also, documents show that Andersen executives believed Enron's fees to the =
firm could eventually total $100 million a year, which would have made the =
energy trader Andersen's biggest client by far.=20
Ties between Enron and Arthur Andersen stretch back to the late 1980s but b=
ecame especially close in 1993 when Enron hired the accounting firm to unde=
rtake its internal audit. While that made some Enron employees uneasy, they=
 became even more troubled by the hiring of Andersen employees, among them =
Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, and Jeffrey McMahon, the =
company's chief financial officer.=20
"It was like Arthur Andersen had people on the inside," says Judy Knepshiel=
d, formerly director of accounts payable at Enron. "The lines became very f=
uzzy."=20
Andersen's Houston office, which employs some 1,400 people out of the firm'=
s total of 85,000 world-wide, was a sort of farm club for Enron. The Anders=
en employees wore Enron golf shirts, former employees say, and decorated th=
eir desks with Enron knick-knacks.=20
David Duncan, the Andersen partner in charge of the Enron account, was a Te=
xas A&M University graduate and recruited heavily from A&M for Andersen's H=
ouston office. Many of the recruits landed jobs on the prestigious Enron ac=
count and were often hired by Enron itself, current and former employees sa=
y. In addition to graduating from Texas A&M, Mr. Duncan sits on the advisor=
y council for the university's accounting department. The tight-knit crowd =
of A&M graduates "would take care of each other," says one former Enron emp=
loyee.=20
Mr. Duncan last week was fired by Andersen after revelations that he direct=
ed the document shredding; Mr. Duncan's attorneys have denied that he did a=
nything wrong.=20
Andersen ultimately became troubled by the number of employees it was losin=
g to Enron, Enron employees and former employees say. When the company unve=
iled its so-called new power project in 2000, for example, it hired all 35 =
of the Andersen consultants who had helped develop the model, former employ=
ees say.=20
But the hiring between Andersen and Enron worked both ways. In 1993, when A=
ndersen took over Enron's internal audit operation, 40 people moved from th=
e company's payroll to Andersen. Also in the early 1990s Enron's Thomas Cha=
mbers, the energy trader's vice president of internal audit, left Enron to =
run the Andersen group assigned to Enron's internal audit.=20
A former Andersen employee now at Enron says the attitude was that rivals w=
ould handle an account of Enron's size similarly, so there wasn't a reason =
to raise issues. "Another auditor would have done the same thing anyway," t=
he employee says, "So what's the point of losing all that money?"=20

Routine 401(k) decision became costly flashpoint=20
By ALAN BERNSTEIN=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20

Eleven months ago, Enron began looking for another firm to keep the records=
 of its workers' retirement savings program, a bundle of 401(k) accounts th=
en worth about $1.6 billion.=20
What may have seemed a relatively routine decision at the time exploded whe=
n the change occurred in October, the point at which Enron collapsed.=20
In the aftermath, the change has become a metaphor for class struggle.=20
That is: While company officers made hundreds of millions of dollars in rec=
ent years selling Enron stock, a 401(k) "lockdown" prevented some 20,000 pa=
rticipants from doing the same when the share price continued a nose dive i=
n the fall.=20
The result has been a wave of vivid stories about employees losing their si=
zable life savings while the bosses cashed in big. The rags-vs.-riches cont=
rast is fueling much of the controversy over the Enron collapse.=20
But the story is far more complex. There are two competing versions of what=
 happened, and the truth could lie anywhere in between.=20
A lawsuit filed by several Enron workers says the bosses should have told e=
mployees more about the real prospects for the company's stock and lifted t=
he lockdown and other restrictions when the stock price fell. Enron counter=
s that such lockdowns are a routine and essential business practice, that t=
he lockdown was, in fact, lifted early, and the changeover followed all fed=
eral rules governing 401(k) accounts.=20
At Enron, those accounts were similar to those offered by many other corpor=
ations. The company contributed 50 cents worth of stock for every dollar of=
 salary -- up to 6 percent -- that workers put in their 401(k)s.=20
But the "matching" stock came with a string -- employees could not sell it =
until they turned 50, when they would be expected to start preparing for re=
tirement. Some companies place no age restrictions on the sale of matching =
stock, experts say.=20
Even so, 89 percent of the Enron stock that workers and ex-workers put into=
 their retirement savings account did not come from the company match, acco=
rding to the workers' lawsuit. It was stock the employees bought with their=
 own money, and they were free to sell it regardless of their age.=20
Thus, about $1 billion of the $1.6 billion total was in unrestricted Enron =
stock, according to the Gottesdiener Law Firm of Washington, D.C., which re=
presents workers.=20
Those numbers indicate many employees were violating theNo. 1 rule of finan=
cial planning -- diversify.=20
"In the end, the employee has to determine where they put the money, and if=
 they don't follow diversification, anything that comes along can hurt them=
," said Michelle Miears, a principal in the Houston office of Buck Consulta=
nts, which helps employers communicate with workers about benefits.=20
But for the workers, Enron was an alluring investment, one that grew in val=
ue far more than other options. Their suit alleges that Enron executives al=
so used psychology to get them to buy company stock and later hid the troub=
ling truth about its future worth.=20
"It is well-known," the suit says, "that the tendency of the worker to put =
their own contributions in company stock is stronger when the employer's ma=
tching contributions are automatically directed in company stock."=20
Even while the stock price declined, Enron Chairman Ken Lay told employees =
it was vastly undervalued and urged them to buy more.=20
Experts agree that there are good reasons why companies match employee cont=
ributions with stock rather than cash, starting with the fact that it costs=
 less.=20
"If a company is matching in stock, that is because it doesn't have the cas=
h," said Alex Brucker, a Los Angeles lawyer who mostly represents employers=
 in benefits cases and is a fellow of the American College of Employment Be=
nefit Council.=20
Matching with stock also allows the company a tax break, gives workers a fe=
eling of ownership and puts stock in hands that are usually friendly in cas=
e of a takeover attempt.=20
When Enron stock was flying high in early 2001, its 401(k) plan records wer=
e administered by The Northern Trust Co., based in Chicago. In February, En=
ron asked Northern's competitors to bid on the contract to manage the recor=
ds.=20
Employers commonly change plan administrators to obtain better service. Tha=
t's increasingly important as workers refine their investments daily by tel=
ephone or computer, Miears said.=20
Indeed, says Enron spokesman Vance Meyer, Enron sought the change to get be=
tter value and service for workers.=20
Hewitt Associates, based in Lincolnshire, Ill., won the contract around the=
 middle of 2001. Enron says it announced the change in an Oct. 4 letter to =
employees at their homes and followed up with e-mails.=20
The notices included a warning that Enron's 401(k) accounts would be frozen=
 starting Oct. 29 -- meaning no stock sales or other adjustments -- during =
the switch from Northern Trust to Hewitt.=20
Enron said the switch was planned for months and had nothing to do with the=
 fact that onOct. 16, the company announced a $638 million third-quarter lo=
ss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
But that version of the story, and what happened next, are in dispute.=20
The workers' lawsuit says some employees, former employees and retirees who=
 would have sold their stock as the price fell never got the word about the=
 freeze until it was too late, and that others had been told it would start=
 Oct. 19.=20
Some workers asked Enron to postpone the freeze when it became obvious that=
 the value of employee-owned stock in the 401(k) was evaporating.=20
Enron responded in an e-mail to employees that "we have been working with H=
ewitt and Northern Trust since July" and "understand your concerns and are =
committed to making this transition as short as possible."=20
Brucker, the employee-benefits lawyer, said such freezes are routine when c=
ompanies change administrators, but they are often postponed to work out pr=
ocedural or other problems.=20
Enron's switch may have been so far along that stopping it would have been =
complicated and difficult, he said, "but there are always ways to stop it."=
=20
Hewitt declined comment on why the freeze was not postponed, referring ques=
tions to Enron, which also declined comment.=20
Enron says it limited the freeze to 10 working days, six days less than exp=
ected.=20
In the corporation's version, the stock, worth about $82 a share in January=
 and $43 as late as August, was at $13.81 when the freeze began and $9.98 w=
hen it ended Nov. 12.=20
That means that most of the stock decline that wiped out so much employee w=
ealth took place long before the freeze. Seen another way, however, the sto=
ck lost about 28 percent of its value during the period when employees were=
 unable to sell, regardless of whether they had bought it with their own mo=
ney or got it through the 401(k) match.=20
The workers' lawsuit contends that the freeze actually began on Oct. 19, an=
d the stock price lost 60 percent of its value when it ended.=20
Besides the 401(k) program, Enron provided workers with a benefit similar t=
o a pension. Employees with the company for at least five years were entitl=
ed to 5 percent of each year's annual base salary, plus interest.=20
The program is described in documents that every new employee got from the =
Enron benefits department, whose slogan, repeated on every page of the bene=
fits manual, is "keeping pace with your lifestyle."=20

Fight Looms Over Pension-Plan Changes --- Enron's Consequences Lead Legisla=
tors to Pursue Tightening Regulations

WASHINGTON -- Businesses, consumer groups and organized labor are gearing u=
p for a battle over efforts to impose new restrictions on retirement plans =
after Enron Corp.'s collapse, which wiped out the nest eggs of thousands of=
 the company's employees.=20
Enron's 401(k) retirement plan was heavily weighted with the company's shar=
es, so when the stock plunged, the value of employees' 401(k) accounts did,=
 too. Making sure that doesn't happen elsewhere is a top priority for many =
lawmakers as Congress returns tomorrow from a monthlong recess. Already, me=
mbers from both parties have introduced bills and scheduled hearings.
A massive lobbying campaign is taking shape: The National Association of Ma=
nufacturers, which opposes far-reaching restrictions, is offering a primer =
for member companies on the more-limited reforms it supports. The American =
Benefits Council, which represents Fortune 500 companies on benefits issues=
, is meeting with high-level administration officials who are drafting reco=
mmendations for President Bush. The council also opposes sweeping regulatio=
n. But the Pension Rights Center, a Washington consumer group, believes the=
 government must step in with far more protections for workers. It plans to=
 launch a Web site and media campaign, and is organizing Enron employees to=
 lobby Congress.=20
The political pressure makes it likely that Congress or federal regulators =
will make some changes to the current system. This is "an opportunity to tr=
y and get real protections in the law for workers," says Shaun O'Brien, sen=
ior policy analyst for the AFL-CIO, which has put pension oversight near th=
e top of its priority list.=20
With national midterm elections coming up in November, the Enron case takes=
 on some urgency for politicians, says David Wray, president of the Profits=
haring/401(k) Council of America, a Chicago employer group. But "we'd like =
everyone to slow down here," he says. "Companies have been sharing ownershi=
p with employees for about 100 years, and we want to be real deliberative a=
s we think about changes."=20
Traditional pension plans -- known as defined-benefit plans because they sp=
ell out retirees' income -- are heavily regulated under the Employee Retire=
ment Income Security Act of 1974, or Erisa. During recent years, growing nu=
mbers of employees have changed -- or been shifted by their employers -- to=
 defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, whose payouts depend on =
how much an employee invests and which are more lightly regulated.=20
One of the first bills introduced after the Enron debacle would impose a 20=
% cap on the portion of their employers' stock that employees can hold in r=
etirement accounts. The measure also would limit to 90 days the amount of t=
ime employers can require workers to hold matching stock contributions; the=
re is no limit in place now.=20
Consumer groups like the legislation a lot. The Pension Rights Center, for =
instance, says it will push the bill, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Barbara=
 Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey, and may even seek stric=
ter requirements for employers. The center is planning a grass-roots campai=
gn, teaming up retirees' and women's groups with Enron employees and Intern=
ational Business Machines Corp. workers who are disgruntled about changes t=
o their pension plan, says Karen Friedman, the center's director of policy =
and communications.=20
The Senate bill, and a similar one in the House, alarms the business commun=
ity. NAM, the manufacturers' trade group, is working with members to lobby =
lawmakers on pivotal committees, says Neil Trautwein, NAM's director of emp=
loyment policy. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chairman Thomas Donohue has been m=
eeting with chief executives of some Fortune 100 companies to help craft th=
eir message to Congress, says Kathleen Havey, the business association's di=
rector of pension policy.=20
Many companies are concerned that legislation could impose too many restric=
tions on the way they set up and administer their pension plans. General El=
ectric Co., for one, says it imposes few restrictions on investment choices=
 for employee 401(k) plans, yet workers still have chosen to put 75% of the=
ir 401(k) assets in GE stock. That is because "returns have been 20% a year=
 in the last five years," GE spokesman David Frail says. "We'd be concerned=
 if, in an effort to shield employees from risk, that legislation would go =
too far."=20
Enron's bankruptcy filing also is giving new legs to old bills, including o=
ne that Rep. John Boehner first introduced in late 2000. A new version, whi=
ch lets pension-fund managers and other fiduciary advisers offer employees =
investment advice as long as they disclose potential conflicts of interest,=
 passed the House in November as Enron was unraveling. Mr. Boehner, an Ohio=
 Republican, is chatting up the bill, trying to find a Senate sponsor.=20
Bush administration officials, including Ann Combs, assistant secretary for=
 the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, have b=
acked the Boehner bill, and NAM calls it a "constructive approach."=20
AFL-CIO officials, however, are scratching their heads and preparing to fig=
ht it. "It's curious Boehner is promoting it in the context of Enron," says=
 Mr. O'Brien, the labor group's senior policy analyst. "Enron is a story of=
 conflicts of interest."

Your Money Matters
Enron Isn't the Only Retirement Tale That Leads to Hard Lesson: `Diversify'
By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. workers whose 401(k) balances have evaporated amid that company=
's bankruptcy may find valuable lessons in a continuing lawsuit brought by =
former Morrison Knudsen Corp. employees who found themselves in a similar s=
ituation.=20
For one thing, they will learn that when companies fail, there are stark di=
fferences between pension plans and 401(k)s. Pensions are protected, becaus=
e companies must set aside money to pay the benefits workers have earned. A=
nd if the pension plan doesn't have enough money, the Pension Benefit Guara=
nty Corp., a federal agency, steps up to pay minimum pension benefits.
There is no similar safety net for the 401(k)s, profit-sharing plans and em=
ployee stock-ownership plans of companies that go bust. If money in the pla=
n is lost because it was invested in employer stock that becomes worthless,=
 that is tough luck.=20
The only hope employees have of recovering their losses is if they can show=
 that the company breached its fiduciary duty by not warning them that the =
stock was a poor investment. However, even if employees have a valid claim,=
 they probably are still out of luck if the company slides into bankruptcy =
-- as Morrison Knudsen did, and Enron has -- because the bankruptcy proceed=
ings ultimately could lead a trial court to dismiss the claim.=20
The bottom line: To the extent possible, employees should diversify the inv=
estments in their retirement plans. Avoiding a concentrated stock position =
can be difficult when companies contribute their own stock to employee reti=
rement plans. But in these situations, workers shouldn't add to their expos=
ure by buying more company stock on their own, as many Enron employees did.=
=20
Of course, the risk generally is lower when it comes to 401(k)s invested in=
 mutual funds or other independent investments. Though the investments can =
lose value, their fate isn't tied to that of the company.=20
Enron employees suing over losses in their 401(k) plan -- 47% of which was =
invested in Enron stock at the end of 2000 -- may find themselves in a repl=
ay of what happened at Morrison Knudsen, a Boise, Idaho, engineering and co=
nstruction company that filed for bankruptcy protection in June 1996. Durin=
g a four-year court battle, the Morrison Knudsen employees have received no=
 compensation for company stock-related losses in their retirement and empl=
oyee stock-ownership plans.=20
In 1994, when Morrison Knudsen announced an unexpected loss, the stock drop=
ped 25% the next day and kept sliding, from its 1994 high of $24 to about $=
2 on Feb. 19, 1996, when the company announced it would file for bankruptcy=
. The stock slump decimated the retirement savings of more than 3,500 emplo=
yees, who had about $75 million invested in a 401(k) and an employee stock-=
ownership plan. The 401(k) was heavily loaded with company shares because t=
he company's matching contribution was in Morrison Knudsen stock. In additi=
on, employees were encouraged to contribute their own savings to Morrison K=
nudsen stock, because if they did so the company would match their savings =
with an equal amount in the ESOP. Both plans required them to hold on to th=
e shares until they were in their 50s.=20
Employees got an opportunity to diversify in 1995 when the company lifted r=
estrictions on selling the shares. However, Morrison Knudsen was negotiatin=
g with banks to avoid bankruptcy for months before it told employees. Some =
employees filed suit on July 19, 1997, alleging that the company breached i=
ts fiduciary duty to the plan participants because it didn't tell them how =
dire the company's financial status was.=20
John Blyler, an engineer with Morrison Knudsen in Boise for 22 years, had a=
bout $35,000 in both the 401(k) and the ESOP before the July 1994 announcem=
ent about the company's troubles. He lost most of it. "It's a crying shame,=
" he says.=20
Employees also sued members of the board, including Peter Lynch, then a vic=
e president of Fidelity Investments' investment-management arm and a truste=
e of its funds who also was a director of Morrison Knudsen and chairman of =
its board's audit committee. Fidelity didn't respond to request for comment=
.=20
When employees sued Morrison Knudsen, the company sought to have them held =
in contempt of court for bringing the suit, on the grounds that the bankrup=
tcy court already discharged the company from any liability for the retirem=
ent plan. While the judge ultimately didn't agree, the employees were frigh=
tened.=20
"You bet I was scared," Mr. Blyler says. "I lose my job, and my retirement =
money -- and I get sued."=20
In November 1999, the federal district court in Boise ruled that Morrison K=
nudsen's 1996 bankruptcy reorganization plan had released the company's off=
icers and directors from any obligations to the employees, and also had dis=
charged the company's obligations to the plan. (Morrison Knudsen was acquir=
ed by Washington Group International Inc., which itself is reorganizing und=
er bankruptcy-court protection. A spokeswoman for Morrison Knudsen declined=
 to comment.)=20
The court didn't dismiss claims against the trustees in the pending case, b=
ecause they weren't debtors. T. Rowe Price Inc. was trustee for the 401(k),=
 and Mellon Bank Corp. was trustee for the ESOP. Both Mellon and T. Rowe sa=
y they were merely custodial trustees, which means they were following the =
company's orders. T. Rowe says it also had no inkling of problems afoot at =
Morrison Knudsen.=20
Enron employees have sued their employer, as well as retirement-plan truste=
e Northern Trust Co. and the auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. Northern Trust,=
 too, says it was a directed trustee without investment authority. "We held=
 the assets and we kept the records," spokeswoman Sue Rageas said. Andersen=
 declined to comment.=20
How Enron workers will fare is anyone's guess. Employees sometimes prevail =
in such suits -- to a degree. ColorTile Inc. employees lost their 401(k) sa=
vings in 1996, because the Fort Worth, Texas, company invested 82% of the m=
oney in stores that held ColorTile leases. The employees sued and obtained =
a settlement of $4 million -- $3.1 million from plan trustee Texas Commerce=
 Bank NA and $950,000 from Texas Pacific Indemnity Co., under a fiduciary l=
iability insurance policy. That was a pittance compared with a total of $34=
 million in the plan.=20
Some say the solution to the problems faced by employees at Enron, Morrison=
 Knudsen, Polaroid Corp. and other companies in bankruptcy would be to prev=
ent companies from loading up employee plans with their own stock and locki=
ng the employees into it.=20
And the bankruptcy code would need to be modified so that if the fiduciarie=
s broke the law, employees could recover money from the reorganized company=
. "A company in reorganization has profit-making potential, so future earni=
ngs ought to be available to refill the retirement plans, should employees =
successfully bring a case," says Brian McTigue, a Washington, D.C., pension=
 lawyer who is representing the Morrison Knudsen employees.

Accounting for Enron: All Tied Up: Retirement-Plan Lockdowns At Lucent and =
Elsewhere Draw Questions
By Dennis K. Berman
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- The imbroglio surrounding rules in Enron Corp.'s retirement-sav=
ings plan, which prevented employees from selling their stock while the com=
pany's fortunes crumbled, is raising new concerns about the "lockdown" prac=
tices at scores of other companies.=20
Some employees of telecommunications-equipment maker Lucent Technologies In=
c. want answers to why the company's 401(k) savings plan was in a lockdown =
period when the company released financial information that cut its stock p=
rice by one-third in just one day.
On Oct. 10, 2000, Lucent said it would miss its previously stated estimates=
 for the fourth quarter. The following day, the value of Lucent stock plumm=
eted, closing down 32%, to $21.25. But the 114,000 participants in Lucent's=
 401(k) savings plan couldn't act on the news. They happened to be near the=
 end of a 15-day "lockdown" period, in which they couldn't buy or sell asse=
ts in their plans, including their plummeting Lucent shares.=20
"We were locked in as investors. We couldn't get out," says Paul Rinderle, =
a 65-year-old retiree of AT&T Corp., whose retirement plan was transferred =
to Lucent when the Murray Hill, N.J., company was spun off from AT&T in 199=
6. Mr. Rinderle said he had hoped to cash in his shares a few days earlier,=
 as the stock price was then on the rise. But because of the lockdown he en=
ded up losing $10,000 "in a heartbeat."=20
Lucent locked down the plan because it had spun off its 34,000-person busin=
ess-communications division, Avaya Inc., on Sept. 30. Lucent's plan adminis=
trator, Fidelity Investments, needed time to "balance the assets" of the re=
tirement fund, says a Lucent spokesman. That entailed halting all 401(k) ac=
tivity to make sure the assets between Lucent and Avaya were divvied up pro=
perly. The company warned employees of the move on July 28 and Aug. 31, and=
 sent a brochure to their homes on Sept. 9.=20
"It's standard required procedure for all major companies to restrict acces=
s to a plan when they go through a merger or spinoff," said Lucent spokeswo=
man Kathleen Fitzgerald, who noted that Lucent's 401(k) plan recently was n=
amed the nation's best by Treasury & Risk Management magazine. "We did it f=
or the shortest time possible," she said. At the end of 2000, 17% of Lucent=
's $11.4 billion 401(k) fund was tied up in Lucent stock, the company says.=
 Lucent also provides its employees with a pension.=20
Ms. Fitzgerald said the company received word of the impending shortfall on=
 Oct. 9, and disclosure regulations required that the information be releas=
ed as soon as possible.=20
Lockdowns typically occur when a company switches plan administrators (as i=
n Enron's case), absorbs another firm in a merger or spins off a unit as a =
separate company. On any one business day, 96 company plans out of 350,000 =
that have 401(k) plans are in a lockdown, according to new research from th=
e Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a trade group representing empl=
oyer plans.=20
While lockdowns are legal, they have come under greater scrutiny because of=
 losses sustained during a lockdown of Enron employees. (Lockdowns, tempora=
ry periods in which no employees can move their investments around, are not=
 to be confused with other restrictions on selling stock. Most companies do=
n't allow employees to sell employer stock the company has contributed to a=
 retirement plan until age 50 or later.)=20
Other companies that recently ended plan lockdowns include International Pa=
per Inc. and Dow Chemical Co., which had locked down a plan with 13,500 par=
ticipants as part of its merger integration with the former Union Carbide C=
orp.=20
Representatives for employer groups say the down time is necessary for the =
plans to adjust. "These are highly complex systems," said Ed Ferrigno, vice=
 president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) council. He said plan administrator=
s need to freeze 401(k) activity so they can make software upgrades, check =
legal compliance and in the case of a spinoff, ensure all the right assets =
are going with the right people.=20
Lucent employees had plenty of other time to sell the stock throughout 2000=
. A series of previous earnings warnings already had sent Lucent shares fal=
ling from $77 at the beginning of the year, to a spinoff-adjusted $27.01 at=
 the close of trading on Sept. 27, the last day employees could trade befor=
e the lockdown began. When the lockdown was lifted on Oct. 13, the shares h=
ad slid to $21.81, a 19% drop from when the lockdown began. (At 4 p.m. Frid=
ay in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Lucent shares were up 18 c=
ents to $6.69.)=20
Still, lawmakers and regulators examining lockdowns could ask why the perio=
ds last so long. "It's done by computer; it shouldn't take that long," said=
 Louis Berney, of DC Plan Investing, a newsletter that covers the 401(k) in=
dustry. "I think it's inefficiency as much as anything. If the employees' b=
est interests are at heart, it should be done as quickly as possible."

Accounting for Enron: Andersen Also Audited Qwest, Accounting Questions Sur=
faced
By Deborah Solomon
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Far from Houston where Arthur Andersen's accounting practice wa=
s by far the biggest of its peers serving the energy sector, the Big Five f=
irm also was a significant presence auditing the books of emerging telecomm=
unications companies, at least one of which has come under fire in recent m=
onths for its accounting practices.=20
Allegiance Telecommunications Inc., Level 3 Communications Inc., Global Cro=
ssing Ltd., Qwest Communications International Inc., WorldCom Inc. and XO C=
ommunications Inc. all use Arthur Andersen as their auditors. None of the c=
ompanies have felt heat anywhere approaching that of energy-trading firm En=
ron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy-court protection late last year short=
ly after restating its earnings going back four years by more than $500 mil=
lion. But questions have swirled about the financial statements of some of =
the telecom companies, many of which achieved spectacular growth rates only=
 to see their valuations crater in last year's stock-market decline.
Some of that spectacular growth came by immediately recognizing revenue fro=
m one-time, long-term contracts, rather than phasing it in gradually over t=
he life of the arrangements. The biggest questions have centered on Qwest, =
of Denver. A Morgan Stanley report last spring contended the company tried =
to boost its earnings through certain accounting moves related to its merge=
r with U S West. Qwest denied it did anything wrong but disclosed that the =
Securities and Exchange Commission had raised questions about its merger ac=
counting. It said it answered those questions and the regulators subsequent=
ly closed the matter. The SEC has declined to comment. Investors raised mor=
e questions in September, when Qwest disclosed a complex contract that work=
ed to boost revenue and meet growth targets; the stock fell to a 52-week lo=
w following the disclosure.=20
Dave Tabolt, a spokesman for Andersen, declined to comment on any of the pa=
rticular accounting issues in the telecom sector. He said the firm is aware=
 of clients' concerns generally in the wake of the Enron collapse, saying t=
hey "are asking good questions. But when we talk to them, they've been extr=
emely understanding and supportive. People are taking our measure. They wan=
t to know we're acting in good faith."=20
Representatives of Qwest, WorldCom, XO, Global Crossing and Level 3 decline=
d to comment about whether they are considering switching accountants. Thom=
as Lord, chief financial officer of Allegiance Telecom, said his company pl=
ans to stick with Andersen, which he said "has the highest level of account=
ing standards. They run Allegiance -- appropriately so -- through the wring=
er every year."=20
Still, some investors interviewed recently said Enron's situation raises th=
e question of whether Arthur Andersen has been allowing its telecom clients=
 to engage in aggressive accounting tactics. "It's a bit of a red flag," sa=
id Dean Gekas, a principal for State Street Global Advisors, which owns sha=
res of Qwest. Mr. Gekas said he plans to try and "identify whether or not t=
here's some relaxation of controls going on [at Andersen] that hasn't gone =
on elsewhere."=20
While companies may not dump Arthur Andersen, those companies' financial st=
atements may come under heightened scrutiny -- especially if they faced any=
 accounting questions in the past, said Jay Crandall, managing partner of O=
ak Hill Capital Management Partners LP, which owns shares of Qwest. Patrick=
 McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, predicted in=
vestors "are going to look more closely at Andersen companies, figuring whe=
re there's smoke, there's fire."=20
On the other hand, "they are probably the best auditor to have now to make =
sure everything's squeaky clean and to try and heal up their credibility," =
said Mike Allison, equity research analyst at Eaton Vance Management, which=
 owns WorldCom shares.

Economy
Moody's Trains Eye on Data Off the Sheet
By Charles Gasparino
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Under mounting criticism for failing to uncover Enron Corp.'s financial dem=
ise, a major ratings agency is turning its attention to Wall Street firms a=
nd other companies by asking for new information on the off-balance-sheet t=
ransactions and other obscure arrangements that could pose financial risks =
sometime in the future.=20
The move by Moody's Investors Service, one of the nation's largest bond-rat=
ing agencies, is unusual, according to financial executives at several Wall=
 Street firms who have been contacted by the company. In recent days, Moody=
's has sent notices to several Wall Street firms asking for new disclosures=
 on "off-balance-sheet financial arrangements," as well as "partnership agr=
eements," "financial contracts" and "agreements with third parties" that ar=
e affected by a downgrade in the companies' own bond ratings. After Enron w=
as downgraded, it was forced to immediately accelerate payments on billions=
 of dollars' worth of debt that the company kept off its financial statemen=
ts.
"As part of our ratings process, Moody's is undertaking a comprehensive rev=
iew of all ratings triggers contained in any agreements entered into," acco=
rding to a Moody's notice reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. As part of t=
he review, the agency also wants information on "the amount of debt involve=
d and the possible effect" of these arrangements on the company's own fisca=
l health.=20
Officials at Moody's say the request for information is being sent to as ma=
ny as 4,200 companies that the firm rates. "It's a significant effort to ga=
ther detailed information on something that is very much on the minds of th=
e capital markets," said Fran Laserson, a spokeswoman for the company. Ms. =
Laserson cited the 1994 bankruptcy filing of Orange County, Calif., as the =
last time the firm had asked bond issuers for such disclosures.=20
But the move comes amid criticism that bond raters like Moody's failed to m=
ove quickly enough to spot Enron's deteriorating financial health. With $50=
 billion in assets, $13.15 billion in debt and billions more in off-balance=
-sheet debt, Enron's is considered the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. hi=
story. On Dec. 2, the company filed for bankruptcy, but it posted a big thi=
rd-quarter loss nearly two weeks before Moody's downgraded its bond ratings=
 in late October.=20
Over the years, Enron managed to amass billions of dollars in off-balance-s=
heet debt in partnerships -- a primary cause for the company's troubles -- =
without major red flags from the rating agencies. "It's good to see the rat=
ing agencies finally doing its homework, but unfortunately it comes too lat=
e for investors of such companies as Enron" says Lynn E. Turner, former chi=
ef accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission, and professor of =
accounting at Colorado State University.=20
It is unclear how much debt can be found in such off-balance-sheet arrangem=
ents, or which companies have the lion's share of such transactions. But a =
big focus of Moody's appears to be the brokerage sector, which like Enron, =
has a history of trading derivatives and other securities through these dev=
ices. "One big question is: Will the incremental scrutiny change the way bu=
siness is done?" said one senior executive at a major Wall Street firm.=20
Moody's isn't the only organization looking to more closely scrutinize off-=
balance-sheet arrangements. In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission, Wall Street's top cop, has begun asking companies to file additio=
nal information regarding "off-balance-sheet" items, according to Wall Stre=
et executives. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, but th=
e SEC appears to be responding to a request by the nation's largest account=
ing firms for corporations to "to take immediate steps to improve their dis=
closures in three critical areas," including off-balance-sheet arrangements=

Credit Markets
Moody's and S&P, Singed by Enron, May Speed Up Credit Downgrades

Moody's and Standard & Poor's, stung by criticism that they were too slow t=
o respond to Enron Corp.'s financial troubles, are considering big changes =
to enable them to cut credit ratings more quickly.=20
While the shift could give investors a better sense of risk -- after all, b=
oth credit-rating companies kept Enron at investment grade until just five =
days before it filed for bankruptcy -- it also could add a new dose of vola=
tility to the stock and bond markets.
Moody's Investors Service is considering making more-frequent ratings chang=
es over a shorter period of time, shrinking the review periods for ratings =
and eliminating ratings "outlooks," says Christopher Mahoney, chairman of t=
he credit policy committee at Moody's, a unit of Moody's Corp. Outlooks are=
 intended to point toward the long-term direction of the rating over the ne=
xt several years.=20
Mr. Mahoney stressed that nothing has been finalized and that Moody's will =
soon release a paper on the topic, to be circulated to investors for commen=
t.=20
Standard & Poor's Corp., owned by McGraw-Hill Cos., also may take steps to =
accelerate the speed at which it makes ratings changes. If investor sentime=
nt sours on a company, and its liquidity becomes an issue, S&P analysts may=
 be more likely to cut a rating, rather than wait to see what happens with =
the company.=20
"Criticism creates urgency but it's not Enron alone that's driving the issu=
e of timeliness," said Clifford Griep, chief credit officer at S&P. "The ma=
rket is concerned with" the speed that ratings are changed.=20
A representative of ratings agency Fitch, a competitor of S&P and Moody's, =
couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Until now, ratings agencies usually moved ratings down gradually, one notch=
 at a time, while putting companies on notice that more downgrades may be f=
orthcoming. But stock and bond prices often are down more quickly, making t=
he last ratings-agency move anticlimactic. With the proposed changes, the r=
atings moves could come more quickly, or a few notches at one time, perhaps=
 getting out ahead of the reaction on Wall Street.=20
The credit agencies, like the Wall Street analysts who covered Enron, have =
been hit by criticism that they didn't cut their ratings fast enough. Criti=
cs, though, say analysts often face conflicts of interest that make them re=
luctant to criticize the companies they cover. While the ratings firms do g=
et paid by the companies they rate, unlike analysts they don't have the opp=
ortunity to profit from investment banking or other business tied to the fi=
rms -- business that could be hurt by a negative analyst report.=20
The trick for the ratings agencies is in balancing the need to warn investo=
rs against the potential damage if a rating downgrade triggers an avalanche=
 of trouble for companies already on the edge.=20
Even before the proposed changes, analysts say there already are signs that=
 the Enron experience is prompting rating agencies to cut credit ratings mo=
re aggressively, especially in the energy sector.=20
In late December, for example, Moody's cut Mirant Corp.'s rating by two not=
ches and Calpine Corp.'s rating by one notch, both to Ba -- a below-investm=
ent-grade, or "junk," rating.=20
In addition, the speed with which Moody's cut Kmart Corp.'s rating last wee=
k also drew attention among bond investors. Kmart was rated investment grad=
e by Moody's as recently as Dec. 14. But after a series of sharp rate cuts,=
 including a decline of five notches in under a week, the company is left w=
ith a rating of Caa1, a low tier of junk bond.=20
Since the Enron bankruptcy, Moody's has announced that it will be more aggr=
essive about alerting investors to the consequences of "triggers" in a comp=
any's capital structure. Triggers are events, such as a rating downgrade or=
 a decline in profitability, that require a company to renegotiate borrowin=
g terms with its bankers or accelerate repayment on bank or bond obligation=
s. Such triggers can greatly exacerbate a company's problems by creating li=
quidity issues just when a company is least able to obtain new funding.=20
Enron's various lending arrangements, including those relating to off-balan=
ce sheet debt, included a number of such triggers.=20
Moody's also has stepped up its focus on off-balance-sheet debt, in light o=
f Enron's problems. A report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal said Moody'=
s in recent days has sent notices to several Wall Street firms asking for n=
ew disclosures on "off-balance-sheet financial arrangements," as well as "p=
artnership agreements," "financial contracts" and "agreements with third pa=
rties" that are affected by a downgrade in the companies' own bond ratings.=
=20
If the broader changes are implemented by the ratings agencies, investors c=
ould benefit. If a company hits tough times and the risks for bondholders s=
uddenly rise, Moody's and S&P will feel free to rapidly slash the company's=
 credit rating. In this way, bond investors will get a better sense of the =
risks involved in buying the company's bonds, and stockholders will also ge=
t a better idea of the company's health.=20
But while stock and bond prices already move in anticipation of moves by cr=
edit-rating agencies, if the agencies begin cutting and raising their ratin=
gs more quickly, it will likely add a new dose of volatility to stock and b=
ond prices.=20
"We've had higher volatility on stocks when debt becomes an issue, and bond=
s already move ahead of the rating agencies," says J. Curtis Shambaugh, a c=
orporate-bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But this will add =
additional volatility."=20
Louise Purtle, credit strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, says the ups=
hot of the Moody's changes would be a "dramatic increase in the volatility =
of ratings."=20
That, in turn, could mean corporations will pay a higher price to tap the d=
ebt market. If rating agencies are quicker to move ratings, investors might=
 begin to demand higher rates on corporate bonds relative to safe Treasurys=
, to compensate them for the higher risk, according to analysts.=20

The Nation COLUMN ONE Enron Case Raises the Bar in Texas A matter that's bi=
g even by the state's usual standards has the legal community in a frenzy, =
with lawyers hiring their own lawyers and others dodging conflicts.

HOUSTON -- Even the lawyers here are hiring lawyers.=20
The astounding collapse of Enron Corp. has devastated employees, infuriated=
 shareholders, stung creditors and awakened the regulators. Everyone's upse=
t. And everyone's headed for court.
"This case is the full employment act for Texas lawyers," said Richard J. Z=
ook, who was the first to file a class-action lawsuit against the energy co=
mpany, now operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.=20
"There will be civil lawyers, criminal lawyers, securities lawyers, regulat=
ory lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers, employment benefits lawyers and trial lawy=
ers," Zook said. "Billions and billions have been lost. It's going be a lon=
g, detailed and exhaustive search for the guilty parties."=20
So far, 51 lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court here naming form=
er Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as a defendant. Fifty-six=
 go after former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling. Fifty-three seek dama=
ges from Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Dozens more suits go after the company it=
self.=20
That's not all. Lawyers for Enron's 20,000 creditors are seeking restitutio=
n, and a group of Enron bondholders is suing the company's former auditor, =
Andersen, as well as the bonds' underwriters.=20
Samson Investment Co., an oil exploration company that was an Enron partner=
, sued the auditor last week. Enron itself is making noises about suing And=
ersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen. Other lawyers are focusing on the=
 brokers who touted Enron's once-golden stock. Wendy Gramm, an Enron board =
member and the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), has had 14 suits filed ag=
ainst her.=20
Texans are fond of their superlatives, so few here are resisting the notion=
 that the biggest bankruptcy filing of all time will spur the largest legal=
 quagmire of all time. Yet that opinion is seconded by more distant observe=
rs, who nonetheless caution that the case is still unfolding.=20
Resolution in Courts Likely Will Take Years=20
"This involves civil actions as well as potentially criminal ones, private =
as well as public entities," said Stanford University law professor Deborah=
 Hensler. "And it involves lots of money and has lots of political ramifica=
tions. Those are the ingredients you'd need."=20
The legal actions are likely to go on awhile.=20
Given the number of defendants and legal proceedings and "the potential of =
the criminal cases to delay the civil cases," said San Diego lawyer William=
 Lerach, "it will take as many as six years to resolve this."=20
Lerach, who represents shareholders who claim they lost fortunes because of=
 Enron's deception, rejects assertions that the only winners will be lawyer=
s.=20
"Lawyers always do well whenever there's a disaster," he said. But he added=
 that class-action lawyers "only get paid if they make a recovery for the c=
lass--and they only get paid a percentage of what they recover."=20
All the more reason, then, to spread the legal net as wide as possible. The=
 juiciest target could be Andersen, which stands accused of failing to pres=
ent Enron's true financial picture. The Chicago-based company has deep pock=
ets and, unlike Enron, is not shielded by U.S. Bankruptcy Court.=20
Marvin Isgur, a Houston bankruptcy lawyer, estimated that at least 40 Houst=
on firms were involved in the case. Others, like Isgur himself, were talkin=
g to potential clients.=20
"Everyone that touched Enron is going to need legal advice," he said.=20
Although Enron lawsuits are being launched all over the country--the bankru=
ptcy case is being heard in New York, and the Samson complaint was filed in=
 Tulsa, Okla.--by far the greatest concentration is here, in the energy com=
pany's hometown.=20
The cases are so plentiful that questions are starting to be asked about co=
nflicts of interest, and the lawyers themselves are wondering what their ow=
n best interests are. Sooner or later, everyone is going to have to take si=
des.=20
In the good old days, there was only one side for Houston lawyers. Everyone=
 sat on charity boards with Chairman Lay, shopped at the Galleria, lived in=
 swank River Oaks and dined on the truffle-scented baby hen at Tony's.=20
"The royalty of Houston were either Enron bosses or on the board of Enron,"=
 said Gerald Treece, associate dean at South Texas College of Law.=20
The tight relationships--and Enron's big footprint in this town--are leadin=
g to conflicts. Two of the 18 U.S. District Court judges here, Nancy Atlas =
and David Hittner, had to recuse themselves from Enron cases. An Atlas assi=
stant said the judge would not comment; an assistant to Hittner said his de=
cision was prompted by his ownership of Enron stock.=20
Their cases were assigned to U.S. District Judge Lee H. Rosenthal, who disc=
losed last month that she had "long-standing friendships" with two defense =
lawyers. One of former CFO Fastow's lawyers was godfather to one of Rosenth=
al's children, the judge said in a court filing. Another lawyer representin=
g Enron defendants was best man at Rosenthal's wedding. The judge said she =
was "fully capable of disregarding these relationships."=20
Ten days ago, without explanation, Rosenthal recused herself from her 46 En=
ron cases.=20
"The problem is Enron is everywhere and Enron executives are everywhere," s=
aid Elizabeth Freeman, a lawyer for Enron creditors. "Most of the judges we=
re practitioners here. They might have represented Enron or an Enron compet=
itor."=20
Cases Consolidated Into 3 Categories=20
Underscoring that point, the U.S. attorney's office in Houston, which was c=
onducting a criminal investigation of Enron, was recused from the case Jan.=
 9 by the Justice Department, in part because staffers are related to Enron=
 employees.=20
For instance, U.S. Atty. Mike Shelby's brother-in-law worked for the energy=
 company. Because many Enron employees are bitter over the collapse of thei=
r company savings plans, there was the possibility the government lawyers w=
ould be accused of seeking vengeance instead of justice.=20
Although the number of lawyers is multiplying, the number of active cases i=
s shrinking for the moment. That's because they are being consolidated on t=
hree tracks: employee benefits, shareholder class actions and so-called der=
ivative suits, in which shareholders sue a corporation's officers to force =
them to restore to the company money they allegedly stole from it. The dock=
et sheet for the class-action suit Newby et al vs. Enron Corp. takes 15 pag=
es to list all the lawyers involved.=20
Yet for all of the frantic legal activity, there's a sense that this might =
only be the beginning.=20
"We haven't gone to Defcon 1 yet," said Treece, the law school dean. "When =
Enron filed for bankruptcy, it scared a lot of lawyers away. They thought t=
he chance of getting big money evaporated."=20
Some have a different reason for staying away.=20
"One thing about Texans, they think loyalty means something," Treece said.=
=20
By spreading its work around, Enron bought a lot of loyalty in the Texas le=
gal world. This is a trick the law firms seem to have learned themselves. W=
hen Vinson & Elkins, Enron's main law firm, was named as a defendant in two=
 of the class-action lawsuits, it promptly sought out Joseph Jamail, the mo=
st famous litigator in Texas, to represent it.=20
Jamail won a $10.5-billion verdict in 1985 against Texaco for his client Pe=
nnzoil, a case that was the previous high-water mark for Texas litigators. =
He did not return a call to comment, but anyone expecting him to take on En=
ron in similar fashion is likely to be disappointed.

Accounting for Enron: Company's Swift Collapse Reverberates Throughout Poli=
tical Circles in Texas
By Elliot Spagat
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Political repercussions from Enron Corp.'s collapse are beginning to be fel=
t in its home state of Texas, where the chairman of the state's Public Util=
ities Commission, a former Enron executive, resigned because of his ties to=
 the company.=20
Max Yzaguirre, who headed Enron's Mexico operations, was named to the Publi=
c Utility Commission in June. The next day, Gov. Rick Perry received a $25,=
000 donation from Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. The governor, a Republ=
ican who replaced President Bush, has said the timing was coincidental.
Mr. Yzaguirre's appointment had become an issue in the governor's race and =
he cited the intensity of the debate in his resignation letter. Candidates =
vying for the job have repeatedly criticized Mr. Perry, who is running to k=
eep his job this fall, for making the appointment.=20
As it did in Washington, Enron, based in Houston, and its employees lavishe=
d Texas politicians and lobbyists with millions of dollars of donations. Mr=
. Perry received $212,000 from Enron during the last two election cycles, s=
econd only to former Gov. George W. Bush among state officeholders, accordi=
ng to Texans for Public Justice, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign d=
onations.=20
Attorney General John Cornyn, a Republican candidate for governor, earlier =
this month withdrew from his office's inquiries into the company. Mr. Corny=
n received $183,000 from Enron during the last two election cycles.=20
Some -- but only a few -- Texas politicians are returning Enron money or do=
nating it to charity, including Comptroller Carole K. Rylander and Greg Abb=
ott, a former state Supreme Court justice and candidate for attorney genera=
l. Both are Republicans.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than $1 million to state candidates and p=
olitical action committees during the 1998 and 2000 elections and paid lobb=
yists as much as $4.8 million, according to Texans for Public Justice. Stat=
e lawmakers say the company's top legislative priorities were to deregulate=
 the state's electricity markets, which became law Jan. 1, and exempt old p=
ower plants from tougher emission controls, another successful effort.=20
Enron also has been one of the biggest contributors to state judges, who ru=
n in partisan elections. Texans for Public Justice says Enron gave $134,058=
 to state Supreme Court justices since 1993, including $97,358 to seven of =
the nine current justices.=20
The Supreme Court sided with Enron in five of six cases it handled involvin=
g the company since 1993, the group says.=20
Enron's large lobbying force -- its 15 Texas lobbyists were paid between $5=
35,000 and $945,000 total last year -- allowed the company to better argue =
its positions with lawmakers, said state Rep. Pete Gallego, Democratic chai=
rman of the House General Investigating Committee. Still, he added, "My per=
ception is they got nothing concrete other than access."=20
Democratic Rep. Steve Wolens said that Mr. Lay was a forceful advocate of f=
ree markets but that his lobbyists were less successful negotiating details=
 of deregulation. For example, legislators rejected an Enron-backed proposa=
l to award retail customers to energy companies via a lottery, he said.=20
Mr. Wolens said that the state's accounting regulator accepted his petition=
 to investigate whether Arthur Andersen LLP and accountants at Andersen, wh=
ich was Enron's accountant, and Enron violated state auditing standards. Vi=
olating accounting standards can lead to a loss of one's license to practic=
e in the state.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE POLITICIANS
Enron Spread Contributions on Both Sides of the Aisle
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 -- Senator Joseph I. Lieberman embodies how the Enron C=
orporation's collapse has tied the capital in political knots.=20
Already, Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who will strike the gavel =
on Thursday to open the new year's first Congressional hearing on Enron, ha=
s been buffeted by criticism from both sides of the aisle for his stewardsh=
ip of one of the many Congressional committees investigating Enron's specta=
cular fall.
Republicans complain that Mr. Lieberman should recuse himself because his f=
ormer chief of staff, Michael Lewan, was a lobbyist for Enron. Others have =
raised questions about campaign donations to Mr. Lieberman and political gr=
oups close to him from Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. And =
some fellow Democrats are expressing dissatisfaction that Mr. Lieberman, wh=
o harbors presidential aspirations, has not made the Bush administration hi=
s prime target.=20
The bipartisan criticism of Mr. Lieberman reflects how deeply Enron, its ca=
mpaign money and its deregulatory agenda have become imbedded in Washington=
's money culture these last dozen years.=20
Like many Fortune 100 companies, Enron, a Houston energy-trading company, s=
pread largess all over Washington. Although it gave more money to Republica=
ns, it gave plenty to Democrats, too, including Senators Charles E. Schumer=
 of New York, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John B. Breaux of Louisiana.=
=20
Enron has written campaign checks to three-fourths of the senators, and nea=
rly half of the members of the House. Perhaps because of those donations, D=
emocrats and Republicans have promised to aggressively investigate Enron's =
financial problems and their impact on thousands of employees for fear of l=
ooking soft on the company.=20
''They are all living in a glass house,'' Mary Matalin, the counselor to Vi=
ce President Dick Cheney, said of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. ''How far are =
they going to go with guilt by contribution?''=20
Everyone agrees Enron's decision to seek bankruptcy protection, the biggest=
 in American history, is a corporate scandal. While most politicians say it=
 has the classic elements of a political scandal, too, they insist it is st=
ill too early to declare it one. Many elected officials on Capitol Hill are=
 proceeding cautiously as they embark on lengthy and complicated inquiries.=
=20
''I think they are being cautious because they don't know all the facts,'' =
a Republican strategist, Charles Black, said. ''This is a very complex thin=
g. And there is no evidence that any elected official or government officia=
l did anything untoward. So they are right to be cautious.''=20
Mr. Lieberman was asked by a legal watchdog group to recuse himself because=
 a group he co-founded, the New Democrats Network, had received $25,000 fro=
m Enron. Critics have also pointed out that Citigroup, Enron's largest lend=
er, is Mr. Lieberman's top donor, giving his campaigns $112,000 since 1997,=
 campaign records show. A longtime Republican strategist put it this way, '=
'Lieberman's problem is simple -- Enron's biggest creditor is his campaign'=
s biggest contributor.''=20
For his part, Mr. Lieberman has promised to conduct a fair and thorough inq=
uiry that will not become ''a witch hunt.''=20
Enron, Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins, a Houston law firm, are among t=
he most generous contributors to Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. Enr=
on has given more than $700,000 to Mr. Bush since 1993; no company has give=
n him more. In addition, Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, was one of the '=
'pioneers,'' raising more than $100,000 for Mr. Bush's campaign, and he and=
 his wife gave a total of $10,000 to Mr. Bush's Florida recount fund. Enron=
 and Mr. Lay also contributed a total of $200,000 to Mr. Bush's inaugural f=
estivities.=20
While Enron's accounting problems worsened last September, Mr. Lay continue=
d to raise money for candidates. He was host of a luncheon for Elizabeth Do=
le, who is running for United States Senate from North Carolina, at the Fou=
r Seasons hotel on Sept. 20. The event raised about $20,000 for Mrs. Dole's=
 campaign, but she has pledged to donate Mr. Lay's contribution -- about $5=
,000 -- to the Enron employees' fund. Other candidates, lawmakers and campa=
ign committees are busily returning Enron donations.=20
The Congressional panels are focusing on the reasons for Enron's collapse. =
They intend to investigate an array of issues, including retirement fund ma=
nagement, the oversight of energy trading markets and financial accounting =
and auditing.=20
The Senate Government Affairs Committee, whose chairman is Mr. Lieberman, w=
ill look at whether regulators could have done more to monitor the company'=
s practices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Representative=
 Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, has been the quickest out of the ga=
te, with an investigation focusing on Enron and Arthur Andersen. Last week =
the committee released a letter from an Enron vice president, Sherron S. Wa=
tkins, that warned Mr. Lay last August about enormous losses and possible i=
llegalities in several Enron partnerships.=20
Mr. Tauzin received campaign money from Enron and Arthur Andersen, but comm=
ittee investigators have aggressively sifted through more than two million =
documents.=20
Congressional committees have sent out hundreds of subpoenas, causing conce=
rns among Justice Department lawyers who say they are worried that key exec=
utives at Enron and Arthur Andersen may compromise any future prosecutions.=
=20
The hazard lies in any grant of immunity to the witnesses testifying before=
 any of the Congressional committees investigating them. Prosecutors would =
then have to show they did not use any of this testimony to find witnesses =
or to gather evidence against them.=20
This hurdle for the government became clear in 1991, when an appeals court =
reversed a conviction in the Iran-contra case of John M. Poindexter, the fo=
rmer national security adviser, and caused the independent prosecutor to dr=
op all charges against Oliver L. North, saying prosecutors would not be abl=
e to show that the testimony used to convict Mr. North had not been affecte=
d by his testimony to Congress.=20
Brian Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, said, ''We're not going to co=
mment on potential trouble down the road. We're aware of the need for Congr=
essional oversight. We are going down the road of a criminal investigation.=
 We'll work with Congress on this issue. If a problem presents itself, we'l=
l work those problems out.''=20
On the political front, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the r=
anking Democrat on the Government Reform Committee, has posed questions abo=
ut Enron's contacts with several administration officials, including Mr. Ch=
eney and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's economic adviser. But the com=
mittee chairman, Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, does not=
 intend to hold hearings on Enron, a spokesman for Mr. Burton said.=20
The Congressional inquiries will focus mainly on accusations of corporate m=
alfeasance, but investigators for several of the committees looking into En=
ron's political contacts can be divided into three general areas of inquiry=
, President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Texas legislators.=20
At a White House question-and-answer session with reporters, the president =
said that Mr. Lay had supported his opponent, Ann Richards, when he ran for=
 governor of Texas in 1994. It is true that Enron had given money to both s=
ides, but Mr. Lay and Enron gave more than three times more money to Mr. Bu=
sh than to Ms. Richards.=20
For years, Mr. Bush affectionately called Mr. Lay Kenny Boy, but recently a=
t the White House the president referred to him as Mr. Lay.=20
In response to questions from Mr. Waxman, the vice president's counsel reve=
aled that in 2001 Mr. Cheney met once with Enron executives and members of =
his staff four times to discuss energy policy.=20
Mr. Waxman released a report that identified 17 areas of the administration=
's energy plan, drafted by Mr. Cheney's task force, that had also been advo=
cated by Enron.=20
Ms. Matalin, Mr. Cheney's aide, said that none of the provisions were given=
 to the administration by Enron.=20
''Just because someone endorsed it, doesn't mean someone put it in there,''=
 she said. ''This is just good energy policy.''=20
Enron's financial problems have reignited a push for Mr. Cheney to release =
a list of people who met with the energy task force last year. The White Ho=
use has declined to release the list. The General Accounting Office will de=
cide next month whether to go to court to require the administration to rel=
ease it. Ms. Matalin said the administration was withholding the list ''on =
principle'' to protect the participants' privacy.=20
Representative Tom DeLay, whose district is in Houston and its suburbs, nea=
r Enron's headquarters, received $28,900 since 1989 from the company.=20
Enron also hired as lobbyists two influential members of Mr. DeLay's inner =
circle, Ed Buckham and Karl Gallant. And Enron and Mr. Lay were also contri=
butors to the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group close to Mr. De=
Lay.=20
The Enron dealings of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, and his wife=
, Dr. Wendy Gramm, a member of the Enron's board of directors and former he=
ad of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, have also drawn scrutiny =
because of their involvement in regulatory issues affecting Enron.=20
But Enron also gave $42,750 to Representative Ken Bentsen and $38,000 to Re=
presentative Sheila Jackson Lee, both Texas Democrats.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: FIVE UNCERTAIN YEARS
A Bankruptcy Freezes The Settlement of Claims In a Puerto Rico Explosion
By MIREYA NAVARRO

01/21/2002

c. 2002 New York Times Company

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Jan. 20 -- To this day, Ruben del Valle said, he bat=
tles depression and insomnia. One day, the 73-year-old shoe salesman said, =
he came home so sullen he took his revolver and locked himself in his garag=
e for half an hour, until a group of relatives, neighbors and police office=
rs lured him out to safety.=20
Justina Rivera said her family was not doing much better. Her 37-year-old d=
aughter is ''like a zombie,'' she said, and is under psychiatric treatment.=
 Ms. Rivera herself spent much of last month's holiday season secluded in h=
er bedroom, she said.
Ms. Rivera lost a 31-year-old daughter, and Mr. Del Valle lost his boss and=
 three co-workers, in a 1996 explosion at a shoe store here that killed 33 =
people, injured 80 others and dealt an economic blow to a major commercial =
hub. And, in lawsuits, they and hundreds of other plaintiffs blame the Enro=
n Corporation for the blast. An Enron wholly owned subsidiary, the San Juan=
 Gas Company, was found by federal investigators to have failed to prevent =
the tragedy because of inadequate employee training and unsafe conditions i=
n its propane gas pipeline system.=20
Now the explosion's victims, already reeling from human as well as financia=
l losses, are feeling the ripple effect of Enron's enormous financial colla=
pse. Enron's bankruptcy case has frozen settlement negotiations and the fir=
st scheduled trials for hundreds of them, plaintiffs' lawyers say, threaten=
ing payment of some of the most serious claims.=20
Nearly 800 plaintiffs -- more than half of the more than 1,400 who filed ab=
out 500 lawsuits against six Enron-related companies and other defendants i=
n both federal and Puerto Rican courts over the explosion -- have settled t=
heir suits, according to bankruptcy court papers filed by Enron lawyers. Th=
e settlements, which the Enron lawyers said had been covered by indemnity i=
nsurance, total about $60 million, plaintiff lawyers estimated.=20
But more than 700 plaintiffs still have pending claims that their lawyers a=
nd other parties in the case said could reach another $50 million in paymen=
ts. Pedro J. Saade, Ms. Rivera's lawyer, said the number of claimants in th=
e case was high because it included people who were passing through the are=
a at the time and who are seeking damages for emotional distress. Also, he =
said, in Puerto Rico, relatives or friends of those affected directly can s=
ue if they, too, can prove to have suffered harm.=20
Among the many victims hurt by the fall of Enron, these litigants have a pa=
rticularly emotional claim against the company -- they hold it and its subs=
idiary accountable for not only financial loss but for wrongful death, pers=
onal injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.=20
''I feel like these people have no conscience, that for them this meant not=
hing,'' said a tearful Ms. Rivera, who filed her lawsuit in 1997 and has fo=
und the settlement offers given to her so far to be inadequate.=20
When her daughter, Maritza Ramos, was killed in the Humberto Vidal explosio=
n -- named after the shoe store where it occurred -- she was entering the s=
tore with her 4-year-old and 3-year-old daughters, Ms. Rivera said. Survivo=
rs described a scene similar in certain horrific details to the World Trade=
 Center catastrophe: structures transformed into a mess of twisted metal, d=
azed people covered in dust, bodies strewn about.=20
The two girls survived, Ms. Rivera said, and they and their father have fil=
ed a separate legal action.=20
''I'm not selling the death of my daughter,'' Ms. Rivera said, ''but I beli=
eve there should be just compensation for my other two children, who are de=
stroyed. It's been five years. How much longer are they going to keep us re=
living this agony?''=20
In 1997, the National Transportation Safety Board, which handles gas pipeli=
ne safety, determined that the probable cause of the November 1996 explosio=
n, which occurred in the basement of the Humberto Vidal six-story store and=
 office building in the Rio Piedras section, was propane gas that leaked fr=
om San Juan Gas's underground pipeline system. In the seven days leading up=
 to the explosion, the board said, the gas company had responded repeatedly=
 to complaints from building occupants of a strong gas odor, but its worker=
s failed to find the gas leak.=20
The safety board's report found fault with Enron for failing to ''oversee a=
dequately'' the operation of its San Juan subsidiary. (It also faulted the =
Puerto Rico Public Service Commission and the United States Transportation =
Department for lack of oversight.) The report said that the company ''did n=
ot oversee employees' actions enough to identify and correct unsafe practic=
es'' and that it had known for more than 10 years before the explosion that=
 its gas subsidiary did not comply with pipeline safety requirements and re=
commended industry practices.=20
The report said, ''Enron Corp. had begun before the explosion to correct so=
me deficiencies in the gas company's operations, but its attempt was neithe=
r timely nor sufficient.''=20
Enron disputed the findings and did not admit responsibility for the explos=
ion. A spokeswoman for San Juan Gas said at the time that the transportatio=
n board had not found forensic evidence showing that the explosion was attr=
ibutable to propane.=20
But in 2000, San Juan Gas, other defendants in the case and the plaintiffs =
agreed not to litigate the cause of the explosion and instead to proceed wi=
th the cases to determine damages and the size of awards.=20
Among the suits waiting for a trial date is that of Humberto Vidal, which i=
s claiming $25 million in compensatory damages for the explosion. The busin=
ess, which was the target of lawsuits itself over the incident, paid $900,0=
00 toward settlements and lost five employees, one store and its corporate =
headquarters in the explosion. It had to demolish the structure, which has =
been replaced by a smaller, two-story commercial building.=20
Humberto Vidal Jr., vice president of the family business, said that the ch=
ain was still operating in the red because of the negative publicity and th=
at Enron and San Juan Gas had made matters worse by disputing the safety bo=
ard's findings and fighting the suits for years, only to agree later to pay=
 damages.=20
Calls to Enron's lawyers handling aspects of the explosion-related litigati=
on in both Puerto Rico and Houston were not returned. A company spokesman, =
John Ambler, confirmed some background information, but he said the lawyers=
 were not at liberty to discuss the case.=20
The explosion plaintiffs can be compensated by Enron's insurance liability =
coverage, say their lawyers. The lawyers have filed a petition with the Uni=
ted States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, asking that the pending cases be =
allowed to go forward.=20
The lawyers say the insurance coverage applicable to their case is about $6=
00 million, more than enough to settle the rest of the suits.=20
But in an objection filed with the court earlier this month, Enron's lawyer=
s opposed the move as a distraction from the company's bankruptcy reorganiz=
ation efforts.=20
They said it would be a precedent that could attract other claimants withou=
t giving the company ''a reasonable opportunity to develop an overall strat=
egy for processing these claims.'' They also said the applicable insurance =
coverage called for the insured to pay first and then be indemnified by its=
 insurers, a point that is disputed by some of the plaintiffs' lawyers.=20
A hearing on the matter is set for March 7.=20
The timing of Enron's collapse could not have been worse for the Puerto Ric=
ans. Five years after the explosion, the first trials had been scheduled fo=
r last month.=20
Some lawyers are reassuring clients that this is just a temporary setback, =
but there is enough uncertainty for some to be worried. At the very least, =
said Jorge Ortiz Brunet, a lawyer here who is handling 30 of the cases, the=
 suits will be delayed further, and Enron will probably be less willing to =
settle and more eager to go to trial because it no longer fears staining it=
s name.=20
''We're in a dark tunnel,'' said Jose J. Torres-Escalera, one of Mr. Vidal'=
s lawyers. ''Nobody knows for certain if anyone will ever recover damages. =
Each day it gets worse. Enron could end up in total bankruptcy.''=20
Some plaintiffs, like Maria Teresa Otero Soto, 28, seem indifferent to what=
 happens. She said that the one pursuing the case was really her husband, a=
 plaintiff in her suit who alleges ''loss of consortium.''=20
Ms. Otero Soto, a 22-year-old student at a beauty school near the shoe stor=
e at the time of the explosion, said she had walked out uninjured but could=
 not erase from her mind the carnage she had seen.=20
But many other plaintiffs are more passionate about their claims, convinced=
 of the negligence of Enron and its San Juan company.=20
''This will always stay with me,'' said Jose Santiago, 36, a San Juan Gas w=
orker who was testing for the gas leak at the time of the explosion and who=
 is now a driver for a Head Start program at half his old salary. No longer=
, Mr. Santiago said, can he bear the sound of hissing gas.

Enron's Woes Revive Debate On Campaigns
By ALISON MITCHELL

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 16, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 -- The Enron debacle is proving to be an unexpected win=
dfall for the effort to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws.=20
As politicians scramble to return contributions from Enron, the failing ene=
rgy trading company, the advocates of limiting money in politics say their =
cause has been reinvigorated. They predict that once Congress returns on We=
dnesday, they will swiftly gain the support needed to force the campaign fi=
nance issue to the House floor.
''It's a huge development,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, the Con=
necticut Republican who, with Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of =
Massachusetts, is a leading sponsor of the bill to ban the unregulated and =
unlimited contributions to political parties known as soft money.=20
Tales of Enron's largess -- the company spread $6 million across Washington=
 and both parties in the last decade -- come just as the drive to overhaul =
the campaign finance law is at a juncture, promising the possibility of the=
 most wide-ranging change in it since the Watergate era.=20
The re-energized push for an overhaul will still meet stiff resistance from=
 Republican House leaders, who have stalled the bill and support a less str=
ingent measure.=20
The campaign finance issue is not the only one affected by Enron. Enron's c=
ollapse could alter the debate over energy legislation, retirement legislat=
ion and even the negotiations on an economic stimulus bill.=20
The Senate approved an overhaul of campaign financing last year, after year=
s in which the bill died in Republican filibusters. The bill would ban soft=
 money and rein in advertising by advocacy groups.=20
In the House, the legislation has stalled. Its backers have been in a petit=
ion drive to push their bill to the floor for debate over the objections of=
 the House Republican leadership. By December, they had 214 of the 218 sign=
atures needed to prevail.=20
Now Representative Corrine Brown, Democrat of Florida, says she will sign, =
in part because of Enron. ''To me, this is the people's House,'' Ms. Brown =
said in an interview. ''The influence that the big dollars have, we need to=
 limit it.''=20
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, has promised to =
provide the final signature if 217 other members sign. That leaves the coal=
ition backing the measure just two votes short.=20
John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, sai=
d he was not sure whether the Enron situation had changed the political out=
look for the measure.=20
''Enron's a different subject, really, from campaign finance,'' Mr. Feehery=
 said.=20
Mr. Hastert would have to permit a vote on the bill if the petition drive s=
ucceeded, he said, adding, ''Obviously, the rules of the House require you =
to follow the rules of the House.''=20
Mr. Hastert remains opposed to the Shays-Meehan bill, and with the House wh=
ip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who has been an implacable foe of th=
e bill, he has been promoting alternative legislation sponsored by Represen=
tative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio.=20
An array of advocacy groups -- including Common Cause, the League of Women =
Voters and the Sierra Club -- have been running phone banks for the past we=
ek to put pressure on a target list of 25 House members to sign the petitio=
n.=20
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, =
said at the Democratic Party's winter meeting over the weekend, ''We are go=
ing to clean up politics in this country once and for all.''=20
Mr. Gephardt's aides say he will personally press Democratic holdouts to de=
liver the last signatures for the petition.=20
Legislation similar to the Shays-Meehan bill passed the House in previous y=
ears, so there is optimism among the bill's backers that if they can get th=
e legislation to the floor they will win passage. Other House members say t=
he vote will be close.=20
For the many Republicans who contend that a ban on soft money would weaken =
the national political parties and abridge free speech, the Enron situation=
 is galling. They contend that the phone calls of the Enron chairman, Kenne=
th L. Lay, to President Bush's senior aides and cabinet members this fall d=
id not bring help for the collapsing company.=20
''If anything, Enron shows that money doesn't buy special influence,'' said=
 Representative Thomas M. Davis III, who heads the House Republicans' re-el=
ection committee.=20
But John Weaver, a strategist for Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republic=
an who put the battle against special interests at the center of his losing=
 presidential run, compared the current frenzy to the one that swept the Ca=
pitol after President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, a fugitive commoditi=
es trader, whose former wife, Denise, was a major contributor to Democrats.=
=20
''Just like the Marc Rich pardon changed the environment a year ago and hel=
ped secure passage in the Senate,'' Mr. Weaver said, ''we feel the washing =
of Enron money all around Washington will do the same thing in the looming =
House debate.''=20
Indeed, so toxic have the Enron donations become that all four of the Congr=
essional campaign committees are returning contributions they received -- e=
ither to the company or to funds that have been established to help employe=
es who have watched their retirement savings dry up.=20
Three of the committees -- those for the Senate Democrats, the Senate Repub=
licans and the House Republicans -- received $100,000 apiece from Enron thi=
s fall, as the company's fortunes rapidly fell. The fourth, the Democratic =
Congressional Campaign Committee, received $2,050.=20
Individual lawmakers, too, are racing to return money. Enron wrote campaign=
 checks to nearly three-fourths of the senators and half the representative=
s over the years.=20
The Democrats are seeking to use Mr. Bush's close ties to Mr. Lay to unders=
core their theme that Republicans stand with special interests. The Republi=
cans say they are prepared to fight back with their own choice examples of =
Democratic connections to Mr. Lay, like the case of Thomas F. McLarty III, =
the Clinton White House counselor who monitored the progress of an Enron po=
wer plant project in India; in 1996, just days before India approved the pr=
oject, Enron gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee.=20
The charges and countercharges will keep the issue of political contributio=
ns alive, which is what the advocates of change want.=20
''In all the years of lobbying on this issue,'' said Meredith McGehee, seni=
or vice president of Common Cause, ''we're used to having to go out and mak=
e the case that this is a problem.''=20
''Now,'' Ms. McGehee said, ''you go out there and people make the case to y=
ou.''=20
Even if the coalition gets 218 signatures on its petition -- a majority of =
the House -- there are still ways for Republican leaders to delay a vote.=
=20
Under the complicated rules for such a petition, the legislation it forces =
to the floor can be considered only on certain Mondays. Often the House is =
not working on Mondays. So the debate could be delayed until April or May.=
=20
Once the Shays-Meehan bill goes to the floor, it will be subject to efforts=
 to amend it and will have to compete against rival bills.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE ANALYST
Man Who Doubted Enron Enjoys New Recognition
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/21/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 -- Of all the Enron mementoes, John Olson might have the b=
est one. Mr. Olson, an analyst who has been a longtime skeptic of the energ=
y company's once-stratospheric stock price, has a handwritten note that the=
 Enron chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, sent last June to Mr. Olson's boss, Donald=
 Sanders.=20
''Don -- John Olson has been wrong about Enron for over 10 years and is sti=
ll wrong,'' Mr. Lay wrote. ''But he is consistant [sic]. Ken.''
Consistently right, actually. Mr. Olson, who follows the energy industry fo=
r a small investment firm here, has finally been proved correct where just =
about every other Wall Street analyst who followed Enron was wrong. But he =
can take only a grim kind of satisfaction in his prescience. ''I would like=
 to be able to gloat,'' he said, ''but this thing is just too damaging, too=
 unhappy, to do anything like that.''=20
Mr. Olson, who calls himself an old-fashioned analyst who does not own indi=
vidual stocks himself, is now a Houston celebrity. A recent talk he gave at=
 the Petroleum Club on the fall of Enron drew a standing-room-only crowd.=
=20
''He's a very sharp analyst,'' said George P. Mitchell, founder of the Mitc=
hell Energy & Development Corporation in Houston. ''When you have 16 out of=
 17 analysts'' promoting the stock, he said, ''that's pretty tough oppositi=
on. But he stuck to his guns, and he did it early.''=20
Mr. Olson's moment in the sun comes at the end of a lonely time. Wall Stree=
t, he said, was dazzled by Enron's high-technology gloss, and did not scrut=
inize the business. That, he said, has been the sad trend of the analyst co=
mmunity during the years of the dot-com bubble, when companies with no prof=
its and few prospects of earning them could get glowing reviews from analys=
ts like Henry Blodgett of Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley.=
=20
''Henry Blodgett might be a nice young man, but . . .'' he said, trailing o=
ff into silence.=20
''On Wall Street,'' he said, ''the worst thing you can be is a schnuckel,''=
 which he said was the Yiddish word for dupe. ''We were schnuckled on Enron=
,'' he said. ''It was gloriously overvalued.''=20
His rough command of Yiddish -- the likely word he was referring to was ''s=
chnook'' -- came from his adolescence in Larchmont, N.Y., where he said the=
 fathers of Jewish girls he dated used choice Yiddish terms to insult him. =
''Yiddish is a marvelously slanderous language,'' he said.=20
A sardonic man, six feet tall, thin and weathered, he looks like a Giacomet=
ti statue in pinstripes. He describes himself as ''a basset hound with a 25=
-watt personality.''=20
After receiving an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of Finance at the Univers=
ity of Pennsylvania, he worked as an analyst covering the oil, gas and elec=
tric power industries for firms including Merrill Lynch, Drexel Burhnam Lam=
bert and First Boston. He is currently director of research for a boutique =
firm here, the Sanders Morris Harris Group.=20
His small corner office, on the 31st floor of one of Houston's many downtow=
n office towers, has a splendid view of Enron Field, the city's new basebal=
l stadium. The wood-framed note from Mr. Lay hangs near a wire sculpture of=
 an oil derrick and a silver yo-yo.=20
The note was scrawled in the margins of a story from U.S. News & World Repo=
rt in which Mr. Olson was quoted as saying, ''They're not very forthcoming =
about how they make their money.'' He went on to say: ''I don't know an ana=
lyst worth his salt who can seriously analyze Enron.'' A messenger delivere=
d the note from Mr. Lay the next day by hand.=20
When Mr. Sanders, his boss, showed him the note, Mr. Olson recalls shruggin=
g. ''You know that I'm old and I'm worthless,'' he said, ''but at least I c=
an spell 'consistent'.''=20
In Houston, opposing Enron was a little like being against the city itself,=
 said Stephen L. Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University. ''=
You could make a case that it was especially hard in Houston to be a skepti=
c on Enron,'' he said, because ''Ken Lay and Enron were very much at the ce=
nter of Houston's sense of positioning itself for success in the post-oil a=
ge'' of trading and high technology.=20
The cost of such pessimism could be high, Mr. Olson said. ''They are a very=
 combative culture over there,'' he said. ''They always played to win.''=20
Those who did not join the chorus of praise for Enron, he said, could be pu=
nished. ''There was a strong mandate, unwritten, unspoken, at Enron that if=
 you the investment banking house ever wanted to do business with Enron, yo=
ur analyst had to have a strong buy on the stock,'' he said. ''I was contin=
ually at war with investment bankers.''=20
His consistency, however, has not been complete. He did recommend Enron sto=
ck when its troubles first drove the price down to $27 a share last Septemb=
er. ''I thought it was a real bargain at the time,'' he said. The slide, of=
 course, continued as Enron headed toward bankruptcy.=20
Surprisingly, he does not believe that Enron is finished. He said that he b=
elieves Enron can, and should, recover because of its trading prowess. ''Th=
ey were the best of the breed,'' he said. ''Trading did not bring them down=
. It was a rogue financing operation.''

The Outlook
Enron Fallout May Cut Stock Prices in General
By Steve Liesman

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

New York -- Are all investors -- even those who didn't hold the stock -- pa=
ying for the collapse of Enron Corp.?=20
That's the question that some economists are pondering as they try to figur=
e out whether the bankruptcy filing of the country's seventh-largest compan=
y has broader market implications.
The $63.39 billion failure (judged by the assets in its most recent quarter=
ly report) itself is small potatoes for an economy the size of the U.S., wh=
ere 2001 gross domestic product exceeded $10 trillion. In fact, the value o=
f Enron's business equaled about 55 hours of output for the entire nation.=
=20

But more widespread economic loss could show up in a more indirect way: thr=
ough a loss of investor confidence that lowers stock prices. In theory, equ=
ity prices reflect a built-in premium that varies depending upon the percei=
ved level of risk. The higher the risk perception, the lower the security p=
rice to allow for greater returns. "If investors think financial informatio=
n is somehow distorting and not portraying the underlying economics of a co=
mpany, common sense says they will exact a premium," says Jim Leisenring, a=
 U.S. member of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20

The most obvious additional risk is that investors now have a new notion of=
 how large is large enough to be considered immune from bankruptcy. Enron's=
 bankruptcy filing is almost as large as the two next biggest failures comb=
ined: Texaco Inc. in 1987 ($35.89 billion) and Financial Corp. of America i=
n 1988 ($33.86 billion). There's more risk because the size of a company th=
at is "too big to fail" has suddenly become larger, says Peter Bernstein, p=
resident of Peter L. Bernstein Inc., an economic consultant to institutiona=
l investors.=20
Enron's collapse is unique in the way it has so publicly and comprehensivel=
y highlighted risk for investors in every part of the market's supposed saf=
eguards. "The Enron debacle has relevance beyond just Enron," says Byron Wi=
en, senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "It has made investors =
more apprehensive about investing and part of the malaise the market has ex=
perienced in the last several weeks is a reflection of that."=20
Internal company memos show that the board and the office of Chairman Kenne=
th Lay approved the off-the-books partnerships that ultimately led to Enron=
's fall. Twice the company waived its code of ethics to allow Enron's forme=
r chief financial officer to head several of these partnerships. So add som=
e risk for the integrity of executives and directors.=20

Revelations that Arthur Andersen was aware of the partnership structures, a=
cted as both external and internal auditor and shredded documents have made=
 even the most skeptical investors rethink what little faith they placed in=
 accountants. There's even a joke among traders that the next great investm=
ent play will be shorting a basket of stocks audited by Andersen. So add so=
me risk for the integrity of the accountants.=20

A look back at the reports from stock analysts before the company's downfal=
l makes clear that the stock analysts, supposedly highly qualified in corpo=
rate finance, didn't understand much of the way Enron earned its money and =
kept debt off its balance sheet. Worse, even after Enron's problems came to=
 light, several analysts from top investment banks continued to recommend t=
he stock while acknowledging the enigma had yet to be fully unraveled. Lehm=
an Brothers analyst Richard Gross called Enron a "strong buy" while noting =
that as a result of an "opaque business, a complicated balance sheet and lo=
w returns on capital Enron trades as a matter of faith." So add some risk f=
or the financial acumen of stock analysts.=20
It has also become apparent that the Financial Accounting Standards Board, =
which sets the accounting rules, has been working for 20 years to create a =
simple standard for disclosing these off-the-books transactions. But becaus=
e of pressure from corporate interests and accountants, it hasn't succeeded=
. And it's now known that the Securities and Exchange Commission gave Enron=
 waivers from two regulations that would have prompted detailed financial d=
isclosures. So add some risk for the regulators.=20
That doesn't leave much for investors to rely upon.=20

To be sure, all of these problems have surfaced in scandals past. And there=
 are those who argue that Enron is an isolated incident because it was the =
only company of its kind: a utility company creating new markets for electr=
icity and broadband trading that engaged in sophisticated finance.=20

But is that really so unique any more? Corporate balance sheets increasingl=
y look like those of financial institutions, with the use of derivatives, v=
endor financing loans, third-party equity stakes and stock options. In fact=
, because of the way companies use stock for employee compensation and, in =
the case of Enron and others, to guarantee corporate obligations, stock has=
 transformed from a reflection of management's performance to a tool of man=
agement to enhance performance. So now, investors must judge whether manage=
rs are good widget makers and good bankers and investors. "As the firm beco=
mes more complex," says Roger Ibbotson, finance professor at the Yale Schoo=
l of Management, "we are less able to understand easily what goes on."=20
And if investors can't trust the directors, executives, accountants or anal=
ysts to come up with good numbers, then everyone will pay a price -- or rat=
her, a lesser price for stocks.

Steel's Shakedown Attempt Will Test Bush's Resolve

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Democrats and the New York Times have been trying mightily to establish som=
e guilt-by-association link between George W. Bush and those hapless tycoon=
s at Enron. Not much luck there. Ken Lay called the government for help but=
 the Bush administration didn't answer.=20
Now, there is another tycoon on the phone yelping for a taxpayer bailout. I=
f George Bush decides to gratify his demands, there will be no complaints f=
rom the Dems. Quite the contrary. The tycoon is U.S. Steel CEO Thomas J. Us=
her and he will have plenty of Democrats backing him up. Indeed, the spokes=
man for his lobby is former Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart.
Mr. Usher's demands on the American taxpayers are limited, but only in the =
sense that a limited amount of water flows over Niagara Falls every day. Al=
l he wants is for the federal government to take over the retiree pension a=
nd health insurance obligations of the big integrated steel producers, so t=
hat U.S. Steel can buy up its competitors free of those burdens. That will =
only cost $12 billion or so, admittedly cheap compared to what it might hav=
e took to make Enron whole.=20
But there's another demand, for new tariffs of up to 40% on 16 types of imp=
orted steel. That one gets a bit expensive. It will raise the price of stee=
l to U.S. manufacturers, making them vulnerable to further market inroads f=
rom foreign competitors. It also will raise the hackles of U.S. trading par=
tners, giving them justification to retaliate against U.S. products.=20
The European Union has just won a World Trade Organization ruling allowing =
it to punish the U.S. with $4 billion in trade sanctions until the U.S. abo=
lishes foreign sales corporations, exporters exempted from corporate income=
 taxes. Europe doesn't much want to retaliate, because it would raise price=
s in Europe, and there is an important question of what business the WTO ha=
s deciding tax policy, anyway. Europe might be willing to call it quits if =
the U.S. chooses to forego any new steel tariffs. If the U.S. gets such an =
offer, it should take it. A nasty issue with the potential of further gummi=
ng up trade relations could be swept under the rug, with benefits all aroun=
d.=20
But will the Bush administration stand up to Big Steel? Various political a=
dvisers argue that refusing the industry's demands might cost Republicans c=
ontrol of the Congress next fall. A collapse of the richly rewarding retire=
ment benefits system granted by the companies to the United Steelworkers Un=
ion in fatter times could sow discontent in places like Indiana and Pennsyl=
vania. Republican congressional candidates could lose in these and other "b=
attleground" states.=20
Mr. Usher's argument is that if the industry can get this bailout, it can c=
onsolidate and make itself more competitive against big competitors in Asia=
 and Europe. He is seconded by Bethlehem Steel CEO Robert Miller, Jr., whos=
e knowledge derives from his role in arranging the 1980 government rescue o=
f Chrysler Corp. The idea is to meld Bethlehem, a Chapter 11 bankrupt, with=
 U.S. Steel and some other failing integrated producers, like National and =
Weirton. But that can't happen, they say, unless the government assumes the=
ir worker retirement obligations, which represent a cost that in some cases=
 is higher than the value of the companies themselves. The government also =
would have to waive antitrust objections, but that would be no big deal.=20
With this help, it's claimed, the U.S. could have one big happy integrated =
producer and all would be well. But is that really true? The U.S. governmen=
t has been protecting steel companies for decades through import quotas and=
 the like, and the result has been a worsening of the industry's sickness. =
The integrated producers start with a cost disadvantage in that they mainta=
in the expensive blast furnaces that convert iron ore into pig iron to be c=
onverted into steel. So-called minimills, which use electric arc furnaces t=
o smelt scrap, can make steel much cheaper and have been taking over more a=
nd more of the market. Many foreign producers, unburdened with expensive la=
bor contracts like those the Steelworkers have won, can undersell as well. =
In a market where demand hasn't grown significantly for years, the integrat=
ed producers are the odd man out.=20
Yet the real issue before the Bush administration is whether it wants to co=
ntinue taking extreme measures to keep this crippled industry on its feet, =
or whether it wants to cut its losses. If the busted mills simply liquidate=
, retired steelworkers won't go hungry. The younger ones have recourse to t=
he government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and indeed are still of work=
ing age. The older ones also have access to Social Security and Medicare. T=
hat's not to say they would suffer no loss, but is it really fair to ask ta=
xpayers who have survived on much less generous pay and benefit packages to=
 support steelworkers at their present levels?=20
More to the point is the example a steel bailout sets for industry in gener=
al. Does the Bush administration want to establish a precedent that the gov=
ernment will assume the obligations of every declining industry in an attem=
pt to arrest that decline? One of the great strengths of the American econo=
my has been its adaptability. The promise of a bailout simply tells manager=
s and workers they won't have to adapt to changing market circumstances. Mo=
re insidiously, it tells them that they can get through politics what they =
couldn't get through hard work and adroit management of their enterprises.=
=20
The worst effect of all is what bailouts say to the rest of the world. They=
 say that the great proponent of free trade has feet of clay. The Bush admi=
nistration is striving hard to preserve America's free trade bona fides by =
asking Congress to restore the President's fast-track authority to negotiat=
e trade agreements that Congress must vote up or down, without crippling am=
endments. That authority is essential if the new round of trade negotiation=
s launched by WTO trade ministers in Qatar last fall is to bear fruit.=20
Reductions of trade restrictions have been the engine driving the growth of=
 the world economy since the Kennedy Round was launched in the 1960s. It ha=
s allowed many millions of the world's people to move from a subsistence ex=
istence into the cash economy and to rise out of poverty to income levels t=
hat provide them with creature comforts and human dignity. This is not a sm=
all thing to risk for the meager returns that will result from keeping a sm=
all group of U.S. companies on life support for a few years longer.

The Urge to Punish Cheats: It Isn't Merely Vengeance
By NATALIE ANGIER

01/22/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Over the last couple of weeks, as the Enron fiasco has played itself out li=
ke a louche fusion of Shakespeare and the old ''Dewey, Cheatum & Howe'' rou=
tine, Americans have been transfixed by the story, united in a nearly seaml=
ess sense of outrage.=20
Regardless of whether any laws were broken in the spectacular collapse of o=
ne of the nation's largest companies, citizens of all political pipings hav=
e voiced disgust at accounts of top Enron executives selling off their stoc=
k in time to enrich themselves handsomely, while ordinary Enron employees w=
ere later forced to sit by in impotent desperation as their retirement savi=
ngs evaporated.
In the ferocity of the public outcry, and the demand from even those with n=
o personal stake in the Enron collapse that ''justice'' be done, some scien=
tists see a vivid example of humanity's evolved and deep-seated hatred of t=
he Cheat. The Cheat is the transgressor of fair play, the violator of accep=
ted norms, the sneak who smiles with Chiclet teeth while ladling from the c=
ommunity till.=20
Human beings are elaborately, ineluctably social creatures, scientists say,=
 and are more willing than any other species to work for the common good --=
 to cooperate with nonkin and to help out strangers, sometimes at great cos=
t to oneself, as the death of hundreds of rescue workers at the World Trade=
 Center only too sadly showed.=20
Such a readiness to trust others, to behave civilly in a crowd, to share an=
d empathize, to play the occasional Samaritan -- all the behaviors that we =
laud and endorse and vow to cultivate more fully in ourselves -- could not =
have evolved without a corresponding readiness to catch, and to punish, the=
 Cheat.=20
Only recently have researchers realized that a willingness, even eagerness,=
 to punish transgressors of the social compact is at least as important to =
the maintenance of social harmony as are regular displays of common human d=
ecency. And while the punitive urge may seem like a lowly and unsavory impu=
lse, scientists point out that the effort to penalize cheaters is very ofte=
n a selfless act.=20
In an article titled ''Altruistic Punishment in Humans,'' which appears in =
the Jan. 10 issue of the journal Nature, Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University o=
f Zurich and Dr. Simon Gachter of the University of St. Gallen in Switzerla=
nd offer evidence that people will seek to punish a cheat even when the pun=
ishment is costly to them and offers no material benefit -- the very defini=
tion of altruism. The researchers propose that the threat of such punishmen=
t may have been crucial to the evolution of human civilization and all its =
concomitant achievements.=20
''It's a very important force for establishing large-scale cooperation,'' D=
r. Fehr said in a telephone interview. ''Every citizen is a little policema=
n in a sense. There are so many social norms that we follow almost unconsci=
ously, and they are enforced by the moral outrage we expect if we were to v=
iolate them.''=20
Dr. David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at the State University o=
f New York at Binghamton, said, ''People are used to thinking of social con=
trol and moralistic aggression as forms of selfishness, and that you must b=
e punishing someone for your own benefit. But if you look at the sort of pu=
nishment that promotes altruistic behavior, you see that it is itself a for=
m of altruism.''=20
In their new work, Dr. Fehr and Dr. Gachter put 240 students through a seri=
es of ''public goods'' experiments with real monetary stakes, always a good=
 incentive for cash-strapped young scholars.=20
Each participant was given an initial lump sum of 20 ''monetary units'' and=
 allowed to play a series of games with rotating groups of three other part=
icipants. By the rules of the game, the members of each group independently=
 decided how much of their sum to contribute to a community project, which =
in turn determined how much would be divvied up to participants in the end.=
 The more generous each contributor, the better the group did as a whole, b=
ut there was always the risk of a participant's trying to freeload off the =
contributions of others.=20
From one round to the next, students were kept apprised of the investment d=
ecisions by others in their group. In some cases, there was nothing they co=
uld do about their teammates' behavior. In other cases, though, participant=
s were allowed to ''punish'' freeloaders and skinflints after the round was=
 through: one monetary unit from them would cost the shirker three monetary=
 units. Hence, cooperators had to pay out of their own pocket to express th=
eir disgust at another's selfish behavior.=20
The outcome of the study was striking on two fronts. One was the popularity=
 of punishment when it was permitted: 84 percent punished defectors at leas=
t once, 34.3 percent took punitive action five times or more and almost 10 =
percent punished the stingy 10 times or more. And all this, remember, invol=
ved the doling out of mad money from people who really needed it.=20
The second significant result was that when the game was carried out under =
no-punishment conditions, cooperation among group members quickly broke dow=
n, and participants contributed progressively less to the public kitty as t=
he rounds went on. But when the opportunity to punish and be punished was a=
pplied, individual contributions to the collective fund jumped sharply, and=
 cooperation among group members grew stronger rather than weaker from roun=
d to round.=20
The researchers also asked participants to describe their feelings toward f=
ree-riders on a seven-point scale, from ''no big deal'' to ''very angry,'' =
and about 84 percent ranked themselves a five or higher. A sense of emotion=
al outrage is very easily evoked, said Dr. Fehr, and sometimes it feels alm=
ost good to indulge and stoke it.=20
Perhaps part of the reason it feels good to rail against the sinner is that=
 not to do so seems irresponsible, if not cowardly. ''Once you think of pun=
ishment as a form of altruism, then the kind of person who doesn't punish e=
merges as a kind of freeloader too,'' said Dr. Wilson, author with Dr. Elli=
ott Sober of ''Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behav=
ior.''=20
The emotional palette behind the effectiveness of social control is a rich =
one, composed not only of a sharp sense of moral indignation and a fear of =
being punished, but embarrassment and shame when one violates social norms.=
=20
Dr. Wilson said that when he and his children, nonbowlers all, recently wen=
t bowling, they were mortified when others gently scolded them for failing =
to observe common bowling etiquette, like taking turns with bowlers in neig=
hboring lanes. ''My ears were burning with shame, and we fled as soon as we=
 could,'' he said.=20
And sometimes the severity of the emotion far outstrips that of the transgr=
ession. Dr. Fehr cited a case during the oil crisis of the 1970's that led =
to long waits at gas stations, when one motorist shot another to death for =
attempting to butt into line. Some of the most odious of human behaviors, i=
ncluding torture, public stonings and lynchings, may all be examples of the=
 meting out of altruistic punishment run amok.=20
The drive to punish selfish transgressors seems to be a basic human predile=
ction. Paradoxically, it stems from something normally associated with rosy=
-eyed utopianism: according to most anthropological evidence, traditional h=
unter-gatherer societies have always been highly egalitarian.=20
In such cultures, there are no kings or commanders, and the bounty of a goo=
d hunt or forage is generally shared with the entire community. If one pers=
on doesn't like or trust another, the person may walk away, or articulate t=
hat distrust with the tip of a spear.=20
''Hunter-gatherer societies are scrupulously egalitarian, but not harmoniou=
sly so,'' said Dr. Herbert Gintis of the University of Massachusetts, a co-=
author on a commentary that appears with the current Nature research report=
. ''They're violently egalitarian.''=20
Despite its antiquity, the strength and expression of the urge to scourge i=
s clearly shaped by culture. Anthropological studies by Dr. Fehr, Dr. Ginti=
s and others have shown considerable cross-cultural variation in the ardor =
with which people seek to punish shifty noncooperators. As a rule, said Dr.=
 Fehr, the more closely a society's economy is based on market rather than =
kinship ties, the more prevalent the use of altruistic punishment to bring =
others into line.=20
In other words, the more likely a person is to be negotiating with nonrelat=
ives, and hence the higher the chances that selfish freeloaders will seek t=
o infiltrate the system, the more important it becomes that everybody play =
by the rules. Or else.

Commentary Enron Got Its Money's Worth Look no further than the national en=
ergy plan.

One of the major falsehoods being bandied about by apologists for the Bush =
administration is that while Enron may have bankrolled much of the presiden=
t's political career it got nothing for those bucks once George W. occupied=
 the White House.=20
That is nonsense.
The administration's energy program, developed by Vice President Dick Chene=
y in secret meetings--six of them with Enron officials--could have been wri=
tten by lobbyists for the now failed company.=20
At the behest of Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the minority staff of t=
he House Committee on Government Reform has prepared a devastating analysis=
 of 17 major concessions made to Enron that gave Kenneth L. Lay, Bush's int=
imate friend and Enron chief executive, just about everything he wanted. Th=
e report concluded that "it is unlikely that any other corporation in Ameri=
ca stood to gain as much from the White House plan as Enron."=20
Those Bush administration concessions to Enron included finishing the job o=
f deregulating the electricity market begun by Bush's father. The senior Bu=
sh's actions had paved the way for the company's meteoric growth.=20
George W.'s energy plan also made it even easier for Enron to sell energy d=
erivatives in the commodity market and pursue other financial shenanigans t=
hat had been a major source of profit. The unregulated selling of energy de=
rivatives, an Enron specialty, was celebrated in the Bush energy plan as "s=
ophisticated and customizable." We now know that practice was so sophistica=
ted that it was the major source of Enron's paper profits.=20
Oddly, given that Republicans are presumed to favor leaving power with the =
states, the Bush energy plan emphasized increased federal power over utilit=
y pipelines that forced local utilities to carry Enron's product. This was =
an expansion of the "open access" powers granted in the 1992 Energy Policy =
Act, passed in the first Bush administration. That law undermined the power=
 of local authorities and regional utility companies for the benefit of Enr=
on. In 1999, Enron had defined "open access" as the company's "single-most =
important initiative."=20
Two years later, George W. delivered. Fortunately this subversion of the po=
litical process had a short life because Enron went belly up before Bush co=
uld save the company from itself.=20
But the question remains why Bush, as governor and president, wanted to foi=
st the example of such a despicable corporate player upon the American peop=
le as a model for business behavior.=20
Surely the Enron alums who occupy key positions in the administration knew =
that the president's model corporation had avoided paying federal income ta=
xes for four out of the past five years.=20
Enron even claimed $382 million in government refunds. How dare this presid=
ent collect taxes from ordinary Americans after touting a company that crea=
ted 881 offshore dodges to avoid taxes. Few taxpayers can open subsidiaries=
 in the Cayman Islands pretending to do business, but Enron had more than 7=
00 there.=20
The IRS and Treasury Department under the Clinton administration had attack=
ed the use of such tax dodges and attempted to eliminate them. Bush, howeve=
r, sought to reward a company that, far more than any of its competitors, t=
ook advantage of offshore loopholes. Dynegy, Enron's lead competitor, had n=
o offshore tax havens, suggesting that it is possible to do business honest=
ly.=20
But how would Bush know of his pet company's chicanery, his apologists howl=
--particularly the talk radio right-wingers who spent eight years skewering=
 Bill Clinton over the most minor transgressions? Bush should have known be=
cause his top economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was paid $50,000 i=
n 2000 for consulting work for Enron, went straight from that gig to being =
head of the White House's National Economic Council. In the latter capacity=
, Lindsey wrote a rosy report on Enron's emerging problems and presented it=
 to the president shortly before the company's collapse.=20
Were he and the other Enron alum who hold high positions in the administrat=
ion lying to the president, or did Bush not want to hear any bad news about=
 his once-favorite company? Either way it smells.=20

Thinking Things Over: I'm OK, You're OK! Enron's OK?
By Robert L. Bartley

01/21/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A13
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Not even the most ardent advocates of capitalism claim it can abolish pride=
, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins. Sinners do get flushed out b=
y recession, however, and we find that Enron, a darling of the mid-1999 to =
mid-2000 blowout, was a house of cards. Maybe, though the jury is not yet e=
ven impaneled, a crime.=20
Such spectacles are occasion not only to pursue the miscreants but also to =
keep the larger picture in mind. For all of human failing, capitalism as an=
 economic system has emerged triumphant from the long trials of the 20th ce=
ntury, providing the developed world once unimaginable prosperity and, not =
so incidentally, historically unprecedented personal freedom.
As we try to prevent another Enron, it will pay to keep in mind that the su=
ccess secret of capitalist economies is decentralized decision-making. When=
 a multitude of buyers and sellers meet in a marketplace, the vagaries of h=
uman judgment even out, facts prevail and true values are reached. Over the=
 centuries since the first money-changers, this principle has been applied =
to wider and wider economic spheres, reaching its highest expression in tod=
ay's international financial markets, directing the investment of capital a=
round the world.=20
Capital markets are particularly good at funding innovation, providing inve=
stment in promising ventures where government technology priming consistent=
ly picks losers. Market-driven economies also have great recuperative power=
; far from buckling from the shocks it has received over the last year, the=
 U.S. economy has stabilized and is probably already recovering. Too, advan=
ced capitalism has developed mechanisms, pension systems and mutual funds i=
n particular, for sharing the bounty through a deep middle class. Peter Dru=
cker has observed that with shares of big corporations predominantly held i=
n pension funds, workers do own the means of production, just as Karl Marx =
wanted.=20
Results can of course be disrupted by market imperfections, for example whe=
n one buyer or seller knows things others do not. Perhaps also by the passi=
on of the crowd, though as history unwinds "bubbles" and "panics" often tur=
n out to have rational explanations after all. Whatever the exceptions, tho=
ugh, year in and year out market-determined decisions outperform even the b=
est-informed and most brilliant individual mind.=20
A capitalist economy does not arise spontaneously from the anarchy of pirac=
y and war. Government plays an absolutely essential role in establishing a =
rule of law, protecting property rights, enforcing contracts and providing =
sound money. But it is also true that over history the greatest threat to p=
roperty is government itself, acting through immoderate taxation, stifling =
regulation and even outright seizure.=20
These minefields suggest some care in designing arrangements to head off hu=
man folly; the system works because people are allowed to fail, indeed to m=
ake fools of themselves. It will not be an advance if we charter some group=
 of brilliant and well-informed mandarins to head off human folly. In reali=
ty, worse, the mandarins would soon be marching to the tune of some or anot=
her batch of politicians feeding this or that narrow constituency.=20
How then to curb the seven deadly sins? Surely the law plays a part, and as=
 we learn about the inner workings of Enron venality seems more and more li=
kely. If it comes time to indict, I hope prosecutors will not rest with a s=
afe case turning on some never-before-enforced provision Congress in its wi=
sdom has declared a felony. To satisfy what's on everyone's mind, they need=
 to see whether they can make the case that top executives set out to steal=
 from their shareholders.=20
What is particularly disturbing about Enron, though, is that failures run f=
ar beyond individual executives. Directors suspending their ethical guideli=
nes to allow self-dealing partnerships. Accountants and lawyers studiously =
looking the other way, even to the point of personal jeopardy. Wall Street =
analysts failing in their principal duty of correctly evaluating share pric=
es. This systemic failure is being blamed on "conflicts of interest," an ex=
planation that strikes me as, well, jejune.=20
The systemic failure is not a matter of economic arrangements, but of the s=
ocietal collapse of standards and morality over the last three decades or s=
o. As a society we seem increasingly incapable of sitting in judgment of ea=
ch other -- certainly not on the behavior of prominent entertainers, sports=
 figures or presidents. We have a legal profession that tolerates and even =
promotes abuse of the legal system in class action suits -- in the current =
Microsoft claims settlement enriching lawyers while not even trying to give=
 a cent to supposedly injured plaintiffs. What kind of behavior can an "I'm=
 OK, you're OK" society expect from its professionals or business leaders?=
=20
Since accountants are bearing the first wave of recrimination, a few specia=
l words: They're vulnerable because their exercise is so artificial. The "e=
arnings per share" figures they grind out and argue over have only a vague =
relation to economic success and market value. Another of Peter Drucker's i=
nsights is that "profit" is best defined as that portion of cash flow the g=
overnment has decided to tax. Dividends are not a tax-deductible cost, for =
example, though in economic terms they are interest on the capital sharehol=
ders have advanced.=20
Thus any good economic principles course will distinguish between accountin=
g profits and economic profits. On the latter, mainstream economists take o=
ne of two views: Some follow Frank Knight, seeing profits as the reward for=
 bearing uncertainty. Others follow Joseph Schumpeter, seeing profits as th=
e reward for innovation -- the monopoly return to an original product, quic=
kly vanishing as imitators arrive. One way to look at Enron's problem is th=
at its economic profits went away, and it sought to substitute accounting p=
rofits.=20
It's fine to close this particular barn door, to crack down on obscure fina=
ncial footnotes, to have more rules against conflict of interest. But the s=
even deadly sins do not ultimately turn on economic arrangements. The real =
answer to Enron is likely to be found in, say, the little sermons on vice a=
nd virtue that make William J. Bennett so tiresome to our I'm OK, you're OK=
 sophisticates.
