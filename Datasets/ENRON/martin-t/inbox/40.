ENRON'S MANY STRANDS
The Report
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The 217-page report of a special investigative committee of the board of th=
e Enron Corporation, released late Saturday, provides the first independent=
 assessment of what went wrong at the company, which filed for bankruptcy i=
n early December. Here are the principal findings. DIANA B. HENRIQUES=20
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST -- Senior executives who owed their primary allegianc=
e to Enron and its shareholders participated in a number of private partner=
ships that did business with Enron. Through the partnerships, these executi=
ves, including Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer, and Michael J=
. Kopper, who worked with him, were enriched, in the aggregate, by tens of =
millions of dollars they should never have received.
INADEQUATE DISCLOSURE AND ACCOUNTING ERRORS -- Enron disclosed the existenc=
e of one set of partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, to its shareholders. However, =
these disclosures were obtuse, did not communicate the essence of the trans=
actions completely or clearly, and failed to convey the substance of what w=
as going on between Enron and the partnerships.=20
Certain transactions allowed Enron to manipulate its publicly reported earn=
ings, to offset and conceal very large losses and, from September 2000 thro=
ugh September 2001, to report profits that were almost $1 billion higher th=
an should have been reported.=20
The accounting treatment for some partnerships was clearly wrong, apparentl=
y the result of mistakes either in structuring the transactions or in basic=
 accounting. In other cases, the accounting treatment was likely wrong. As =
a result, business entities that should have been included in Enron's finan=
cial statements were not disclosed. A set of entities called the Raptor par=
tnerships were instrumental in Enron's systematic concealment of its losses=
 and inflation of its earnings.=20
A FAILURE AT THE TOP -- Procedures that were set up to police the potential=
 conflicts in the partnerships' dealings with Enron were not rigorous enoug=
h and were inadequately monitored by both senior management and the board. =
Individually, and collectively, Enron's management failed to carry out its =
substantive responsibility for ensuring that the transactions were fair to =
Enron -- which in many cases they were not.=20
The captain of the ship, Kenneth L. Lay, functioned almost entirely as a di=
rector, and less as a member of management.=20
Jeffrey K. Skilling, although he certainly knew or should have known of the=
 risks associated with these transactions, he did not monitor them, even af=
ter Enron's treasurer, Jeffrey McMahon, told him in March 2000 that he had =
serious concerns about Enron's dealings with the LJM partnerships.=20
Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, presided over a series of=
 accounting judgments that went well beyond the aggressive and failed to pr=
ovide the board with sufficient information about transactions.=20
The board failed to adequately oversee management, especially in its dealin=
gs with the problematic partnerships. The board's compensation committee fa=
iled to review Mr. Fastow's compensation from the partnerships. Nor did the=
 board react to warning signs when they occurred.=20
Enron's outside advisers also failed to protect shareholders. The accountin=
g firm Arthur Andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in=
 connection with its audits of Enron's financial statements. Besides making=
 errors that allowed Enron to conceal business transactions that should hav=
e been disclosed, Andersen also failed to alert Enron's audit committee to =
the accounting firm's own concerns about the adequacy of Enron's disclosure=
 of the conflicts involved in these transactions.=20
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's legal counsel, should have brought a stronger, mor=
e objective and more critical voice to the disclosure process.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: ANOTHER INQUIRY
Company Hobbled Investigation by Its Law Firm, Report Says
By KURT EICHENWALD

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

An investigation last year by outside lawyers for Enron into accusations of=
 improprieties raised in an anonymous employee letter to the chairman was h=
ampered by restrictions placed by executives, causing the findings to be ''=
largely predetermined,'' according to a report from a committee of Enron's =
board.=20
The inquiry into the accusations in the letter, later determined to have be=
en written by Sherron S. Watkins, an executive who worked in the company's =
finance area, failed to detect many of the problems that subsequently contr=
ibuted to the company's collapse, even though the letter described them in =
detail.
''Watkins was right about several of the important concerns she raised,'' t=
he report stated. ''On certain points, she was right about the problem, but=
 had the underlying facts wrong. In other areas, particularly her views abo=
ut the public perception of the transactions, her predictions were striking=
ly accurate. Over all, her letter provided a road map to a number of the tr=
oubling issues presented'' by certain partnerships.=20
But the investigation by Enron's lawyers at Vinson & Elkins was inadequate =
largely because of restrictions placed by the company on the lawyers' effor=
ts from the outset, the report says. The lawyers were told not to review th=
e underlying accounting for the partnerships, the very area where Ms. Watki=
ns said a problem existed and where the report found its evidence of errors=
 and potential malfeasance. ''The result of the V.& E. review was largely p=
redetermined by the scope and nature of the investigation and the process e=
mployed,'' the report says.=20
The investigators wrote that they found the most serious problems ''only af=
ter a detailed examination of the relevant transactions and, most important=
ly, discussions with our accounting advisers,'' both steps that Enron deter=
mined would not be part of Vinson & Elkins's investigation.=20
A representative of Vinson & Elkins, speaking on the condition of anonymity=
, said the accusations raised by the letter were strongly examined by the i=
nvestigators.=20
''Sherron Watkins's complaints were taken quite seriously,'' the representa=
tive said. 'The exercise of ascertaining the facts was a serious one.''=20
A series of events surrounded the sending of the Watkins letter. Jeffrey K.=
 Skilling stepped down as chief executive on Aug. 14, after only months in =
the job, and was succeeded by his predecessor, Kenneth L. Lay. A week later=
, Ms. Watkins sent the anonymous letter to Mr. Lay.=20
Mr. Lay passed the letter to Enron's general counsel, James V. Derrick, who=
 in turn hired Vinson & Elkins to investigate, even though the law firm had=
 played a role in some of the transactions challenged by Ms. Watkins.=20
''Derrick says that he and Lay both recognized that there was a downside to=
 retaining V.& E. because it had been involved'' in some of the transaction=
s under investigation, the report says. ''But they concluded that the inves=
tigation should be a preliminary one.''=20
But even in that preliminary investigation, the effort went nowhere, largel=
y because the lawyers sought answers almost exclusively from the people at =
Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, who had been involved in se=
tting up the partnership deals.=20
Vinson & Elkins ''spoke only with very senior people at Enron and Andersen,=
'' the report says. ''Those people, with few exceptions, had substantial pr=
ofessional and personal stakes in the matters under review.''

Internal Probe of Enron Finds Wide-Ranging Abuses --- Unanswered in Board R=
eport Are Some Big Questions Regarding Legal Liability
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

02/04/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A highly anticipated report by a special committee of Enron Corp.'s board i=
nvestigating the energy trader's collapse portrayed a company riddled with =
improper financial transactions and extensive self-dealing by company offic=
ials. But the report left unanswered major questions whose resolution could=
 determine whether the company and its officials will face criminal or civi=
l liability.=20
Some of those questions might begin to be addressed this week as Congress h=
olds a round of hearings on Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest busine=
ss, by revenue, which sought bankruptcy-law protection in early December. K=
enneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive for most of the past 15 ye=
ars, was slated to testify this morning before the Senate Commerce Committe=
e, but yesterday canceled his appearance. Mr. Lay resigned his Enron positi=
ons last month.
The committee's report essentially focuses on certain off-balance-sheet par=
tnerships first disclosed by The Wall Street Journal beginning in October. =
Controversial accounting related to the partnerships was the major factor c=
ontributing to Enron's collapse. The 211-page report by the three-member sp=
ecial board committee and its staff amounts to a scathing indictment of the=
 way the company did business in recent years. Enron "improperly" implement=
ed various transactions "to conceal from the market very large losses" resu=
lting from some of its business operations, the report said. Between the th=
ird quarter of 2000 and the third quarter of 2001, alone, reported earnings=
 were "almost $1 billion higher than should have been reported," it added. =
The committee said the report was prepared with limitations of time and acc=
ess to certain witnesses.=20
Additionally, the report said, several Enron officers and other employees "=
were enriched" by tens of millions of dollars that "they never should have =
received" as the result of being investors in partnerships that did large b=
usiness deals with the company. Among those employees cited by the report w=
ere former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who allegedly made at lea=
st $30 million from heading and partly owning two entities known as the LJM=
 partnerships; Michael Kopper, a former managing director of an Enron unit,=
 who supposedly made at least $10 million from the Chewco Investments partn=
ership and former treasurer Ben Glisan, whom the committee quoted as acknow=
ledging that he received about $1 million within two months of putting $5,8=
00 into one partnership arrangement.=20
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declined to comment. Neither Mr. Kopper nor Mr. =
Glisan could be reached for comment. In the past, both have declined to com=
ment.=20
The report also takes a hard shot at Arthur Andersen LLP, noting that in ad=
dition to being Enron's external auditor, the Chicago firm was paid $5.7 mi=
llion in return for helping design the controversial partnerships that inve=
stigators found were fraught with ethical problems from the start. In a sta=
tement, the big accounting firm said the report wasn't credible because it =
sought to "insulate" Enron officers and directors by "shifting the blame to=
 others."=20
Enron's main outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, also comes in for criticism=
. Vinson & Elkins "should have brought a stronger, more objective and more =
critical voice" to the issue of what Enron needed to disclose publicly abou=
t its partnership-related transactions, the report said.=20
A senior Vinson & Elkins partner declined to discuss what advice the firm g=
ave to Enron executives, citing attorney-client confidentiality. The lawyer=
 pointed out that the report notes that Vinson & Elkins, based in Washingto=
n, did push Enron to disclose more but the lawyers were overruled by Enron'=
s investor-relations department.=20
Still, there's plenty the report doesn't say. It rarely ventures beyond an =
examination of the LJM and Chewco partnerships, uncovered by The Wall Stree=
t Journal in articles published last fall. Since then, allegations have eme=
rged concerning possible fraudulent accounting schemes at several Enron uni=
ts including Enron Energy Services and Enron Broadband Services. These aren=
't addressed in the report. The report also didn't answer questions concern=
ing who had crucial information about the creation and financing of the Che=
wco partnership in 1997. In testimony to Congress in December, Andersen Chi=
ef Executive Joseph Berardino said that those 1997 Chewco-related activitie=
s involved "possible illegal acts."=20
The provenance of the report also casts a shadow on its handling of issues =
concerning the investigating committee itself and its advisers. The chairma=
n, William Powers, is dean of the law school at University of Texas, a faci=
lity that has ties to Vinson & Elkins. Another member, Herbert "Pug" Winoku=
r Jr., was an outside director on Enron's board when many of the transactio=
ns now under scrutiny were approved. Raymond Troubh, the final member of th=
e committee, has no apparent conflict.=20
As for the advisers, William McLucas, former head enforcement officer for t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission, now works for the Washington-based l=
aw firm of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, which is representing Enron in a case=
 against federal energy regulators that is currently before the U.S. Suprem=
e Court. The accounting firm that helped advise the committee, Deloitte & T=
ouche, has previously done tax work for Enron, including "certain limited t=
ax-related services for Chewco Investments," according to the report.=20
Despite these potential conflicts, the report provides a wealth of detail a=
bout specific transactions -- including the nearly two dozen involving the =
LJM partnerships created by Mr. Fastow.=20
The theme of the report remains consistent from deal to deal: Officers who =
should have been concerned with doing their fiduciary duty to shareholders =
instead cooked up Rube Goldberg-like structures to circumvent already weak =
accounting rules. Not only did the ventures engage in transactions that vio=
lated accounting rules, the report says, but numerous transactions were don=
e that "served no apparent business purpose for Enron" and appear ginned up=
 simply to generate fees for insiders.=20
According to the report, one of the most egregious examples of financial en=
gineering concerned LJM partnership subentities known as "Raptor" that were=
 used to "hedge" or provide offsets to fluctuating values in other Enron in=
vestments.=20
Had they been true hedges, says the report, there would have been a true tr=
ansfer of risk from Enron to another party, in return for fair compensation=
. But that isn't the way Enron did business. Instead, Enron engaged in appa=
rently false transactions with related parties, using its own stock, in som=
e cases. This provided big bursts of profits for the company while stocks w=
ere rising. But it also generated big losses when prices were moving in the=
 opposite direction. In late 2000 and early 2001, according to the report, =
two of the Raptor vehicles had insufficient credit capacity to pay Enron on=
 its hedges.=20
"As a result, in late March 2001, it appeared Enron would be required to ta=
ke a pretax charge against earnings of more than $500 million," the report =
says, "to reflect the shortfall in credit capacity" of the Raptor structure=
s.=20
Rather than take the lump, Enron chose to "restructure" the Raptor vehicles=
 by transferring more than $800 million of contracts to the vehicles that e=
ntitled the holder to receive still more Enron stock. The report says the t=
ransactions don't appear to have been authorized by the board of directors.=
=20
This maneuver enabled Enron to put off declaring substantial losses from th=
e first quarter of 2001 until the third quarter -- by which point the compa=
ny's chief executive had departed. Shortly before Mr. Skilling resigned as =
president in August 2001, both he and Mr. Lay told investment analysts that=
 the company's financial condition had never been stronger.=20
Another troublesome series of transactions detailed in the report concerned=
 Chewco, a vehicle run by Mr. Kopper, a member of Enron's Global Finance te=
am who reported to Mr. Fastow. The committee said it found no evidence that=
 any waiver from Enron's code of conduct ever was obtained from the board, =
prior to Mr. Kopper's involvement.=20
Chewco was created to hold part ownership in another Enron-related investme=
nt vehicle. Enron was prohibited from holding this interest directly unless=
 it wanted to put the related debt back on its balance sheet. But to keep t=
he investment "unconsolidated," Chewco had to be separate from Enron, in te=
rms of management, and it had to have outside equity equal to at least 3% o=
f its total capacity.=20
It failed both tests, the investigators found. The outside equity piece was=
 provided by two other entities controlled by Mr. Kopper called Little Rive=
r Funding LLC and Big River Funding LLC. Mr. Kopper in December 1997 transf=
erred his interest in these entities to William Dodson, the report says. Th=
e two men, according to the report, are "domestic partners." The nature of =
their relationship at the time of the Chewco transactions isn't clear.=20
Mr. Kopper received $2 million in "management and other fees" related to Ch=
ewco during a three-year period that ended in December 2000. The committee =
said it couldn't identify "what, if anything, Kopper did to justify the pay=
ments." All told, Mr. Kopper and Mr. Dodson received more than $12 million =
from Enron and Enron-related entities in return for what is believed to hav=
e been an initial investment of $125,000.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: NEWS ANALYSIS
Talk of Crime Gets Big Push
By KURT EICHENWALD

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The report released Saturday evening by a special committee of the Enron Co=
rporation's board clearly raises the specter that at the foundation of the =
company's downfall was a series of multimillion-dollar crimes, legal expert=
s and former prosecutors said yesterday.=20
Until now, much of the investigation into Enron's free fall has been focuse=
d on complex transactions that, while suspicious and poorly executed, appea=
red to fall within the framework of workaday corporate finance. These inclu=
de the now notorious off-balance sheet deals that shifted assets and debt f=
rom the company's books and into a byzantine collection of partnerships, ma=
ny of them controlled by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. =
Fastow.
But with the committee's report, if it proves accurate, investigators into =
the company's collapse will seek to pinpoint whether the same kinds of frau=
dulent acts that were at the foundation of the savings and loan scandals of=
 the late 1980's and early 1990's occurred at Enron, too. These include fal=
se valuation of assets, bogus deals between related parties, and millions o=
f dollars pocketed by participants along the way.=20
''This report is a road map for the Department of Justice to bring a crimin=
al indictment,'' said John J. Fahy, a certified public accountant who was o=
nce a federal prosecutor in New Jersey.=20
With its detailed description of seemingly irrational transactions that ser=
ved no economic purpose other than to pump up Enron's earnings, the report =
has shifted the focus from the company's balance sheet, which lists assets =
and liabilities, to its income statement, which describes revenues and prof=
its.=20
To those uncomfortable with the internecine workings of finance, that may s=
ound like a distinction without a difference.=20
But in truth, the shift allows the federal inquiries trying to unravel the =
Enron collapse to move from an area weighed down by dueling professional op=
inions to the familiar stomping ground of criminal prosecutions.=20
''Moving from the balance sheet to the income statement makes the case a lo=
t easier for a prosecutor to bring and a lot easier for a prosecutor to exp=
lain to a grand jury,'' Mr. Fahy said.=20
To prove any case against Enron, prosecutors would have to establish that p=
otential defendants intended to commit a crime. Under the law, a person can=
 participate in activities that result in false information being given to =
investors without committing a crime, so long as he believed -- even falsel=
y -- that the activities were appropriate.=20
That is what created difficulties for a criminal case based on Enron's inco=
rrect accounting for the partnerships as separate entities. Executives at E=
nron could point to approvals from Arthur Andersen, the company's accountin=
g firm, as evidence that they intended nothing improper.=20
But with the report's conclusion that certain transactions served no purpos=
e other than to manipulate the reported earnings of the company -- and with=
 certain executives personally receiving millions of dollars in undisclosed=
 profits from their partnership dealings -- the hurdle of proving intent to=
 commit a crime has been dramatically lowered.=20
''It's going to take a herculean salesmanship job to persuade a jury that t=
he Enron executives involved in this could not appreciate the fraudulent na=
ture of these transactions,'' said Christopher J. Bebel, formerly a federal=
 prosecutor and a lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commission who is=
 now with Shepherd, Smith & Bebel in Houston.=20
''Their reliance on the advice of experts is starting to go out the window,=
'' Mr. Bebel added, ''and the accountants could end up being key witnesses =
for the government in some respects.''=20
Members of Congress, who have been investigating the Enron debacle, made it=
 clear yesterday that what they are seeing now appears to fall within the r=
ealm of a criminal conspiracy.=20
''We're finding what may clearly be securities fraud,'' Representative Bill=
y Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Energy and Comm=
erce Committee, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''=20
Most criminal fraud prosecutions must show that participants had some finan=
cial motive to participate in an illegal scheme, and in this instance, form=
er prosecutors said, there are plenty of examples of such benefits. Enron i=
nsiders received millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation from their=
 dealings with the partnerships; Mr. Fastow alone, whose spokesman has decl=
ined comment, received at least $30 million from his partnership dealings.=
=20
An array of other insiders received huge sums in a deal offered to them by =
Mr. Fastow and another executive, Michael J. Kopper, who declined to be int=
erviewed by the committee. Two participants in the deal earned about $1 mil=
lion in profits in just two months from an investment of $5,800 each, the r=
eport said.=20
''The magnitude of these returns raise serious questions as to why Fastow a=
nd Kopper offered these investments to the other employees,'' the report sa=
id.=20
Ultimately, if the report proves correct that profits were improperly manip=
ulated, the range of charges that would be under consideration are the stan=
dard mix for corporate frauds, according to former federal prosecutors. The=
y include, at their base, securities fraud from the filing of false informa=
tion regarding corporate profits with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Those, in turn, lead to charges of mail fraud and wire fraud relating to=
 the transmission of that information, both to the S.E.C. and to the invest=
ing public.=20
Despite the dozens of people involved in the transactions, the report descr=
ibes an atmosphere of compartmentalized information, where few people under=
stood the full scope of anything that was going on.=20
Employees had little understanding of their roles and responsibilities in t=
he transactions; in one particularly stunning passage, the report describes=
 how an executive who negotiated a deal with Enron on behalf of one of the =
partnerships believed that, instead, she was acting on behalf of the energy=
 company.=20
But, for investigators, the most damning information relates to the repeate=
d instances in which the company engaged in transactions that served no pur=
pose other than to inflate the earnings Enron reported to investors and the=
 public.=20
Indeed, the portrait painted by the report is one of a corporation where fa=
cts were fungible, capable of being massaged and manipulated to create what=
ever outcome most benefited the executives involved. It describes, for exam=
ple, transactions with backdated documentation, done for the apparent purpo=
se of taking advantage of a high price in a stock that was at foundation of=
 the deal. By the time the deal was actually done, the price of the stock h=
ad fallen dramatically, but Enron was able to book millions more in profit =
by simply pretending that the transaction had taken place weeks before it d=
id.=20
Repeatedly, the report said, there were transactions in which Enron sold an=
 asset to a partnership near the end of an accounting period, only to buy t=
hem back later after profits had been booked. The partnership involved in t=
hose transactions never lost money on any deal, the report said, even when =
the value of the asset being bought and sold had declined. Indeed, the repo=
rt said, there are suggestions that Enron guaranteed the partnerships invol=
ved against loss.=20
Ultimately, certain transactions were simply bogus, the report concluded. F=
or example, the most complex series of transactions involve a group of four=
 partnerships known as Raptor I-IV. Purportedly, the transactions were desi=
gned to allow Enron to hedge certain investments it made -- transactions in=
 which the risk of an investment is shared with another party for the purpo=
se of minimizing potential losses. But in truth, the report said, the Rapto=
r transactions were simply a complex group of partnerships controlled by En=
ron, used as a secret dumpsite where troubled Enron businesses -- and the p=
oor financials that accompanied them -- could be hidden.=20
Even worse, the report concluded, is the potential that, since Enron was es=
sentially on both sides of each deal, the transactions were merely an illus=
ion.=20
''The fundamental flaw in these transactions is not that the price was too =
low, the report said. ''Instead, as a matter of economic substance, it is n=
ot clear that anything was really being bought or sold.''

al investigation committee found several reasons many of these transactions=
 raised red flags: Enron often sold the partnership assets at the end of ac=
counting periods, only to buy them back later; LJM made a profit even when =
the asset's value had declined; and true ownership of certain partnership s=
takes was sometimes disguised. Chart shows companies sold or bought back by=

THE FALL OF ENRON CFO's Deals Detailed by Enron Probe: Andrew Fastow headed=
 partnerships in which the energy firm's representatives were his own subor=
dinates, panel's report shows.

HOUSTON -- At least 13 times in the last three years, private partnerships =
headed by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer cut deals with the energy g=
iant in which the executives representing Enron were his own subordinates.=
=20
These arrangements by ousted CFO Andrew S. Fastow created a jungle of confl=
icts of interest in Enron's executive suites and were a key factor in the f=
inancial problems leading to the company's Dec. 2 Chapter 11 bankruptcy fil=
ing, according to findings of the special Enron panel that examined the par=
tnerships.
The report, released Saturday, provides a wide-ranging indictment of the co=
mpany's management and financial practices. Much of the focus is on Fastow,=
 however, as it offers the most detailed account yet of the off-the-books p=
artnerships he oversaw.=20
"The transactions between Enron and the [Fastow] partnerships resulted in E=
nron increasing its reported financial results by more than a billion dolla=
rs, and enriching Fastow and his co-investors by tens of millions of dollar=
s at Enron's expense," said the report, released this weekend.=20
Enron's internal investigation alleges that Fastow, a former banking execut=
ive who became Enron's CFO four years ago at age 36, raided the energy gian=
t from the inside, exposing his employer to deepening risk while orchestrat=
ing side deals that paid him at least $30 million.=20
"Fastow, as CFO, knew what assets Enron's business units wanted to sell, ho=
w badly and how soon they wanted to sell them and whether they had alternat=
e buyers," the report said. "He was in a position to exert great pressure a=
nd influence, directly or indirectly, on Enron personnel who were negotiati=
ng" with the entities in which he had a personal financial stake.=20
Gordon Andrew, a spokesman for Fastow, declined to comment.=20
The 203-page report was written by a three-member panel led by William Powe=
rs, the University of Texas Law School dean appointed to the Enron board sp=
ecifically to conduct the inquiry.=20
Enron had turned to Fastow in the late 1990s to devise a strategy that woul=
d allow the energy giant to keep investing in new businesses while keeping =
the company's credit ratings strong.=20
Fastow responded by increasing Enron's use of so-called special-purpose veh=
icles--corporate entities that can be used to absorb gains and losses as lo=
ng as they are controlled and partially owned by outside investors.=20
Enron had used such financing at least once before, cutting a joint-venture=
 deal with the California Public Employees' Retirement System. But Fastow a=
dded a twist--he proposed that Enron engage in deals with an ostensibly ind=
ependent entity run by one of Enron's own executives.=20
The technique worked for a time. By moving assets and liabilities off its b=
ooks, Enron was able to inflate its profit and credit rating--fueling its s=
wift ascent on Wall Street and pumping up the value of its executives' stoc=
k options.=20
But amid increased scrutiny last year, Enron decided that many of the outsi=
de entities weren't truly independent. On Oct. 16, it was forced to disclos=
e a $1.2-billion drop in shareholder equity, and the resulting decline in i=
ts credit ratings led the company to file for bankruptcy protection.=20
Much of the problem arose from three partnerships engineered or partially o=
wned by Fastow.=20
Chewco Investments=20
Fastow's first such off-the-books design for Enron was Chewco Investments--=
named for the Chewbacca character in the "Star Wars" films. He planned to u=
se Chewco, financed with bank loans, to buy out the California pension syst=
em's share of a joint venture that Enron wanted to keep off its books.=20
But the venture was hardly independent, the report found: The bank loans us=
ed to fund it were guaranteed by Enron, and initially, Fastow planned to ma=
nage it himself while continuing as Enron's CFO.=20
Fastow told employees that Enron's then-president and his mentor, Jeffrey K=
. Skilling, had approved of his participation in Chewco as long as it didn'=
t have to be disclosed in Enron's regulatory filings, the internal probe fo=
und.=20
When Enron's in-house lawyers told him his involvement would have to be dis=
closed, Fastow substituted one of his lieutenants, Michael Kopper, to run t=
he partnership.=20
Although Chewco "apparently required little management" aside from preparin=
g unaudited financial statements for internal use, Kopper received about $2=
 million in fees, the report said. During certain periods of Chewco's exist=
ence, these management tasks "appear to have been performed by Fastow's wif=
e," the report said.=20
LJM Cayman=20
Chewco was just the start of Fastow's deal making. In June 1999, he formed =
a partnership called LJM, with the letters representing the first initials =
of the names of his wife and two children.=20
Fastow formed LJM Cayman to shield Enron from possible losses from its $10-=
million investment in a start-up Internet service provider called Rhythm Ne=
tConnections Inc.=20
As part of the plan, Fastow told Enron's board that he would serve as the g=
eneral partner of LJM Cayman and would invest $1 million of his own money. =
In return, he would be paid fees including 100% of the proceeds of the sale=
 of any assets until he had reached a rate of return of 25%. But he said he=
 would not receive any gains from increases in the price of Enron stock pai=
d to LJM Cayman.=20
The board approved the arrangement, waiving Fastow's potential conflict of =
interest.=20
In a complex swap, Enron moved the risk from the Internet company to LJM Ca=
yman in exchange for more than $170 million in paper increases on Enron sto=
ck locked up in a contract with an outside investment bank.=20
Enron in early 2000 decided to sell the Rhythm shares and had to unwind the=
 deal with LJM. Fastow negotiated the deal with Enron's chief accounting of=
ficer, Richard Causey--another potential conflict.=20
An executive who has been interviewed by congressional investigators said C=
ausey "was intimidated by Andy and didn't think it was his role" to haggle =
with him.=20
Causey could not be reached for comment.=20
According to the calculations of the board investigators, the final deal re=
sulted in Enron giving up options and cash worth $70 million more than the =
restricted shares it received.=20
The transaction also exposed another potential conflict. In March 2000, Fas=
tow had allowed a handful of Enron executives to participate in LJM Cayman.=
 These executives--who included Fastow and Kopper--signed an agreement to f=
orm an entity called Southampton Place, which acquired a stake in LJM Cayma=
n.=20
The deal enabled a Fastow family foundation to receive $4.5 million about t=
wo months after Fastow made an initial investment of $25,000. Two other emp=
loyees who each invested about $5,800 received about $1 million each in the=
 same period.=20
The special committee found that Fastow's financial stake was inconsistent =
with his representation to Enron's board that he wouldn't receive any value=
 from Enron stock involved in the LJM Cayman transaction.=20
The panel also found that at least two of the executives who received windf=
alls from LJM Cayman were representing Enron at the time in transactions wi=
th another Fastow-created entity.=20
LJM2 Co-Investment=20
In October 1999, Fastow engineered the creation of another, far larger enti=
ty called LJM2 Co-Investment. Again, he would serve as the entity's general=
 partner while maintaining his post as Enron's chief financial officer. The=
 plan was to raise money from outside investors and purchase assets from En=
ron and enable the energy giant to remove debt from its books.=20
To raise funds, LJM2 sent an offering memorandum to potential investors. In=
 an usual move, the document emphasized Fastow's position as Enron CFO, not=
ing that LJM2 would have access to "investment opportunities that would not=
 be available otherwise to outside investors." Critics say it is improper f=
or Fastow to dangle the possibility of using inside information for investo=
rs' benefit.=20
The report said the deals often took place under terms that were "remarkabl=
y favorable" to LJM2 while serving no apparent business purpose for Enron. =
For example, in one of the deals, Enron agreed that an LJM2 affiliate would=
n't have to start absorbing Enron losses until the Fastow-controlled LJM2 r=
eceived an initial return of $41 million, or 30%, on its initial $30-millio=
n investment.=20
The report concluded that the troubles created by Fastow's partnerships wou=
ld have come to light far sooner if the board itself had exercised closer o=
versight.

How Chewco Brought Down an Empire

With its "Star Wars" name, its elusive origin and its central role in the i=
mplosion of Enron Corp., the investment partnership named Chewco has been o=
ne of the mysteries of the unfolding scandal.=20
Now it stands exposed in 27 detailed pages of a special investigative repor=
t.
In the Chewco story are examples of huge profits improperly claimed by Enro=
n and individual enrichment by Enron insiders. In three years, a $125,000 i=
nvestment by a second-level financial executive and his domestic partner ba=
llooned into a $10.5 million payoff, plus other lucrative fees.=20
On paper Chewco appeared independent; control was shared by Enron and outsi=
de investors in an arrangement that would permit Enron to keep some of its =
energy projects and debts off its books. Enron executives created Chewco in=
 1997 as part of a complex investment in another Enron partnership that own=
ed stakes in natural gas projects.=20
But personal motives dominated Chewco's history, according to the report by=
 a special investigating committee of Enron's board of directors.=20
First, then-chief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow proposed that he be al=
lowed to manage Chewco, the report said. Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's pre=
sident, told the committee that Fastow also wanted to have members of his w=
ife's family as Chewco's investors, but Skilling said he told Fastow no.=20
Because of his senior executive position, Fastow could not run Chewco witho=
ut publicly disclosing his role, which Skilling did not want, the investiga=
tors said. So Fastow turned Chewco over to a friend, Michael J. Kopper, the=
n-managing director of Enron Global Finance, whom Fastow supervised. Kopper=
's role did not have to be disclosed because of his lower rank.=20
To remove any public appearance that Kopper might be seen as controlling Ch=
ewco, several more pieces were tacked on. An entity, Big River Funding, bec=
ame Chewco's limited partner. Little River Funding was set up as the owner =
of Big River.=20
In December 1997, as Chewco was being created, Kopper transferred his owner=
ship in both Big River and Little River to his domestic partner, William D.=
 Dodson, an employee of an airline. That left Kopper with no formal ownersh=
ip interest in Chewco.=20
Kopper invested $115,000, and Dodson invested $10,000. Before Enron bought =
out their interests in March 2001, Fastow stepped in and pressured Enron to=
 pay more. Kopper and Dodson ultimately shared a $10.5 million windfall fro=
m their $125,000 investment, according to the committee and former Enron em=
ployees.=20
Kopper, in addition to collecting his regular Enron salary, was paid about =
$2 million in questionable management fees relating to Chewco from 1997 to =
2000, the report said. According to the committee, Chewco required little m=
anagement -- mainly clerical work involving transferring funds. Much of tha=
t was done by another Enron employee on company time and occasionally by Fa=
stow's wife, although the report said it wasn't known if she was paid.=20
Kopper and Dodson have an unlisted phone number and could not be reached ye=
sterday.=20
The outlines of Chewco's role in Enron's collapse emerged recently in newsp=
aper reports and in investigations by lawyers representing shareholders. En=
ron, the report said, violated accounting standards when it created Chewco,=
 enabling the company to claim $405 million of profits from 1997 through 20=
00 that it was not entitled to have, while also concealing more than $600 m=
illion in debt. Enron executives broke the rules a second time, the report =
said, using Chewco to report a profit on the increased value of Enron commo=
n stock held by a related partnership, Jedi.=20
When Enron owned up to its accounting violations concerning Chewco and yet =
another partnership, LJM, last November, the disclosures stunned investors =
and pushed Enron toward a death spiral that ended with its Dec. 2 bankruptc=
y court filing.=20
Chewco was an early example of the Byzantine investment structures that wer=
e Fastow's specialty. Its roots go back to 1993, when Enron formed the Jedi=
 partnership with the giant California Public Employees' Retirement System =
(Calpers) to invest in natural gas projects. By 1997, company executives we=
re eager to expand Jedi, but Calpers was reluctant.=20
So Fastow and Kopper decided to buy out Calpers's share, which was then wor=
th $383 million, and replaced it with their new creation, Chewco Investment=
s LP.=20
Jedi was operating off Enron's books. To keep it there, Chewco, as Jedi's n=
ew half-owner, would have to meet certain accounting standards. It would ha=
ve to be independent of Enron's control, and its owners had to put in a sma=
ll but specific amount of real money.=20
That investment requirement came to 3 percent of Chewco's capital, or about=
 $11 million. Kopper was a successful executive, former associates say, but=
 he didn't have $11 million. The solution was to borrow most of the money f=
rom a willing lender -- in this case, Barclays Bank PLC.=20
The remaining 97 percent included a loan from Jedi and another from Barclay=
s. In another questionable part of the transaction, Enron guaranteed the Ba=
rclays' loans.=20
But the creation of Chewco was hurriedly done, and there was a fateful slip=
.=20
At the last minute, key details of the transaction changed, primarily becau=
se Barclays wanted more collateral for its loans. Accordingly, the size of =
Barclays' loan to Kopper and Dodson was trimmed by $6.6 million, making the=
ir investment less than 3 percent. If Fastow or Kopper had found another in=
vestor to make up the difference, Chewco would have met the standard. That =
was not done.=20
From its beginning then, Chewco -- and thus Jedi -- didn't meet accounting =
requirements, so Enron should not have kept Jedi's debt off its books or ha=
ve segregated Jedi's profits and losses from Enron's results, the committee=
 said. Belatedly, the company corrected the error last November, with the d=
evastating revision of its revenue and profits.=20
"We do not know whether this mistake resulted from bad judgment or careless=
ness" by Enron employees or their auditor, Arthur Andersen, "or whether it =
was caused by Kopper or other Enron employees putting their own interests a=
head of their obligations to Enron," the committee said. It noted: "the con=
sequences were enormous."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE BOOKKEEPING
Too Clever by Half: Enron's Doomed 'Triumph of Accounting'
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times
Page 18, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The original raptors were fierce creatures that hunted in packs and managed=
 to bring down larger dinosaurs, which they then devoured.=20
Now the special report of the Enron board committee has clarified just how =
four entities known as Raptors played an essential role in destroying Enron=
. It is a tale of how accounting rules can be abused and insiders enriched.
The report traces the delicate machinery that was used by Enron's accountan=
ts. There appears to have been, at least for a time, a tortured interpretat=
ion of accounting rules that could be used to justify the hiding of $1 bill=
ion in losses.=20
But that smokescreen would have been completely unsuccessful had auditors f=
rom Arthur Andersen forced the company to disclose what was happening, as t=
hey should have done. Those disclosures would have made it clear that there=
 was no economic rationale for the transactions, and thus no reason to thin=
k that Enron had earned nearly as much money as it said it did.=20
Over 15 months, from the beginning of the third quarter of 2000 through the=
 third quarter of 2001, Enron reported pretax profits of $1.5 billion. Had =
Enron not used the Raptor artifices, the figure would have been 72 percent =
lower: $429 million.=20
The accounting rationale was that the risks of some truly bad investments h=
ad been transferred from Enron to the Raptors, which were created in conjun=
ction with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financi=
al officer.=20
In fact, as the report makes clear, there was no real transfer of risk, and=
 Enron eventually had to shoulder the losses. But there was a large transfe=
r of wealth to the Fastow partnerships, which were guaranteed huge profits =
while taking no risks. Those transactions helped provide $30 million for Mr=
. Fastow and millions for other Enron insiders.=20
When it became clear that the Raptor enterprises were failing, Enron desper=
ately restructured them, first at the end of 2000 and again three months la=
ter. Those reorganizations, which the committee denounces in the strongest =
terms, allowed the truth about Enron to stay largely hidden for many months=
 -- a period when top Enron officials sold large quantities of stock.=20
''The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors=
 was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by=
 a group of innovative accountants,'' the committee report stated. ''We bel=
ieve that perception was mistaken. Especially after the restructuring, the =
Raptors were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that wa=
s destined to collapse.''=20
When it did collapse last fall, Enron was forced to take a large loss, whic=
h it painted as extraordinary. It was also forced to take a $1.2 billion re=
duction in shareholder equity -- the amount a company's balance sheet shows=
 the company is worth. As questions about that intensified, Enron's collaps=
e began. The Raptors lived up to their name, bringing down a giant.=20
As with any disaster, there seem to be differing recollections. Jeffrey K. =
Skilling, Enron's president and chief executive during the March 2001 scram=
ble to avoid having to report a half-billion dollars in losses, told the co=
mmittee that he had known little of what happened.=20
Other Enron employees, not named by the committee, recalled that Mr. Skilli=
ng had taken an intense interest, saying that fixing the Raptors was of the=
 highest priority and then calling an accountant to congratulate him after =
the problem was finessed.=20
There also seems to have been a bit of historical revisionism at Arthur And=
ersen, the auditing firm that repeatedly signed off on accounting that the =
committee characterized as dubious or clearly incorrect.=20
In a Dec. 28, 2000, memorandum, Andersen partners in Houston reported that =
they had consulted with officials at the accounting firm's Chicago headquar=
ters before approving a temporary Raptor restructuring that kept Enron from=
 having to report a loss that year.=20
But on Oct. 12, 2001, days before Enron reported the big loss related to Ra=
ptor -- the loss that led to the company's collapse -- an amended version o=
f the December memorandum was put in the files. In that version, the Chicag=
o partners advised that Enron's accounting in December had been wrong.=20
What happened? Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, explained that there =
had been no need for the original memorandum to mention that the Chicago ex=
perts thought the accounting was wrong. That was because the Houston partne=
rs believed that the issue in question was not critical to the accounting.=
=20
The accounting fiction of the Raptor enterprises stemmed from having the pa=
rtnerships agree to assume the losses if some Enron investments lost value,=
 as they did. The Raptors could stand the losses only because they had prof=
its on investments in Enron stock, which was transferred by the company to =
them at a discount.=20
It was an accounting hall of mirrors, and those involved knew it. Enron's c=
orporate secretary, taking notes at a board committee meeting where a Rapto=
r transaction was explained, wrote, ''Does not transfer economic risk, but =
transfers P&L volatility,'' referring to the profit and loss statement. In =
other words, there was no purpose for the deals save to hide the losses. If=
 any directors were bothered by this sleight of hand, they do not appear to=
 have spoken up.=20
If the Raptor accounting was correct, the committee concluded, then ''a com=
pany with access to its outstanding stock could place itself on an ascendin=
g spiral: an increasing stock price would enable it to keep losses on its i=
nvestments from public view; which, in turn, would spur further increases i=
n its stock price; which, in turn, would increase its capacity to keep loss=
es from its investments from public view.''=20
Arthur Andersen says its auditors acted properly, and it says the board rep=
ort ''overlooks the fundamental problem: that poor business decisions on th=
e part of Enron executives and its board ultimately brought the company dow=
n.''=20
In fact, the board committee's report makes clear that bad investments play=
ed an important role in Enron's demise. But it also provides evidence that =
if Andersen had done its job well, investors would have known the reality o=
f those bad investments long before they did.

Chart: ''Raptors, a Step-by-Step Guide'' Through complex derivatives tranac=
tions, enterprises called Raptors were used by Enron to hedge the risk that=
 stock investments it held might decline. Here are how the Raptors worked, =
according to a recent report by an investigative committee of Enron's board=
. RAPTOR LJM2 1 Creating a Raptor Partnership Each Raptor needed capital to=
 operate. Enron provided its stock to the Raptor in exchange for a promisso=
ry note. LJM2, a partnership run by senior Enron executives and financed by=
 outside investors, invested $30 million in the Raptor. In return, LJM2 was=
 promised at least a 30 percent return. 2 Recouping LJM2's Investment The R=
aptor could not operate until LJM2 had recouped its investment and made a p=
rofit. Enron paid the Raptor $41 milion for a contract that allowed Enron t=
o sell the Raptor a certain amount of its stock at a fixed price sometime i=
n the future. The Raptor gave the $41 million to LJM2, thereby repaying LJM=
2's investment and giving it a profit of $11 million -- enough to satisfy i=
ts investors. 3 Putting the Raptor to Work With LJM2 paid off, Enron made a=
 contract with the Raptor in which the Raptor agreed to cover any losses fr=
om certain Enron investments if those investments declined in value. In ret=
urn, the Raptor was promised any gains if the investments appreciated in va=
lue. The Problem -- The agreement between Enron and the Raptor protected En=
ron from a decline in the value of its investments only if the Raptor was a=
ble to cover those losses. That was possible only if the Raptor's principal=
 asset -- Enron's stock -- rose in value. If the stock fell, it would be un=
able to meet its obligations and Enron would be stuck with the losses.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE BOARD
Shareholder Advocates Press For Actions Against Directors
By REED ABELSON

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 20, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Shareholder activists said yesterday that they would use the sharply critic=
al report by a special committee of Enron's board to take a much closer loo=
k at the board's own responsibility for the company's collapse.=20
''Nothing could be more conclusive on the substantial unfitness of the Enro=
n board,'' said William Patterson, the director of the office of investment=
 for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. His federation plans to ask the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission today to start an investigation into whether the Enron direc=
tors should be barred from serving on boards of other public companies. The=
 federation is urging companies to remove any Enron director from their own=
 boards.
The directors have maintained, through one of their lawyers, that they were=
 misled by some Enron executives and were never told about critical transac=
tions. They also say they relied on the guidance of outside accountants and=
 lawyers.=20
The report portrays a board, despite the prominence and financial sophistic=
ation of some members, as all too willing to go along with the numerous man=
euvers that kept investors in the dark about Enron's true financial health.=
 Instead of asking pointed questions, the report indicated, the directors a=
ppeared to rely too heavily on assurances from Enron executives and outside=
 advisers. The report found that the board never probed deeply enough to un=
derstand what was going on and stop the financial abuses and self-dealing t=
hat the report said took place.=20
The board, the report said, ''failed, in our judgment, in its oversight dut=
ies.'' If the board had ''been more aggressive and vigilant,'' it continued=
, the abuses that allowed Enron to inflate profits by at least $1 billion m=
ight never have happened.=20
The report, however, does not distinguish among members of the board or hol=
d individual directors accountable for specific actions, Mr. Patterson said=
. It offers little insight into why the board was not more skeptical and do=
es not examine some of the potential threats to their independence that mig=
ht have contributed to their laxity, he said.=20
The directors have been sharply criticized by advocates for shareholders an=
d by others for their lack of independence and their coziness with manageme=
nt. One director, Lord Wakeham, a former British cabinet member, for exampl=
e, was also paid by Enron as a consultant, while another, Herbert S. Winoku=
r Jr., an investment manager, was involved with a company that did business=
 with Enron. Others, including Wendy L. Gramm, a former federal regulator a=
nd wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, work for organizations =
that received charitable contributions from Enron.=20
The committee that prepared the report was made up of three directors: Mr. =
Winokur, William C. Powers Jr. and Raymond S. Troubh. Mr. Powers, who leads=
 the committee, and Mr. Troubh joined Enron after the company's collapse an=
d were responsible for evaluating the board's own behavior.=20
Whatever the reasons for the directors' behavior, they are sharply criticiz=
ed by Mr. Powers and Mr. Troubh for their lack of oversight even when there=
 were clear indications of significant potential problems at Enron.=20
In particular, the report said, the board was aware of the potential confli=
cts involving the creation of partnerships with Enron's chief financial off=
icer, Andrew S. Fastow. But the directors apparently never bothered to find=
 out how much Mr. Fastow might have personally benefited, and they made onl=
y a cursory review of transactions between the partnerships and the company=
. Even when they should have known some of the transactions were devised pr=
imarily to improve Enron's financial results, the report said, they did not=
 probe deeply enough to find the basic problems with the deals.=20
''You can't accept stuff like that at face value when it deviates so much f=
rom business norms,'' said Robert E. Mittelstaedt Jr., a business professor=
 at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Enron's audit com=
mittee ''has a responsibility for risk management in the broadest sense,'' =
he said.=20
In particular, Mr. Mittelstaedt faults the board for choosing to suspend En=
ron's own code of ethics to create the partnerships.=20
Because the board commissioned the report, it has already been criticized b=
y some, including Arthur Andersen, Enron's former accounting firm, as being=
 self-serving.=20
The report specifically says there is no evidence to suggest that the direc=
tors, unlike some Enron executives, had a financial interest in any of part=
nerships.=20
But the report does not address other concerns involving the board, like th=
e significant sales of stock by some directors, including Norman P. Blake J=
r., chief executive of Comdisco.=20
To Enron's critics, the board's real offense may have been its willingness =
to listen to the company management when there were indications that they s=
hould have taken a closer look. Many of the directors, including Robert K. =
Jaedicke, who headed the audit committee, and Mr. Winokur, who headed the f=
inance committee, had served on the Enron board since the company was creat=
ed in 1985 through a merger.=20
''The board was asleep,'' said one person close to the board. ''It was mesm=
erized by the price of the stock and the apparent success of the company.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: LITIGATION
Lawyers Say Board Report Has Limited Value for Them
By BARNABY J. FEDER

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The Enron-sponsored report detailing the company's manipulation of numerous=
 investment partnerships will provide only limited support to lawsuits by E=
nron investors and former employees, lawyers who filed the suits say.=20
''It confirms many of the allegations in our complaints,'' said Steve W. Be=
rman, a Seattle lawyer whose firm has filed four lawsuits seeking compensat=
ion for Enron employees who lost pensions, jobs or both when the company co=
llapsed last fall.
But plaintiffs and their lawyers say any benefit from the report will be mo=
dest because the investigators, who were chosen by Enron's board, did not c=
over a range of Enron activities that will figure in many lawsuits. In the =
report, released Saturday, investigators ignored foreign operations, accusa=
tions of insider trading, Enron's role in the California energy crisis last=
 year and possible mishandling of employee pensions.=20
Nor did the investigators have access to several crucial Enron managers and=
 members of the Enron audit team at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, or=
 enough time to delve deeply into the investment partnerships that were the=
 focus of the inquiry. Some lawyers were also disappointed to see no mentio=
n of investment bankers and consultants that they suspect played a role in =
constructing what turned out to be a financial house of cards.=20
''It only scratches the surface,'' said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the Uni=
versity of California Board of Regents, which is a plaintiff in a lawsuit. =
The university has estimated that it lost $145 million on its Enron investm=
ents, second only to the State of Florida among public investors.=20
Lawyers not involved in any lawsuits said the report appeared to support an=
 argument that Enron's directors did not recklessly or willfully participat=
e in fraud. That is the conclusion the board, which appointed the investiga=
tors, might want a bankruptcy court to reach in deciding whether to leave t=
he company under its control instead of naming a special trustee, said Seth=
 T. Taube, head of the securities and business crimes practice at the law f=
irm of McCarter & English in Newark.=20
''You always want a report that says your people were negligent, not venal,=
'' Mr. Taube said.=20
Despite the report's limited scope, plaintiffs and their lawyers said that =
the publicity it generated could encourage witnesses to come forward. The r=
eport also provided some new information about the roles of various parties=
 in Enron's collapse, including some that have not yet been named in lawsui=
ts. Many hoped that the report would encourage judges overseeing the suits =
to throw out motions to quash them. That, in turn, could allow the plaintif=
fs to move ahead sooner with the pretrial gathering of evidence, a process =
known as discovery.=20
''A report like this is amazingly helpful in laying out who was involved an=
d what went on,'' said James M. Finberg, a lawyer at Lieff Cabraser Heimann=
 & Bernstein in San Francisco, which has filed a suit for investors against=
 Enron directors, many of its executives and Arthur Andersen. The suit seek=
s class-action status. (Suits against Enron have been put on hold by the co=
mpany's bankruptcy court filing.)=20
Mr. Berman said that the report had made it more likely that his firm would=
 add Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to the list of defendants i=
n two of the four suits it has filed. One suit is based on federal antirack=
eteering statutes. The other, filed in a Texas state court, seeks damages f=
or former employees who chose stock rather than cash as part of their compe=
nsation on the basis of Enron's statements about its financial condition.=
=20
The report singled out Vinson & Elkins for playing a significant role in de=
veloping Enron's annual proxy statements to shareholders, which the investi=
gators described as ''fundamentally inadequate.'' It also criticized the la=
w firm for its role in an investigation last year of complaints about Enron=
's accounting.=20
Evidence of active misconduct by parties like Vinson & Elkins and Arthur An=
dersen would be crucial to the lawsuits. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled t=
hat a business could not be sued under federal law for providing advice or =
services that a client uses illegally in selling or buying stocks or other =
securities.=20
Higher barriers went up in 1995 when Congress barred courts from allowing p=
retrial discovery in securities suits until all motions to dismiss the liti=
gation had been dealt with. That has discouraged lawyers from dragging law =
firms, bankers and accountants into lawsuits before they have strong eviden=
ce against them.=20
The same law also said defendants were liable for damages only in proportio=
n to their role in securities violations. That further reduced the incentiv=
e for plaintiffs to sue a defendant's outside advisers.=20
Most of the Enron lawsuits have been assigned to Federal District Court Jud=
ge Melinda Harmon in Houston. Three groups of lawyers are vying to be chose=
n by Judge Harmon as the lead representatives of investors. That decision i=
s expected within two weeks. Lawyers representing employees, meanwhile, hav=
e been negotiating among themselves to form a committee to carry the cases =
forward. Judge Harmon has set a hearing for Feb. 25 to review where the law=
suits are headed.

Internal Probe of Enron Finds Wide-Ranging Abuses --- Former CEO Kenneth La=
y Won't Testify This Week At Hearings in Congress
By Greg Hitt and Kathryn Kranhold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Kenneth Lay, the embattled former chairman of Enron Corp., an=
d two other former top company executives told lawmakers they won't testify=
 this week as Congress begins much-anticipated hearings probing the company=
's collapse.=20
In a letter sent late yesterday to the Senate Commerce Committee, where Mr.=
 Lay was scheduled to appear today, his attorney, Earl Silbert, said the at=
mosphere surrounding the hearing had become "prosecutorial." Following rece=
ipt of the letter, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.=
) canceled the hearing, saying that the panel won't proceed without Mr. Lay=
.
The letter followed an appearance by Sen. Byron Dorgan, a senior member of =
the Commerce Committee, on NBC's "Meet the Press," in which the North Dakot=
a Democrat voiced sharp concerns about the company. "Once you start peeling=
 away the layers of this onion, it gets pretty ugly," Mr. Dorgan said. On t=
he same NBC news show, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R., La.) said investigator=
s for the House Commerce Committee had found what may "end up being securit=
ies fraud."=20
Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay had intended to testify until it became clear from=
 the Sunday news shows that "judgments have been reached and the tenor of t=
he hearing will be prosecutorial."=20
Mr. Lay had stayed out of the public eye since the company's spectacular co=
llapse, and Mr. Silbert wrote that his client's silence amid public allegat=
ions of misconduct has been "construed as acquiescence" by some. "They are =
wrong," Mr. Silbert wrote. "Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he =
engaged in wrongful or criminal conduct."=20
Mr. Silbert also wrote Ohio Rep. Michael Oxley, chairman of the House Finan=
cial Services Committee, canceling Mr. Lay's scheduled appearance before th=
at committee Tuesday.=20
Even before the Sunday shows, it was clear Mr. Lay would face stiff questio=
ning from lawmakers on issues ranging from the controversial web of partner=
ships that let Enron hide debt to his handling of "whistle-blowers" who rai=
sed concerns inside the company.=20
Robert Bennett, Enron's outside counsel, said the company is cooperating wi=
th Congress, but he "understands" the concerns raised by Mr. Silbert. "It w=
as unfortunate," Mr. Bennett said. "Mr. Lay was going to testify."=20
Mr. Lay's expected testimony had been the centerpiece of several congressio=
nal hearings planned on Capitol Hill this week probing Enron's collapse. Be=
fore Mr. Lay backed out of his appearance, the company's former chief finan=
cial officer, who organized many of the questionable off-balance sheet deal=
s that led to the company's collapse, had indicated he wouldn't cooperate w=
ith the congressional probe.=20
Former Enron CFO Andrew Fastow and an aide, Michael Kopper, plan to invoke =
their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination when called to appe=
ar before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, the committee's=
 chairman said.=20
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declined comment on whether he will appear this =
week, and an attorney for Mr. Kopper didn't return calls. However, a spokes=
person for Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, said he intend=
s to appear before Congress and will testify freely.=20
With his deep personal and political ties to the White House, Mr. Lay's rol=
e in Enron's collapse underscores how the matter has become a political lia=
bility for President Bush. On Friday, the Justice Department asked the Whit=
e House to preserve any Enron-related documents, drawing the administration=
 directly into the probe.=20
Despite heavy financial support by Enron to Bush campaigns, however, the Ju=
stice Department's demand doesn't suggest that it is focusing on possible i=
nfluence-peddling. Instead, the letter to White House Counsel Alberto Gonza=
les hints that the focus may be on whether company executives took actions =
or made private statements about Enron's condition that were at odds with t=
heir public statements -- a signal the criminal investigation may be focusi=
ng on building a case alleging securities fraud. The Commerce, Energy and T=
reasury departments were also ordered to retain documents.=20
The department's demand also could raise pressure on the White House to rel=
ent in a showdown with Congress over access to White House records. Lawmake=
rs are seeking notes of meetings between Vice President Dick Cheney and Enr=
on executives and other energy industry officials as a new national energy =
policy was being drafted.=20
Several congressional hearings this week will air various aspects of Enron'=
s failure, providing what lawmakers hope will be a detailed accounting of e=
vents that led to the firm's decline into bankruptcy. Several current and f=
ormer Enron executives have been called to appear Thursday before the Energ=
y and Commerce Committee, of which Mr. Tauzin is chairman.=20
The House Financial Services Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committe=
e this week also will hear from William Powers Jr., the University of Texas=
 law school dean and an Enron director. Mr. Powers leads a special, board-a=
ppointed team investigating possible malfeasance at the company. A report o=
n his findings, released over the weekend, raises serious questions about t=
he ethics and judgment of executives who created the maze of partnerships t=
hat allowed Enron to report strong profits while sweeping debt off its bala=
nce sheet.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE POLITICS
At 11th Hour, Lay Refuses to Testify as Congressional Criticism Grows More =
Pointed

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 -- After a weekend of sharp criticism for his stewardshi=
p of Enron, Kenneth L. Lay, the company's former chief executive, abruptly =
reversed course this evening and told Congress he would refuse to testify b=
efore two committees preparing to hear his testimony, starting on Monday.=
=20
Earl J. Silbert, the lawyer for Mr. Lay, said he had decided to withdraw be=
cause ''judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearings will be p=
rosecutorial.'' But Congressional aides said that they had never expected t=
hat Mr. Lay would appear and that he was looking for a convenient excuse to=
 miss the hearings.
His appearance on Monday morning before a Senate committee and the next day=
 before a House committee had been eagerly awaited. He had repeatedly decli=
ned to comment publicly. On Saturday evening, however, a special committee =
of Enron's board provided new details of the self-dealing and financial sle=
ight-of-hand that had substantially overstated earnings.=20
The report characterized Mr. Lay as responsible in an overall sense for Enr=
on's problems because he was the ''captain of the ship'' who ''had the ulti=
mate responsibility for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the officers=
 reporting to him performed their oversight duties properly.'' But he is al=
so described as largely oblivious to a wide range of inside-dealing and cor=
porate malfeasance.=20
Some lawmakers raised questions about that characterization, and, in appear=
ances on talk programs today, suggested, without directly pointing to Mr. L=
ay, that crimes might have been committed at Enron.=20
''It is hard to imagine how the C.E.O. of a company of this size that was e=
ngaged in moving hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of obligation=
 off its books, enriching members of its hierarchy to the tunes of tens of =
millions of dollars, could be so oblivious,'' Representative James C. Green=
wood, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on ''Late Edition'' on CNN.=20
Mr. Lay has refused to respond to questions about the collapse. His wife, L=
inda, and their children, however, appeared on television last week, mainta=
ining that he was largely ignorant of the events that led to Enron's collap=
se and that the family was struggling to avoid bankruptcy.=20
For days, Mr. Lay's lawyers had promised Congressional investigators that h=
e would testify, despite the suggestions by many defense lawyers in Washing=
ton that it would be unwise for him to testify under oath while he was a su=
bject of a sprawling criminal inquiry into securities fraud and illegal ins=
ider trading.=20
Today, Mr. Silbert said that Mr. Lay had been preparing as late as this mor=
ning to testify but reversed course after lawmakers on the morning talk pro=
grams suggested that Enron had been rife with fraud. In letters to the two =
committee chairmen this evening, Mr. Silbert recounted some of the criticis=
m, including a reference to an article in The New York Times today that sai=
d ''Mr. Lay will face a panel eager to pulverize him.''=20
''I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw from his prior acceptance of your i=
nvitation,'' Mr. Silbert added. ''He cannot be expected to participate in a=
 proceeding in which conclusions have been reached.''=20
''Many allegations have been publicized in the news media accusing Mr. Lay =
and others of wrongful, even criminal conduct,'' Mr. Silbert wrote in his l=
etters to Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, and Repre=
sentative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, whose committees were to he=
ar testimony from him. ''Some have construed his silence as acquiescence. T=
hey are wrong. Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he engaged in wr=
ongful or criminal conduct.''=20
But Congressional aides said Mr. Lay had been looking for an excuse to avoi=
d testifying.=20
''In all honesty, we never expected him to appear,'' said Ken Johnson, an a=
ide to Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who leads the =
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Tauzin said earlier in the day tha=
t he expected, based on what had been uncovered so far, that ''maybe somebo=
dy ought to go to the pokey for this.''=20
Mr. Johnson said: ''I can only tell you that if Mr. Lay spurns our committe=
e, Mr. Lay will be subpoenaed. And if he ignores the subpoena, we'll pursue=
 all our options, including the possibility of a contempt of Congress'' cit=
ation.=20
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota and head of one of the su=
bcommittees investigating Enron, said that he had been informed on Friday a=
nd Saturday that Mr. Lay would testify. He said he believed that the report=
 was a ''pretty tough indictment of what was happening at that corporation'=
' and had probably persuaded Mr. Lay to change his mind.=20
Democratic and Republican lawmakers praised the company's internal report t=
oday, although Congressional investigators cautioned that it failed to reso=
lve crucial issues about the roles senior executives played in establishing=
 the questionable partnerships at the heart of the scandal.=20
The members of Congress said that while the report presented strong evidenc=
e of corporate crimes, most notably securities fraud, it did not reduce the=
 need for a significant overhaul of the accounting and corporate governance=
 rules.=20
''The report presents a pretty straightforward case of fraud,'' said Senato=
r Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, and a former senior executive on =
Wall Street at Goldman, Sachs. ''If the facts of it are accurate, it's quit=
e despicable and damning.''=20
''There is still no less of a need for reform of 401(k) rules and corporate=
 governance rules,'' he added.=20
Mr. Tauzin said the report closely tracked what was being uncovered by Cong=
ressional investigators.=20
''I think we're finding what may clearly end up being securities fraud,'' M=
r. Tauzin said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' Mr. Tauzin said =
he had been told that Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial offi=
cer and the engineer of many of the partnerships, would refuse to testify l=
ater this week and invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incriminat=
ion. He added that he had also been told that Jeffrey K. Skilling, the form=
er chief executive, would testify later this week and that he had refused t=
o sign the approval sheets for some of the partnerships after being warned =
they were questionable.=20
''What does that say about his knowledge about whether these deals were hon=
est or corrupt?'' Mr. Tauzin said.=20
Bruce Hiler, a lawyer for Mr. Skilling, said his client would testify befor=
e Congress on Thursday and not exercise his Fifth Amendment right. Mr. Hile=
r declined to comment on Mr. Tauzin's remarks.

THE FALL OF ENRON Enron's Ex-Chief Won't Testify Hearings: Kenneth L. Lay p=
ulls out of scheduled appearance before Senate Commerce Committee, evoking =
harsh reaction from congressional leaders.

WASHINGTON -- Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay on Sunday abruptly cance=
led his much-anticipated appearance before Congress, contending he would no=
t receive a fair hearing.=20
Lay changed his mind about testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee =
today, after comments by congressional leaders on Sunday television news sh=
ows suggested that "judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearin=
g will be prosecutorial," said his attorney, Earl J. Silbert.
Lay had agreed to appear voluntarily at the hearing, though other committee=
s have issued subpoenas in the Enron investigation. Committee sources said =
no decision had been reached as of Sunday night on whether the members will=
 subpoena Lay to appear in the future.=20
His client "cannot be expected to participate in a proceeding in which conc=
lusions have been reached before Mr. Lay has been given an opportunity to b=
e heard," Silbert said in a letter to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the=
 committee chairman, and Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio).=20
Until Jan. 23, Lay was chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., once th=
e country's seventh-largest corporation. The energy company filed for Chapt=
er 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 after questions about its financial heal=
th and questionable accounting practices sent its stock plummeting.=20
The Senate Commerce Committee hearing--at which Lay was to be the only witn=
ess--was canceled. The House Financial Services subcommittee on capital mar=
kets will hear this afternoon from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair=
man Harvey L. Pitt and from William Powers, the University of Texas law pro=
fessor who led an internal inquiry into the company's collapse. The report =
of that inquiry--a scathing rebuke to the company, its directors and its ac=
counting firm, Andersen--was released late Saturday.=20
Lay also had been scheduled to appear Tuesday before the House Financial Se=
rvices subcommittee, along with Andersen Chairman and CEO Joseph F. Berardi=
no, but will not attend that hearing either.=20
Meanwhile on Sunday, Berardino, whose firm also faces several federal and c=
ongressional probes, said Andersen hired former Federal Reserve Chairman Pa=
ul A. Volcker to head a panel to help overhaul the way the firm operates. "=
It's obvious the public has been let down more than once," Berardino said. =
"We will be very tough on ourselves."=20
Lay's decision evoked a harsh reaction from congressional leaders.=20
"I am disappointed," said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senat=
e Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, the panel before which Lay was=
 scheduled to testify. "I believe the American people, the Congress and his=
 own employees have a right to hear a public explanation of what happened a=
t the Enron Corp."=20
"I doubt they ever thought appearing before a congressional committee would=
 be a walk in the park," Dorgan added, "because there are tough and difficu=
lt questions that need answers. . . . Eventually, Mr. Lay and others will h=
ave to provide those answers, and sooner rather than later."=20
Lay, who reportedly accepted the committee's invitation to appear against h=
is attorney's advice and without any offer of immunity, was in Washington o=
n Sunday preparing for his appearance. But while listening to lawmakers on =
the talk shows, he heard "inflammatory statements" suggesting that "judgmen=
ts have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial," S=
ilbert said.=20
The lawyer cited a comment by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of=
 the House Energy and Commerce Committee, predicting that some senior compa=
ny executives will end up "in the pokey."=20
Silbert also cited a remark by Dorgan on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the la=
rgest bankruptcy filing in corporate history put some people in "real jeopa=
rdy."=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a senior Democrat on the House Energy=
 and Commerce Committee--one of a dozen congressional committees investigat=
ing the Enron collapse--said, "It's a real setback for those of us who want=
 some accountability from this man."=20
Waxman said Congress should subpoena Lay because he will not testify volunt=
arily.=20
"It looks like statements that he made that he was willing to be cooperativ=
e were not sincere," Waxman added.=20
Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), top Republican on the Senate Commerce subco=
mmittee on consumer affairs, said: "In my judgment, Mr. Lay is again taking=
 a dive."=20
"It's that lack of accountability and responsibility that led to the Enron =
debacle in the first place. He will eventually have to answer questions--pe=
rhaps not before the Commerce Committee but possibly in a forum where his t=
estimony can be compelled."=20
Lay's appearance was to kick off a week of hearings on Capitol Hill probing=
 Enron's collapse and featuring a notable list of witnesses. Andrew S. Fast=
ow, the company's former chief financial officer, is scheduled to appear be=
fore the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee Thursday but is expected to=
 invoke the 5th Amendment.=20
Former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left the company in August, also =
is scheduled to appear before the panel.=20
Fitzgerald noted that the Powers report was critical of many parties, inclu=
ding Lay.=20
Congress will use the information it unearths to determine what laws may ha=
ve been broken and whether any laws or regulations should be changed to pre=
vent such corporate misdeeds. The information also may be used by the Justi=
ce Department as it investigates possible criminal wrongdoing by the compan=
y, whose downfall left more than 6,000 people without jobs and shattered th=
e savings of thousands of employees and investors.=20
Enron attorney Robert S. Bennett said Sunday: "The company is fully coopera=
ting with Congress, and we are encouraging people who are requested to test=
ify to testify. But I have read Mr. Silbert's, letter and I understand his =
concerns and the sound basis for them."=20
Earlier Sunday, Waxman said in an interview that Lay should reveal the iden=
tities of investors in more than 3,000 controversial off-the-books partners=
hips that led to the company's collapse. The names were left out of the Pow=
ers report.=20
"These entities became the basis for looting the corporation," Waxman said.=
 "If we want to know where the money went, we need to know who these partne=
rs were."=20

Former Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay last night abruptly canceled a much-an=
ticipated appearance today before a Senate panel in the wake of a scathing =
report on the management failures and self-dealing that led to his company'=
s spectacular collapse.=20
Key members of Congress, reacting to the report released this weekend, said=
 yesterday that top officials of the bankrupt energy trader may have engage=
d in securities fraud in booking $1 billion in non-existent profits over th=
e past 15 months.
"Clearly some things have happened that are going to put some people into r=
eal jeopardy and trouble," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), a member of =
the Senate panel that was to question Lay, in comments on NBC's "Meet the P=
ress." "This is almost a culture of corporate corruption."=20
House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), appearing o=
n the same program, agreed, saying "maybe somebody ought to go to the pokey=
 for this."=20
Lay's lawyer, Earl Silbert, seized on the comments, telling Congress in a l=
etter yesterday evening that he advised Lay not to testify. Silbert said La=
y was prepared to answer critics about his stewardship of Enron, but, he sa=
id, "these inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached an=
d the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial."=20
But Dorgan said in an interview last night he believes the report itself "t=
ipped the balance" and led Lay and his legal team to conclude that Lay coul=
d place himself in greater legal jeopardy by testifying. "I can't believe h=
e ever thought it would be a walk in the park to testify before Congress," =
Dorgan said.=20
The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into Enron's collapse=
. Witnesses called before Congress amid a criminal investigation are often =
advised by lawyers not to testify because they may open themselves to charg=
es of perjury or false statements.=20
Experts in securities law said the findings in the 218-page report suggest =
that former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who received $30 m=
illion from partnerships he organized, is most vulnerable to possible crimi=
nal charges. But they said the legal consequences of Enron's financial mach=
inations are not as clear-cut for Lay, former chief executive Jeffrey Skill=
ing and Enron's board of directors.=20
Lawyers for Fastow have told House investigators he would appear voluntaril=
y before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, but investigator=
s are not certain that he will testify. Michael J. Kopper, a former Enron m=
anaging partner who worked for Fastow, was subpoenaed by the committee, but=
 he has told investigators that he would decline to testify citing his Fift=
h Amendment right against self-incrimination.=20
Skilling, one of the architects of the company's off-the-books partnerships=
 that concealed massive debts from investors, sold $100 million in Enron st=
ock since 1998. His profit from the sales is not known. He is scheduled to =
testify Thursday, and his lawyers have told the House panel that he intends=
 to appear. Lay's family and his lawyers have said he was eager to answer q=
uestions, though he has so far declined to personally respond to the allega=
tions swirling about Enron's mismanagement. Lay continues to believe "the a=
ppropriate place to explore these allegations and related policy issues was=
 before the Congress," Silbert wrote.=20
"Some have construed his silence as acquiescence. They are wrong," he said.=
 "Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or cri=
minal conduct."=20
Lay associates said in interviews last week that he was being advised by la=
wyers to keep silent. "He wants to talk so bad," said his daughter, Elizabe=
th Lay, 31, a lawyer who has been advising her father. She and other source=
s said that Lay was anxiously awaiting the report from the special investig=
ating committee before testifying.=20
Lay was to testify voluntarily, but now that he has refused, lawmakers may =
subpoena him. He could then invoke his Fifth Amendment right to keep silent=
. Another family member said that "his lawyers are telling him to shut up. =
They were very angry Linda was talking," referring to Lay's wife, who defen=
ded her husband in two televised interviews last week. This source said las=
t week that Lay would take the risk of testifying before Congress if "he is=
 convinced he has a preponderance of the facts" surrounding the demise of h=
is company. "But the basic strategy always is, if there's a possibility of =
criminal charges [in the case], you shut up," the family member said. "It's=
 a no-win situation for him."=20
The assessments of Lay's leadership and the Enron corporate culture were wi=
thering yesterday, one day after the release of a report for the Enron boar=
d of directors prepared under the direction of William Powers Jr., dean of =
the University of Texas School of Law. Powers joined the Enron board on Oct=
. 31, after the company reported its third-quarter loss and appointed a spe=
cial investigating committee.=20
The committee investigated only a handful of the more than 1,000 partnershi=
ps Enron established and found that Enron executives manipulated the compan=
y's financial condition in several transactions with these partnerships. Th=
e committee said some partnerships hid losses from troubled Enron deals, in=
cluding investments at power plants in Brazil and Poland, and in companies =
such as Internet service provider Rhythms NetConnections Inc. and networkin=
g equipment maker Avici Systems. Deals were done to make the company appear=
 profitable when it was actually losing money and heavily in debt. At the s=
ame time, insiders made hundreds of millions of dollars in the sale of Enro=
n stock, at the expense of employees and shareholders.=20
Lay was portrayed in the report as a lax manager who "bears significant res=
ponsibility for those flawed decisions" to create off-the-books partnership=
s and let others run them. He would have faced a firestorm of questions tod=
ay, members predicted.=20
"They were doing almost no business, but they manufacture income from a ban=
k loan," Dorgan said. "That's the kind of thing that went on over and over =
and over again. We want to know what Ken Lay knew."=20
Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), in a broadcast interview on NBC's "Today," =
said: "Ken Lay obviously had to know this was a giant pyramid scheme, a gia=
nt shell game."=20
Under criticism for its role in the Enron collapse, accounting firm Arthur =
Andersen announced yesterday that it would conduct a sweeping review of its=
 business practices under the direction of former Federal Reserve Board cha=
irman Paul A. Volcker. Andersen was paid $5.7 million to scrutinize the par=
tnerships, in addition to its fees for auditing Enron's books.=20
"Not only were there corrupt practices, not only was there a hiding of the =
fact that debt was being put off the balance sheets and profits were report=
ed that didn't exist, but we found more than that," Tauzin said. "I think w=
e're finding what may clearly be securities fraud, attempts -- not to hedge=
 or put debt out of the company, which many companies do -- but literally f=
raudulent, phony attempts to do so."=20
Tauzin noted yesterday that the report found that Skilling held back from s=
igning his name on approval forms for several off-the-books partnership dea=
ls. "What does that say about his knowledge of whether these deals were hon=
est or corrupt?" he said.=20
Lawyers for Skilling and Fastow were unavailable for comment yesterday.=20
Nowhere in the report is there any mention of former Enron vice chairman J.=
 Clifford Baxter, who committed suicide Jan. 25, anguished, associates said=
, over the Enron scandal. Baxter made millions from the sale of Enron stock=
 but left the company last spring after complaining about the propriety of =
the partnerships to colleagues. Authorities have not disclosed the contents=
 of his suicide note.=20
Among the questions the report was not able to answer are the identities of=
 the outside investors in more than 1,000 partnerships and related investme=
nt groups linked to Enron. Major Wall Street firms sold partnership interes=
ts to outside investors. Dorgan said Congress wants to know who was invited=
 into the partnerships.=20
A few Enron employees tried to bring the self-dealing and dangerous financi=
al machinations to the attention of Lay and other top managers, the report =
also found. Lawyer Jordan Mintz, who worked for Fastow, sought advice from =
Washington law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson as to what needed=
 to be disclosed about the partnerships, including whether Fastow's $30 mil=
lion compensation for managing the partnerships had to be revealed.=20
Fried Frank suggested more disclosure of some partnership information, the =
report said. Mintz is scheduled to testify this week about the disclosure i=
ssues. Columbia University law professor John C. Coffee said the report lay=
s the groundwork for "an old-fashioned, plain-vanilla fraud case against Ko=
pper and Fastow."=20
"I think this is going to significantly enhance the prospect of criminal in=
dictments in their cases," Coffee said. If the facts stated in the report a=
re true, "this is into the zone of active fraud," he said.=20
Donald Langevoort, a securities law professor at Georgetown, said of the re=
port: "It certainly adds to the evidence we've already seen that there were=
 deliberate falsifications that led to fraudulent accounting. The question =
becomes not so much were the financial reports accurate, but were they doct=
ored -- and if so, by whom."=20
But Langevoort noted that the "language of the report is very measured with=
 respect to its senior executives, in questioning what Lay and Skilling kne=
w or should have known. There is a mile of difference between 'known' and '=
should have known' that amounts to whether you can stick someone with secur=
ities fraud."=20
"The report talks about a failure of management; it says Lay acted more lik=
e a director than a senior executive. That is not terribly unusual in a lar=
ge corporation and certainly not the basis for liability," Langevoort said.=
=20
The report was prepared for the board of directors, and while it criticizes=
 the board, those criticisms are mainly directed at its failure to live up =
to its responsibility to monitor management decisions and internal controls=
. The board could face negligence lawsuits, lawyers said, but on the basis =
of the report's findings, members would not likely be vulnerable to civil o=
r criminal fraud charges.=20
The report found that the board should have sought more information about t=
he partnerships and should not have allowed Fastow to run them while he was=
 simultaneously Enron's chief financial officer because it created a confli=
ct of interest. The board's attorney, Neil Eggleston, focused on the report=
's assessment that some information was withheld from directors.=20
"The board and its committees were repeatedly assured that the controls the=
 board had ordered were adequate and being implemented, but the board was m=
isled," he said.=20

Lay cancels date with Congress=20
Ex-Enron leader won't testify=20
By JOHN C. HENRY=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Feb. 4, 2002, 6:13AM
WASHINGTON -- Questioning whether he could get a fair hearing before Congre=
ss, former Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay notified lawmakers Sunday that he w=
ould not appear this week before committees examining the company's collaps=
e.=20
Lay's decision, outlined in letters delivered to Capitol Hill by his lawyer=
, came hours after House and Senate members heading the inquiries suggested=
 that some top Enron executives engaged in illegal activity and "ought to g=
o to the pokey."=20
Attorney Earl J. Silbert wrote that Lay "cannot be expected to participate =
in a proceeding in which conclusions have been reached before (he) has been=
 given an opportunity to be heard."=20
Citing remarks by three lawmakers Sunday on television news programs, Silbe=
rt wrote: "These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reac=
hed and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial."=20
Silbert's letter said Lay rejects "any allegations that he engaged in wrong=
ful or criminal conduct."=20
Lay was to have led off the first of seven congressional hearings this week=
 into the Houston-based company and its bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. his=
tory. In addition to at least 10 congressional inquiries, Enron and its exe=
cutives face federal criminal investigations and several civil class-action=
 lawsuits filed by employees and stockholders.=20
Lay, who in December accepted an invitation to testify today before the Sen=
ate Commerce Committee, also was to have appeared Tuesday at a House Financ=
ial Services Committee hearing. The committee plans to proceed without the =
former Enron chairman.=20
"To back out at this stage of the game is a breach of trust," said Rep. Ken=
 Bentsen, a Houston Democrat who sits on the House panel. "This has all the=
 appearances that he was stringing us along and in the 11th hour has pulled=
 the plug. I'm profoundly disappointed."=20
There was no indication late Sunday whether either the Senate Commerce Comm=
ittee or the House Financial Services Committee would try to compel Lay to =
appear later. The Senate hearing -- which was to have been chaired by Sen. =
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and broadcast live on seven television networks -- wa=
s canceled.=20
"We're going to meet with the committee members and have a discussion about=
 what we do next," Dorgan said, dismissing Silbert's assertion that the hea=
ring would have had a "prosecutorial" tone.=20
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- which=
 is holding three hearings into Enron this week but was not scheduled to he=
ar from Lay -- said a subpoena would be issued if he turns down an invitati=
on to appear.=20
"If he thumbs his nose at us like he did the Senate Commerce Committee, we'=
ll subpoena him," said Ken Johnson, whose boss, Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., c=
hairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "Mr. Lay has some tough ques=
tions to answer, and sooner or later he's going to have to answer them."=20
Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been subpoena=
ed to appear before Tauzin's panel later this week, has notified congressio=
nal investigators that he will not testify unless he is granted immunity fr=
om prosecution.=20
"We're not granting immunity to anybody," Johnson said. "We're not in a dea=
ling mood. Too many people have lost their jobs and lost their pensions."=
=20
Lay's decision not to appear came the day after a special committee of Enro=
n's board of directors released a 218-page report that criticizes Enron's e=
xecutives, auditors, lawyers and board members for allowing improperly crea=
ted partnerships to inflate the company's earnings, hide its debt and wrong=
fully enrich a handful of insiders.=20
The report spent more time criticizing Fastow and accounting firm Arthur An=
dersen than it did Lay. At the same time, the report by University of Texas=
 law school Dean William Powers cited Lay as ultimately responsible for mak=
ing sure his officers performed their oversight duties properly.=20
"For much of the period in question, Lay was the Chief Executive Officer of=
 Enron and, in effect, the captain of the ship," the report said. "He does =
not appear to have directed their attention, or his own, to the oversight o=
f the LJM partnerships. Ultimately, a large measure of the responsibility r=
ests with the CEO."=20
Also singled out for criticism in the report were former Chief Executive Of=
ficer Jeff Skilling, Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey and Chief Risk Of=
ficer Richard Buy. The report says former employee Michael Kopper violated =
Enron's code of ethics for having managed one of the partnerships without t=
he board of directors' approval.=20
Skilling is scheduled to appear later this week before the House Energy and=
 Commerce Committee and, Tauzin says, has agreed to testify. Kopper, who al=
so has been subpoenaed, has notified the committee's investigators that he =
will decline to testify and cite his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-in=
crimination.=20
Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing the Enron board, said th=
e company had hoped Lay would testify but cannot blame him for backing down=
 after seeing the Sunday morning television performances by Tauzin and othe=
r lawmakers.=20
"I understand his (Lay's) position and the sound basis for it," Bennett sai=
d. "The remarks on television today were very troubling."=20
Appearing early Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Tauzin referred to the Powe=
rs report and weeks of investigation by Energy Committee staff members when=
 he said: "We're finding what may clearly end up being securities fraud" by=
 Enron executives.=20
Tauzin said his panel -- which began investigating Enron's collapse in Dece=
mber -- wants to find whether "there really (was) wrongdoing and maybe some=
body ought to go to the pokey for this? And I think we're going to find out=
 `yes' to that question."=20
On the same program, Dorgan said: "Some things have happened here that are =
going to put some people in real jeopardy, in trouble."=20
On NBC's Today, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., said: "Ken Lay obviously had=
 to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme -- a giant shell game."=20

Text of withdrawal letter=20

Houston Chronicle
WASHINGTON -- Text of letters sent Sunday by a lawyer for Ken Lay to the ch=
airmen of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Committee o=
n Commerce, Science and Transportation.=20
The letters from Earl J. Silbert were identical except the one to the Senat=
e chairman referred to Lay having accepted an invitation to appear before t=
he full committee and a subcommittee, while the letter to the House chairma=
n referred only to a hearing scheduled by the full committee.=20
Dear Mr. Chairman:=20
About one month ago, Kenneth Lay accepted your invitation to appear before =
this committee (and subcommittee) to testify about the collapse of Enron. H=
e was looking forward to a meaningful, reasoned question and answer session=
 to provide his understanding of the events and to discuss with you a numbe=
r of related policy, legal, and regulatory issues. This tragedy for the com=
pany, its current and prior employees, retirees, and shareholders has been =
devastating and heartbreaking to him.=20
Many allegations have been publicized in the news media accusing Mr. Lay an=
d others of wrongful, even criminal conduct. He has not personally responde=
d to them. Some have construed his silence as acquiescence. They are wrong.=
 Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or crim=
inal conduct. He did and still does believe that the most appropriate place=
 to explore these allegations and related policy issues was before the Cong=
ress.=20
Mr. Lay, with counsel, has been spending extensive time preparing both for =
written and oral testimony. As of this morning, Mr. Lay intended to testify=
 tomorrow. In the midst of our preparation, particularly disturbing stateme=
nts have been made by members of Congress, even today, on the eve of Mr. La=
y's scheduled appearance. These inflammatory statements show that judgments=
 have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial.=20
For example, on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC, Senator Peter Fitzgerald charge=
d:=20
"Ken Lay obviously had to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme -- a gi=
ant shell game. ... They grafted a pyramid onto an old-fashioned utility. .=
.. There was blatant fraudulent activity going on for years, and in my opin=
ion he had to have known. ... "=20
On Meet the Press today, Senator Byron Dorgan concluded:=20
"(T)his is almost a culture of corporate corruption. ... "=20
"Clearly some things have happened here that are going to put some real peo=
ple in real jeopardy and trouble."=20
On the same TV program, Congressman Billy Tauzin, the chair of one of the c=
ommittees conducting one of the principal investigations of the Enron colla=
pse, claimed:=20
"Secondly: were they really wrongdoing, and maybe somebody ought to go to t=
he pokey for this? I think we are going to find out yes to that question."=
=20
Congressman Tauzin also charged:=20
"(N)ot only were there corrupt practices, not only was there a hiding of th=
e fact that debt was being put off the balance sheets and profits were repo=
rted that didn't exist, but we've found more than that. I think we're findi=
ng what may clearly end up being securities fraud, attempts not to hedge or=
 put debt out of the company, which many companies do, but literally fraudu=
lent, phony attempts to do so. ... "=20
These are a few examples, from among many others. Indeed, as The New York T=
imes reported today, in appearing before the subcommittee, "Mr. Lay will fa=
ce a panel eager to pulverize him." As a consequence, I have instructed Mr.=
 Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation. He does so, but o=
nly with the greatest reluctance and regret. He also wishes to express, as =
do I, our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience caused by this decision=
, but he cannot be expected to participate in a proceeding in which conclus=
ions have been reached before Mr. Lay has been given an opportunity to be h=
eard.=20

Ex-workers let down as Lay alters his plans=20
By STEVE BREWER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Feb. 3, 2002, 9:49PM
For former Enron employees in Houston, Ken Lay's televised testimony before=
 Congress was going to be the equivalent of Sunday's Super Bowl. They had m=
ade plans to gather in bars, restaurants and homes today to hear what their=
 ex-boss had to say.=20
But when the former Enron CEO backed out of testifying on Sunday, they were=
 left with more questions, anger and a lot of disappointment. They said the=
y felt robbed.=20
"We kind of thought at least he will take the Fifth Amendment and ask for i=
mmunity. At least then, we would have had a good laugh," said Anthony Huang=
, a former Enron contractor who is part of Enronx.org. "But he didn't even =
let us do that."=20
Enronx.org, an Internet-based resource for former employees of the fallen c=
orporate giant, was expecting more than 60 ex-Enron workers to show up and =
watch Lay's testimony in a local restaurant. Television networks had arrang=
ed for the testimony to be fed straight into the restaurant, and the group =
had even sent an invitation to Lay's family.=20
By 8 p.m. Sunday night, the gathering had been called off.=20
"We're disappointed and slightly upset," Huang said. "A lot of people were =
anticipating hearing from him, so he could at least defend himself, and to =
see if he knew about certain transactions occurring."=20
Charles Weiss, a former manager for Enron's long-haul network, said he had =
planned on watching the testimony at home, like he was doing with the Super=
 Bowl on Sunday.=20
News of Lay's cancellation made him mad.=20
"How can he continue to dodge the inevitable?" Weiss asked. "Does he plan j=
ust to say anything and plead total ignorance? ... It's insane that he's be=
ing allowed to not own up and answer all the questions on the table."=20
Weiss also said he thought it was odd that Lay's decision not to testify ca=
me the day after a review of the company's activities by University of Texa=
s School of Law Dean William Powers concluded that the company's management=
 concealed financial information.=20
Gloria Alvarez worked as an administrative coordinator for Enron for 13 yea=
rs. She said she had planned to go to a friend's house to watch the testimo=
ny and that groups of her former co-workers had planned gatherings througho=
ut town to do the same thing.=20
Many of those groups were going to be joined by national news outlets, hopi=
ng to get their on-the-spot reaction to Lay's words.=20
Late Sunday, she got the call informing her that the meeting had been cance=
led.=20
"I just don't understand," she said. "I suppose this is something his lawye=
r told him to do."=20
For people like Jackie Jackson, who worked for Enron four years as a contra=
ct administrator, Lay's decision not to testify only makes them more bitter=
 about the company executives they once worked for.=20
"It's unfortunate that we were working for a bunch of cowards that we all l=
ooked up to," Jackson said. "And now, it turns out those people we held as =
superior are looking very inferior to us now."=20
Former Enron workers also weren't too impressed with the reason Lay's lawye=
r gave for his deciding not to appear -- that judgments had been reached pr=
ior to the hearing that remarks by various members of Congress on Sunday mo=
rning news talk shows showed that the hearing would be "prosecutorial" in t=
enor.=20

As Enron Purged Its Ranks, Dissent Was Swept Away
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Feb. 3 -- Linda Richardson was in her office at Enron one day in F=
ebruary 1999 when her secretary, Marie Thibaut, came in with an open intero=
ffice envelope and a look of concern on her face. ''Linda, are you quitting=
?'' she asked.=20
The envelope contained a severance agreement. As Ms. Richardson, a vice pre=
sident for information technology, looked at the papers, the realization da=
wned. ''Marie, they're firing me!'' she exclaimed.
By that point, Enron, which had once prided itself on its intense team spir=
it, had become the kind of place where someone could be dismissed in such a=
n impersonal way -- a company so bent on success that it did not always obs=
erve the basic human niceties. Many former employees and executives say the=
 atmosphere became so intensely competitive that people often did not feel =
secure enough in their jobs to question irregularities, if they were aware =
of them at all.=20
In recent years, a steady stream of Enron employees made their way to the e=
xits, whether by choice or by force. Some, including J. Clifford Baxter, wh=
o was a vice chairman, left after it became known within the company that t=
hey were troubled by the network of partnerships that concealed a flood of =
red ink on Enron's balance sheet. Others, like Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche, a pr=
ominent executive who signed deals to build and buy power plants around the=
 world, lost internal corporate battles and moved on. Indeed, of the 34 sen=
ior executives listed in the company's 1999 annual report, only 11 remain.=
=20
But departures occurred on all rungs of Enron's ladder. Many of those who l=
eft -- whether voluntarily or not -- say part of the reason was that Enron =
had metastasized into a more ruthless, less humane place.=20
Many who left say that much of the change in Enron's culture coincided with=
 the rise of Jeffrey K. Skilling, whom many called a brilliant visionary; h=
e was promoted to president and chief operating officer in 1996. It was Mr.=
 Skilling -- the company's chief executive when he resigned last summer -- =
who was largely responsible for Enron's transformation. He helped turn Enro=
n from a large but unglamorous natural gas company in the mid-1980's into a=
 kind of hedge fund that created and ran markets in energy and a dizzying a=
rray of commodities, including high-speed Internet access and even weather =
risk. Ultimately, the company gambled away its own future.=20
Mr. Skilling was singled out for criticism in the internal investigation th=
at was released by Enron on Saturday. The report said of the partnerships t=
hat he ''certainly knew or should have known of the magnitude and the risks=
 associated with these transactions.'' It concluded that Mr. Skilling ''bea=
rs substantial responsibility for the failure of the system of internal con=
trols'' to reduce the risks in the partnerships. Through a spokeswoman, Mr.=
 Skilling declined requests for an interview.=20
Whatever Mr. Skilling's eventual failings as a chief executive, a zealous a=
pproach to business was there from the start.=20
Professors at Harvard Business School recalled that even in that rich pool =
of future business titans, Mr. Skilling stood out as a student at the schoo=
l in the late 1970's. Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an expert in corporate leaders=
hip, recalled an argument he had with Mr. Skilling one day at the Galley, a=
 student grill in the school's Gallatin Hall.=20
''I had the foolish temerity to argue with him about energy deregulation,''=
 the hot business topic of the day, Mr. Sonnenfeld recalled, and he was soo=
n overwhelmed by the student's passionate and relentless arguments on behal=
f of free markets.=20
Mr. Sonnenfeld recently asked his Harvard Business School colleagues about =
Mr. Skilling and found that ''everybody remembered him, and I don't think a=
nybody remembered an unpleasant thing about him.''=20
Once out of business school, Mr. Skilling rose quickly in the energy world =
and made his way to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, where he ultima=
tely became head of its energy and chemical practices. In 1982, he began ad=
vising Enron; seven years later, he helped the company devise a complex tra=
nsaction that offered the customer the equivalent of a safe, fixed-price co=
ntract in a deregulated natural gas market, where prices fluctuated.=20
It was a defining moment for Mr. Skilling and for Enron. At the time, the o=
ld-line gas companies were being hammered by deregulation. The deal proved =
that Enron could surf the waves of change instead of drowning in them. In 1=
990 Mr. Skilling joined Enron as head of trading.=20
The Enron that Mr. Skilling joined was very different from the one that he =
would eventually run. Under the chairmanship of Kenneth L. Lay, the company=
's divisions had enjoyed so much autonomy that they were referred to as sta=
nd-alone silos. Each had its own system for determining salaries and bonuse=
s and its own culture. But despite their differences, all the units were bi=
g on risk and reward. And they were arrogant, thinking themselves invincibl=
e.=20
''There were no grown-ups at Enron,'' a former executive said.=20
At Enron International, which built power plants around the world, the cult=
ure was especially freewheeling. Ms. Mark-Jusbasche and Joseph W. Sutton, a=
nother top executive at the unit, once made a grand entrance on roaring Har=
ley-Davidson motorcycles at a meeting for the group's thousands of employee=
s. One presentation included a live elephant.=20
''It was a hoot,'' said Connie Castillo, a former legal assistant with the =
group. But it was fun with a purpose, Ms. Castillo recalled. ''It made ever=
ybody a part of something.''=20
Mr. Skilling's trading operation, however, had a more cutthroat reputation,=
 and it was suffused with Mr. Skilling's particular buzzwords -- like ''loo=
se-tight,'' which he used to describe his management style.=20
The tight side was managing risk in every transaction. The company was loos=
e when it came to managing creativity, Mr. Skilling told researchers from t=
he Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of V=
irginia. ''You wanted to have an environment that weird people liked operat=
ing in,'' he said, adding, ''It's the weird ideas that create new businesse=
s.''=20
More and more, Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling saw the company's future in the luc=
rative world of trading -- not in hard assets like power plants and pipelin=
es. By the time Mr. Skilling became president and chief operating officer o=
f the entire company in early 1996, his traders were the in-crowd.=20
He quickly started shaking things up. In an videotaped interview with the V=
irginia researchers, Mr. Skilling's eyes danced as he recalled a confrontat=
ion with the managers of the office tower that is Enron's headquarters. The=
 managers bore detailed manuals describing the number of square feet allott=
ed to a senior vice president, a vice president and so on, Mr. Skilling sai=
d.=20
''I want to get rid of all the walls,'' he recalled telling a person he ref=
erred to as the ''building Gestapo.'' He wanted a big open room where ''peo=
ple will talk and throw things at each other and get all excited and creati=
ve.'' The ''building Gestapo,'' he said, ''didn't get it.''=20
After a big struggle, Mr. Skilling said, he simply ''hired contractors and =
had them start ripping the walls out.'' Under Mr. Skilling, the old rules n=
o longer applied. Literally and figuratively, the walls were coming down.=
=20
A former Enron lobbyist said employees could could see the differences betw=
een Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling in how the men walked through the company's cr=
owded lobby. Mr. Lay worked the room, shaking hands, patting backs and pull=
ing out photographs of his grandchildren to share with secretaries.=20
Mr. Skilling, by contrast, exuded an intensity, marching through with his e=
yes straight ahead, his body language radiating importance and urgency and =
making clear that few should dare to take a moment of his time.=20
As Mr. Skilling brought the silos under a more unified management, function=
s like accounting and compensation were made more consistent. But the most =
troubling part of Mr. Skilling's rise for many at Enron could be expressed =
in a buzz phrase: ''rank and yank.'' That was the informal name for a perfo=
rmance review process in which employees were evaluated at regular interval=
s by management groups and the lowest-ranked were purged.=20
''If you were ranked high and well thought of, you made a beaucoup amount o=
f money,'' recalled Ms. Richardson, the ousted technology executive. ''If y=
ou disagreed with anything, if you spoke what you thought was the truth, yo=
u didn't fare too well.''=20
Ms. Richardson said she had been fired because she had spoken out against a=
 decision to invest tens of millions of dollars in new software and had rid=
iculed the cost-benefit analysis. ''If this is the kind of process that we =
use to justify projects, then we're in trouble,'' she recalled saying. She =
now works as an independent software consultant.=20
Rank-and-yank cast a pall over the company, said Ms. Castillo, the legal as=
sistant, who said she had gone from the top of the scale to the bottom afte=
r she filed a harassment complaint, accusing another woman on the staff of =
hostile actions. She was fired in mid-2001.=20
Prof. Robert F. Bruner, a co-author of the University of Virginia study of =
Enron, said that while that kind of performance review could help build a c=
ompany, ''if it's just a front for cronyism, rank-and-yank can be extremely=
 destructive.''=20
Over time, the culture that Mr. Skilling cultivated ''just swamped the othe=
r parts of the business,'' said a former executive from the international s=
ide, who added, ''We became an open target.'' Many began to see rank-and-ya=
nk as a tactic in Mr. Skilling's fight for supremacy.=20
Members of the international team, while acknowledging a number of very exp=
ensive mistakes, argue that most of the financial drag on the company from =
projects like the $3 billion Dabhol power plant in India could be corrected=
 with further investment. But they say the Skilling team wanted to get out =
of capital-intensive assets as quickly as possible.=20
Prof. Samuel E. Bodily, the other author of the Virginia study, said that a=
lthough the environment at Enron had been genteel, compared with that at a =
New York investment bank, the review process had accelerated a trend toward=
 shortsightedness. Employees gravitated toward projects that could show res=
ults within the six-month review cycle, an attitude that he described as ''=
if it's not going to happen by then, don't talk to me about it.''=20
Or, as Michael J. Miller, a manager in the company's ill-starred venture to=
 provide high-speed Internet services, put it: ''Get it done. Get it done n=
ow. Reap the rewards.'' Whether the deal made money, or even made sense, wa=
s somebody else's problem, he said.=20
A clear plastic block from 1998 -- one of a seemingly endless series of com=
memorative objects that the legal department handed out -- testified to the=
 company's hang-10, toes-over-the-edge attitude. It gave the department's m=
ission statement this way: ''To provide prompt and first-rate legal service=
 to Enron on a proactive and cost-effective basis.''=20
Underneath was a tongue-in-cheek addendum. ''Translation: We do big, comple=
x and risky deals without blowing up Enron.''=20
And then, in 2001, it all did blow up. Mr. Skilling resigned in August, and=
 before long the series of devastating financial restatements and revelatio=
ns about Enron's hidden debt crushed the once highflying company.=20
The Virginia professors warn against looking for simplistic reasons for the=
 collapse. They quote a passage from the novelist Victor Hugo, translating =
it as, ''Great blunders, like large ropes, have many fibers.''=20
The question has often been asked lately: Why didn't more people speak up a=
bout the problems they saw at Enron? Some say that they heard rumors of irr=
egularities but that the company was so vast that they had no firsthand evi=
dence. Some said they feared that spreading rumors might cause the damage t=
hey would have hoped to avert by blowing the whistle.=20
It was clear, too, that Enron had become a company where dissent was tolera=
ted less and less over the years.=20
When people came to Mr. Sutton to complain about unfairness they perceived =
in the company's compensation system, they would be rebuffed, according to =
a former employee who was present for one such dressing- down. ''He'd scowl=
 and say, 'Are you making more money than you ever expected to make in your=
 whole entire life?' '' the former employee said. '' 'If you keep whining a=
bout everything else and everybody else in this company,' he would warn, 'Y=
ou're never going to succeed.' ''=20
Most important, said another departed senior executive, employees tended to=
 trust Mr. Lay. If they heard of a problem that seemed to flunk the ''smell=
 test,'' the former executive said, ''I think they questioned their own nos=
trils more than they questioned the company.''=20
Now many former employees feel betrayed. ''The core values of the company w=
ere 'Respect. Integrity. Communication. Excellence,' '' said Sue Vasan, rec=
iting the much repeated list from memory. She worked in the company's corpo=
rate risk assessment department but was laid off in December, the day after=
 Enron filed for bankruptcy. ''The people preaching those values were the o=
nes most violating them,'' she said. ''I think it's appalling.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE BUZZ
World Economic Forum Plays Down the Scandal
By LOUIS UCHITELLE

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 20, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

More than a thousand corporate chief executives are gathered in New York fo=
r the World Economic Forum, their voices ringing out in almost all the pane=
l discussions.=20
But in four days of nonstop talking, the Enron scandal has hardly been ment=
ioned; when it has been, the emphasis has been on lax business practices an=
d how every recession brings down some big company, rather than on the appa=
rent fraud at the heart of Enron's collapse.
Only one hastily organized panel specifically dealt with the scandal, and i=
ts principal speaker, Richard H. Murray, director of legal and regulatory a=
ffairs at Deloitte & Touche, quickly set the tone. Enron, he told a less-th=
an-packed audience in one of the smallest conference rooms, should not be v=
iewed as a morality play -- there are too many nuanced issues and no clear =
answers.=20
Gail D. Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, argued that ''Enro=
n happened as part of the change in corporate value systems between 1989 an=
d today.''=20
Ms. Fosler, appearing with Mr. Murray, said she had not been recruited unti=
l Wednesday for the Saturday panel, long after most planning for the confer=
ence was done.=20
No one gives more support to the World Economic Forum than those leading Am=
erican corporations that each pay $26,000 a year in dues and fees to cover =
much of the cost of the elaborate annual gathering held, until this year, i=
n Davos, the Swiss ski resort. Enron was a prominent supporter, and when th=
e first list of probable participants for this gathering went out in late S=
eptember, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, was still on it, although his c=
ompany had begun to unravel in public.=20
''I don't think we have ever had a more sudden demise,'' Charles McLean, th=
e forum's chief spokesman, said. Or seen a company more quickly dismissed. =
''Enron is not important to us,'' Mr. McLean said. ''They are bankrupt.''=
=20
But if the forum's participants -- not only chief executives, but entertain=
ers, heads of state, writers, religious leaders and union officials -- winc=
ed at dealing with Enron head on, there were references to it in the panel =
discussions and the hallways.=20
Many cited Enron as a symptom of the times, a point of view offered by Stan=
ley Fischer, the former second in command at the International Monetary Fun=
d who is now a vice chairman at Citigroup. ''Enron is something that happen=
s at the end of a boom,'' he said in a panel on the economic outlook, ''so =
I think we are in for a period of slow growth.''=20
But mostly there was minimizing. Joseph F. Berardino, chief executive of Ar=
thur Andersen, also under fire as Enron's auditor, canceled a scheduled app=
earance. And in interviews, half a dozen chief executives, made less rather=
 than more of the scandal.=20
''It will raise the diligence of boards,'' said Michael D. Capellas, chairm=
an of Compaq Computer. ''I don't think there is a C.E.O. out there who is n=
ot paying attention. But I don't think they are drawing the conclusion that=
 because Enron failed, the system is flawed.''=20
The resistance to linking Enron to corporate fraud and political connection=
s came out at a session on a supposedly loftier matter attended by John J. =
Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Someone raised the issue of corpo=
rate corruption,'' Mr. Sweeney said, ''and the consensus on the panel was t=
hat this was not an issue of globalization.''

Bentsen heads roundtable session=20
Congressman gathers hearing questions from ex-Enron employees=20
By LORI RODRIGUEZ=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Minority Affairs Writer=20
Feb. 4, 2002, 12:05AM
On the eve of a congressional hearing today that was to feature former Enro=
n Chairman Ken Lay, Houston Congressman Ken Bentsen met with former company=
 employees Sunday to hammer out questions for the ex-CEO about the collapse=
 of the company and the subsequent plight of its workforce.=20
In an abrupt move a few hours later, however, Lay announced he would not ap=
pear at the hearing as requested.=20
"What we are trying to find out is one, what happened, what went wrong, wer=
e there things that were done incorrectly, were there bad business decision=
s, was there mismanagement or were there things that were even worse, perha=
ps bordering on fraud," said Bentsen Sunday.=20
"Were there problems in existing law that need to be affected and were ther=
e things done by senior management that resulted in the decisions by employ=
ees to hold the stock that they might not have otherwise done."=20
Following the private discussion with former Enron employees, Bentsen, a ca=
ndidate for the seat being vacating by retiring U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, said =
he had introduced two bills aimed at helping workers who lost their jobs an=
d life savings when the company failed.=20
One bill would prohibit employers from preventing their workers from sellin=
g company stock contained in a 401(k) or retirement savings account. Anothe=
r would give employees a seat at the bankruptcy court table, requiring that=
 they be granted the same rights to compensation as fully secured investors=
 in the company.=20
Lay was scheduled to appear before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transpo=
rtation Committee beginning at 8:30 a.m. today. The hearing was to be viewe=
d in Houston on all the major networks. Bentsen is a senior member of the H=
ouse Financial Services Committee, which will conduct another hearing at 1 =
p.m. probing the company's fall.=20
When he arrived in Washington late Sunday, Bentsen was told of Lay's decisi=
on to pull out of the hearings. "I'm profoundly disappointed, and I know th=
e former employees of Enron I met with are not too pleased," the congressma=
n said.=20
Primed with questions of his own and several from the former Enron workers,=
 Bentsen said Lay was "making a terrible mistake" by not testifying. "We wi=
ll get the answers at some point," Bentsen said.=20
Earlier Sunday at Bentsen's Houston office, Enron ex-employees said they ha=
rbor no malice toward Lay personally. But they told harrowing tales of what=
 they called "Black Monday", Dec. 3, the day they got their marching orders=
.=20
"We had 30 minutes to get out of the building and that was not fair," said =
Louis Allen, who served as supervisor of parking and transportation for nin=
e years. "We were treated like criminals."=20
Although Allen lost $50,000 in savings made during his nine years with the =
company, he and the other employees had kind words for their former top bos=
s.=20
"Mr. Lay is a very generous man, and I think he needs to come forth," said =
Allen. But Allen noted the former chairman would not have left the company =
and returned "if he wasn't concerned."=20
"He didn't want any of this to happen. If he could have done anything, I be=
lieve that he would have tried to save the company. He was a people's perso=
n.=20
"I'm not angry. I just want relief."=20
Debbie Perrotta, a former senior executive assistant for five years who los=
t $40,000 in savings, similarly said she held no anger toward Lay.=20
"I just want the truth to come out," said Perrota, when asked what question=
s she wants Lay and other executives to answer.=20
If employees had been forewarned of the looming trouble, said Perrota, inst=
ead of being constantly reassured of the company's solvency, they might hav=
e pulled back from further savings and investments.=20
"Nobody knew. It was a complete surprise. It was a shock."=20
Allen said he is convinced top Enron officials knew well before the company=
's public failure that it teetered on bankruptcy. As the person in charge o=
f executive parking, Allen said he watched numerous officials turn in their=
 garage keys and bail out months before the collapse.=20
Allen called a scathing report by a three-member team from Enron's board of=
 directors released Saturday "internal damage control." The report conclude=
d the company overstated profits by $1 billion in the last two years while =
some executives pocketed more than $50 million from poorly monitored partne=
rships.=20

Meltdown Is Deja Vu for Some at Enron Energy: Executives who warned about p=
ractices had similar experiences at MG Corp. in the 1990s.
LEE ROMNEY and WALTER HAMILTON
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

There were massive financial losses and ousted executives. Finger-pointing =
at the company's auditor, Andersen, for not ringing alarm bells. An executi=
ve who warned of what could lie ahead but was unheeded.=20
And ultimately, a corporate collapse.
The story is Enron Corp.'s. But it is also that of MG Corp., a German congl=
omerate's U.S. subsidiary that suffered its own high-profile meltdown in th=
e early 1990s.=20
And in a tale of intertwining fates, Enron executives who warned about Enro=
n's practices last year had worked at MG and seen it all before.=20
Jeffrey McMahon, promoted last week to Enron president and chief operating =
officer, was MG's internal auditor. In 1993, he warned his bosses of poor i=
nternal controls in the months before MG began to fall, copies of the audit=
s obtained by The Times show.=20
Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president whose memo to former Enron Cha=
irman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay last summer predicted the company =
would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals"--and pointed to McMahon as=
 equally concerned--also had worked at MG.=20
That experience, according to one friend and former colleague of Watkins, h=
elped her foresee how fast and hard Enron could fall.=20
The crises that battered both companies are far from identical. MG--which i=
s still alive, but no longer owns any operating businesses--was done in by =
an ill-fated bet on oil futures. Enron's slide was triggered in part when l=
osses hidden in off-balance-sheet partnerships suddenly were disclosed.=20
*=20
Both Turned to Derivatives=20
But among the striking similarities is that both companies took risky foray=
s into so-called derivatives that pushed the envelope of conventional finan=
ce, economists familiar with the companies said.=20
Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from the price o=
f an underlying stock, commodity or index. They can be used to make high-oc=
tane market bets or to hedge against market moves.=20
Both firms also used aggressive "mark-to-market" accounting. The goal of ma=
rk-to-market accounting is for companies to list the true value of their as=
sets at prevailing market prices. But experts say the technique can be abus=
ed in thinly traded markets where companies can arbitrarily assign high val=
ues to their assets.=20
In addition, both companies displayed a hubris during their peak years that=
 stood out against their humbling descents, one source said.=20
For those who were in both workplaces, the parallels are all too strong.=20
"I can see anyone who had been at MG saying, 'Hey, I've been here before,'"=
 said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist who served as an expert w=
itness for MG's parent company in the subsequent litigation. "It must have =
become increasingly uncomfortable."=20
MG unraveled in late 1993, when a sudden plunge in world oil prices left it=
 with gaping losses in energy derivatives.=20
Until that time, MG had been aggressively signing long-term contracts with =
energy distributors and marketers to supply them with gasoline and other oi=
l products. Because it promised deliveries at fixed prices, MG sought to gu=
ard against a sudden rise in oil prices.=20
To do that, MG invested in oil futures contracts and other derivatives that=
 would increase in value if oil prices rose. Theoretically, the gains in de=
rivatives would offset any losses on the energy contracts. But rather than =
rising, oil prices sank abruptly. MG incurred steep losses on its large der=
ivatives holdings.=20
*=20
Hypothetical Profit on Books=20
Meanwhile, the cash flow from the long-term contracts MG signed to supply g=
asoline to energy firms was dwarfed by the short-term losses on the derivat=
ives. And in some cases, MG had structured the contracts so customers didn'=
t have to take any supply, or make any payments, for a decade. Yet MG alrea=
dy had recorded expected long-term profit from the energy-supply contracts =
on its books.=20
MG's losses eventually reached $2.7billion. The bankruptcy of its parent, M=
etallgesellschaft, once Germany's 14th-largest company, was averted only by=
 a bailout by German banks.=20
The parent company underwent an aggressive restructuring and eventually liq=
uidated its U.S. oil trading unit.=20
Neither Watkins nor her attorney returned calls for comment on her three-ye=
ar stint at New York-based MG Corp.'s financing arm--MG Trade Finance Group=
--which she left in 1993 to join Enron.=20
Watkins was not at the center of the MG storm, which involved MG Refining &=
 Marketing Inc. But one friend said she had mentioned her experience with t=
hat company's debacle when sounding alarms at Enron.=20
McMahon was closer to the crisis. As internal auditor of MG, he issued seve=
ral internal audits that raised concerns about the oil trading unit.=20
An August 1993 report concluded that the unit's risk-management procedure "=
requires improvement" and that the overall risk-management system was "some=
what informal."=20
*=20
Warning Ignored by Executives=20
Apparently referring to the increasingly large and risky derivatives positi=
ons that the unit was taking on, McMahon wrote that the exposure to losses =
was "much larger than anticipated in the original business plan."=20
McMahon said through Enron spokesman Mark Palmer that he had attempted to a=
lert his superiors to potential problems at the trading unit.=20
McMahon "found a lot of problems," Palmer said. "They just didn't have the =
governance structure to manage the trading positions."=20
The audits "fell on deaf ears" until the losses mounted in late 1993, said =
New York attorney Bob Bernstein, who represents Metallgesellschaft, now kno=
wn as MG Technologies.=20
"Jeff's reports ... were quite prescient," Bernstein said. "Was he the most=
 important person? No. Was Jeff McMahon an important person? Yes.... He's a=
 person of honor and integrity who saw things that were wrong and alerted p=
eople to that."=20
At Enron, McMahon has emerged as one of a handful of executives who alleged=
ly was concerned by off-balance-sheet partnerships headed by former Chief F=
inancial Officer Andrew S. Fastow.=20
According to Watkins' memo, McMahon was "highly vexed over the inherent con=
flicts of [the partnerships]. He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling."=20
Days later, Watkins wrote, Skilling offered McMahon a different job heading=
 another Enron unit. With Skilling and Fastow both gone by fall, McMahon be=
came CFO.=20
*=20
Finger-Pointing Followed Collapse=20
As with Enron, MG's collapse was held forth as having broad implications fo=
r corporate governance, financial controls and derivatives trading.=20
There were allegations that German board members--who claimed they were kep=
t in the dark about the U.S. trading unit's problems--were too close to the=
 company. Similar concerns swirl around Enron's board.=20
There also were questions about accounting firm Andersen. According to publ=
ished reports, the German parent pointed a finger at the firm for supportin=
g MG's interpretation of its numbers and replaced Andersen by 1994.=20
Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said MG's problems were due to the b=
ig swing in oil prices.=20
"This is simply the case of a company caught on the wrong side of a dramati=
c slide in oil prices, like many other companies were at that time," Dorton=
 said, refusing to comment further.=20
In Enron's case, Andersen is under investigation for shredding Enron-relate=
d documents after the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an in=
vestigation of the energy trader. The firm has denied that it authorized sh=
redding.=20
The companies' financial practices also bear similarities. MG has been desc=
ribed in academic papers as a derivatives "horror story." Now, there are si=
gns that in Enron's hands derivatives evolved into tools of fiscal concealm=
ent and manipulation, some experts say, allowing Enron to inflate the value=
 of assets while understating the risks involved.=20
Palmer rejected the notion that the company's problems are tied in any way =
to derivatives. Enron's trading operation suffered when the company's credi=
t rating was cut, not by the trading itself, which he said was profitable.=
=20
Nonetheless, both MG and Enron entered long-term contracts whose ultimate v=
alues were difficult to predict and booked the hypothetical long-term profi=
t from those contracts in the present. That mark-to-market accounting has e=
merged as a trouble spot in both cases, said John Parsons, a financial econ=
omist at Charles River Associates in Boston.=20
"People are marking to what their own opinion is of the value," Parsons sai=
d. If those opinions are wrong, the financial consequences can be severe.=
=20
As it turned out, Enron and MG became directly linked: Eighteen months ago,=
 Enron bought the company's London-based metals trading operation, and the =
Enron and MG logos are side by side in Madison Avenue office space.=20
That relationship is now ending. Sempra Energy last week announced its purc=
hase of the metals business.=20
The similar fates of MG and Enron strike some observers as eerie.=20
"It's almost identical," economist Verleger said. "I think that Enron inadv=
ertently blundered into the same corporate model that caused the collapse o=
f MG."

White House Is Expected to Recommend Only a Slight Boost in Funding for SEC
By Greg Ip
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

02/04/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Despite widespread demands for increased scrutiny of corporat=
e accounting following Enron Corp.'s collapse, the White House is expected =
to recommend only a slight increase in funding for the lead regulator on su=
ch matters when its budget is unveiled today.=20
What's more, the Securities and Exchange Commission's operating budget woul=
dn't include money to back up a recent commitment from both Congress and th=
e Bush administration to raise SEC salaries to stem an exodus of experience=
d staff, people familiar with the matter said.
Just three weeks ago, the agency appeared to score an important victory whe=
n President Bush signed legislation that would raise SEC staff pay to the l=
evels of their counterparts at federal banking-regulation agencies, who ear=
n an estimated 24% to 39% more. Funding the increase was to be handled late=
r.=20
But just a week after the bill was signed, Chairman Harvey Pitt told staff =
in an e-mail, "Unfortunately, the Office of Management and Budget has advis=
ed us that funding for pay parity will not be included in the president's p=
roposed budget for fiscal year 2003, which starts in October. While I am en=
ormously disappointed by this, we are part of one government, and must abid=
e by government-wide budget decisions."=20
The SEC originally requested more than $500 million for 2003, including $76=
 million to implement pay parity for its lawyers and investigators, accordi=
ng to people familiar with the request. As it is, the White House is expect=
ed to recommend a rise of about 4% from the agency's overall budget of $438=
 million this year, with the increase allotted mostly to additional technol=
ogy rather than beefed-up salaries, these people said. In his e-mail, Mr. P=
itt said the administration has agreed to let the SEC use some of this year=
's budget to partially implement pay parity in the current year.=20
The SEC experienced a major exodus of experienced staff in recent years, as=
 the bull market drove up the salaries they could earn in the private secto=
r. During one two-year period in the late 1990s, the SEC's New York regiona=
l office lost more than half of its 137-member enforcement staff. Critics s=
ay that hampered both the level of scrutiny the agency could bring to the m=
arkets and its ability to pursue cases.=20
For example, the SEC tries to review annual reports from large companies at=
 least once every three years, but in the late 1990s its staff was so inund=
ated with reviewing initial public offerings they were unable to scrutinize=
 the usual number of annual reports. Last month, The Wall Street Journal re=
ported that Enron Corp.'s 2000 annual report was scheduled for SEC review, =
but staffers delayed the process for another year, not only to await newly =
required derivatives disclosures but also, a person with knowledge of the p=
rocess said, because they didn't want to take the time to wrestle with Enro=
n's complicated filings.=20
The SEC could face fresh demands on its resources, as better policing of co=
rporate reports and accountants is sought in the aftermath of Enron's colla=
pse. SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Mr. Pitt "has said that we have th=
e staff and the resources to do the job we need to investigate Enron. What =
we will be interested in seeing is what additional duties Congress might as=
k the SEC to take on."=20
White House budget director Mitchell Daniels Jr. said in an interview Frida=
y that the administration doesn't consider the SEC's request for pay parity=
 "justified." He added, "I think the SEC is amply provided for. . . . If th=
ey need more money, it might be for more investigations, as opposed to doin=
g the same investigations and pay everybody more."

Questioning the Books: In Spoof Video, Former CEO Steers Enron To Places No=

By Jonathan Friedland

If former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay testifies before Congress this w=
eek, he won't be showing up dressed as Captain Kirk.=20
But in an in-house spoof video made four years ago for a sales event of Enr=
on's retail energy-services unit, Mr. Lay was shown piloting the Starship E=
nterprise as part of Enron's quest to expand its influence to every corner =
of the universe.
The 10-minute tape -- made at a time when Enron's stock price was soaring a=
nd the company was lauded by many as the nation's most innovative firm -- t=
akes the form of a mock segment from ABC's "20/20" newsmagazine. In it, voi=
ces impersonating Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs, dubbed over their images,=
 recount how in the year 2020 Enron was elected "the world's first global g=
overning body." A voice impersonating ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson says,=
 there "isn't a person who is alive today who doesn't know and revere Enron=
."=20
Featuring cameos by former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling and the former =
Vice Chairman of Enron Energy Services and now Secretary of the Army Thomas=
 White, the tape tells the story of how Enron righted many of the world's w=
rongs, essentially by being smarter than anyone else.=20
Enron officials figure out ways to vanquish earthquakes in Japan, tidal wav=
es in Asia and drought in India. Mr. White averts nuclear war with Russia. =
He is depicted at one point suggesting to Russia's president that the best =
way to prevent tensions from rising anew is for Moscow to outsource managem=
ent of its nuclear arsenal to Enron. The next segment shows Red Square full=
 of Enron logos.=20
The tape, which mixes in footage from such movies as "Naked Gun" and "Deep =
Impact," also recounts how Mr. Lay received the Nobel Prize for economics f=
or theories that forestall a stock market crash in 1999.=20
Mr. Lay had been scheduled to testify before Congress today, but his lawyer=
s said he wouldn't because the hearings have become "prosecutorial."=20
For his part, Mr. Skilling, who is expected to testify this week, is shown =
in the video talking about how he is retiring to a remote island near islan=
ds owned by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett because he has done everything he=
 set out to do at Enron. "It's time for me to go fishing with Warren and Bi=
ll," he tells the interviewer.

O'Neill Wants Stiffer Penalties for CEOs --- Under Proposal, Executives Who=
 Mislead Holders Couldn't Use Insurance
By Bob Davis

NEW YORK -- Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said he favors strengthening pe=
nalties for chief executives who release misleading financial statements, i=
ncluding barring them from using insurance to cover the costs of some share=
holder lawsuits.=20
Responding to the gale of criticism over the collapse of Enron Corp., whose=
 disclosure statements were seen as inadequate or misleading, Mr. O'Neill s=
aid rules governing corporations should be changed to make clearer the resp=
onsibility of corporate executives.
"It would be helpful to strengthen the certification [of financial results]=
 that a chief executive officer makes on behalf of the company," he said du=
ring an interview at the World Economic Forum meeting in New York. One way =
to accomplish that, he said, would be to bar the CEO, other senior executiv=
es and directors from having insurance that pays for legal costs and judgme=
nts arising from situations where a firm doesn't release adequate financial=
 information.=20
Mr. O'Neill said such an insurance ban would apply "to all cases, whether t=
here is wrongdoing or whether there is a wrongful statement." A total ban i=
s important "so there is no ambiguity about the responsibility of executive=
 officers -- that they have the responsibility to know and a responsibility=
 to share" information.=20
Insurance policies covering directors and officers liability typically stat=
e that deliberate misrepresentations or violations of securities laws are g=
rounds for denying a claim.=20
Other types of policies often are less clear in spelling out when an insure=
r must pay. In the Enron situation, insurers who wrote surety bonds are dis=
puting some claims because the insurers say Enron misled them about how the=
 bonds were to be used. Surety bonds are issued by insurers to companies th=
at want to guarantee performance or payment in a business transaction.=20
In the wake of the Enron collapse, President Bush named Mr. O'Neill to head=
 a panel to look at changes in rules governing corporate behavior, which is=
 expected to make recommendations by mid-February. He said it was "worth lo=
oking into" the insurance proposal, but the plan wasn't final. Mr. O'Neill =
also heads a separate panel to look at changes in pension laws, such as rec=
ommending that workers have more flexibility to diversify retirement accoun=
ts, and that senior executives be held to the same blackout periods on stoc=
k sales as rank-and-file employees.=20
By focusing on the actions of CEOs, Mr. O'Neill said it should be possible =
to avoid wholesale changes in rules governing corporate disclosure. "It's n=
ot possible to devise a detailed regulatory scheme that anticipates everyth=
ing that one ought to know," he argued. "Therefore, it's probably going to =
be more beneficial to put the duty on the executives because they should kn=
ow everything that's necessary to know and they should provide everything t=
hat's necessary to know."=20
Stephen Kaufman, chairman and CEO of Arrow Electronics, a Melville, N.Y., s=
emiconductor supplier, who was also attending the WEF meeting, said he was =
concerned that a broad denial of insurance would make it hard to fill top c=
orporate jobs and directorships. "As a CEO of a large company, it's impossi=
ble to know everything going on," he said. "Am I supposed to be sued becaus=
e someone did something wrong? I'd have to think twice about taking the job=
 if that were the situation."=20
So long as an officer or director exercised "reasonable" care in producing =
financial reports, Mr. Kaufman said, he thought they ought to be able to qu=
alify for insurance.=20
Mr. O'Neill said he also would review the recommendations of a task force h=
eaded by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who is examining int=
ernational accounting standards. More and more of the world is one from a f=
inancial standpoint, Mr. O'Neill said, "I think there's no reason to have m=
ultiple standards."=20
Separately, Mr. O'Neill said he expected pace of U.S. economic growth to pi=
ck up during the year, and forecast fourth-quarter growth at an annual rate=
 of 3% to 3.5%. He anticipated that the government would run a surplus, inc=
luding revenue from Social Security taxes, again in "a couple of years." He=
 dismissed criticism that the government should measure its surplus or defi=
cit, without including Social Security taxes.=20
"Tell me why I should do that?" he said. "What does that have to do with an=
ything."=20
When the government runs a surplus, each dollar is used to retire debt, whe=
ther or not that revenue comes from Social Security taxes. That improves th=
e fiscal condition of the government and makes it easier for it to borrow a=
gain in the future to pay for retirement of baby boomers. The proper level =
of government surplus is a subject for debate, Mr. O'Neill said, but the le=
vel shouldn't be determined by the amount of Social Security taxes coming i=
nto the Treasury now.=20
"It's not a relevant thing," he said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE AUDITORS
FORMER FED CHIEF PICKED TO OVERSEE AUDITOR OF ENRON
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

02/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A day after a committee of the Enron board issued a damning report on the c=
ompany's collapse, Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that certified Enro=
n's financial statements, gave extraordinary authority to a new oversight p=
anel to be led by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairma=
n.=20
But Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, abruptly pulled out of =
two promised appearances before Congress beginning today, saying that lawma=
kers had already decided on his guilt.
Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, said, ''Judgments have been reached and =
the tenor of the hearings will be prosecutorial.''=20
Lawmakers generally praised the Enron report yesterday, saying, without poi=
nting directly to Mr. Lay, that it contained strong evidence of corporate c=
rimes.=20
''The report presents a pretty straightforward case of fraud,'' said Senato=
r Jon S. Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey and a former executive at the inve=
stment firm Goldman, Sachs. ''If the facts of it are accurate, it's quite d=
espicable and damning.''=20
The report, issued Saturday, concluded that Enron executives intentionally =
manipulated profits, inflating them by almost $1 billion in the year before=
 the company's collapse through byzantine dealings with a group of partners=
hips. It described across-the-board failures of controls at almost every le=
vel, as a culture of self-enrichment at the expense of shareholders emerged=
.=20
The report said that Arthur Andersen signed off on flawed and improper deci=
sions every step of the way and deserved much of the blame for Enron's coll=
apse. Andersen responded on Saturday by attacking the report as an effort t=
o shift blame to others.=20
Yesterday, Andersen executives said that their reforms were already planned=
 and in no way a reaction to the report. While this is not the first time t=
hat an accounting firm has created an oversight body, the amount of power t=
hat Mr. Volcker's committee will have is remarkable, said Arthur W. Bowman,=
 editor of Bowman's Accounting Report.=20
''What they've done now is almost hard to believe,'' Mr. Bowman said. ''The=
y're going to give this committee carte blanche to make recommendations, an=
d they'll follow them without question.''=20
Mr. Volcker will lead a committee of at least three people with the power t=
o change Andersen's policies and fire or reassign personnel, the firm annou=
nced. The new board is one of several steps Andersen will take to restore i=
ts credibility, the firm's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, said.=20
In its efforts to reassure clients and investors, Andersen has already said=
 that it will stop serving as both internal accountants and external audito=
rs for the same company. It will no longer sell certain technology consulti=
ng services to clients whom it audits, a dual role that critics say creates=
 conflicts of interest. Enron paid Andersen about $27 million for consultin=
g and $25 million for auditing in 2000.=20
Mr. Berardino, who sought out Mr. Volcker, said other changes are in the wo=
rks. ''We're taking a first step forward, and I emphasize it's a first step=
,'' Mr. Berardino said. ''We are serious about being the strongest firm in =
quality, as soon as possible.''=20
The oversight board, whose other members have yet to be named, will have at=
 least one paid full-time staff member. Mr. Volcker will not be paid for hi=
s services.=20
While it is unclear just how far the power of the committee will extend, Mr=
. Volcker said that he expected to be able to effect ''substantial'' change=
s. Otherwise, he said, ''I could not possibly invite other people to join t=
his board.''=20
As the leader of efforts to persuade Swiss banks to return deposits to fami=
lies of Holocaust victims, Mr. Volcker has already established himself as a=
 powerful moral voice.=20
Andersen's announcement comes as accounting firms that audit the nation's l=
argest companies find themselves under intense pressure to change practices=
 that have undermined the credibility of the financial statements they appr=
ove. Last week, four of the Big Five accounting firms, including Arthur And=
ersen, announced support for new restrictions on the services they could se=
ll to companies they audit.=20
Andersen's role in Enron's fall, coming after previous scandals over financ=
ial statements it approved at the Sunbeam Corporation and Waste Management,=
 has made it the focus of industry critics. Beyond missing Enron's accounti=
ng errors and omissions, the Enron report said, the firm also ''participate=
d in the structuring and accounting treatment'' of some of Enron's transact=
ions with partnerships, run by Enron executives, that hid company debt.=20
At the news conference yesterday, Mr. Berardino and Mr. Volcker would not a=
nswer questions about the Enron report -- though Mr. Berardino is likely to=
 face such questions when he testifies before Congress tomorrow. They tried=
 instead to focus on broader accounting issues.=20
''Accounting and auditing in this country is in a state of crisis,'' Mr. Vo=
lcker said at yesterday's news conference, at the offices of Andersen's New=
 York law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell.=20
''Auditing is crucial to protection of the investor'' and to the functionin=
g of efficient markets, Mr. Volcker said. ''If you can't trust the numbers,=
 how can you allocate capital correctly?''=20
Accounting firms, hoping to head off tougher regulation or legislation, are=
 rushing to make themselves more open and accountable. PricewaterhouseCoope=
rs last week announced steps similar to Andersen's, including the addition =
of 3 outside directors to its 18-member board. In the future, the firm will=
 put out an annual report detailing its revenues, compensation policies and=
 other practices to ensure the quality of audits, its chief executive, Samu=
el A. DiPiazza Jr., said at the time.=20
''There needs to be a proactive response by the profession to the Enron sit=
uation,'' Mr. DiPiazza said. ''It is important for us, as we take steps, th=
at we emphasize that we don't think our system is broken. We think our qual=
ity is very high; we think our focus is on the interests of the public and =
public investors. But there's a perception issue.''=20
Ernst & Young, another Big Five firm, is expected to announce its own propo=
sals for changing the profession early this week. According to an executive=
 close to the matter, the heads of all five firms met more than a week ago =
and at that time Mr. Berardino informed them of Andersen's plans.=20
The adoption of an independent board is a measure that experts in corporate=
 governance and former regulators have long called for as a way to make up =
for the lack of oversight given the private partnership structure of accoun=
ting firms.=20
Such oversight might have led Andersen to drop Enron as a client, said Rich=
ard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the S.E.C. ''If Andersen's quandary ov=
er whether to resign had been brought to a board, what would have happened?=
'' he said. ''When conscience questions come up, you need to have a board w=
ith public representatives dealing with them.''=20
Andersen's measures probably will not head off regulatory or legislative ac=
tion, Mr. Bowman said, but may help preserve what is left of the firm's rep=
utation and keep some clients from leaving. ''It takes a step in restoring =
confidence in the firm's ability to do the best work with the best people,'=
' he said. ''But this does not do a thing for what's happened to them to th=
is point.''=20
Accounting experts and some former regulators said the reforms that the fir=
ms now support would not necessarily have prevented the kind of accounting =
that concealed Enron's true condition.=20
But for accounting firms to take the steps they are proposing is radical fo=
r an industry that seldom receives, or wants, much outside attention. The a=
ctions indicate the sense of crisis that accountants acknowledge they now f=
eel.=20
No previous accounting scandals have led the firms to propose such reforms.=
 Last summer, Andersen paid $7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the S=
.E.C. after it had certified statements that vastly overstated earnings at =
Waste Management. In 1998, Waste Management adjusted its previous earnings =
downward by $1.43 billion.=20
But Andersen did not discipline three partners who were involved in the aud=
it, who paid fines of $30,000 to $50,000 each and were temporarily barred f=
rom auditing public companies.=20
Asked whether in light of Andersen's role in Enron, Andersen should have re=
sponded differently to the S.E.C.'s Waste Management charges, Mr. Berardino=
 offered an answer he may have to use repeatedly in the future: ''In hindsi=
ght, I guess we all might do things differently.''

Questioning the Books: Andersen Retains Volcker in Effort to Boost Its Imag=
e --- Former Fed Chairman Is Set To Lead Panel to Help Change Audit Practic=
es
By Jonathan Weil

NEW YORK -- Looking to bolster its damaged image, Arthur Andersen LLP said =
it has retained former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker to lead =
an outside panel that will guide Andersen in making "fundamental change" in=
 the accounting firm's audit practice.=20
Andersen also announced it will stop accepting assignments for information-=
technology consulting work or internal-audit work from U.S.-based publicly =
traded clients for which Andersen also acts as independent auditor. Critics=
 have accused the accounting firm of conflicts of interest because it was E=
nron Corp.'s internal and external auditor and did extensive consulting wor=
k for the energy-trading company before it filed for bankruptcy-court prote=
ction late last year.
The announcement that Andersen would limit the scope of services it provide=
s to domestic audit clients is in line with similar announcements made in t=
he past week by other Big Five accounting firms. Joseph Berardino, Andersen=
's chief executive, called the initiatives an important "first step" toward=
 regaining the public's confidence in the Chicago firm's audits.=20
On Saturday, a special committee of Enron's board issued a blistering repor=
t that, among other things, accused Andersen of failing to perform its prof=
essional duties as the auditor. Andersen promptly issued a statement blamin=
g the Houston company's collapse on poor business decisions.=20
But at a news conference here yesterday, Mr. Berardino ducked reporters' qu=
estions about the special committee's report. "We've had a major letdown in=
 our whole process," Mr. Berardino said. "It's obvious the public has been =
let down, and the question is what should their expectations be." Explainin=
g why he wouldn't comment on the Enron board's findings, Mr. Berardino said=
, "Today's conversation is about going forward."=20
In its report released Saturday, a special committee appointed by Enron's b=
oard pinned much of the responsibility for Enron's misleading financial rep=
orts and eventual collapse on former Enron executives -- and on the company=
's board for failing to exercise adequate oversight. However, the report al=
so laid blame on Andersen.=20
"The evidence available to us suggests that Andersen did not fulfill its pr=
ofessional responsibilities in connection with its audits of Enron's financ=
ial statements, or its obligation to bring to the attention of Enron's boar=
d . . . concerns about Enron's internal controls," the special committee's =
report states. The report also says Andersen at times declined to cooperate=
 with Enron's internal review, a contention Andersen denies. Mr. Berardino =
referred questions about the report to the statement released Saturday by a=
nother Andersen executive, global managing partner C.E. Andrews.=20
"Nothing more than a self-review, [the Enron board's report] does not refle=
ct an independent credible assessment of the situation, but instead represe=
nts an attempt to insulate the company's leadership and the board of direct=
ors from criticism by shifting blame to others," Mr. Andrews said. "More im=
portantly, the report overlooks the fundamental problem -- the fact that po=
or business decisions on the part of Enron executives and its board ultimat=
ely brought the company down."=20
By appointing Mr. Volcker to Andersen's outside panel, Mr. Berardino said h=
e wants to signal that Andersen is serious about improving its audit polici=
es and procedures. "We want to improve our standing in the public's mind, a=
nd we want to improve the quality of our auditing," he said. "Today is a ne=
w day."=20
It remains to be seen what changes Mr. Volcker might recommend. Mr. Volcker=
, who is providing his services free of charge, said the new oversight pane=
l will assemble its own staff and will be funded by Andersen. At the news c=
onference, Mr. Berardino said Andersen would abide by any recommendations m=
ade by the panel. Under the contract between Andersen and Mr. Volcker, an e=
xcerpt of which was released by the firm, the panel would have authority to=
 mandate policy and personnel changes at the firm, which Mr. Berardino desc=
ribed as an unprecedented concession for a large accounting firm.=20
Andersen also has retained former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Repub=
lican, to conduct a review of the firm's records-management policy and reco=
mmend improvements in light of Andersen's disclosure of widespread document=
 destruction at the firm's Houston office.

Questioning the Books: Companies Mull Separation of Auditing, Consulting
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

02/04/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The accounting scandal at Enron Corp. has prompted other companies to consi=
der following a move by Walt Disney Co. to cease using their external audit=
ors to do consulting work.=20
While many companies say they see no need to separate the functions, Cornin=
g Inc., Mirant Corp. and New York Times Co. are among those saying they mig=
ht consider the step.
The collapse of Houston energy trader Enron Corp. brought new scrutiny to t=
he common practice of companies using one accounting firm both to audit the=
 books and to provide lucrative consulting services -- with companies somet=
imes paying much more for the nonaudit services.=20
Some audit firms, facing strong criticism of the practice, aren't waiting f=
or clients to act. Yesterday Arthur Andersen LLP, which audited and did con=
sulting work for Enron, became the latest to react. Andersen said it will n=
o longer accept internal-audit and financial information-systems work from =
publicly traded clients to which it provides external audit services.=20
Disney last week became the first major company to announce it would separa=
te auditing from consulting, saying that though there were no problems with=
 outside auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, it wanted to be free from conc=
erns about auditor independence. Disney's move rendered moot a shareholder =
initiative, scheduled for the annual meeting later this month, that questio=
ned the company's use of its auditor for consulting services.=20
Many companies try to ensure audit independence through rules that require =
board members to approve the use of outside accountants for other services.=
 Others place limits on the fees paid to accountants. At the same time, que=
stions about the practice are prompting executives to re-examine their poli=
cies, to make sure safeguards are sufficient to prevent conflicts of intere=
st.=20
This week, Corning's board-level audit committee will consider adding restr=
ictions to its auditing and consulting-fee policies, said Paul Rogoski, a c=
ompany spokesman. In light of the Enron situation, "we're going to look at =
what our current process is and see if it needs to be updated," Mr. Rogoski=
 said. For 2000, the most recent figures available, Corning, a Corning, N.Y=
., optical-fiber maker, paid $2.5 million in auditing fees to Pricewaterhou=
se and $13.3 million to the firm in consulting fees.=20
Mirant, an Atlanta energy firm, says it probably will study the Disney move=
 as part of a "constant review" of its audit policy, though it typically tr=
ies to separate audit work from consulting jobs. "We're making every effort=
 we can to be non-Enron-like," a company spokesman said. In 2000, the compa=
ny paid Arthur Andersen LLP $2.2 million for auditing services, another $1.=
2 million for financial information-systems services, and $10.1 million for=
 other services, including help with its initial public offering and tax co=
nsulting.=20
JDS Uniphase Corp. a maker of fiber-optic components for telecommunications=
 networks, said that last year, under pressure from regulators, it began to=
 reduce the nonaudit services that it purchases from auditors Ernst & Young=
 LLP. For the fiscal year ended June 30, JDS, which maintains dual headquar=
ters in Ottawa and San Jose, Calif., paid Ernst & Young $1.4 million for it=
s audit; $2 million for other audit-related services, including review of J=
DS's SEC filings; and $3.6 million for other services, including tax consul=
ting and its internal audit.=20
Chief Financial Officer Anthony Muller said JDS stopped using Ernst & Young=
 for real-estate consulting and internal auditing because of "loud messages=
 from the SEC" about auditor independence. He said the company continues to=
 use Ernst & Young for tax-related issues because JDS believes there is "co=
nsiderable value" in having the auditor work on both accounting and tax iss=
ues.=20
At New York Times Co., Enron-related accounting concerns are prompting the =
company's audit committee to review whether it will use auditors Deloitte &=
 Touche for consulting work in 2002, spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said. In =
2000, the company paid Deloitte $1.3 million for reviewing its financial st=
atements and $3.1 million for other services, principally tax consulting an=
d work revolving around a since-withdrawn plan to create a tracking stock f=
or its New York Times Digital unit.=20
Some companies say there is nothing wrong with using auditors for other ser=
vices if there are safeguards in place.=20
Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, paid Pricewaterhouse=
Coopers $1.2 million in audit fees for the year ended Dec. 31, 2000, and an=
other $11 million primarily for tax, technology and management-consulting s=
ervices. Richard Zannino, Dow Jones's chief financial officer, said a large=
 chunk of the nonaudit expenses were related to computer systems bought thr=
ough the audit firm. He said Dow Jones isn't considering altering its polic=
y in light of Enron, because the company already has "very conservative pra=
ctices" in place.=20
Even before the Enron debacle, there was pressure on professional-services =
firms to stop hawking audit and consulting services to the same client. Som=
e firms have taken their consulting units public or gone public themselves =
in recent years. Ernst & Young sold its consulting business two years ago, =
while KPMG LLP spun off KPMG Consulting Inc. in an initial public offering =
one year ago this month.=20
Last week, Pricewaterhouse said it will file plans this spring to spin off =
its management-consulting unit, PwC Consulting, in an IPO. The firm says th=
e timing is due in part to what it sees as a crisis of confidence in the in=
dustry.=20
Arthur Andersen itself, in 2000, separated from its management-consulting b=
usiness, now called Accenture, in an acrimonious split. However, Andersen's=
 role as auditor and consultant to Enron is prompting intense scrutiny. Enr=
on paid Andersen $25 million for audit services and $27 million for nonaudi=
ting work, including tax consulting, in 2000, the most recent period for wh=
ich figures are available. After Enron revealed in November that it had ove=
rstated its earnings for four years, Andersen officials testified before Co=
ngress that the nonauditing fees didn't compromise their independence as au=
ditors.=20
Yesterday, Joseph F. Berardino, the firm's managing partner and chief execu=
tive, signaled that Andersen wouldn't accept internal-audit and computer-sy=
stems work from audit clients as a way "to assure confidence in the quality=
 of our audits in all jurisdictions." Andersen also said it had hired forme=
r Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker as chairman of an oversight board t=
o help recommend other changes.=20
Some accounting firms, however, warn against quick judgments. Deloitte & To=
uche, in a statement last week, acknowledged that "a perception problem nee=
ds to be solved" in the industry. But the firm said "it is premature to acc=
ept or reject any single proposal." A spokeswoman for Deloitte had no addit=
ional comment.

Derivatives Cop Wanted, but Terms Vary
By Michael Schroeder and Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

In the wake of Enron's colossal fall, the Bush administration and a biparti=
san group of lawmakers want to shine a light on derivatives-trading practic=
es. Pressure is building for new regulatory action.=20
But the question is: Which regulatory cop will get the derivatives beat?
President Bush, in his State of the Union address, singled out the need for=
 "stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements." Thoug=
h Mr. Bush didn't mention Enron Corp. by name or identify derivatives tradi=
ng specifically, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently spoke for the adm=
inistration in calling for modernization of derivatives regulation.=20
Lawmakers have their own proposals. Some Democrats are using Enron to reviv=
e a debate about whether derivatives should be regulated by a merged Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Some=
 derivatives -- investment contracts whose value is derived from underlying=
 assets such as commodities or currencies -- aren't traded on exchanges and=
 fall through the regulatory cracks.=20
Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, is drafting legislation that wo=
uld create a merged superregulator to address "gaping holes in the federal =
oversight of financial markets," specifically with regard to over-the-count=
er derivatives. Sen. Jon Corzine (D., N.J.), former co-chairman of Goldman =
Sachs Group Inc., says he believes both agencies should share increased ove=
rsight of these risky transactions.=20
Everyone agrees that it is a huge market. The nominal value of derivatives =
on the books of commercial banks soared to $51.3 trillion at the end of Sep=
tember from $6.8 trillion in 1990, with nearly $20 trillion of that growth =
coming since 1998, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Curren=
cy. Of course, these numbers considerably overstate the actual money at ris=
k because the aggregate dollars are based on the theoretical value on which=
 each transaction is based. For example, it is highly unlikely that the val=
ue of most derivative contracts would ever go to zero.=20
Financial regulators hew to decades-old divisions of authority. They have c=
ontinued to keep a close watch on banks, brokerage firms and conventional e=
xchanges, while leaving new entrants such as Enron to police themselves. Th=
e CFTC regulates futures contracts and, along with the SEC, options traded =
on exchanges, but not derivatives traded off-exchange, or "over the counter=
." These over-the-counter trades are negotiated privately between large fin=
ancial institutions or corporations.=20
The way such derivatives are regulated depends on what kind of firm sells t=
hem. For example, bank regulators such as the Federal Reserve can scrutiniz=
e commercial banks' activity, while the SEC can examine brokers who conduct=
 business in the U.S.=20
Enron -- which started by trading natural gas, then expanded to electricity=
, metals and more exotic derivatives -- fell through the gaps of this regul=
atory framework. During 2000 alone, Enron's derivatives-related assets incr=
eased to $12 billion from $2.2 billion, with most of the growth coming from=
 increased trading through its EnronOnline unit, according to Enron's finan=
cial reports. To ensure that Enron met Wall Street quarterly earnings estim=
ates, it used derivatives and off-balance-sheet partnerships, known as spec=
ial-purpose vehicles, to hide losses on technology stocks and debts incurre=
d in financing unprofitable businesses, some specialists say. In addition, =
some traders apparently hid losses and understated profits, which had the e=
ffect of making derivatives trading appear less volatile than it was.=20
Throughout the 1990s, there have been calls for expanded regulation and mor=
e disclosure after a number of high-profile financial disasters involving d=
erivatives, including investigations of Bankers Trust New York Corp., Orang=
e County, Calif., and Long-Term Capital Management, the investment fund who=
se fall in 1998 threatened the entire financial system.=20
In the past, however, proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have run into a b=
uzzsaw from lawmakers unwilling to give up jurisdiction over the agencies. =
The agriculture committees fought to preserve oversight of the CFTC, while =
the banking and financial-services committees wouldn't consider relinquishi=
ng their SEC authority.=20
Giving financial institutions the option of selecting a derivatives regulat=
or from among the SEC, CFTC or banking regulators, including the Federal Re=
serve Board, is one approach being considered. That arrangement would give =
regulators confidential access to books and records, which wouldn't be made=
 public. Lawmakers also are discussing giving a designated regulator the au=
thority to do a yearly, unscheduled audit of each derivatives dealer -- an =
approach used in Japan.=20
To address problems posed by companies such as Enron, some specialists have=
 said nonfinancial public companies should be required to split derivatives=
-trading operations into separate affiliates subject to strict capital requ=
irements, much as banks as well as brokerages do.=20
Derivatives have been around since the ancient Greeks hedged the price of t=
heir crops. But early in the 1980s, U.S. corporations such as International=
 Business Machines Corp. or institutions such as the World Bank began using=
 derivatives to hedge against the volatility of currency or interest rates.=
 By 1990, use of derivatives by U.S. corporations had become the rule rathe=
r than the exception.=20
Any effort to increase wholesale regulation of derivatives dealers will mee=
t fierce opposition from powerful banks and Wall Street firms, which succes=
sfully have championed the near-complete absence of oversight of over-the-c=
ounter derivatives.=20
For their part, bankers say financial institutions are subjected to much mo=
re scrutiny than other public companies. Not only do banks have regulators =
like the Federal Reserve monitoring the way they carry the risk of derivati=
ves, but banks also must pass muster with entire industry of analysts, cred=
it-rating agencies and competitors who constantly measure their risk as cou=
nterparties. Some bankers concede their own disclosure provides investors a=
nd counterparties little insight into the full scope of the risks involved.=
=20
In late 2000, Congress exempted over-the-counter derivatives from nearly an=
y regulation. Enron led the massive lobbying effort on Capitol Hill and, wi=
th the exemption, escaped federal oversight of its trading activities. Sen.=
 Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.) plans legislation to repeal the part of the 2=
000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act that exempts energy trading from re=
gulation.=20
As a publicly traded company, Enron and other big energy-derivatives trader=
s routinely provide the SEC with general information about finances. They a=
ren't obliged to divulge detailed information to any agency about over-the-=
counter trading activities.=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has required since last year that =
companies report broad aggregate derivatives numbers to the SEC each quarte=
r, but regulators concede that companies can do last-minute transactions to=
 dress up portfolios. In December, FASB issued extensive guidance on deriva=
tives reporting, which is covered in more than 800 pages. Specialists say t=
he sheer complexity of the rule could muddy the waters.=20
The investing community -- and Congress -- probably will compel companies t=
o disclose information about corporate use of derivatives. "If companies ar=
e going to indicate to investors that they are managing risk with derivativ=
es, investors are going to want more information about how they are doing t=
hat so they can reach their own judgment about how well its being managed,"=
 says Nik Khakee, director of derivatives ratings at credit-rating agency S=
tandard & Poor's.

Enron's Woes Are Felt by Firms Overseas --- In U.K. and Elsewhere, Accounti=
ng Rules Get Newfound Attention
By Steve Liesman and Marc Champion
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Two weeks ago, Mohamed Alabbar, the chairman of a public company in the Uni=
ted Arab Emirates, received a hurried visit from his auditors at Ernst & Yo=
ung.=20
The team asked him to declare that his company, Emaar Properties PJSC, had =
no off-the-books partnerships or off-balance-sheet debts. While Mr. Alabbar=
 was ready to sign a document pledging that was the case right away, the au=
ditors told him to take the document home for a couple of days and think ab=
out it first. "All these auditors are sharpening their pencils," says Mr. A=
labbar, who has even had his travel expenses questioned recently. "It's lik=
e they are coming and sitting with you almost every day."
The collapse of Enron Corp. has led global markets to retrench in fear of w=
idespread accounting irregularities, forced at least one foreign official t=
o resign, and focused attention on local accounting scandals. It also has p=
rompted a rethink of accounting practices from Britain to the UAE to South =
Africa. In many ways, the Houston company's bankruptcy is being treated lik=
e a fault has been found in a critical airplane system, prompting a scrambl=
e to effect global repairs.=20
In Britain, ripples from the Enron affair claimed a first casualty Friday, =
when Lord John Wakeham, a former U.K. energy minister and accountant who se=
rved on Enron's audit committee, stepped down temporarily from his job as h=
ead of Britain's press complaints commission. Lord Wakeham has said he will=
 remain on leave until he has cleared his name in the U.S. investigation in=
to Enron.=20
As in the U.S., the question of political donations from Enron has been rai=
sed in the U.K., with the opposition Conservative Party charging that GBP 3=
8,000 ($61,000) in Enron donations to the ruling Labour Party in 1997 to 20=
00 may have influenced the government to end a moratorium on the constructi=
on of gas-fired power stations. So far, the Tories have come up with no evi=
dence to support their claim of impropriety and have had to admit that they=
 accepted GBP 25,000 in Enron donations as well.=20
While the current political squall over Enron in the U.K. may blow over, th=
ere are likely to be lasting effects on British accounting regulations. How=
ard Davies, the head of Britain's newly consolidated Financial Services Aut=
hority, says he has set up an internal inquiry to look into lessons that th=
e U.K. could learn from the collapse of Enron. Interviewed at the World Eco=
nomic Forum in New York, Mr. Davies said plans for a review of Britain's ac=
counting rules were already in place as a result of an earlier, domestic ac=
countancy scandal. But, he said, "Enron has given that process a big kick."=
=20
While Mr. Davies believes an Enron-style scandal is less likely in the U.K.=
 because of differences in accounting practices, he says it is possible. Re=
forms in the pipeline would aim primarily to strengthen auditor independenc=
e. The FSA will, for example, look into drafting new rules that would requi=
re companies to rotate their auditing firms, or at least re-tender the cont=
racts, perhaps every five years. There may also be more formal restrictions=
 on firms providing nonauditing services -- such as consulting -- to client=
s. Mr. Davies said the Enron scandal likely has given him greater political=
 clout to push through change, using either his own authority or through pa=
rliament.=20
Worried about the implications of the Enron affair, the U.K.-based global f=
oods and household goods company, Unilever PLC, has already said that it wi=
ll ban its auditors from consulting contracts with the company.=20
Similarly, in South Africa, an earlier accounting scandal has suddenly beco=
me a more significant public issue. The collapse of the biggest health-club=
 chain in the country is receiving intense scrutiny because its accounting =
irregularities mirrored Enron's. The company, Leisurenet, booked upfront me=
mbership revenues to be debited monthly from credit cards rather than as th=
ey were paid, echoing charges that Enron aggressively booked future profits=
 from derivatives contracts.=20
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the country is examining =
its accounting legislation, including its accounting oversight board. "This=
 was in process before, but now I think we have to take a very hard look at=
 it."

Enron's Rise and Fall Gives Some Scholars A Sense of Deja Vu --- Decades Ag=

As Congress investigated the collapse of a high-profile energy company, it =
faced a daunting challenge.=20
One senator said that to understand the huge company's shocking failure, la=
wmakers must consider the regulatory and legal missteps that led to its dow=
nfall. How, he wondered, could Congress restore investors' confidence in th=
e financial system? By repealing old laws? Enacting new ones?
One of his colleagues answered by recounting an old joke: A man gets a mess=
age that his mother-in-law has died. "Shall we embalm, cremate or bury?" it=
 asks. Replies the man, "Embalm, cremate and bury. Take no chances."=20
Was this a moment of levity during last week's hearings into the Enron Corp=
. debacle?=20
Actually, it was a scene that played out nearly seven decades ago between F=
red Herbert Brown, a New Hampshire Democrat and George Norris, a Nebraska R=
epublican, as they took to the Senate floor to discuss the demise of Middle=
 West Utilities Co. The holding company -- the hub of a vast empire built b=
y energy magnate Samuel L. Insull -- had sunk abruptly into bankruptcy amid=
 allegations of stock fraud and crooked accounting, wiping out thousands of=
 investors.=20
Today, many students of corporate history get a sense of deja vu as they wa=
tch the Enron saga unfold. "In the 1930s, investors lost confidence in the =
basic institutions of capitalism -- banks, corporations and accountants," s=
ays Richard Hirsh, professor of economics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute=
 and State University in Blacksburg, Va. "To see this happening again with =
Enron certainly gives one pause."=20
Middle West was made up of a host of interconnected companies with interloc=
king boards -- an arrangement mirrored, in some ways, by the web of off-bal=
ance-sheet partnerships that concealed Enron's heavy debt burden. So compli=
cated was Middle West's structure that it took seven years for a team from =
the newly formed Federal Trade Commission to fully unravel its financial st=
ructure.=20
Other similarities between Middle West and Enron go straight to the top. Li=
ke Kenneth Lay, who resigned last month as Enron's chairman and chief execu=
tive, Middle West's Mr. Insull was a big campaign contributor, with powerfu=
l friends in Washington. Both men were successful in keeping the government=
 out of their business dealings. Mr. Insull, for one, "was careful to regul=
ate the regulator," Sen. Norris declared in June 1934.=20
In its era, Middle West's operations were every bit as groundbreaking as En=
ron's would be with EnronOnline, its Internet-based energy-trading system. =
Mr. Insull, for example, pioneered the idea that central power plants shoul=
d operate 24 hours a day to help defray their high fixed costs.=20
To generate enough demand to fulfill this vision, Mr. Insull, who sported a=
 broom mustache, wooed electric streetcar companies, promoted electric elev=
ators and touted the labor-saving advantages of the "all-electric home." He=
 even coined the term "massing production," later shortened by his publicis=
ts to "mass production," to describe the benefits of huge power plants supp=
lying electricity to large regions of the country. Some economists credit M=
r. Insull with single-handedly driving down power costs, helping American f=
actories to flourish.=20
But, also like Enron, Middle West pushed its financial engineering too far.=
 By the early 1930s, it was emblematic of the octopus-like "power trusts" t=
hat were suspected of manipulating the nation's energy markets in unseen wa=
ys.=20
Middle West was born in Chicago in 1912, about 31 years after the London-bo=
rn Mr. Insull immigrated to the U.S., where he became private secretary to =
Thomas Alva Edison. While Mr. Edison invented the technology that harnessed=
 electricity, Mr. Insull invented the business model that turned it into a =
money maker. He rose to manage Mr. Edison's Schenectady, N.Y., operations, =
later to become General Electric Co. Then, he moved on to Chicago, where he=
 broke free of Mr. Edison in 1892 and formed Commonwealth Edison Co. by mer=
ging smaller companies.=20
Middle West was the first and most prominent of Mr. Insull's half-dozen or =
so holding companies. Its myriad affiliates, which included utilities, cons=
truction outfits and electrical-equipment makers, hawked stocks tied to oth=
er Insull enterprises. "There was tremendous pyramiding and preferential tr=
eatment of affiliated companies," says Alfred Kahn, an economics professor =
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.=20
Middle West withstood the stock-market crash of 1929, and it looked at firs=
t like Mr. Insull might emerge relatively unscathed. At one point, he even =
extended $50 million in credit to the city of Chicago to pay its schoolteac=
hers and police.=20
But Middle West had an Achilles' heel. Its companies had taken on an enormo=
us amount of debt during the go-go years of the 1920s, and the company acce=
lerated its borrowings after the crash. By the middle of 1931, creditors an=
d rivals, including financier J.P. Morgan, were circling. In 1932, with pre=
sidential hopeful Franklin Roosevelt blasting the "Insull monstrosity" for =
allegedly inflating the value of its holdings and selling worthless bonds, =
Middle West and many of its 284 affiliates were placed in receivership.=20
Washington quickly got into the act. In rapid order in 1934 and 1935, Congr=
ess passed the Securities and Exchange Act, the Public Utility Holding Comp=
any Act and the Federal Power Act. Those laws sought to break up the power =
trusts and guarantee investors the information they needed to make informed=
 decisions. More than a half century later, Enron would figure out ways aro=
und parts of those same laws.=20
After Middle West went bust, an exhausted Mr. Insull left the country, land=
ing in Greece. Later, at the behest of the U.S., Turkish authorities arrest=
ed him on his yacht and shipped him home to stand trial for fraud and embez=
zlement.=20
In a packed Chicago courtroom, the 75-year-old Mr. Insull took the stand, m=
esmerizing jurors with his Horatio Alger-like tale of how an English dairym=
an's son rose to become secretary to the Wizard of Menlo Park, as Mr. Ediso=
n was known, and head of a vast conglomerate. In all, he stood trial three =
times; all three trials ended in his acquittal.=20
Still, he was far from home free. The politicians whom he had liberally sup=
ported now took pains to distance themselves from him. He also lost his per=
sonal fortune, estimated in 1930 at $150 million, remained significantly ti=
ed up with Middle West -- a notable difference, it seems, from Mr. Lay and =
other Enron executives who cashed out hundreds of millions of dollars in st=
ock before the company went under.=20
"It looks to me like Enron management made beaucoup boatloads of money and =
jumped ship," says University of Alabama historian Forrest McDonald, an Ins=
ull biographer who sees his subject as a tragic figure whose contributions =
have been largely overlooked. By contrast, Mr. McDonald says, Mr. Insull "w=
ent down with the ship. "=20
In 1936, Mr. Insull left the U.S. to live in France, trusting his son to de=
fend his interests in lingering lawsuits. Two years later, at age 78, he su=
ffered a massive heart attack while waiting for a Paris subway train. When =
police arrived, his wallet was missing. The next day, newspapers gloated ov=
er his rags-to-riches-to-rags saga, noting that the onetime millionaire had=
 died alone, and with a mere 85 cents in his pocket.

BOOM TOWN: Enron's Lessons Can Be Applied To Web Issues
By Kara Swisher

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is the Enron crisis taking Silicon Valley off the hook? Lately, it's been s=
tealing all the tsk-tsk headlines and the blame for Wall Street woes as the=
 prime example of hype and greed.=20
"I think people are tending to look back on this era now as a comedy and no=
t a tragedy," says John Cassidy, author of the aptly named new book, "Dot.c=
on: The Greatest Story Ever Sold. "Capitalism has great recuperative powers=
 and there is now a feeling that we let bygones be bygones."
Not so fast. It's critical that we keep a spotlight on the issues that have=
 surfaced since the Internet and tech sector began imploding, especially if=
 the industry is to move forward on stable footing. Here are some continuin=
g concerns:=20
Fueled by sky-high stock valuations, bickering managers, indiscriminate dea=
l-making and a spate of service complaints, the bankruptcy of Excite@Home l=
ast year was a shocking example of Web-mania run amok. The cable service's =
users and minority shareholders bore the brunt of the pain. Most of the com=
pany's assets have been sold and the rest will be shuttered down. "Basicall=
y, after Feb. 28, we will cease to exist," Excite@Home spokeswoman Julie Da=
vidson says.=20
So, shareholder lawsuits will be moot and investors will be out of luck, ev=
en as many top executives and venture investors sold out big chunks of thei=
r shares while urging others to invest. It had a distinct Enronish feel, li=
ke many dot-coms, with insiders benefiting over outsiders, even though the =
share-selling was perfectly legal.=20
More, not less, oversight by the media and Wall Street analysts was needed =
in this case. As most of the company's customers are forced to move onto al=
ternatives, state and federal regulators need to keep an eye on the rollout=
 of broadband access. This is especially important as tech leaders pressure=
 the Bush administration to make high-speed Internet access a priority by o=
ffering tax breaks and removing regulation.=20
It's a good thing Enron is keeping accounting issues at the forefront of pu=
blic attention. Dubious, though usually legal, methods of accounting for re=
venue and income were common in the dot-com sector in its early years. Reve=
nue-enhancing methods, such as mixing barter, investment and other one-time=
 revenues into the mix of ordinary sales performance -- while stripping out=
 costs -- painted a skewed picture of many companies' prospects.=20
The travails of Homestore.com, the Westlake Village, Calif., online real-es=
tate company, is a good measuring stick for how well Web firms clean up the=
ir balance sheets. Once one of the few survivors with a multibillion dollar=
 market valuation, the company warned of trouble in the form of a huge quar=
terly loss in November. At that time, executives blamed the ad downturn for=
 their plight against the backdrop of Sept. 11.=20
In fact, after new executives took over and an internal audit inquiry was o=
rdered, Homestore.com conceded it had overstated revenue by as much as $95 =
million for the first three quarters of 2001 by counting a large chunk of q=
uestionable barter transactions as ad sales. The company also has ferreted =
out those responsible and taken disciplinary actions.=20
"Clearly, the future of the company relies on its ability to restore confid=
ence with partners, employees and customers," says Homestore.com spokesman =
Gary Gerdemann. "We definitely have some bridges to mend."=20
Companies need such frankness. And investors need to demand increased trans=
parency in a company's financial health. While it isn't clear that Homestor=
e.com will survive, a mea culpa like Mr. Gerdemann's is refreshing to hear,=
 given how little public responsibility many dot-com players have taken. Th=
ey should take more.=20
The recent lawsuit lobbed by AOL Time Warner against Microsoft over the sor=
ry state of AOL's Netscape subsidiary brought a collective yawn from Silico=
n Valley. It deserved more attention. It's critical this plodding legal dra=
ma be played out to the very end for the good of the industry.=20
In a nutshell, AOL claims its once-dominant Navigator browser was unable to=
 withstand Microsoft's withering monopolistic assault. Microsoft claims Net=
scape's products just plain stunk.=20
"This is a logical extension of the findings of two federal courts that Mic=
rosoft thwarted competition and violated the antitrust laws," says AOL spok=
eswoman Kathy McKiernan. Microsoft's spokesman Vivek Varma counters that AO=
L is just using the courts to make business gains it can't achieve via comp=
etition. "The last thing our industry and consumers want and need is for tw=
o of America's biggest companies suing each other in court," he says.=20
Actually, it may be just the thing we need. Even if such battles may seem t=
o drain energy from all-important innovation -- and Microsoft is correct th=
at it often does -- the future development of the industry may depend on th=
em.=20
---=20
What are the most troublesome issues of the dot-com heyday that serve as le=
ssons for the future? Write me at kara.swisher@wsj .com and see the debate =
Friday at WSJ .com/BoomTown.
