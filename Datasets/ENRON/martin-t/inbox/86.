Tom, I believe you are correct regarding the voice mail question you left me.  Anything you trade on that might be in a Schwabb account etc will more than likely need to be rolled over to Paine Webber.  Mutual Funds will probably not be an issue.  Like I said, I don't have too much information on that right now however I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that we will have to eventually make those changes.

Thanks, Tony
