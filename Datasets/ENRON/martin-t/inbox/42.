HOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =
meeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=
ately disastrous course.=20
On that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=
urn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=
gal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=
 management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=
rantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.
While Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=
s was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=
as supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=
ned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=
he meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=
tow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=
ld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =
limited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =
but off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=
nough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20
However, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=
 there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=
as. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=
sively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=
lders and creditors.=20
Four years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=
ng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=
 two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=
cause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=
 to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=
 Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=
rs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=
t bankruptcy-law protection.=20
Federal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=
rn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=
d themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=
s existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=
 heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=
nda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=
 a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=
, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20
Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=
mer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=
ut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, "We are=
n't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation." An atto=
rney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=
ly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20
The meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =
people at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=
rt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =
One -- Herbert "Pug" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=
eenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =
creation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=
 says the executive committee was told that "Chewco was a special-purpose v=
ehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=
-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=
as involved with Chewco." The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =
in attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=
ow whether he was introduced or took part.=20
During the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow "=
reviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=
orporate structure." Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=
ng was "positive income impact to Enron," according to a handout appended t=
o the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=
ture.=20
Chewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =
longtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =
his firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =
separate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=
ng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =
Barclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=
 transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=
h the discussions.=20
A Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =
is scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=
 his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=
o four years ago.=20
Chewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=
 at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=
 had many competitors. Traditional "off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=
nique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=
ted States," says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=
 firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =
developing, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=
oney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20
This financing is "nonrecourse," meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=
e hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=
h it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=
. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =
little of it publicly evident.=20
To do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=
lowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=
tnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=
he assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=
 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=
st 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=
soring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=
 many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=
rship.=20
Enron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=
uilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=
 consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=
 and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=
enants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=
nd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20
They figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=
th debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =
its financing costs higher.=20
Mr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =
and deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=
ther "hard" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome=
 and confining to achieve this. Enron would have to negotiate for months wi=
th partners, banks and other outsiders before getting a deal going. "Enron =
didn't like being told no," says one former senior Enron executive. So Mr. =
Skilling and Mr. Fastow "found a way to avoid the discussion altogether."=
=20
The solution: bring the partnerships in house, without appearing to do so, =
say people involved in setting up the structures.=20
In 1995, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Fastow began app=
roaching investment banks with a novel proposal. He wanted them to help him=
 recruit investors for partnerships that would do business with Enron. But =
the partnerships would be partly owned and run by Enron executives. Donalds=
on, Lufkin & Jenrette, for one, turned him down, figuring the potential con=
flicts of interest were too great.=20
Mr. Fastow and other Enron officials continued their discussions with vario=
us banks to no avail. All the while, pressure was building. By 1997, compan=
y executives would later acknowledge, debt levels were getting worrisomely =
high. The company was also having a tough time meeting its earnings project=
ions.=20
That's when Chewco was presented to the board in the November 1997 meeting.=
 Having met resistance from investment banks, Enron officials turned to com=
mercial banks to lend money to Chewco as well as to two small entities, als=
o connected to Mr. Kopper. These two put the crucial 3% of outside equity i=
nto Chewco that allowed it to be treated as separate from Enron.=20
After Chewco was set up, Enron's profit performance began to improve and it=
s expansion pace intensified. Mr. Skilling and his team ascended the ranks.=
 By 1998, he was Enron's chief operating officer, Mr. Fastow was chief fina=
ncial officer and Mr. Causey was chief accounting officer.=20
Chewco became a template. In June 1999, the board held a special meeting to=
 hear Messrs. Skilling and Fastow outline plans for a new partnership known=
 as LJM Cayman LP. It was designed to resolve "certain challenges" in prote=
cting the value of a growing portfolio of volatile telecommunications asset=
s, according to an excerpt from the meeting's minutes. The LJM name came fr=
om the initials of Mr. Fastow's wife and two children.=20
Four months later, the Enron executives proposed to the board an even more =
ambitious partnership, dubbed LJM2 Co-Investment LP, to serve as a reposito=
ry for other risky bets made by the company.=20
Both LJMs were managed and partly owned by Mr. Fastow. In an SEC filing, En=
ron recently estimated he made more than $30 million from his participation=
 in the entities. At least several million dollars of this was management f=
ees -- a generous sum given that, in one presentation, Mr. Fastow said he w=
orked just three hours a week on partnership matters.=20
A spokesman for Mr. Fastow declines to comment on how much he made from the=
 partnerships or on LJM generally. In the past, representatives of the form=
er CFO have pointed to Enron statements that its board and top management r=
eviewed and approved both the creation and operation of the LJM partnership=
s.=20
Some Enron insiders say that whatever Mr. Fastow earned from the LJM partne=
rships was a pittance compared with the benefits they provided the company.=
 As Enron's growth exploded in the late 1990s, worries mounted over debt le=
vels, and the company needed help producing cash flow and earnings. Increas=
ingly, Enron came to rely on the partnerships to take debt and troubled ass=
ets off its books and produce transactions that could be reported as profit=
s. How much Mr. Fastow made from the LJMs was of little concern to top mana=
gement, says one former Enron executive, because the CFO was the one person=
 who could consistently pull "their nuts out of the fire with some fancy tr=
ansactions."=20
By the year 2000, the LJM partnerships were providing more than 40% of Enro=
n's reported pretax income of about $1.4 billion, according to a recent SEC=
 filing by the company.=20
All told, the LJM partnerships raised about $400 million from outside inves=
tors and eventually did billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. Sub=
structures of the LJM latticework proliferated with the creation of other e=
ntities. In a May 1, 2000, presentation to the finance committee of Enron's=
 board, management described how an LJM offshoot called Project Raptor woul=
d "hedge the profit & loss volatility of Enron investments," according to i=
nternal documents from that meeting.=20
As part of the project, another entity called Talon was to be created with =
seed capital of $400 million and an initial capacity to provide "approximat=
ely $200 million of P&L protection" to Enron, according to one document. LJ=
M2 would be the outside investor in Talon and "be entitled to a 30% annuali=
zed return plus fees," it said.=20
At the finance-committee meeting, its minutes show, Mr. Causey said Anderse=
n "had spent considerable time analyzing the Talon structure and the govern=
ance structure of LJM2 and was comfortable with the proposed transaction." =
The committee approved the Raptor-Talon plan.=20
Mr. Causey's attorney, J.C. Nickens, says that his client believes the trea=
tment of the partnerships "was an appropriate interpretation of the account=
ing rules as they existed then and as they still exist today."=20
Though the minutes said there was "discussion" of the Raptor arrangement, n=
either those minutes nor similar recountings of other board gatherings indi=
cate that directors seemed particularly concerned about what was happening =
under the LJM umbrella. They might well have been. By last fall, public con=
cern over the transactions had plunged Enron into crisis. Now, investigator=
s are trying to make sense of hundreds of other Enron-related entities with=
 names like Braveheart, Rawhide and Bobcat. The big question: Which, if any=
, may contain LJM-like problems?=20

WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey K. Skilling, who unexpectedly quit as Enron Corp. chi=
ef executive in August, has agreed to testify next week before Congress, a =
Senate subcommittee chairman said Thursday.=20
Congressional investigators are eager to hear from Skilling, who has denied=
 any wrongdoing in the events leading to the energy company's Chapter 11 ba=
nkruptcy filing Dec. 2.
But another Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, wrote to Enron Chairman Ke=
nneth L. Lay in August that Skilling had been warned about the company's pr=
oblems by other executives, including former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxt=
er, who died last week in an apparent suicide.=20
"Skilling is critical," said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs the =
Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs.=20
The committee also has asked for the testimony of fired Enron Chief Financi=
al Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who allegedly set up many of the off-the-books=
 partnerships that were instrumental in the company's collapse. Fastow has =
not responded to the committee, Dorgan said.=20
A spokeswoman for Skilling confirmed that he had agreed to testify voluntar=
ily and would do so without a grant of immunity.=20
"He wants to be open and forthcoming with all committees investigating this=
 matter," Judy Leon said.=20
Exactly when and where Skilling will testify next week is unclear. He is li=
sted as a witness at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing Thursday=
. Dorgan's committee and others among the dozen congressional panels invest=
igating the Enron collapse also are seeking his testimony.=20
"There are competing invitations, and that is complicating the scheduling,"=
 Leon said.=20
Lay, who replaced Skilling as chief executive and was ousted from that posi=
tion last week, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan's committee Monday.=
=20
Dorgan said both men are likely to say Enron's collapse was due to circumst=
ances beyond their control, but that his panel was prepared to counter such=
 claims with internal documents showing that Enron's board of directors kne=
w about the partnerships.=20
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed on various oc=
casions the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals,"=
 Dorgan said.=20
In other developments, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) called on House Spea=
ker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to be the "gatekeeper" in determining whethe=
r immunity is granted to witnesses in the Enron investigation and what docu=
ments are made public.=20
Complaining about leaks of documents that damaged other cases, Miller wrote=
 Hastert: "The failure to honor confidentiality, the untimely release of in=
formation or the inappropriate granting of immunity all have great potentia=
l to compromise and undermine [potential] criminal prosecutions of Enron an=
d [accounting firm] Arthur Andersen."=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion to provide her with a list of all meetings and phone calls that took =
place between Enron executives and FERC commissioners.=20
"Every day more and more alarming information is revealed concerning Enron'=
s role in prolonging the California electricity crisis," she said in a lett=
er to FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III.=20
The FERC said this week that it would investigate allegations that Enron us=
ed its market clout to artificially inflate long-term electricity prices on=
 the West Coast. On Thursday, at a FERC-sponsored conference in New York on=
 power supplies in the Northeast, Wood told Reuters news service that its i=
nquiry had begun.=20
In a letter to Wood on Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis urged FERC to expedite the=
 inquiry and expand it to include other energy marketers.=20
"California has a special interest in getting to the bottom of such charges=
, since this state bore the brunt of the marketers' price gouging," Davis w=
rote.

At Lay hearings, lawmakers out to lift 'shroud of secrecy'=20
By JULIE MASON=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers signaled Thursday that their questioning of former =
Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay on Capitol Hill next week is likely to be conf=
rontational when he delivers his first public explanation of the company's =
collapse.=20
Congressional investigators want to know how Enron executives were able to =
cash out millions of dollars in company stock while employees saw their ret=
irement savings wiped out.=20
The so-called "lockdown," which prevented employees from selling stock, and=
 Enron's use of partnerships to shield its debt also are among issues lawma=
kers want to pursue.=20
In negotiating Lay's Monday appearances before the Senate Commerce and the =
House Financial Services committees, his attorneys did not seek immunity or=
 any restrictions on what he could say, lawmakers and Lay's attorney said T=
hursday.=20
"The shroud of secrecy that has surrounded so much of what this corporation=
 has done shall not be allowed to stand," said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a=
 member of the Senate Commerce Committee, where Lay is to testify first.=20
Lawmakers are complaining that Enron is not cooperating with requests for i=
nformation.=20
"Every day it becomes more clear that this corporation resorted to a variet=
y of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the=
 American public in the dark," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also a member o=
f the Senate committee.=20
Dorgan said the committee has repeatedly asked Enron to provide information=
 about the estimated 3,000 related partnerships the company had on its book=
s.=20
"To date, the corporation has provided no information to the committee abou=
t these partnerships," Dorgan said. "We have sent a second letter to the co=
rporation asking for that information, and again they are failing to cooper=
ate."=20
Bob Bennett, attorney for Enron in Washington, said Dorgan is mistaken.=20
"I am terribly disappointed he would say that because we have been fully co=
operative with them," Bennett said. "There have been some documents they as=
ked for that we did not have dealing with these partnerships, nor would we =
be expected to have them."=20
The disputed documents, according to Bennett, involve independent partnersh=
ips and records that Enron does not have.=20
Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy was the largest in corporate history. The collaps=
e of the company cost thousands of employees their jobs and wiped out most =
of their retirement accounts, much of which were tied up in Enron stock.=20
Lawmakers want to know when Lay became aware of the company's financial pro=
blems, and whether executives hid Enron's true financial picture from emplo=
yees and investors.=20
"We know for example that bankruptcy didn't treat everyone alike, we know t=
here are some who made millions while others lost their life savings," Dorg=
an said. "We also know that this corporation created off-the-books partners=
hips in a very aggressive way, thousands of them, with strange-sounding nam=
es but even stranger architecture in terms of how they were created."=20
Wyden compared the conduct of Enron executives to captains on a rapidly-sin=
king ship.=20
"They locked the workers down there in the boiler room," Wyden said.=20
The House and Senate hearings set for Monday are among at least 10 congress=
ional investigations under way into the collapse of the one-time energy gia=
nt.=20
In addition to Lay, witnesses before the House committee Monday will includ=
e Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino and Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission.=20
Since Enron's troubles first garnered national attention months ago, Lay, w=
ho resigned as chairman last week, has remained publicly silent as various =
investigations unfolded into possible malfeasance at the company.=20
Last week, Lay's wife, Linda, discussed the couple's troubles on a televisi=
on morning show.=20
Dorgan said the Senate committee has a tentative agreement with Enron's for=
mer chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, to testify at a later date.=20
The committee also has tried to arrange for testimony from Andrew Fastow, f=
ormer chief financial for Enron, with no success.=20
"We, in my judgment, will have to hear from Mr. Fastow, the question is how=
," Dorgan said. "At this point we have had no response at all from register=
ed letters we've sent."=20
Skilling and Fastow, central figures in the free fall at Enron, are both sc=
heduled to testify next week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee=
's subcommittee on oversight and investigation.=20
Dorgan said that more than 40 boxes of documents previously submitted by En=
ron to the committee contain notes from meetings of the Enron board of dire=
ctors.=20
The Washington Post on Thursday reported that Enron's board received detail=
ed briefings and signed off on the use of related partnerships, dating back=
 at least four years.=20
Dorgan declined to provide significant details about the documents his comm=
ittee received.=20
"It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed, on various o=
ccasions, the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals=
. But I think you will hear more about that in the hearings," Dorgan said.=
=20
The controversial partnerships are a key element in the investigation of En=
ron's collapse because the company used the vehicles to shield its debt and=
 appear more profitable.=20
President Bush, whose administration has come under scrutiny for its close =
ties to Lay and Enron, made an indirect reference to the controversy Thursd=
ay.=20
Speaking of the need for a "responsibility culture," he said companies must=
 be honest in their financial reporting.=20
"Let's make sure when you account for losses and profits that you put it al=
l on your books so everybody understands," Bush said in Atlanta.=20
In addition to questions about the partnerships, Wyden said lawmakers will =
have questions about Enron's foray into California energy markets, and part=
icularly whether Enron manipulated markets on the West Coast.=20
"The common culprit in my view has been secrecy and a lack of cooperation f=
rom this company," Wyden said. "It is now high time for Congress to flip on=
 the light and get to the bottom of this situation."=20

 Washington lawyer representing Enron, said of the partnerships. "We do not=
 have control over those documents. They are separate entities."
Bennett made his statement after Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) held a news =
conference criticizing Enron for failing to provide congressional investiga=
tors on the Senate Commerce Committee with the names of investors and other=
 information about the partnerships. The committee is holding hearings Mond=
ay at which former Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay is expected to give his fi=
rst public account of the company's collapse. Lay was not granted immunity =
from prosecution in exchange for his testimony, officials said.=20
"I know that Enron has some records about these entities or that would be m=
alfeasance," Dorgan said. "Essentially they are just stalling."=20
Dorgan said he thinks Enron created more than 3,000 partnerships, known as =
special-purpose entities. Written minutes from meetings of the company's bo=
ard of directors suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's g=
rowth strategy and show that they were regularly reviewed by the board.=20
The partnerships are a major focus of investigators trying fathom what led =
to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, which came less than a month after Enr=
on disclosed that since 1997 financial statements audited by the big accoun=
ting firm Arthur Andersen had overstated Enron's profits by almost $600 mil=
lion and understated its debts by more than $1 billion.=20
A dozen congressional committees, as well as the Justice Department and the=
 Securities and Exchange Commission, are probing Enron's demise, which cost=
 investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is w=
hether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partner=
ships run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
Dorgan said that as of yesterday evening, Fastow has failed to respond to r=
epeated requests to testify before the senator's subcommittee. He said that=
 Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, has said he will appe=
ar, but not on Monday.=20
Fastow and Skilling are scheduled to appear before the House Energy and Com=
merce subcommittee on oversight and investigations next Thursday. Two other=
 former Enron executives and one board member are also expected to testify.=
 The subcommittee has subpoenaed another former executive, Michael Kopper. =
Kopper handled financial transactions at Enron and headed at least two off-=
the-books partnerships.=20
Skilling resigned in August. Fastow was ousted in October. When it was then=
 disclosed that Fastow made $30 million running partnerships with names suc=
h as LJM, Raptor and Jedi, Lay announced that the board was setting up a co=
mmittee to investigate.=20
Enron board member William C. Powers Jr. chairs that special committee and =
is expected to testify Monday before the House Financial Services Committee=
. The Powers special committee is about to release a report on its findings=
.=20
Bennett has said that while Enron's board of directors was aware that speci=
al-purpose entities were being set up, there was "a great deal of informati=
on regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of=
 directors."=20
Asked about the report yesterday, Bennett said he doesn't know when it will=
 come out or what will be in it.=20
In December, Dorgan's subcommittee sent a letter to Enron requesting "the n=
umber of partnerships, the investors in the partnerships and a range of inf=
ormation about these 'off the books' partnerships," Dorgan said. "To date t=
he corporation has provided no information to the committee about these par=
tnerships."=20
In response, Bennett said, "I think that's grossly unfair, and I'm sorry th=
e senator would say that. I wish the senator had called me. I can only assu=
me he's terribly misinformed. We're cooperating fully with this committee a=
nd the dozen others that have contacted us." But, he said, the company can'=
t produce documents it has no control over.=20
Dorgan called that explanation "implausible."=20
As to whether board members knew the names of investors in the partnerships=
, W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, referred questi=
ons to the company.=20
The names of the investors in one partnership, LJM2 Capital Management LP, =
were disclosed in a court filing by Alpine Investment Partners, the lead pl=
aintiff in a suit against the partnership, Bloomberg News reported. About 9=
0 employees of Merrill Lynch invested a total of $16 million in the partner=
ship. Merrill had been hired by Enron to raise money for the fund. Other in=
vestors listed in the document include units of American International Grou=
p, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Travelers Insurance Co., the Arkansa=
s Teachers Retirement System, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fo=
undation.=20
Meanwhile, a group of students and alumni has asked Harvard University to r=
eview its ties to Enron and questioned whether Enron board member Herbert W=
inokur broke insider-trading laws as a member of the board that oversees Ha=
rvard's investments. A report by the group questions whether Harvard made a=
s much as $50 million through investments managed by Highfields Capital at =
a time when Enron stock began falling. "Mr. Winokur had no involvement in H=
ighfields Capital, and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to short-sell=
 Enron stock is just plain wrong," Eggleston said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE INVESTIGATION
Senator Says Enron Refuses To Cooperate
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Enron has refused to turn over to a Senate panel rec=
ords of controversial partnerships that are crucial to understanding the co=
mpany's downfall, the panel's chairman said today.=20
The chairman, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, said that despite repeated requests,=
 Enron continued to refuse to turn over records of 3,000 partnerships. Inve=
stigators say Enron used the arrangements to bolster the company's financia=
l statements while hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.
''They just simply have not cooperated,'' Mr. Dorgan said, adding that ''th=
e shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has don=
e will not be allowed to stand.'' But he did not say whether the committee =
was considering a subpoena.=20
Mr. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the consumer affairs=
 subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said lawyers for Kenneth L.=
 Lay, Enron's former chairman and chief executive, assured his staff on Wed=
nesday that Mr. Lay would appear on Monday to testify before Congress. His =
lawyers have not sought immunity for the testimony, Mr. Dorgan said.=20
Mr. Dorgan also said another former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skill=
ing, had agreed to testify in coming weeks. But he said the company's forme=
r chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who Enron says made more than =
$30 million from his dealings with the partnerships, has not responded to r=
epeated registered letters asking him to testify. A spokesman for Mr. Fasto=
w declined comment today.=20
Late today, another Congressional committee investigating Enron's downfall,=
 the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said both Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fa=
stow would testify next Thursday, along with Enron's chief accounting offic=
er, Richard A. Causey; its chief risk officer, Richard B. Buy; and the boar=
d of directors' audit committee chairman, Robert K. Jaedicke. A former Enro=
n executive who was involved in the partnerships, Michael Kopper, has also =
been subpoenaed to appear.=20
A lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, disputed Mr. Dorgan's characterizati=
on of the company's cooperation, saying the senator had been ''terribly mis=
informed.''=20
''We have been fully cooperative with that committee,'' Mr. Bennett said. '=
'There are some documents that the committee would like to get that we have=
 no access to and no control over, and I believe that may be what is raisin=
g this issue. But he is getting bad information.''=20
At the Senate hearing on Monday morning, Mr. Lay, who was ousted from his j=
ob by Enron's creditors last week, is expected to testify that important de=
tails of the partnerships and investments were kept from him and the board.=
=20
Many investigators doubt his claims of ignorance, and Mr. Lay may be presse=
d about why he sold millions of dollars of Enron stock last year even as he=
 promoted the value of the shares to Wall Street and his own employees. Min=
utes of Enron board meetings also show that Mr. Lay was present when the pa=
rtnerships were discussed. Mr. Lay's lawyer, Earl J. Silbert, declined comm=
ent today, but in the past he has said that Mr. Lay was disposing of stock =
last year to pay down loans outside the company and that the sales did not =
reflect any doubts about Enron's future.=20
Today, Mr. Dorgan said investigators had received 41 boxes of materials fro=
m Enron, which he declined to characterize. But he did say it was clear tha=
t members of the company's board had a fair degree of knowledge about the d=
eals.=20
Some people involved in the Congressional investigations had thought Mr. La=
y was unlikely to testify before first reviewing a long-awaited report by a=
 special committee of Enron directors into the company's deals with the par=
tnerships.=20
People close to the company said the report was expected to be finished som=
etime over the weekend. Before being released publicly, the report would ha=
ve to be approved by the special committee and then have to be reviewed by =
the full board.=20
The report is likely to draw distinctions about how much various people at =
Enron, including board members, Mr. Lay and other executives, knew concerni=
ng the partnerships, and how much responsibility various officials bear, a =
person close to the matter said. The report may also say board committees h=
ad differing levels of information about the deals, this person said.=20
In an interview today, Mr. Dorgan said he intended to spend a lot of time d=
uring the hearing delving into details about the partnerships. But he said =
it was ''pretty hard to limit inquiries in circumstances like this.''=20
''I expect there will be attention to virtually all of the areas: 401(k) pl=
ans, insider trading, partnership construction, a whole series of things.''=
=20
Enron, he added, has said that some partnership information does not techni=
cally belong to the company and that as a result it does not have all that =
information. But, Mr. Dorgan said, ''in many cases, they own 97 percent of =
the partnerships,'' so they should be able to get it.=20
William C. Powers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, w=
ho is chairman of the Enron special committee preparing the report, decline=
d to discuss the timing of the report's release or to give details. He woul=
d not even disclose whether he would be testifying before Congress next wee=
k, even though he is scheduled to do so.=20
Mr. Powers said the work of the committee he heads ''is not precluding any =
other investigation from going forward with investigation, charges, punishm=
ent, whatever.'' The report, he said, will stand on its own, and ''governme=
nt agencies can build on that if they find it useful.''=20
People at the law school said Mr. Powers was outraged at a suggestion publi=
shed today in The Washington Post that he would be taking part in a concert=
ed defense of Enron in his testimony before Congress. Mr. Powers has conten=
ded from the beginning of his investigation that his role is to produce an =
impartial report.=20
Mr. Powers has come under fire from advocacy groups and from the local news=
paper, The Austin American-Statesman, over accusations that his impartialit=
y is compromised by the close ties between the University of Texas, and Enr=
on and the law firms that have represented the company, especially Vinson &=
 Elkins.=20
The critics have said that the appearance of a conflict of interest is so g=
reat that Mr. Powers should not have taken on the assignment.=20
''Dean Powers is a nice guy and a great professor, but unfortunately, looki=
ng at the facts, he has multiple apparent conflicts that, rightly or wrongl=
y, cast a shadow on this report,'' said Cristen Feldman, a lawyer for Texan=
s for Public Justice, a group that tracks campaign contributions in the sta=
te.=20
In other Enron-related developments today, Representative George Miller, De=
mocrat of California, asked that no witness in the House's various Enron he=
arings be given immunity without approval from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a=
 Republican.=20
Separately, the General Accounting Office, which is preparing to sue the Wh=
ite House to obtain records of meetings of executives at Enron and other en=
ergy companies with administration officials working on Vice President Dick=
 Cheney's energy task force last spring, said it had hired the law firm of =
Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood.=20
In addition, Senators Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of=
 the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee's se=
nior Republican, sent letters to the United States Export-Import Bank, the =
Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Agenc=
y requesting information on what help the federal agencies had given Enron.=
 The committee is preparing for hearings into the company later.=20
The chairman of an accounting ethics board, meanwhile, reaffirmed the board=
's decision to disband in light of the sketchy proposals by the Securities =
and Exchange Commission to restructure disciplinary rules. The chairman, Ch=
arles A. Bowsher, had announced that the Public Oversight Board would resig=
n as a group partly in protest of the proposals by Harvey L. Pitt, the comm=
ission's chairman.=20

Probe likely to blame former execs=20
Skilling, Fastow, auditors to be cited in report=20

Enron Corp.'s internal probe of partnerships that helped bring the company =
down will likely focus the blame on former executives Jeff Skilling and And=
y Fastow and the company's auditors, say sources familiar with the investig=
ation.=20
The report, expected to be released this weekend, will probably say the two=
 and the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen failed to give Enron's board of=
 directors adequate information on the nature of the partnerships.=20
Though Enron has acknowledged the board approved the formation of the partn=
erships and many of the deals, officials say the report will claim vital de=
tails were withheld.=20
The leader of the investigation, William Powers, dean of the University of =
Texas School of Law, is expected to testify before the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee Tuesday.=20
One source critical of the board said the directors were trying to deflect =
the blame.=20
"It's like blaming a roofer for cracks in the foundation of your house," th=
e source said.=20
Enron's internal investigation began in late October shortly after the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission started a formal investigation of off-balanc=
e-sheet partnerships formed by Fastow, then the chief financial officer. Th=
e partnerships enlisted outside investors to buy Enron assets as a means of=
 helping the company artificially keep its debt level low and earnings high=
.=20
Mistakes in the reporting of some transactions with two partnerships, LJM-C=
ayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, forced the company to restate 4 1/2 years of =
earnings, including a reduction in reported profit by $586 million and add =
$2.5 billion in debt to its books.=20
In November, the internal committee determined that Fastow and other employ=
ees had profited from investments in the partnerships. Those employees were=
 fired.=20
The report will be the first official word from the committee since then. A=
t the insistence of creditors, it will be posted on Web sites of Enron and =
the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York.=20
Enron officials declined comment on the report, as did representatives for =
Fastow and Skilling.=20
An Andersen spokesman said Enron officials simply made some bad business de=
cisions and are trying to blame the auditors.=20
"The notion that the leaders on the board were not aware of these issues is=
 absolutely implausible," said Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton. "These we=
re sophisticated people with sophisticated business advisers."=20
Patrick McGurn with Institutional Shareholders Services, a company that adv=
ises shareholders on corporate governance issues, said Enron's board may ha=
ve a valid argument if it can show it didn't know enough details to assess =
the risk involved.=20
"There's a question as to who had the ability to see the big picture, if th=
e board was so compartmentalized that they could only know one part of it a=
t a time," McGurn said.=20
It's not unusual for boards to see only summaries of very complicated deals=
 and issues, McGurn said.=20
"But even if all of this is true, it still means either the board wasn't di=
ligent enough, it willingly went along with something that was wrong, or th=
ey were just stupid," he said.=20
It's not clear if the report will also criticize Enron's longtime law firm,=
 Vinson & Elkins. The firm did not help set up the LJM partnerships, but wa=
s asked to look into concerns raised by Enron executive Sherron Watkins in =
a now well-known October 2001 memo to Lay and the board.=20
In an Oct. 15 letter to Enron general counsel James Derrick, V&E's Max Hend=
rick addressed some of those concerns, including the potential for conflict=
s of interest in Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and chief partner in the =
LJM partnerships, and the board's waiver of its code of ethics in meetings =
on June 28, 1999, and Oct. 11, 1999, to allow him to run the partnerships.=
=20
The letter concluded that -- based on its interviews -- no outside counsel =
or auditors were needed to investigate the issues further. Hendrick did say=
, however, that "bad cosmetics" on the LJM partnerships and its investments=
 in certain Enron technology and communications assets, coupled with the po=
or financial performance of those assets, could lead to a "serious risk of =
adverse publicity and litigation."=20
The day after the letter was written, Enron began to unwind those investmen=
ts with LJM.=20
The fact that the code of ethics was waived to allow Fastow to run LJM is f=
urther indication that the board should have been more vigilant, said McGur=
n.=20
McGurn and other observers are already questioning the impartiality of the =
investigation, given that many board members who approved parts of LJM are =
involved. But the presence of William McLucas, the former director of the S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission's division of enforcement, on the committ=
ee as general counsel will lend it more credibility, said one source.=20
"Lucas is a notorious hard-ass," said the source, who asked not to be ident=
ified. "So I can't imagine he'll go too soft on anyone."=20

Few of Lay Family's Real-Estate Assets Are on the Market, Listing Records S=

Earlier this week, Linda P. Lay, the wife of former Enron Corp. Chairman Ke=
nneth L. Lay, told a national television audience that nearly everything th=
e couple owns is for sale as they struggle with a personal financial crisis=
.=20
But few of the couple's vast real-estate holdings are on the market, accord=
ing to Multiple Listing Service records.
Altogether, Mr. and Mrs. Lay own real estate valued at more than $30 millio=
n in Texas and Colorado, according to local tax records. They own 18 proper=
ties in Houston, Galveston, Texas, and Aspen, Colo., according to real-esta=
te records. But only two of the properties, vacation homes in the resort to=
wn of Aspen, are being offered for sale.=20
On NBC's "Today," Mrs. Lay described the couple's plight in the wake of the=
 Enron bankruptcy as a fight for liquidity because most of their wealth was=
 tied up in Enron stock, now nearly worthless. "Other than the home we live=
 in, everything we own is for sale," she said.=20
The comments stirred a torrent of criticism in Houston, where about 4,000 E=
nron employees have seen their jobs and stock holdings evaporate. Belo Corp=
.'s Houston television station, KHOU, reported that the couple's Houston an=
d Galveston properties didn't show any sign of being for sale.=20
The family's Houston-based investment office didn't return a call requestin=
g clarification. According to tax and real-estate records, the Lays live in=
 a Houston penthouse valued at $7.1 million and continue to hold a home nea=
r Aspen's riverfront valued at $4.1 million, as well as property valued at =
$2.1 million. Two other homes, valued at more than $6.1 million each, were =
listed with an Aspen real-estate firm on Nov. 12, two weeks before Enron fi=
led for bankruptcy. Mr. Lay also sold a third of his stock in Compaq Comput=
er Corp. at the end of October, two months before resigning from its board.=
=20
However, Mr. Lay has retained significant stock holdings in Compaq, Eli Lil=
ly & Co. and other companies where he once served as a director. Those shar=
es are currently valued at more than $10 million.=20
Still, along with Enron, the Lays have seen some investments sour. Through =
private partnerships, they are the largest individual investors in a strugg=
ling Houston online company that has cut its work force four times in the p=
ast year.=20
The Lays invested between $18 million and $20 million out of the more than =
$150 million that Questia raised since its inception in 1998, according to =
people close to the firm.=20
Questia sells access to online books to college students for $20 a month. I=
nvestors say it has fallen far short of its original goal of recruiting 10%=
 of the 14 million U.S. college students to sign up for its service.=20
Last month, Questia cut its work force to just 28 employees from 300 a year=
 ago. A spokesman said recently the job cuts would enable the company to co=
ntinue operations while it seeks new investors. While Mr. Lay has resigned =
his seats on the boards of Compaq, Eli Lilly and i2 Technologies, he remain=
s on the board of Questia, according to the company.

Enron Report Ties the Company's Ruin To Executives Who Formed Partnerships
A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

02/01/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A much-anticipated report on an internal investigation into the collapse of=
 energy company Enron Corp. is expected to point fingers at former and curr=
ent Enron executives who were behind the questionable partnerships that led=
 to the company's ruin, congressional aides said.=20
The report, which may be released as early as this weekend, also is expecte=
d to outline the failure of internal controls at the company, the aides sai=
d.
The report is already being denounced by some defense lawyers and others ca=
ught in the widening probe of Enron's collapse. They are raising questions =
about conflicts of interest, and they fear the report will deflect blame fr=
om Enron's board onto former Enron executives or Arthur Andersen LLP, its f=
ormer auditor.=20
In an interview yesterday, William Powers Jr. -- the University of Texas la=
w school dean who joined Enron's board in October and heads a committee of =
outside directors that is conducting the investigation -- declined to comme=
nt on the report. "We will file the report when it's ready and then we will=
 comment on it," he said. Mr. Powers is scheduled to testify at a congressi=
onal hearing into the Enron collapse Tuesday.=20
Mr. Powers, chairman of the special committee, had ties to Enron executives=
 and its law firm, Vinson & Elkins, and helped raise millions of dollars fr=
om them for the University of Texas, the defense lawyers and other said. Mr=
. Powers serves on the university Capital Campaign Committee, and Enron has=
 given $3 million to the university, and more than $250,000 to the law scho=
ol, since Mr. Powers became dean in 1998. In addition, Vinson & Elkins endo=
wed a chair at the law school.=20
Critics of the expected report also point out that other Enron directors on=
 the special committee approved the transactions that they are now reviewin=
g. The Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 2 that the board explicitly approv=
ed the structure of the partnerships now under scrutiny.=20
The company announced the formation of the special committee in the fall, j=
ust as the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation in=
to partnerships used by Enron to move debt off its books.=20
The special committee's other two members are Raymond Troubh, a New York fi=
nancial consultant named to Enron's board in late November; and Herbert S. =
Winokur, a director since 1985 and chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings I=
nc., a private investment company. Mr. Winokur also was chairman of the boa=
rd's finance committee, which recommended that the board suspend the compan=
y's ethics code so former company treasurer, Andrew Fastow, could run a par=
tnership.=20
The committee retained William McLucas, a former SEC enforcement chief who =
left after 22 years to join the Washington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutle=
r & Pickering, to advise the committee. Mr. McLucas, 51, was known as a no-=
nonsense securities cop in the eight years he served as the SEC's top law-e=
nforcement officer.=20
Enron has said its dealings with the Fastow partnerships were legal and pro=
perly disclosed to investors. According to Enron filings with the SEC, the =
company did deals involving billions of dollars of assets and Enron stock w=
ith entities related to the Fastow partnerships. Internal partnership docum=
ents indicate that Mr. Fastow and possibly others made millions of dollars =
from the partnerships.=20
The committee is expected to present the report to Enron's full board of di=
rectors, then to the official committee of unsecured creditors in Enron's b=
ankruptcy-court proceeding, according to someone familiar with the process.=
 It will then be filed publicly in federal bankruptcy court in New York.=20
Asked when Enron planned to file the report with the court, Martin Bienenst=
ock of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said, "W=
e hope next week."

Executive Privilege
Enron's Top Dogs Still Flying Luxury Jets

By Brian Ross  <http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/2020/ross_brian_bio.htm=
l>
=20


Jan. 31 - Enron executives and lawyers appear to be going bankrupt in style=
, traveling to bankruptcy court hearings in New York in the company's two r=
emaining private jets.=20


An Enron spokesperson has confirmed a total of eight corporate jet trips to=
 New York and Washington since the bankruptcy, saying the flights were more=
 efficient than commercial travel.=20
A round-trip commercial flight, Houston to New York, could be as little as =
$365 in coach. According to aviation executives, the same trip on an Enron =
jet would cost tens of thousands of dollars.=20
The Enron executives seen leaving the airport Wednesday used the corporate =
jet to attend the funeral of J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron executive w=
ho committed suicide on Jan. 25. Enron says that is the only nonbusiness tr=
ip since the bankruptcy.=20
"Of course I have sympathy for the Baxter family, but for them to use the c=
orporate jets to fly the total corporate entity to any function at this poi=
nt again seems arrogant," said Rod Jordan, a former employee and chairman o=
f the Severed Enron Employees Coalition.=20
Former Employees Outraged=20
Laid-off Enron employees, who stood in line today for $1,000 checks from a =
group collecting donations and returned political contributions, were outra=
ged to hear the luxury jets were still in the air.=20
"This is atrocious," said former Enron employee Cindy Cicchetti. "What's wr=
ong with coach? That's what I fly."=20
The luxury private jets were part of the Enron culture created by its forme=
r chairman and CEO, Kenneth Lay.=20
Not only did Lay use his $45 million jet for business, but he regularly use=
d it for strictly personal trips for him and his family, at a cost of $334,=
000 in the year 2000 alone.=20
Months before the bankruptcy, Lay defended the personal trips. When asked w=
hat kind of message it sends to the rest of the company, he responded, "Wel=
l, I think it gives my senior people something to aspire to."=20
Enron says Lay's favorite jet has already been sold, and that the remaining=
 two jets are for sale.=20

RICHMOND, Va. -- A top Enron Corp. executive has admitted he gave poor advi=
ce to students at his alma mater who lost nearly $12,000 in University of R=
ichmond endowment money invested in Enron stock.=20
Jeffrey McMahon, who was promoted to president and chief operating officer =
at Enron this week, said he hadn't foreseen the company's collapse. In an i=
nterview with the university's newspaper, however, he acknowledged that he =
had long been a critic of Enron's use of secretive partnerships, a practice=
 that contributed to the company's downfall.=20
McMahon, who graduated from the university in 1982, visited the school Sept=
. 20 and Oct. 18, meeting with students and giving enthusiastic accounts of=
 his company's prospects even as its stock was slumping.=20
On Nov. 2, a student group that manages a small portion of the university's=
 endowment fund bought $12,771 worth of Enron stock. At the time, Enron cos=
t $11.61 a share. In late November, Enron's stock crashed, and when the gro=
up sold their investment shares were trading at 83 cents. They got back jus=
t $913.=20
"The students said he was just so enthusiastic about the company," accounti=
ng professor Joe Hoyle told the newspaper, The Collegian. "Why would a guy =
who had a whole lot of knowledge of Enron's finances go to his alma mater a=
nd be so enthusiastic ... when you can just keep your mouth shut?"=20
Student fund manager Devin Weisleder told the newspaper, "After listening t=
o him for an hour, you want to go out and drop 10 grand to buy the stock."=
=20
In his copyright interview with The Collegian, McMahon said he was unaware =
the investment was made on his recommendation, but conceded, "In hindsight,=
 that probably wasn't good advice."=20
"The stock suffered a precipitous fall that no one could have expected," he=
 said. "I was running an operating division at the time, responsible for pa=
per and steel. I had little knowledge of the financials of the company," he=
 was quoted as saying.=20
McMahon was mentioned in an internal memo, written in August by Sherron Smi=
th Watkins and made public earlier this month, critical of Enron's secretiv=
e partnerships.=20
"I expressed concerns about partnerships in 1999," McMahon told the newspap=
er. "(Watkins) was referring (in her memo) to conversations I had internall=
y relating to those concerns and possible conflicts of interest."=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December and laid off thousands of workers. T=
he filing came after weeks of revelations that executives had concocted com=
plicated partnerships that let Enron keep $500 million in debt off its book=

Mighty J.P. Morgan in the Hot Seat Banking: Charges of collusion with Enron=
 and its recent hefty losses raise questions about firm's judgment.

In the rubble of recent financial collapses, one prestigious institution se=
ems especially vulnerable: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the nation's second-lar=
gest bank.=20
The New York company, a lead lender to Enron Corp., Kmart Corp. and telecom=
munications firm Global Crossing Ltd., is at risk of losing billions in dea=
lings with bankrupt firms, as well as losing heavily in Argentina's economi=
c meltdown.
J.P. Morgan also lost $1.1 billion last year on its stakes in businesses, i=
ncluding many ailing technology companies, and is accused by insurers of he=
lping Enron conceal vast losses. Morgan strongly disputes the charge, but t=
he allegation, coupled with the hefty losses, raises questions about the ju=
dgment of an institution that traces its roots back more than 200 years.=20
The bank's woes, accompanied by sizable losses on loans at many other finan=
cial giants, also reveal chinks in a banking industry generally regarded as=
 a pillar for the nation's recovery from an economic slowdown and from Sept=
. 11.=20
J.P. Morgan fares badly in comparison with big competitors such as Citigrou=
p Inc., the largest U.S. banking concern, and Bank of America Inc., the thi=
rd-largest. Despite their huge losses in Argentina, Enron and other corpora=
te collapses, Citigroup earned $4 billion and BofA posted a profit of $2 bi=
llion in the fourth quarter, bolstered in part by robust consumer lending.=
=20
Morgan, by contrast, lost $332million in the fourth quarter, compared with =
a $708-million profit a year earlier. For the year, the company still earne=
d $1.6 billion.=20
Wall Street's skittishness over projected losses at J.P. Morgan has been ap=
parent in the steady stock sell-off in recent weeks after a "continuing par=
ade of train wrecks," in the words of analyst E. Reilly Tierney at Fox-Pitt=
 Kelton in New York.=20
The stock, which traded above $40 early in December, hovered near $32 this =
week before closing Thursday at $34.05, up 99 cents a share, on the New Yor=
k Stock Exchange.=20
Some analysts remain bullish on Morgan, saying the institution is fundament=
ally sound and the financial setbacks are only temporary. And by some indus=
try measures, J.P. Morgan's financials look sturdy. A key ratio of nonperfo=
rming assets to total assets, for example, was just 0.87% as of Dec. 31, we=
ll below the 2% figure regarded as a sign of potential trouble.=20
Investors' concerns surfaced in December after Enron's bankruptcy, when J.P=
. Morgan, which had a reputation for usually disclosing bad news promptly a=
nd completely, suddenly tripled its estimate of its potential Enron losses,=
 to $2.6 billion.=20
Nearly $1 billion of the total stemmed from insurers' refusals to pay Enron=
-related claims on unfulfilled energy contracts. The insurers contended in =
a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York that the losses resulted from =
J.P. Morgan's setting up "sham" offshore energy trading concerns to do busi=
ness with Enron.=20
J.P. Morgan contends its energy trading companies were above board, adding =
that--unlike Enron--it included the results on its balance sheets.=20
The bank also says the hefty loan losses from the mammoth bankruptcies are =
a result of J.P. Morgan's position as the leading arranger of the biggest c=
redit lines to the biggest businesses. These so-called syndicated loans are=
 carved up and shared by dozens of banks.=20
"We're handling 40% of the syndicated loans, and when companies go down we =
tend to be exposed," said J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau.=20
But other banks in the syndicates typically take on responsibility for more=
 than 90% of the amounts lent. Though J.P. Morgan arranged $1.6 billion in =
credit lines for Kmart, for example, it had just $117 million in unsecured =
loans when the retailer filed for bankruptcy last month. Likewise, though J=
.P. Morgan had helped arrange $2.25 billion in loans for Global Crossing, i=
t's now owed less than $100 million by the telecom firm, according to peopl=
e close to the situation. And while J.P. Morgan still has a $500-million ex=
posure to Argentina, Citigroup and FleetBoston have far more.=20
Indeed, only about 10% of J.P. Morgan's earnings come from lending these da=
ys, compared with 50% a decade ago, Lemkau said, meaning its comparative cr=
edit risk exposure actually has declined dramatically.=20
Still, there's no denying the bank's missteps, which include an 8% stake in=
 an Argentine bank accused of fraud, and loans to a European cable TV compa=
ny that has threatened to default on $17.5 billion in debt.=20
Prospects looked far brighter at the end of 2000, when J.P. Morgan Chase & =
Co. emerged in its current manifestation via the colossal merger of Chase M=
anhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co.=20
After deregulation tore down walls separating banks, brokerages and insurer=
s, the idea was to compete better with Citigroup--itself formed in the merg=
er of Citicorp and Travelers Group--by selling more services to clients. Th=
e newly formed giant hoped especially to persuade companies with bank loans=
 to use J.P. Morgan's investment banking services, which typically are more=
 profitable than commercial lending.=20
But the technology meltdown, the recession and Sept. 11 combined to create =
the worst environment in years for stock offerings, mergers and other stapl=
es of investment banking.=20
The big question now, Tierney said, is whether J.P. Morgan failed to assess=
 credit risks properly at companies because it figured making loans was a s=
ure path to bigger profit on other services.=20
However, Lemkau said the dollar amount of corporate loans on J.P. Morgan's =
books has declined for the last three years. "It's a misconception we're le=
nding like a drunken sailor so we can get our hand on more profitable busin=
esses," she said. "It's just not true."=20
No doubt reflecting the uncertainties facing all financial institutions aft=
er Sept. 11 and the Enron meltdown, the range of expert opinions about Morg=
an is astonishingly wide.=20
Some analysts, such as Michael Mayo at Prudential Financial, have slapped "=
sell" ratings on the bank while others, such as Diana P. Yates at A.G. Edwa=
rds & Sons Inc., rate it a "strong buy."=20
Yates characterized concerns over the insurers' allegations of collusion wi=
th Enron as "overdone." She also warned against judging J.P. Morgan by its =
admittedly atrocious last quarter.=20
"They're taking some hits, but they're a big company with a $41-billion equ=
ity base. It's not like they're going out of business," she said.

Enron Bondholders Blame Brokers
By Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

02/01/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Citigroup Inc. lent money to Enron Corp. in October, when the energy compan=
y's finances were sliding. At the same time, the Wall Street giant pitched =
Enron bonds to clients as a solid investment.=20
Now, at least one institutional investor who bought the bonds is hopping ma=
d -- and has taken the beef to court.
In a suit filed recently in federal court in New York, Silvercreek Manageme=
nt Inc., a Toronto investment company that bought Enron bonds in October, a=
ccuses Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, as well as Goldman Sachs Grou=
p Inc. and Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America Securities LLC, of promo=
ting Enron securities even when they knew the company was on the brink of c=
ollapse.=20
"The brokers were calling our clients telling them that this was a wonderfu=
l opportunity to buy these instruments," says Joe Cotchett, a lawyer repres=
enting Silvercreek. "They were giving our client a sell job."=20
Citigroup, Goldman and Banc of America declined to comment.=20
The suit is one of the first to put the blame for Enron squarely on Wall St=
reet's role in facilitating Enron's deception. "Enron's investment bankers =
sold the securities which propped up the pyramid," the suit alleges. "In th=
e process, these firms earned $214 million in underwriting fees alone, and =
much more for lending, derivatives trading and merger advice."=20
But the case highlights a broader question. Did Enron's lenders have a duty=
 to their investing clients to disclose the depths of Enron's woes? Some an=
alysts say that investors should probably have known that they were buying =
securities from financial institutions who were in a position to know that =
Enron was facing dire straits. Yet Citigroup wouldn't have to disclose its =
knowledge of Enron's troubles because of lender confidentiality.=20
"When you're a bank lender, you can hide behind the confidentiality rule," =
says David Hendler, an analyst at market research firm CreditSights.=20
In its suit, Silvercreek says the three financial firms were pitching Enron=
 securities to Silvercreek as late as October, including some new bonds tha=
t would convert into Enron stock. The Canadian firm, which invested $175 mi=
llion in Enron bonds in October, says it lost $120 million and is seeking c=
ompensation and unspecified damages.=20
Sure, Enron had been through a rough patch over the summer, the Wall Street=
 sales pitch went, according to Silvercreek's lawyers. But Enron wasn't all=
 that bad off, and the bonds were selling at a sharp discount. That purport=
ed pitch was mirrored by some of the research reports the brokerage firms h=
ad released during October.=20
"We reiterate our Buy rating on Enron," an Oct. 19 Salomon Smith Barney rep=
ort on Enron said, "after untangling part of a complicated story involving =
their balance sheet."=20
Enron's story, of course, wasn't nearly so upbeat. Its balance-sheet high j=
inks caused a sudden loss of confidence, bringing about a liquidity shortag=
e so dire that Enron was forced to draw down an emergency $3 billion credit=
 line on Oct. 25, only a few days after Salomon's report. That move signale=
d Enron was running short of crucial operating capital.=20
Citigroup's lending division knew as well as anybody that Enron was facing =
trouble, since it had been one of the top banks arranging the credit line. =
Yet the brokerage companies had Enron securities in their firm's inventory =
to unload, according to the Silvercreek suit.=20
Enron had sold Wall Street firms about $1.9 billion in convertible bonds th=
at firms such as Citigroup were free to sell to investors by June of 2001, =
the court papers say. But the sales of these securities weren't going so we=
ll, Silvercreek alleges.=20
So Citigroup's brokers became increasingly aggressive in pushing the Enron =
bonds on institutional investors, Silvercreek's lawyers say. Citigroup sold=
 Silvercreek its last chunk of Enron securities on Oct. 25 -- the same day =
that Enron drew down its credit line from Citigroup.=20
Executives familiar with Citigroup thinking assert that Silvercreek should =
have known the risks of investing in Enron as well as any other investor. M=
eanwhile, the lending side knew about the problems at Enron, but the broker=
age side didn't. That is in keeping with the so-called Chinese Wall on Wall=
 Street, which seeks to separate businesses to reduce conflicts.=20
Further complicating the role of Citigroup in the dispute is that on Oct. 2=
5 -- the same day Enron drew down its credit line -- Citigroup met with oth=
er bankers to begin discussions on a new, $1 billion Enron credit line.=20
The new financing, which was announced much later, was firmly secured by co=
llateral in the form of Enron pipeline assets. Yet Citigroup effectively ro=
lled some of its existing unsecured Enron financing into the new secured cr=
edit line -- thereby shielding itself from Enron losses shortly after pushi=
ng Enron debt on to other investors.

FERC to focus on Enron's role in Calif. energy crisis=20
Bush appointed 2 Lay choices to commission=20
By PATTY REINERT=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Feb. 1, 2002, 12:21AM
WASHINGTON -- Federal energy regulators Thursday launched an investigation =
into whether Houston's embattled Enron Corp. helped prolong last year's ele=
ctricity crisis in California by unfairly manipulating wholesale power pric=
es.=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood III, a Texas Republi=
can who was appointed by President Bush last year at the behest of Enron Ch=
airman Ken Lay, confirmed that an inquiry had begun but declined to elabora=
te on its scope.=20
FERC spokeswoman Barbara Connors said Wood's decision to look into Enron's =
activities came at the request of several Western Democratic lawmakers, inc=
luding Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, Ron Wyden of=
 Oregon and Maria Cantwell of Washington. California Gov. Gray Davis, a lon=
gtime Enron critic, also requested an investigation.=20
Calls for FERC to look into Enron's business dealings in California came as=
 early as 2000 as power prices soared after the state's failed attempt to d=
eregulate its energy markets. But pressure on federal energy regulators has=
 mounted in the past month amid investigations by numerous congressional co=
mmittees, the Labor Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the =
Justice Department.=20
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the latest investig=
ation, but the company has denied any wrongdoing in the California energy c=
risis.=20
Boxer cited a 30-minute meeting that Lay, who since has left Enron, had wit=
h Vice President Dick Cheney on April 17 to discuss the California crisis. =
The senator said a memo from that meeting offers possible evidence that Enr=
on officials, who were huge financial contributors to the Bush presidential=
 campaign, influenced the administration's energy policies.=20
The eight-point memo that Lay reportedly gave Cheney during their meeting w=
as published earlier this week by the San Francisco Chronicle.=20
In it, Lay suggested that the administration "reject any attempt to re-regu=
late wholesale power markets by adopting price caps or returning to archaic=
 methods of determining the cost base of wholesale power."=20
He added that even temporary price caps would be detrimental to power marke=
ts.=20
The day after his meeting with Lay, Cheney said price caps wouldn't solve C=
alifornia's problems.=20
Boxer called the revelations "quite disturbing" and said they raise questio=
ns about whether Enron also may have tried to influence FERC directly.=20
In addition to an investigation of Enron, Boxer requested information on me=
etings and phone calls between Enron executives and FERC commissioners and =
staff between August 2000 and June 2001.=20
The FERC investigation comes one day after the General Accounting Office sa=
id it would take the unprecedented step of suing the White House in the nex=
t few weeks unless Cheney reconsiders his refusal to turn over information =
on meetings between Enron and other energy executives and the administratio=
n's energy task force.=20
Meanwhile, in an interview scheduled for broadcast tonight on PBS' Now With=
 Bill Moyers, Lay says that during a meeting at the White House he gave Bus=
h administration officials a list of candidates for seats on the five-membe=
r FERC. Of the eight names, Bush appointed two -- Wood and Nora Brownell of=
 Pennsylvania.=20
"I brought a list, we certainly presented a list. ... As I recall, I signed=
 a letter which in fact had some recommendations as to people that we thoug=
ht would be good commissioners," Lay said in the interview, which was taped=
 last May but never aired.=20
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack confirmed Thursday that Lay gave the na=
mes to Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel director.=20
Wood, who served as head of the Texas Public Utility Commission under then-=
Gov. George W. Bush, is an advocate of market-oriented utility regulation, =
an approach favored by Lay and other Enron officials.=20
Bush selected Wood for the FERC job to replace Curt Hebert, who says in ton=
ight's PBS program that he and Lay had long disagreed about issues before t=
he commission. Lay had "asked me to take certain positions, but I've had th=
ose conversations with Ken Lay for a long time -- and have disagreed with h=
im for a long time," said Hebert, a former Mississippi legislator.=20
Enron, once the world's largest energy trader, plunged into bankruptcy Dec.=
 2 after admitting it had overstated its profits by $586 million since 1997=
.=20
Lay is scheduled to testify before Congress next week as part of numerous i=
nquiries launched in the wake of Enron's collapse. Information yielded by c=
ongressional investigators so far has rekindled the ire of officials in Wes=
tern states who have long claimed Enron was at least partly to blame for th=
e region's energy woes almost two years ago.=20
"If there is any doubt in your mind about whether an investigation is warra=
nted, the latest revelations should answer that question," Davis wrote to W=
ood in a letter released Thursday. "Clearly, an investigation is needed."=
=20
Davis, a Democrat, first called on FERC to investigate allegations of marke=
t manipulation by Enron and other power generators and traders in the summe=
r of 2000.=20
By fall of that year, wholesale power prices in California had risen tenfol=
d and continued at high levels through the following spring as angry custom=
ers began to suffer through blackouts.=20
The price jump was blamed on the state's failed attempt at deregulating ele=
ctricity markets.=20
FERC eventually voted to impose price caps on electricity sold in Californi=
a. That move, along with the state's signing long-term contracts with power=
 companies to lock in prices and milder weather that spring, ended the cris=
is.=20
Blaming Enron and other marketers for the crisis, the state of California h=
as sought $9 billion in refunds for alleged overcharges. That case is pendi=
ng before a FERC administrative judge; no decision is expected for several =
months.=20

Economy
Bush to Unveil Proposals for Changing Pension Law
By Jeanne Cummings and Kathy Chen
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Workers would have more flexibility to diversify retirement a=
ccounts, senior executives would be held to the same blackout periods on st=
ock sales as rank-and-file employees, and workers could receive more indepe=
ndent investment advice under pension proposals to be unveiled by President=
 Bush today.=20
Based on the recommendations of a cabinet task force, Mr. Bush is expected =
to announce those changes and others during an appearance before congressio=
nal Republicans at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, a senior White H=
ouse official said.
The proposals stem from a three-week review of pension law commissioned by =
the president in response to the collapse of Enron Corp. As the Houston ene=
rgy-trading company spiraled toward its Dec. 2 bankruptcy, workers' retirem=
ent savings that were bottled up in frozen 401(k) accounts evaporated with =
the shrinking stock price. Some senior executives, whose holdings weren't u=
nder the same restrictions, sold off millions of dollars in stock and cashe=
d in deferred compensation accounts.=20
The White House study, conducted by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Labor =
Secretary Elaine Chao, and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, was designed to=
 provide greater protection for workers in the future and to give the presi=
dent some political cover in the scandal that involves one of his largest f=
inancial backers.=20
The proposal, which would require legislation or regulatory action before t=
aking effect, doesn't go as far as some bills supported by consumer and lab=
or organizations. But some provisions are likely to meet resistance from bu=
sinesses.=20
To give employees greater flexibility to diversify their portfolios, employ=
ers would be required to allow workers to sell employer-company stock after=
 they have participated in their 401(k) plans for three years. Many employe=
rs currently require workers to hold on to company shares, especially those=
 that are given by the employer as a "match" to employee contributions, for=
 many years, or even until retirement. Employers enjoy tax benefits for iss=
uing company stock to retirement accounts, and the practice is also cheaper=
 than making cash retirement contributions. But, in the case of a bankruptc=
y such as Enron's, the restrictions can wipe out employee nest eggs, advoca=
tes of change argue.=20
The president's package wouldn't limit the amount of employer-company stock=
 that could be held in 401(k) plans. Such caps have been proposed in legisl=
ation, including a bill introduced by Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of Cal=
ifornia and Jon Corzine of New Jersey that is supported by consumer and lab=
or groups.=20
Calling for increased access to investment advice, Mr. Bush embraced a bill=
 sponsored by Rep. John Boehner (R., Ohio) and passed by the House last yea=
r. The White House now will push for action in the Senate.=20
The Boehner bill would encourage employers to provide more investment advic=
e to their workers by shielding them from lawsuits and fiduciary responsibi=
lity for investment decisions made based on advice given by other parties. =
But the bill also would allow pension-plan managers to provide such advice,=
 a move which consumer groups say would result in a dangerous conflict of i=
nterest.=20
The National Association of Manufacturers, which is leading a coalition to =
oppose major pension changes, and other industry groups have voiced support=
 for Mr. Boehner's bill.=20
Mr. Bush's proposals also would raise the stakes for employers when they im=
pose "blackout periods" on stock trading for pension plans. Companies routi=
nely impose such periods when they are changing plan administrators, for in=
stance.=20
In addition to requiring senior executives to face the same blackout period=
s as lower-level workers, Mr. Bush is calling for a 30-day notice before a =
blackout begins. He also will recommend that employers be held responsible =
for what happens to workers' investments during the periods when their stoc=
k is frozen. Under current regulations, employers are protected from that l=
iability.

Who Were the Friends of Enron?: Michael Lewis
2002-01-31 16:25 (New York)

    Berkeley, California, Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The only people who are go=
ing to explain what happened at Enron Corp., and why, are the people who wo=
rked there. So I'm delighted to report the trickle of notes and letters fro=
m Old Enronians has become a torrent. My inbox runneth over.
     This week's pile of cards and letters offers several different kinds o=
f information. The first is the sort of colorful detail that will be useful=
 to whoever eventually makes the crummy TV movie about the energy trader's =
collapse.
     It's fun to know, for instance, that Enron's chief risk officer had a =
picture of the Titanic on the wall of his office, and that Enron's chief ac=
countant drove a Ferrari. It's even more fun to know there was plenty of se=
xual scandal in the halls at Enron, to go along with the financial one. Off=
ice affairs are common at any big company, but Enron's steamy Texas culture=
 seems to have created a particularly juicy hothouse.

Book Fodder

     The next category of information is the deeper understanding that will=
 be useful to whoever writes the respectable best-selling book about Enron.
     For the first time since the scandal broke, for example, I've read a s=
atisfying explanation for Enron's many disastrous investments in foreign as=
sets.
     As this correspondent put it, the main motive for paying ridiculously =
big sums for Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on was not =
foreign market information, or access to foreign politicians, but the need =
to be able to cover a short position.
     In its attempt to create the same sort of trading markets in developin=
g countries as it had in the U.S., Enron exposed itself to a new kind of ma=
rket risk.
     It was one thing to be caught short in U.S. natural gas, in which you =
could hedge your position on a well-established futures exchange. It was an=
other to be caught short Indian electricity. Owning the underlying physical=
 assets ensured that would never happen. (But also ensured Enron would be c=
onstitutionally long all new markets.)

Friends and FOEs

     The final category of information is the sort of corporate intrigue th=
at will be gold to the investigative reporters newly assigned to the Enron =
beat.
     For example, there was, according to one former Enron employee, a grou=
p of individual investors known as the Friends of Enron.
     These people, ironically known as FOEs, were offered the following dea=
l: Agree to put your name on a million dollar investment in a private offsh=
ore partnership stuffed to the gills with junky assets, and Enron would len=
d 95 percent of the money and guarantee you at least a 15 percent annual re=
turn. In other words, put up fifty grand and Enron would ensure you receive=
d 150 grand at the end of the year.
     So, who was offered this deal? My Enron correspondent contends the lis=
t of people on it will read "like a Who's Who.''
     Bloomberg News this week revealed that some individuals who put money =
into Enron partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow=
 were executives at Merrill Lynch & Co.
     This is interesting -- and not merely because of the blatant conflict =
of interest in employees of a firm taking huge sums of money from Enron whe=
n it is the role of their firm, in part, to serve as a detached observer of=
 Enron. The conceit that Wall Street firms evaluate U.S. companies honestly=
 was dropped long ago. (Merrill is a passive minority investor in Bloomberg=
 LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, and has said the investments didn't repr=
esent a conflict of interest.)

Looking the Other Way

     No, what's astonishing is that the people who were offered these deals=
 by Enron didn't acknowledge what they said about a company that last year =
ranked as the seventh largest in the U.S. by sales. A lot of well placed pe=
ople knew such a giant company was rotten and yet no one said anything abou=
t it, or altered his behavior in any way towards the company.
    Or almost no one. A couple of local Houston institutional investors who=
 declined similar sweet deals could see clearly enough what it meant.
     Danny Bowers, the chief investment officer of the Houston Fireman's Re=
lief and Retirement Fund, has said "there was a pretty blatant conflict of =
interest. It was kind of a stinky deal.''
     David Long, who runs the Houston Municipal Employees Pension Fund, tol=
d Bloomberg News that, "We had a lot of discussion about potential conflict=
s of interest. You had the CFO of Enron, who's an employee of Enron, acting=
 as general partner of a partnership which for the most part could be const=
rued to be adversarial to Enron.''

Need Not to Know

     So why didn't any respectable person respond the same way to Enron's o=
ffer of free money?
     One of the curious aspects of the Enron scandal is the way the world c=

Houston, we have a problem
The city where deregulation is king is in Enron denial - and won't let go o=
f its wildcatting ways.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Katharine Mieszkowski, Salon.com
Feb. 1, 2002 | HOUSTON -- In a skyscraper just across the street from Enron=
's sparkly new downtown headquarters, Pamela Lovett explains why the bigges=
t bankruptcy in history isn't something to get all worked up about. "This i=
s not the first company to declare bankruptcy," she says. "Personally, I ha=
ve very high regard for Ken Lay."=20
Lovett is the head of economic development for the Greater Houston Partners=
hip, a local business group with 135 CEO members, which Lay was the chairma=
n of in 1994. Her job is wooing big companies to come set up shop in the la=
issez-faire, pro-business Promised Land of Houston.=20
She lowers her voice to remind me reverently that in this country we assume=
 the accused are "innocent until proven otherwise," and when it comes to En=
ron "a lot of things are being tried by speculation." But the civics lesson=
 is interrupted when Lovett's colleague David McCollum comes bursting in to=
 announce that the FBI has just occupied Enron's headquarters, based on rep=
orts that employees were still shredding documents there a few days earlier=
.=20
"We're just having so much fun now!" McCollum jokes before popping back out=
, leaving Lovett to continue to argue that in spite of the Enron collapse t=
hings here in Houston are just fine, thanks.=20
Congress is holding hearings, criminal investigations are under way and cla=
ss action suits are bubbling over, but in Houston, civic leaders don't want=
 to jump to any untoward conclusions. Despite all the sob stories generated=
 by thousands of local laid-off Enron workers and retirees, Mayor Lee Brown=
 has been careful not to cast blame. When Ken Lay resigned as the CEO of En=
ron, the mayor said in a statement: "Only those who are working all day, ev=
ery day on this situation are in a position to know all the details." Oh, a=
nd by the way, Lay sponsored a $50,000 fundraiser for Brown's election last=
 year.=20
The Houston City Council isn't exactly warming up the tar-and-feathers eith=
er. Instead, it's busy awarding a $198,000 consulting contract to Arthur An=
dersen, a company now feverishly attempting to escape its own immolation af=
ter its failure to competently audit Enron's books. "That disgusted me," sa=
ys Amy Oberg, a former Enron employee who lost retirement savings in her 40=
1K as well as her job. "The fact that the city went and did that in the mid=
dle of the federal investigation just blows my mind. For the people here wh=
o were hurt by Enron, that was a slap in the face."=20
Greetings from Houston, the city that tries too hard. Houston is a city tha=
t is proudly unapologetic about its status as an icon of anything-goes dere=
gulation. Nowhere will you find a place more consciously devoted to living =
the free-market version of the American dream. But there's an insecurity lu=
rking beneath the pride, an inferiority complex bred in part by the spectac=
ular flameouts and huge busts that are a natural consequence of living with=
 as few rules as possible. It is, as one resident notes, a place where "peo=
ple come to make money, and then they go someplace else. Nobody retires in =
Houston."=20
Enron's fall from grace is but the most recent disaster to bring out the co=
ntradictions inherent in the Houston way. Even as many Houstonians feel a l=
ingering sense of betrayal and disappointment and no shortage of embarrassm=
ent, they are still unwilling to ask themselves: Why did Enron happen here =
in Houston? And can anything be done to prevent the next catastrophe?=20
Probably not. Because to do anything substantive would be a betrayal of Hou=
ston's founding myth -- the idea that the city is a place where a guy can c=
ome to make a lot of money without being held back by a bunch of party-poop=
ing naysayers and regulators. It's a myth that fits neatly into the explici=
t deregulation platform so heavily promoted by Ken Lay and Enron, and it's =
not something that Houstonians will give up on easily.=20
"There will be no reform in Houston," predicts Dr. Alvin Tarlov, a physicia=
n and policy advisor at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston.=
=20
There never is.=20
"This is a city where you can make your fortune and not have people looking=
 over your shoulder saying: 'You can't do that,'" says Houston native Carlo=
s Hernandez, with evident pride, adding quickly: "Enron was taking that to =
the extreme. That's just criminal."=20
But from the beginning, Houston's wide-open ethos has been an invitation to=
 criminals. "Houston is a city that started as a land scam. It's still a wi=
ldcatters town," says Jim Hightower, the Texas writer and wisecracker. Back=
 in the 1820s the city's roguish developers sold scrip for 5 or 10 cents an=
 acre that didn't actually convey property rights to any land. It was a sca=
m that makes pushing stock that's not based on real revenues look pretty ta=
me.=20
To this day, locals eschew government oversight so much that many suburbani=
tes here don't even live under any city government. They inhabit unincorpor=
ated districts run by the residents, in a barely governed super-sprawl of c=
heap housing. Here's how it works: A developer buys a piece of the endless =
raw prairie land outside city limits. He puts a trailer on it and has his c=
onstruction foreman move in. Then, an only-in-Texas "election" is held. The=
 sole voter -- the construction foreman -- votes in favor of developing the=
 property, and voila! -- a new district is created complete with tax-exempt=
 bond status.=20
When the new 'burb is built and inhabited, the developer turns it over to t=
he citizens, who repay the debt from the bonds with property taxes. There a=
re some 400 of these unincorporated districts in the Greater Houston area, =
and you only really hear about them when the City of Houston cherry-picks a=
 wealthy one, annexing it to assume its lucrative tax base -- usually again=
st vehement "Don't tread on me!" protests from the residents.=20
In the unincorporated areas and the city proper that together make up the s=
prawling greater Houston area, population 4.5 million, lies a case study in=
 what is wrought by living according to the commandment "There shall be no =
zoning." Sublime, helter-skelter juxtapositions are everywhere. Right next =
to an eight-lane freeway, a Discount tire store huddles near a traveling ca=
rnival; children spin themselves silly on blinking rides that rival NASA's =
anti-gravity chambers, under the vacant gaze of an overly made-up model loo=
ming down from a billboard advertising an all-night porn store. And don't m=
iss the 20-story office building right across the street from a neighborhoo=
d of brand-new monster houses, with no niceties like landscaping buffering =
the commercial district from the residential one. Neighborhood deed restric=
tions impose some conformity, but those rules end at the property lines -- =
then, hallelujah! Anything goes! There were a few years there in the early =
'90s when the Houston City Council did impose zoning, albeit after the fact=
, but by 1994 the citizens had voted to repeal this brazen act of governmen=
t intervention.=20
"Strip malls and strip clubs. There's a Gap on every corner next to a Starb=
ucks," says Tracy Delmer, a speech pathologist who has lived here all her l=
ife. "It's all about trying to make your strip mall prettier than the other=
 strip mall down the street."=20
The flip side to freedom from nasty government oversight is some of the wor=
st air pollution in the country. Some 2.5 percent of the world's total refi=
ning capacity lies in the greater Houston area, and Houston's high ozone re=
adings are rivaled only by Los Angeles. The state, in true Texas laissez-fa=
ire style, has been notoriously lax on environmental regulation, allowing o=
ld petrochemical plants to be grandfathered in when introducing new, watere=
d down environmental rules, which just means that those old, polluting plan=
ts never seem to die off.=20
"That's Texas. If the federal government forces Texas to do it, they do it,=
" says Jim Blackburn, a Houston environmental lawyer. "But otherwise, it's =
all up for grabs."=20
Is it any wonder that few people seem to come here just for fun? "People do=
n't say 'I went to Houston last summer,'" says Delmer, "like they say 'I we=
nt to Seattle.'"=20
"All over the country, if people hear they're being transferred to Houston =
they want to commit suicide," says Amy Jaffe, a local energy policy advisor=
, who still finds the distaste outsiders have for Houston puzzling. It's no=
t as if Houston is some kind of cultural wasteland, she notes, enumerating =
a laundry list of Houston's sophisticated worldly charms, from the opera to=
 the ballet to the symphony.=20
All of which, it should be noted, are funded almost entirely by private sou=
rces.=20
Nationally, Enron's demise is stirring debate on a huge range of issues, fr=
om campaign finance reform to accounting rules to the very ascendancy of th=
e idea of deregulation.=20
But not here in Houston.=20
"None of us blame President Bush or free-market capitalism for Enron's coll=
apse," says Raymund Eich, a local patent agent, who believes that liberals =
are using the Enron bankruptcy as an excuse to smear both. Only Dallas and =
Washington gave more money to Bush's 2000 campaign than Houston, and Enron =
is well known to be Bush's single biggest corporate backer, but Eich doesn'=
t think the government owes anything to hard-hit Enron employees or investo=
rs, noting that "Houstonians are more self-reliant than people in other pla=
ces."=20
Take Houston accountants -- a phrase that in February 2002 sounds like the =
punchline to a very bad joke waiting to happen. Here's a group who would li=
ke very much to remain self-reliant, even as they fear that their days of s=
elf-regulation may be numbered, thanks to Andersen's bad behavior. Over lun=
ch -- beef stew on noodles -- the members of the Houston Chapter of the Tex=
as Society of Certified Public Accountants at their annual business meeting=
 at the J.K. Marriott dish about Andersen's role in the Enron debacle.=20
"I think someone should pay," says Ann-Marie Curtin, a CPA at Prime Asset M=
anagement, a Houston property company. "There's no way that there wasn't a =
significant amount of illegal activity going on."=20
But new rules to help prevent such nefarious activities? They won't hear of=
 it. Patrick L. Durio, president-elect of the local group and the chairman =
of the -- voluntary! -- ethics committee of the Texas Society of CPAs, says=
: "Government regulation is not the answer. I don't want to see the governm=
ent setting accounting standards," noting that the industry has been self-r=
egulating for 100 years. "And I don't think that politicians should be gett=
ing involved in it."=20
In Houston, they probably won't. Because no matter how big Enron's corporat=
e implosion appears on the national scale, such colossal busts are hardly u=
nusual in Houston history. In fact, Enron is a mere blip compared to the ci=
ty-wide bust that occurred in the mid-'80s. Houston is always trying to sha=
ke the perception that it's just an urban pit stop for roughnecks who rip n=
atural resources out of the ground on the way to getting really, really ric=
h. Because many Houstonians remember what happened when those roughnecks an=
d their moneymen ran the town right into the ground.=20
"Imagine a city where everybody had gone to Las Vegas for the weekend and l=
ost everything they owned," says Jaffe.=20
In the mid-'80s, the city lost a quarter of a million jobs in the oil and r=
eal estate bust. "There were a lot of people who went from owning lots of r=
eal estate in West Houston and driving a Porsche to having to take a job se=
lling aluminum siding. Everybody was a kazillionaire," says Jaffe, "and all=
 of a sudden, everybody was bankrupt over the course of, like, three years.=
" Banks just couldn't keep up with all the foreclosures on the suburban hou=
ses stocked with '80s amenities -- the backyard swimming pool, the built-in=
 wet bar and the Jacuzzi.=20
The bust inspired a favorite Houston bumper-sticker, begging God for a seco=
nd chance, for another oil boom: "God, if you bring it again, we won't scre=
w it up this time."=20
Things were so depressed circa 1986 that a volunteer civic organization cal=
led Houston Proud formed to try to cheer up the beleaguered populace. The H=
ouston Proud theme song was a relentlessly upbeat ditty that tried too hard=
. Sample lyric: "We're Houston Proud! Proud of the things we've done togeth=
er!" Commercials aired on local TV pairing the song with chipper images of =
smiling Houstonians to market Houston to its own people, as if to plead, "P=
lease don't lose faith. Just don't move away."=20
And maybe that's where the inferiority complex comes from: This is a city t=
hat knows what it feels like to fall flat on your face, to go from driving =
a Porsche to selling aluminum siding. Or maybe a city where the free-market=
 conquers all knows it's inevitably a little rough around the edges.=20
Congratulations, Houston! You've just been named "The Fattest City in Ameri=
ca" by Men's Fitness magazine for the second year in a row. To respond to t=
he salvo, Mayor Brown recently launched a campaign to inspire Houstonians t=
o slim down, by starting with his own waistline. If you can't rule by polic=
y, why not govern by example?=20
The taxes are so low here that the city government needs a public referendu=
m to do anything beyond barely keeping the surface streets functional. Behi=
nd the scenes, it's businesspeople, both informally and through the Greater=
 Houston Partnership, who push civic projects and sweetheart deals along, f=
rom downtown revitalization to building new stadiums. In Houston, the busin=
ess agenda is the civic agenda.=20
"The shadow government decided where the football stadium is going to be, h=
ow much public money was going to be put into it, and where the money would=
 come from," explains Tarlov. Ken Lay led the approval process of the new b=
aseball stadium, which now bears the name of his disgraced company.=20
The sign that says Enron Field, which the now-bankrupt company pledged to p=
ay $100 million for, is the most vivid symbol that Enron's shame is also a =
big black eye for Houston. But neither Enron Field nor the Compaq Center --=
 Compaq cut 8,500 jobs last spring and may still be absorbed by Hewlett-Pac=
kard -- has soured local politicians on the naming game. Right now, the Cit=
y Council is considering selling off different rooms of the new convention =
center for corporate branding.=20
Houston has struggled since the catastrophic oil bust of the '80s to change=
 its wildcatting ways. And like an investor who learned her lesson the hard=
 way when her 401K turned out to be composed 80 percent of Enron stock, Hou=
ston has shed its overdependence on the energy industry, with some success.=
 The city now boasts that while 82 percent of all economic activity in the =
early '80s was energy-related, now it's about 49 percent. That still means =
it's a town whose fortunes are tied to the price of oil, just less so.=20
But even with big local employers Compaq and Continental on the ropes, Enro=
n evaporating and the price of oil down from $30 a barrel in early 2000 to =
$18 a barrel today, the city has lost only 5,700 seasonably adjusted jobs, =
according to the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting=
. That means while the country has shed about 1 percent of its job base in =
the recession, even with Enron's fall, Houston has lost only a quarter perc=
ent of its base. Houston may be down, but it is still ahead of the rest of =
the country.=20
But the collapse of Enron means something more here than the loss of jobs o=
r money or even face. Lay was the archetypal Good Houston Businessman: a yo=
ung man from somewhere else who comes to town, makes a lot of money and sho=
wers it back on the community, while building his good name. He was widely =
thought to be a promising candidate for mayor when Brown's term expires on =
term limits next year, prompting comparisons to Houston's great-granddaddy =
of civic business leaders, Jesse "Mr. Houston" Jones.=20
And before its collapse, Enron represented Houston's best idea of itself --=
 an innovative, technocratic, deregulation innovator that might be a bit on=
 the arrogant and greedy side but was also philanthropic and civic-minded, =
a company transforming itself out of the oil and gas business into a new ec=
onomy conglomerate that even sold broadband services. Enron was the New Hou=
ston.=20
Not even the city's official civic pride cheerleaders can entirely brush of=
f Enron. Lynn Nutt, chair of Houston Proud, confides: "The self-esteem here=
 in Houston is very depleted."=20
But in a city that's always trying to prove itself, there's no time for nav=
el-gazing about whether Enron's collapse means that there's something inher=
ent in Houston's culture that breeds such colossal screwups. The Houston wa=
y isn't to wallow and whine. It's to declare -- all together now! -- your p=
ride in your city, while leaving the congressional investigators, the FBI a=
nd the courts to sort out that Enron mess. In bike-riding, eco-friendly, gr=
anola-eating Portland, Ore., they may be singing the "Enron Blues," but her=
e in Houston, headquarters for the largest bankruptcy in history, they're s=
till Houston Proud!=20
Just in time for all the Enron fuss, there's a new Houston Proud "Rally Son=
g" by local songwriter Phil Blackman: "Houston is the Place to Be." It's a =
twangy Texas two-step blues number with a country twist.=20
"I've been up, I've been down,=20
Searchin' for a place to be=20
I've been around, the world you see=20
But Houston is the place for me."=20
Ah, the good-natured earnestness, the protesting-too-much! It's enough to m=

Texas law firm working to weather Enron storm
Vinson & Elkins, one of state's largest firms, faces hard questions on its =
work for company
By Bruce Hight
American-Statesman Staff
Friday, February 1, 2002
For now, at least, Vinson & Elkins LLP, the big Houston law firm that repre=
sented Enron Corp., sits quietly in the eye of the hurricane of outrage tha=
t stormed the city after the collapse of the energy giant into bankruptcy a=
nd scandal.
But the investigations have only begun.
So far, the firm says, it has not lost any clients and even continues to re=
present Enron on some matters, although it says Enron owes the firm $5 mill=
ion for past services.
And while Vinson & Elkins faces questions about its role in the creation an=
d operation of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure, the fi=
rm - one of the largest in the state - has not been directly implicated in =
Enron's collapse.
That's a marked contrast to Arthur Andersen LLP, which was fired as Enron's=
 auditor last month and has fired one of its own top partners. It has also =
acknowledged destroying Enron-related records and admitted this week that i=
t has lost clients. Some analysts have suggested that Andersen might be so =
heavily damaged that it will have to seek a merger with another accounting =
firm.
Harry Reasoner, who was Vinson & Elkins' managing partner until the end of =
last year, said the law firm is not free to comment in detail about its wor=
k for Enron because of attorney-client privilege.
"It is particularly frustrating because we're confident that when the full =
facts come out that it will be clear that we have conducted ourselves in a =
manner that is both professional and is required by our ethical obligations=
," he said.
One aspect of the firm's work for Enron already has raised eyebrows: At Enr=
on's request, it investigated internal warnings last fall of possible wrong=
doing involving some of the partnerships that eventually led to the company=
's bankruptcy, despite a warning that Vinson & Elkins had previously provid=
ed some legal advice pertaining to the partnerships.
Outside legal experts agree that it's too soon to tell whether the firm act=
ed legally and ethically. But that doesn't mean it has nothing to worry abo=
ut, they added.
"Even if Vinson & Elkins is determined to have no legal liability in this m=
atter, its reputation has been tarnished," said Milton "Mitt" Regan, who te=
aches a course on professional responsibility and corporate lawyers at Geor=
getown University Law Center in Washington.
One issue, Regan said, is just what role Vinson & Elkins played in the crea=
tion of the partnerships that were used by Enron to move debt off its own b=
ooks, which apparently benefited some Enron executives and helped lead to b=
ankruptcy.
"We will need to know whether Vinson & Elkins was confined to the narrow ta=
sk of opining on the legality of business proposals that others developed, =
or whether it took a more expansive role as a member of the team that devel=
oped business strategies," Regan said in an e-mail interview.
John Dzienkowski, a University of Texas law professor who also teaches prof=
essional responsibility, said even if Vinson & Elkins did nothing wrong, th=
e firm probably won't avoid legal action against it.
"Given their deep pockets and high profile, they're likely to be targets of=
 plaintiffs looking for remedies," he said.
Just last August, another prominent Texas law firm, Locke Liddell & Sapp LL=
P, paid $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought against it by investors of=
 Brian Russell Stearns, who was convicted of running a phony investment sca=
m. And in April 2000, the same firm agreed to pay $22 million to settle a l=
awsuit brought by investors in Austin Forex International, a failed foreign=
 currency firm run by former UT football star Russell Erxleben.
Investors claimed that Locke Liddell helped Stearns and Erxleben defraud th=
em. Locke Liddell denied any wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid length=
y and expensive litigation - a decision that Vinson & Elkins may face event=
ually, said Dzienkowski.
Still, he said, Vinson & Elkins' professional reputation is so strong that =
he doubts it will suffer permanent harm.
To make sure, Vinson & Elkins has hired some of the top names in the legal =
profession to defend it. One is Joe Jamail, a renowned Houston trial lawyer=
 better known for battling firms such as Vinson & Elkins than helping them.=
 But Jamail already has persuaded plaintiffs' lawyers in two lawsuits again=
st Enron to drop Vinson & Elkins as a defendant.
Another top gun hired by Vinson & Elkins is John Villa, of the top Washingt=
on firm of Williams & Connolly LLP. He specializes in defending prominent l=
aw firms.
Reasoner said Villa is overseeing Vinson & Elkins' cooperation with the var=
ious investigations: "I don't believe in our lawyers representing themselve=
s when they're called on to testify as witnesses."
Founded in 1917, Vinson & Elkins is the second-largest law firm in Texas, a=
ccording to a survey last year by a trade publication, Texas Lawyer. It has=
 860 lawyers, including 110 in its Austin office, making it one of the city=
's largest law firms. (Don Wood, partner in charge of the Austin office, sa=
id none of the Austin lawyers were assigned to Enron.) It also has offices =
in other cities, including Dallas, Washington, London, Moscow and Singapore=
.
Its revenues last year were about $455 million.
"Enron was only 7-plus percent of our revenue," Reasoner said. "That's sign=
ificant, but I mean, it's not material to us economically in the sense of h=
arming us. And of course people are upset by reading unpleasant publicity. =
But I don't think anyone is concerned that it will affect us in the long ru=
n."
Vinson & Elkins is the kind of firm people have in mind when they talk abou=
t "establishment" or "white shoe" lawyers, those representing banks, major =
corporations, insurers and wealthy individuals.
It is well-connected, politically and otherwise. Al Gonzales, general couns=
el to President Bush and a former Texas Supreme Court justice, is a former =
Vinson & Elkins partner. And some of Enron's 200-plus in-house lawyers used=
 to work at Vinson & Elkins, including the company's general counsel, James=
 Derrick.
(Another major Houston law firm that has done work for Enron, Bracewell & P=
atterson, has severed all ties with the company. Two of its partners, Marc =
Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Greg Abbott, a =
candidate for Texas attorney general, have been criticized for their links =
to a firm working for Enron.)
Vinson & Elkins recruits some of the top law school graduates in the countr=
y - first-year associates start at $110,000 - and the firm, as well as Enro=
n, has contributed to the UT Law School foundation. Reasoner serves on the =
foundation's board, as did Derrick until October.
Those connections have attracted some criticism of the Law School dean, Wil=
liam Powers, after he was elected last year to the Enron board and named ch=
airman of a special committee to investigate the company's finances. Powers=
 has denied any conflict.
The most obvious cloud on Vinson & Elkins' Enron dealings at this point app=
ears to be the investigation it undertook last fall, at Enron's request, re=
garding warnings from an Enron executive that the company could "implode in=
 a wave of accounting scandals."
The executive, Sherron Watkins, also advised former Enron Chairman Ken Lay =
not to use Vinson & Elkins for the investigation because it had provided le=
gal advice in the past to some of the entities whose actions she was questi=
oning.=20
Most of her concerns, however, centered on the accounting of the transactio=
ns between the partnerships and Enron, warning that although they had the b=
lessing of Arthur Andersen, "none of that will protect Enron if these trans=
actions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day."
But Enron nevertheless selected Vinson & Elkins, which on Oct. 15 sent a se=
ven-page letter to company executives that reported no apparent law-breakin=
g and advised that there was no need to hire independent counsel or auditor=
s.=20
However, it warned that some of the transactions in question had "bad cosme=
tics," with "a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation."
Reasoner said that Watkins' warnings did have an effect; Enron afterward ac=
knowledged the problems and reported publicly its major financial losses.
And he hints that Vinson & Elkins did more than suggested by its report: "T=
he notion that this was a whitewash or that the company didn't deal with it=
 - I'm not free to say what our oral advice is or why they did what they di=
d, but they certainly did deal with it."
And, Reasoner said, the firm "was not asked to examine our own legal work" =
in the investigation.
Others will, however, including Congress and the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission.

New Prosecutor Is an `Iron Fist In a Velvet Glove'
By Jerry Markon
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

When James Comey was a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va., he riled up the=
 area's three federal judges in a way that prosecutors rarely do. In a high=
ly unusual joint opinion, the judges criticized Mr. Comey's pet project to =
crack down on gun crimes by prosecuting them in federal courts, where sente=
ncing was tougher, rather than state courts.=20
"It's a total intrusion on the sovereign state of Virginia," Richard Willia=
ms, one of the judges, says in an interview. At the same time, he adds: "I =
have a very high regard for Jim Comey. . . . He did an outstanding job."
Such sentiment is often heard about Mr. Comey, who is expected to be confir=
med soon by the Senate as the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Imposing at 6=
-foot-8 and reputed for his tenacity, Mr. Comey -- who's been involved in h=
ighly charged cases from terrorism to an earlier Enron Corp. case -- seems =
the classic tough-as-nails prosecutor. But as one Richmond defense lawyer, =
Steven Benjamin, puts it, Mr. Comey is "an iron fist in a velvet glove. He'=
s extremely pleasant, but if you challenge him, you go to war. He will not =
yield an inch on something that matters to him."=20
Allan Applbaum, a former New York federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Co=
mey in the early 1990s, notes: "He has this combination of strength and boy=
ish charm that really does disarm people."=20
Mr. Comey, 41 years old, will need these qualities in his new job, which he=
 began on an interim basis last month. With its focus on Wall Street crime,=
 the Mafia and, in recent years, terrorism, Manhattan's federal prosecutor =
is traditionally the most visible of the country's 93 U.S. attorneys.=20
But since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has centralized terrorism inves=
tigations in Washington, saying the events required a coordinated national =
response. It's a significant change: Since the first World Trade Center att=
ack in 1993, most major terrorism cases had been handled in New York. Now, =
key terrorism cases are being filed in Mr. Comey's old district in Virginia=
.=20
A native of Yonkers, N.Y., Mr. Comey won the attention of Attorney General =
John Ashcroft and President Bush with accomplishments such as his quick ind=
ictment last year of 14 men in the 1996 terrorist bombing of military barra=
cks in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American airmen. FBI officials had bee=
n frustrated at the slow pace of the government's investigation, and reques=
ted that the case be transferred to Mr. Comey, who was then in Richmond.=20
As an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the early 1990s, Mr. Come=
y won guilty pleas from two former executives of Enron's oil-trading subsid=
iary to charges of conspiring to defraud the parent company through a serie=
s of phony oil- trading contracts. He also oversaw the hunt for fugitive Ma=
rc Rich, who was later pardoned by President Clinton.=20
Mr. Comey recalls a 1992 trip to a mountaintop hotel in Zurich, Switzerland=
, expecting to meet Mr. Rich and his lawyers to arrange the fugitive's surr=
ender. But Mr. Rich's side argued instead that the racketeering and tax-eva=
sion charges he faced had no merit, and Switzerland had already refused the=
 U.S.'s extradition request.=20
"It was a bit frustrating. We felt we had wasted an enormous amount of time=
," Mr. Comey says. "The chocolates were lovely though."=20
Mr. Comey had more success with his gun-crime program in Virginia starting =
in the mid-'90s. Facing concerns that Project Exile was anti-black because =
most gun crimes involve blacks, he met with the critical federal judges and=
 community leaders to emphasize that the program would help victims. He eve=
ntually won widespread support for the program, which helped cut the murder=
 rate in Richmond by half. At least 12 other cities, including Baltimore an=
d Oakland, Calif., have started their own version of Project Exile.=20
Mr. Comey calls his new position "a dream job," and seems confident that th=
e New York office's central role in prosecuting high-profile cases will be =
maintained. "There's always a healthy tension between an aggressive, indepe=
ndent U.S. attorney's office and headquarters [in Washington], but I don't =
see any kind of sea change," he says.

Inside, Outside Enron, Audit Panel Is Scrutinized --- Links to Company Of C=
ertain Members Are Called Too Cozy
By Joann S. Lublin
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

When the board audit committee of Enron Corp. gathered for a regular meetin=
g at its Houston headquarters a year ago, the session should have been anyt=
hing but routine.=20
After all, Enron management wanted a blessing for every transaction during =
2000 between the energy-trading company and two partnerships run by then-Ch=
ief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The controversial partnerships kept si=
gnificant debt off the books, pumped up profits -- and earned Mr. Fastow mo=
re than $30 million.
Yet committee members, all of them outside directors, didn't challenge a si=
ngle transaction, according to knowledgeable people and excerpts of the Feb=
. 12 meeting's minutes. Their indifference wasn't a complete surprise. The =
full board twice had taken the rare step of suspending the corporate-ethics=
 code, so Mr. Fastow could head the partnerships.=20
Subsequent disclosure of losses related to the partnerships hastened Enron'=
s collapse. Now, amid finger-pointing at top management and the company's o=
utside auditors at Arthur Andersen LLP, the audit committee is under harsh =
scrutiny from a slew of civil, criminal and congressional investigations --=
 and the board itself.=20
A special board committee looking into the debacle is expected to partly bl=
ame the six-member audit panel in a report to be issued as early as this we=
ekend. The report will cite slick presentations by sophisticated financial =
people along with lethargy on the part of audit-committee members, says an =
individual close to the situation. The panel discovered significant defects=
 in procedures for monitoring financial results and controls, the individua=
l adds.=20
Critics who contend Enron's audit panel fell short cite several key reasons=
: Several members held cozy ties with the company, they say. The panel's ch=
airman -- Robert K. Jaedicke, retired accounting professor and former dean =
of Stanford University's business school -- preferred a relatively passive =
role. And Andersen auditors apparently weren't persuaded that they should b=
e answerable to the audit committee as their client. "It's the worst audit =
committee I have ever seen," asserts John Nash, president emeritus of the N=
ational Association of Corporate Directors.=20
"This audit committee worked pretty well based on the information it was pr=
ovided," retorts W. Neil Eggleston, counsel for Enron's outside directors a=
nd a partner at Howrey Simon Arnold & White in Washington. Andersen signed =
off on accounting practices and didn't alert members about "any impropriety=
 or irregularity" until November, Mr. Eggleston adds. Audit-committee membe=
rs either declined to comment about their role or didn't return calls.=20
An Andersen spokesman, asked to respond to Mr. Eggleston's critique, said t=
he notion that "the audit committee or senior management wasn't aware of th=
e risks of the business decisions they were making is entirely implausible.=
" Regarding criticism of its auditing work, Andersen says Enron withheld cr=
ucial information and misled the auditors about the partnerships; Enron fir=
ed Andersen last month.=20
At first glance, Enron's pivotal audit panel, made up of prominent executiv=
es, looks well-qualified. But in reality, governance specialists contend, t=
he committee's makeup is far from ideal.=20
For one thing, half its members live abroad -- an uncommon practice at audi=
t panels, which meet often and require a keen grasp of business practices h=
ere. As an American citizen, Hong Kong billionaire property developer Ronni=
e Chan may understand U.S. business. But he has the worst recent attendance=
 record of any Enron director. He missed more than 25% of board and committ=
ee meetings during 1996, 1997 and 2000, according to proxy statements. (In =
1998 and 1999 he missed fewer meetings, though the percentage wasn't report=
ed because it was less than 25%.)=20
Corporate-governance experts doubt some other audit-committee members are t=
ruly independent. Lord John Wakeham joined the board in 1994, four years af=
ter the then-British energy secretary approved plans for Enron to build a p=
ower plant in the United Kingdom. Since 1996, proxy statements show, he has=
 earned $72,000 a year advising its European unit -- more than his $50,000 =
annual stipend for being a director. In a statement last week, Lord Wakeham=
's office said it "would clearly be wrong of him" to make any comments abou=
t his position at Enron while the matter is being investigated.=20
John Mendelsohn is president of University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Ce=
nter, which has received nearly $1.6 million in donations from Enron and re=
lated entities since 1985, the year his predecessor Charles A. LeMaistre be=
came an Enron director. Dr. Mendelsohn has said the center doesn't depend h=
eavily on Enron philanthropy.=20
Dr. Jaedicke, who is 73 years old, is the most important -- and, to corpora=
te governance experts, perhaps most problematic -- member of Enron's audit =
panel. The unpretentious retired academic commands respect for his meticulo=
us thoroughness. But he has led the Enron audit panel since he obtained his=
 board seat in 1985. Big-business boards typically switch committee heads e=
very three to five years to maintain distance from management.=20
Dr. Jaedicke feels his lengthy tenure never crimped his outside perspective=
, Mr. Eggleston says. But some question whether Dr. Jaedicke's long service=
 to Enron may have contributed to his approach.=20
He took a relatively passive role, for example, when the board first waived=
 the ethics code in mid-1999. To form a private partnership called LJM Caym=
an LP, Mr. Fastow needed a special board ruling that his activities wouldn'=
t violate policies intended to protect against executives being involved in=
 activities that might pose a conflict of interest or harm Enron.=20
The audit committee's charter, disclosed in the latest proxy statement, des=
cribes its responsibility for overseeing ethics-code compliance. Yet the pa=
nel took no action about suspending the code before the full board met; nor=
 did Dr. Jaedicke propose an audit-committee review during that board meeti=
ng, Mr. Eggleston reports.=20
"The audit committee should have made the code suspension part of their wor=
k, especially since the partnership would involve the CFO," says Charles El=
son, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of D=
elaware's business school. And Dr. Jaedicke, as the committee's chairman, "=
should have been upset over the proposed waiver of the code."=20
To the contrary, according to excerpted minutes from Enron's board meeting =
on June 28, 1999, it was Dr. Jaedicke who seconded the motion suspending th=
e ethics code when directors approved a resolution that Mr. Fastow's partne=
rship participation "will not adversely affect the interests of the Company=
."=20
He saw the partnership as a "one-off, isolated transaction. It didn't look =
like there was much risk at that time," Mr. Eggleston explains. In addition=
, the lawyer continues, committee members "believed that Arthur Andersen wa=
s involved in blessing the LJM partnerships."=20
Also raising eyebrows is the audit committee's lack of involvement in decid=
ing which law firm would conduct the nearly two-month probe into a letter w=
arning of questionable accounting last August by Enron Vice President Sherr=
on Watkins. Her letter raised alarms about the unorthodox partnerships and =
their potential danger to Enron's finances and public image.=20
At numerous companies, the audit-committee chairman decides which law firm =
should probe a serious whistle-blowing complaint. "That's the only way you =
maintain the integrity of the company," says Roderick M. Hills, a former Se=
curities and Exchange Commission chairman who has led more than six audit c=
ommittees.=20
Instead, at Enron, management made the decision to retain Houston law firm =
Vinson & Elkins to explore concerns described in the letter Ms. Watkins sen=
t and discussed with then-chairman Kenneth Lay. Her letter cautioned agains=
t using Vinson & Elkins as investigators because it had issued legal opinio=
ns endorsing some of the partnerships.=20
Dr. Jaedicke didn't learn about the Watkins letter or the outside lawyers' =
inquiry until it ended, when Vinson & Elkins briefed him about the finding,=
 Mr. Eggleston says. He maintains this didn't bother Dr. Jaedicke because h=
e knew corporate policy required that in-house attorneys review employee co=
mplaints from any level and decide whether to seek outside legal help. Crit=
ics say that the Vinson & Elkins Oct. 15 report in effect ignored the accou=
nting problems, by concluding that Enron's practice of forming special-purp=
ose entities to keep debt off its books was "creative and aggressive" but w=
asn't "inappropriate from a technical standpoint."=20
Enron's auditors also knew about the Watkins allegations long before the au=
dit committee did. An Aug. 21 Andersen memo summarizes a conversation in wh=
ich the whistle-blowing executive, a former Andersen auditor, shared her co=
ncerns about Enron's questionable accounting with an Andersen audit partner=
 not assigned there. The partner passed along what he termed "a very troubl=
esome scenario" to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm's law=
yers. Andersen says it also informed Enron management.=20
By Oct. 9, Andersen analysts had determined there was "a red alert: a heigh=
tened risk of financial-statement fraud" at Enron, according to an Andersen=
 e-mail. The Andersen spokesman says the financial-statement test described=
 in the e-mail was conducted on an "experimental basis" using software late=
r found to be flawed and doesn't know what actions auditors took to address=
 the "red alert."=20
Again, however, Enron's audit committee didn't immediately learn of this. N=
ot until Nov. 2, when the company's financial condition had seriously deter=
iorated, did Andersen tell the Enron board of "possible illegal acts within=
 the company" concerning one partnership, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph B=
erardino told lawmakers. Six days later, the complex partnerships caused En=
ron to restate nearly $600 million in earnings reported over five years.=20
Some suspect Andersen auditors failed to keep Enron's audit committee well-=
informed because they saw their main responsibility as serving the company'=
s management, and not the full board or the audit committee. "It's usually =
the comptroller that recommends to the audit committee who the auditors sho=
uld be," a former Enron official observes. Andersen auditors worked "with t=
he company day by day. They saw the audit committee once a quarter."=20
Yet at some companies audit-panel chairmen aggressively try to reverse that=
 misconception, thereby protecting auditors against management mischief. "Y=
ou're there to make sure [auditors] report to you" and that only directors =
can fire them, Mr. Hills says. So, he occasionally spends all day at audito=
rs' offices making sure they consider conservative accounting methods. "Enr=
on is emblematic of a culture in corporate life that needs to be rooted out=
," he maintains.=20

UT dean too close to Enron inquiry
Editorial Board
Austin American-Statesman
Thursday, January 31, 2002
University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers Jr. has been described a=
s a man with an unswerving moral compass.=20
There is no reason to believe otherwise. But frankly, the dean's moral comp=
ass is not the issue in the debate over whether he should lead Enron's inte=
rnal investigation of what went wrong with the Houston-based energy trader.=
=20
Public trust is the issue.=20
Powers is a member of the Enron board. His law school has close ties to Enr=
on and its money. The dean is probing partnerships that hid the company's l=
osses. As lead investigator, Powers will issue a report on the nature of th=
ose transactions.=20
The goal of the investigation -- to get to the bottom of Enron's financial =
scandal -- clearly is compromised with Powers at the helm. Powers should st=
ep down from that role to ensure that there can be no questioning or doubt =
about the objectivity of the inquiry. Enron, a publicly traded company, owe=
s its shareholders an investigation. Investors, out-of-work employees and o=
thers are entitled to a comprehensive probe that steers clear of conflicts =
-- even perceived ones.=20
That is why the Enron board should hire a third party with no ties to the c=
ompany for the job.=20
The larger principle at stake in the board's investigation is public confid=
ence. U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft as well as Texas Attorney General=
 John Cornyn set an example by recusing themselves from investigating Enron=
, which contributed heavily to both. Ashcroft lost his U.S. Senate seat las=
t year in his native Missouri. Ashcroft and Cornyn wisely understood that t=
he issue was not whether they could conduct fair investigations, but whethe=
r the public would trust their investigations given their financial ties to=
 Enron and its former CEO, Ken Lay.=20
That is the issue at the heart of the debate over Powers. Unfortunately, th=
e Enron board doesn't seem to get it. It downplays ties between Enron and U=
T, including the close connection between Powers and top Enron executive Ja=
mes Derrick Jr.=20
Derrick is a major fund-raiser for the UT law school and, until recently, w=
as a member of its Law School Foundation that supplements Powers' UT salary=
. He resigned after Powers joined the Enron board.=20
After Enron made the last installment of its $250,000 pledge to the UT law =
school last year, Powers sent Derrick a handwritten note, "Thank you for al=
l you do for us!"=20
The Enron-UT-Powers connections go deeper. Houston-based Vinson & Elkins, w=
ith offices in Austin, is a generous donor to the law school. Enron is one =
of the firm's major clients.=20
We wanted to discuss these issues with Powers. But we were referred to Kare=
n Denne, an Enron public relations representative in Houston.=20
Denne said the board doesn't see anything wrong with Powers heading the inv=
estigation. It appointed him to the board last fall for that very purpose, =
she said. The company had begun its financial free fall when Powers joined =
the board in October.=20
"The board specifically brought Dean Powers on board to head up this specia=
l investigation so we would have a comprehensive, independent review and in=
vestigation of the partnerships in question."=20
Denne added that the board concluded, "Powers' credentials and reputation i=
n the legal field outweigh any perceived legal conflict."=20
It's not the board's view that matters most. It's the public's, and the pub=
lic is not likely to trust a report produced by someone with Powers' connec=
tions to Enron. Then there are the real people who got hurt -- former Enron=
 employees, teachers and others who saw their pensions and life savings eva=
porate as Enron stock crashed. They are even less likely to trust an inquir=
y by Powers.=20
Those are legitimate doubts. They already are clouding Powers' investigatio=
n and will surely taint his findings -- however reliable they might otherwi=
se be.=20
Texas' economy will feel aftershocks from Enron's fall. The public deserves=
 an accounting it can trust from an impartial outsider. Powers should step =
aside.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: COLLEGE REACTION
Watchdog Group Wants Investigation on Harvard Official
By NEELA BANERJEE and REED ABELSON

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A group of Harvard students and alumni called yesterday for the university =
to investigate whether a member of its governing body might have given insi=
der information to an investment fund that manages part of Harvard's endowm=
ent, permitting it to profit from the fall in Enron's stock price late last=
 year.=20
The group acknowledged that it had no evidence.
The focus of the group, HarvardWatch, is Herbert S. Winokur Jr., a longtime=
 Enron director who is also a member of the Harvard Corporation, which runs=
 the university.=20
Mr. Winokur has no direct ties to the fund. Mr. Winokur is chairman of the =
finance committee on Enron's board.=20
In a statement issued last night, the university said: ''Mr. Winokur is a v=
alued member of the Harvard Corporation. The university is reviewing the si=
tuation for any developments that have a genuine bearing on Harvard.''=20
HarvardWatch, a relatively new organization, said that Highfields Capital M=
anagement, an investment manager with ties to Harvard, profited by acquirin=
g options last year betting that Enron's stock would fall.=20
The group estimated that the positions would have yielded $50 million to $1=
20 million in profit.=20
Highfields declined to comment on the assertions. But W. Neil Eggleston, a =
lawyer who is representing Enron's outside directors, said: ''Mr. Winokur h=
as a long history of personal and financial commitment to Harvard, and he h=
as no plans to walk away from the institution. Mr. Winokur had no involveme=
nt with Highfields Capital and any suggestion that he tipped the fund to sh=
ort sell Enron stock is just plain wrong.''=20
HarvardWatch wants an inquiry into any contact between Mr. Winokur, a Harva=
rd alumnus, and Highfields.=20
''We by no means have evidence of insider communications, but we feel the s=
ituation certainly warrants investigation,'' said Molly McOwen of HarvardWa=
tch. ''Why did Highfields have the confidence to sell the stock when no one=
 else did?''=20
Highfields was skeptical about Enron's performance far earlier than most mo=
ney managers.=20
Mr. Winokur did not sell any of his own shares in Enron last year, records =
show.=20
Mr. Winokur is a director of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees=
 the university's endowment.=20
HarvardWatch said it was also pursuing potential conflicts concerning other=
 ties with Enron.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ARMY SECRETARY
Former Executive, Now in Washington, Denies Impropriety at His Unit
By JAMES DAO

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Thomas E. White, the secretary of the Army, vigorous=
ly defended today the business practices of a major Enron division that he =
helped manage until early last year, rejecting in an interview assertions b=
y former employees that there was improper accounting at the unit.=20
Mr. White and Enron officials said that the division, Enron Energy Services=
, was getting out of the business of providing energy services to military =
bases before Mr. White was named Army secretary last spring. As a result, M=
r. White said, he has not needed to disqualify himself from any decisions r=
elating to Enron after he took office in May.
Several former employees of Enron Energy Services have said that while Mr. =
White was vice chairman of the unit, it overstated its profits by hundreds =
of millions of dollars, using shoddy accounting practices to create illusor=
y earnings. Those assertions have come under scrutiny by several committees=
 on Capitol Hill investigating Enron's collapse.=20
Mr. White denied the ex-employees' accusations. ''As far as I am concerned,=
 Enron Energy Services was a great business,'' he said in an interview that=
 ranged widely across military issues and the Enron matter. ''We built it f=
rom nothing. There were no accounting irregularities that I was aware of.''=
=20
Questions about Enron Energy Services became public last week with news rep=
orts of an e-mail message sent last year by a former employee, Margaret Cec=
oni, to Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman at the time. Ms. Ceconi, a former =
sales manager, said that Enron Energy Services had hidden losses on contrac=
ts worth more than $500 million.=20
''This is common knowledge among all the E.E.S. employees, and is actually =
joked about,'' she said in the message, dated Aug. 29, 2001. Since Enron's =
bankruptcy filing in December, Enron Energy Services has laid off most of i=
ts 1,000 employees and walked away from many of its contracts. Those includ=
e a $25 million contract to provide services to Fort Hamilton in New York t=
hat Enron won when Mr. White, a retired Army brigadier general, was a compa=
ny executive.=20
The Army is in negotiations with Enron Energy Services over its default on =
the Fort Hamilton contract.=20
Other former employees have said that the division used aggressive projecti=
ons and accounting to overstate earnings during Mr. White's tenure. The emp=
loyees said that they did not know whether Mr. White or Lou L. Pai, the uni=
t's chairman at the time, were aware of this.=20
On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to Mr. =
Lay asking him to explain what Enron did in response to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail=
 message.=20
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the investigatio=
ns subcommittee of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, also raised q=
uestions about Mr. White's financial ties to Enron in a letter to the Offic=
e of Government Ethics. Mr. Levin's office said today that he had not recei=
ved a response from the ethics office.=20
In the interview today, Mr. White dismissed Ms. Ceconi's claims of impropri=
eties, and he argued that most of her e-mail message was devoted to complai=
nts about how the company had treated her. Her personal complaints seemed v=
alid, he said, though he suggested that the management team that succeeded =
him was responsible for her problems.=20
''I think she has a case from what I know about it and what I've read about=
 it that her employment at Enron was not properly handled,'' Mr. White said=
. ''She was recruited into a specific area of the business, and the new lea=
dership team at Enron Energy Service decided to head the business in a new =
direction. Unfortunately, she got caught in the middle of it.''=20
In the e-mail message, Ms. Ceconi said she was recruited to leave her job a=
t GE Capital by Enron Energy Services with promises of a compensation packa=
ge worth as much $1 million a year. Instead, she was laid off in less than =
a year as the company began to crumble. Ms. Ceconi did not return calls for=
 comment.=20
While Mr. White was at Enron Energy Services, the company created a unit ca=
lled Enron Federal Solutions that aggressively pursued contracts with the P=
entagon to provide energy services at military bases. Congress had authoriz=
ed the privatization of utility services at bases in 1997, and the followin=
g year the secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, ordered the armed servic=
es to try to privatize electric, natural gas and other utilities at all bas=
es by 2003.=20
A spokeswoman for Enron Energy Services said that by March 2001, before Mr.=
 White was nominated to be Army secretary, the division had already decided=
 to stop bidding on military contracts. At the time, the company had bid on=
 five contracts to provide services to about a dozen bases, including some =
Army bases.=20
When Mr. White took office, he strongly endorsed the Army's energy privatiz=
ation policy. Some consumer groups, including Public Citizen, have raised q=
uestions about possible conflict of interest.=20
In a letter last week to Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the =
ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, Mr. White sai=
d he had been in contact with 13 different Enron employees, including Mr. L=
ay, on 29 occasions since taking office. But Mr. White said that all of tho=
se contacts had been personal in nature.=20
Today, Mr. White said that no decisions regarding Enron had come to his off=
ice. ''I have taken no action at any point or at any time that would benefi=
t Enron corporations in any way with utilities privatization or any other e=
ndeavor,'' he said.=20
According to government disclosure filings, Mr. White's final salary at Enr=
on was $5.5 million. To comply with ethics rules, he was compelled to sell =
405,710 shares of Enron last year at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a sh=
are, well below the stock's peak. Still, he received $12 million.=20
''I guess I would say that there is a terrible tragedy that has unfolded th=
ere,'' Mr. White said today. ''I have many friends, as well as myself, who =
have suffered losses.''

Accountants Won't Fight Consulting Ban

Arthur Andersen, KPMG and the American Institute of Certified Public Accoun=
tants said yesterday that they will drop their opposition to a ban on accou=
nting firms providing certain consulting services.=20
That sharp reversal of the position they took two years ago was viewed by l=
awmakers as an effort to head off new restrictions that Congress is conside=
ring in the wake of the Enron collapse and other corporate accounting blowu=
ps.
Meanwhile, PricewaterhouseCoopers announced plans to split off its $6.7 bil=
lion management-consulting business into a separate public entity, an attem=
pt to reassure the public of the independence of the firm's audits.=20
At the same time, one of PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing clients, Walt Disn=
ey Co., said it would no longer use PwC for consulting projects because of =
the debate over auditor independence.=20
And New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall also called for a ban on audi=
tors providing consulting services in most cases. McCall oversees the state=
 pension fund, which lost millions on Enron stock.=20
The federal government gave the accounting industry the valuable franchise =
of auditing companies that sell shares to the public after the stock market=
 crash of 1929. The auditors are supposed to be independent watchdogs and d=
o their best to make sure investors can trust corporate financial statement=
s.=20
Over the years, accounting firms have done increasing amounts of consulting=
 work for their clients. Former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman=
 Arthur Levitt Jr. feared that auditors would be reluctant to get tough wit=
h clients and risk losing lucrative consulting work.=20
In 2000, Levitt tried to ban auditors from providing information technology=
 and consulting services, and from conducting internal audits for their cli=
ents.=20
KPMG, Deloitte & Touche, Arthur Andersen and the AICPA opposed that effort,=
 threatening to go to court to block the SEC. Ultimately, they got lawmaker=
s to pressure Levitt to back off.=20
Now, however, the Enron scandal and other corporate accounting blowups have=
 cost investors billions of dollars and created a new political climate for=
 reform.=20
Stephen G. Butler, chief executive of KPMG, said he hoped that by lifting i=
ts opposition, the industry could steer the regulatory debate away from aud=
itor independence and the services limitations Levitt had wanted, which he =
called "a red herring" for the profession.=20
Barry Melancon, the AICPA president who was also a fierce critic of Levitt'=
s efforts, said he believes that limiting the type of services that an audi=
t firm can perform would not have prevented the Enron meltdown. But Melanco=
n said industry representatives recognize that the auditor independence iss=
ue is "front and center."=20
"We need the profession to address it," he said. "If we didn't address thes=
e two issues, people would be saying that we are trying to deflect. We are =
saying we are stepping up to the plate first."=20
Andersen, which has been criticized for its handling of Enron's audits, als=
o decided yesterday to drop its opposition to the scope-of-services restric=
tions. "Andersen went voluntarily before Congress in December and made a co=
mmitment that it would look at its practices and that it would be making ch=
anges," said Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard. "We are pleased to say the=
 direction the industry is moving toward is something Andersen supports."=
=20
Deloitte & Touche, the other major accounting firm that had opposed Levitt'=
s ban, did not follow Andersen and KPMG yesterday. A spokeswoman for Deloit=
te & Touche said in a statement that the firm would not "accept or reject a=
ny single proposal whether we agree with it or not, because the effectivene=
ss of a complete set of reforms is what ultimately needs to be assessed."=
=20
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young did not oppose the SEC two years a=
go and said they would maintain that position.=20
PricewaterhouseCoopers announced two years ago that it planned to spin off =
several businesses, including its consulting business. PwC officials said y=
esterday that they decided to speed up their plans for an initial public of=
fering for PwC Consulting because of the current concerns about auditor ind=
ependence. PwC's IPO plans were first reported in the Wall Street Journal.=
=20
Lawmakers said it's unclear whether these various moves by accounting firms=
 will be sufficient to head off legislative actions. "I'm delighted by thei=
r conversion, but too little, too late," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.=
), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.=20
"The culture has changed," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "Congress has got =
to get the consumer protections into a statute. It doesn't count unless you=
 get it into a federal statute."=20
In the Senate, Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.) ha=
ve proposed legislation that would prohibit firms from providing audit and =
consulting services to the same client.=20
"We've got a serious public confidence issue that needs to be addressed," h=
e said.=20
Dodd called the industry's action a "positive development." But noting that=
 the accounting industry was not united in this action, he said it "also hi=
ghlights the need for uniformity in the industry.=20
Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial Services sub=

"It shouldn't shift the focus away from broader issues of auditor independe=

 the central focus of Enron. It's the only thing that explains why Andersen=

It was, says Elizabeth Dole's Senate campaign, just an afterthought.=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the North Carolina Republica=
n suspended campaign activities. But she kept a Sept. 20 speaking engagemen=
t to a Christian women's gathering in Houston. Then, in what aides called a=
 "last-minute decision," she agreed to let Kenneth L. Lay, then Enron Corp.=
's chairman, host a fundraising lunch for her at a Houston hotel.
It proved a costly decision. North Carolina Democrats today begin airing a =
TV ad attacking Dole for the Enron event, making her the first prominent po=
litician to be targeted by a well-financed effort for having connections to=
 the bankrupt energy company.=20
She is unlikely to be the last.=20
In Colorado, Connecticut, Texas and other states, the Enron scandal has see=
ped into state and congressional races, forcing Republicans to defend even =
modest brushes with the company now under widespread investigation. The tar=
gets include the president's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where the s=
tate pension fund lost $325 million when Enron stock plummeted last fall.=
=20
It is unclear whether the criticisms will stick, let alone influence voters=
 nine months from now. Even some Democratic strategists urge caution, notin=
g that many Democrats also have accepted Enron money. But with polls showin=
g high presidential approval ratings -- along with greater voter confidence=
 in Republicans than in Democrats on an array of issues -- some Democrats s=
ee the unfolding Enron saga as their best hope for a surge in the November =
elections.=20
"Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002=
, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and =
Republicans," three well-known Democratic advisers wrote in a recent memo t=
o members of Congress. "The more people hear, the more corrosive it becomes=
," wrote James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Robert Shrum.=20
North Carolina may provide the first test. Dole, a former Cabinet member an=
d one-time presidential contender, is strongly favored to win the GOP nomin=
ation to succeed retiring Sen. Jesse Helms (R). Democrats haven't settled o=
n a nominee, but they have eagerly criticized Dole for collecting $20,000 a=
t Lay's luncheon.=20
Dole has given $5,000 of that amount -- which came directly from Lay or his=
 relatives -- to a special fund for displaced Enron employees. But that has=
n't stopped a barrage of news stories and critical editorials.=20
Now comes the Democratic TV ad, to air in three North Carolina cities over =
12 days. It says Dole attended "a secret fundraiser" hosted by Lay. It quot=
es a Winston-Salem Journal editorial that said, "while Dole's campaign was =
publicly stating it had put its activities on hold, it was conducting fundr=
aisers at the house of a scoundrel."=20
In a section not cited in the ad, the editorial also said, "The state Democ=
ratic Party, which has looked silly trying to find mud to throw at Dole, ha=
s uncovered a whole puddle." The Houston fundraiser "shows that Dole is one=
 more politician into whom Lay appears to have sunk his financial claws."=
=20
Democrats note Dole's campaign hired Washington-based consultant Edward Gil=
lespie, a key Enron link to Republican House leaders and the White House. C=
ampaign sources said Gillespie's Enron lobbying did not overlap with his wo=
rk for Dole and he was not involved in the Houston fundraiser.=20
In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to get out in front of his potential En=
ron problem. The governor, who is seeking reelection this fall, has joined =
others in calling for an investigation of the state employee pension fund's=
 $325 million loss in Enron stock. Much of the stock was bought after Oct. =
22, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned it was investig=
ating the company.=20
Bush is one of three board members who oversee the fund. He joined Florida =
Attorney General Robert A. "Bob" Butterworth (D) in calling for an inquiry =
focusing on Alliance Capital Management LP, the New York firm that made the=
 Enron purchases.=20
Through Alliance, the pension fund paid $9 to $82 a share for Enron stock, =
which it sold for 28 cents a share on Nov. 30, according to Florida news ac=
counts. While newspapers have noted the governor's role in overseeing the p=
ension fund, Democrats are moving cautiously.=20
Florida Democratic Chairman Bob Poe said, "Right now, I don't see where [Bu=
sh] had control of Alliance Capital. Maybe someone shows me how he should b=
e responsible, but right now, I don't see that."=20
Poe was more critical of Bush's decision to attend a January fundraiser for=
 the Florida GOP at the Houston home of Richard D. Kinder, who was presiden=
t of Enron until 1996.=20
"It's a tremendous lapse of judgment," Poe said. "For the people who lost t=
heir life savings and for the participants of the Florida pension fund that=
 lost $300 million, this seems incredibly insensitive."=20
In Connecticut, the Manchester Journal Inquirer reported that Enron spent $=
297,150 from 1999 to 2001 for legal and lobbying services. Most of the mone=
y went to a firm employing Michael J. Martone, a former top aide to Gov. Jo=
hn G. Rowland (R). Martone lobbied the state to fund a fuel-cell project pr=
oposed by Enron and the Connecticut Resource Recovery Association.=20
In Texas, Enron's collapse has touched scores of politicians. Gov. Rick Per=
ry (R) has declined to return roughly $200,000 in Enron-related contributio=
ns. The money includes $25,000 that Lay donated the day after Perry appoint=
ed Lay's choice, former Enron official Max Yzaguirre, to the Public Utility=
 Commission. Yzaguirre later resigned.=20
In Colorado, Democratic Senate challenger Tom Strickland accused Sen. Wayne=
 Allard (R) of contributing to Enron's collapse by opposing prompt enactmen=
t of a proposed rule change governing accounting firms.=20
"Allard asked for the rules to be delayed, which in effect caused the rules=
 to be killed, which killed any chance of preventing the Enron debacle," St=
rickland campaign manager Brian Hardwick told the Denver Post.=20
Allard campaign manager Dick Wadhams told the newspaper that the senator so=
ught "a delay so that Congress could spend more time considering the measur=
e. The request was made by senators of both political parties."

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE POLITICS
In Commercial, Elizabeth Dole Is Chastised For Enron Ties
By ALISON MITCHELL

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- In their first effort to turn the Enron collapse int=
o an overt campaign issue, Democrats today unveiled a commercial attacking =
Elizabeth Dole, one of the Republicans' best-known Senate hopefuls, for att=
ending a fund-raiser given by Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron.=
=20
The 30-second spot, sponsored by the North Carolina Democratic Party with f=
inancial assistance from the Washington-based Democratic Senatorial Campaig=
n Committee, takes to task Mrs. Dole, the former presidential candidate who=
 is the prohibitive favorite in the Republican primary for the North Caroli=
na Senate seat being vacated by Jesse Helms. The Democrats have not yet cho=
sen their Senate candidate.
In the advertisement, an announcer intones that Mrs. Dole said she had put =
her campaign on hold in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks but then=
 nine days later flew to ''a secret fund-raiser'' given by Mr. Lay. ''Tell =
Elizabeth Dole we expect the truth,'' the announcer says.=20
Mary Brown Brewer, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Dole, called it ''sad that the De=
mocrats have already resorted to personal attack ads.'' Ms. Brewer added, '=
'It's this kind of bitter partisanship and reckless negativity that voters =
are tired of.''=20
The commercial -- unusual at a time when both parties are still holding pri=
mary contests in North Carolina -- comes as Democrats have begun trying to =
use the Enron collapse to portray the Bush administration and Congressional=
 Republicans as tied to wealthy special interests.=20
Ms. Brewer took issue with the Democrats' advertisement. She said Mrs. Dole=
 flew to Houston in late September to speak to a Christian women's group, t=
hen went to the fund-raiser. She said that it was not secret and that Mrs. =
Dole would give all contributions from Enron, its executives or its employe=
es to a fund for Enron employees. She said that about $5,000 raised at the =
Houston event came from Enron.=20
Until now, Democrats had largely used Enron as a metaphor and as a way of r=
aising doubts about Republican policies.=20
''I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget,'' Se=
nator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said this month, speaking about the=
 reappearance of federal deficits.=20
In a Jan. 28 memo to Democrats, three prominent Democratic strategists, Sta=
n Greenberg, James Carville and Bob Shrum, said the Enron collapse ''has th=
e potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact othe=
r issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and the Republica=
ns.''=20
They wrote that polls showed that the more people heard about the company, =
''the more corrosive it becomes.''=20
''This is an issue where Democrats ought to talk about right and wrong, gre=
ed and responsibility,'' they wrote.=20
More than a dozen Congressional investigations into Enron are under way. Bu=
t Democrats have been cautious until now about being too overtly political =
and have focused on policy. Some party strategists say they do not want to =
overplay their hand.=20
This week, after the memo surfaced, Mr. Daschle said, ''The last thing we s=
hould do is politicize the scandal.''=20
But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is closely tied to Mr. Das=
chle and is in charge of preserving and increasing the Democrat's fragile m=
ajority.=20
James M. Jordan, the executive director of the Senate Democrat's election c=
ommittee, argued that the ad ''fundamentally is not about Enron. It's about=
 her campaign's lack of honesty and about politics as usual.''=20
He said the commercial would run for at least 12 days in major media market=
s in North Carolina and on cable television in Washington ''so the Doles ca=
n watch the ad in their home at the Watergate.''=20
Mrs. Dole's primary residence is in Washington along with her husband, Bob.=
 Democrats have accused her of being a carpetbagger though she grew up in N=
orth Carolina. She recently took title to the North Carolina house where sh=
e grew up and her mother still lives.=20
Three Democrats are also in a primary battle for Mr. Helms's seat: Erskine =
B. Bowles, a former White House chief of staff; Daniel T. Blue Jr., a state=
 representative; and Elaine F. Marshall, the secretary of state. Republican=
s in Washington say that if Mr. Bowles wins the primary, they are prepared =
to use the Clinton administration's own ties to Enron against him.=20
Enron was a major donor to the Democratic National Committee in the Clinton=
 years. Mr. Lay played golf with Mr. Clinton and stayed overnight in the Wh=
ite House.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY TASK FORCE
Enron Won Some and Lost Some in White House Energy Report
By JOSEPH KAHN

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Though the General Accounting Office plans to sue the White House to learn =
how much influence Enron and other energy companies had on the Bush adminis=
tration's energy policies, one scorecard has been publicly available for mo=
nths.=20
In its National Energy Strategy, a 170-page list of recommendations release=
d in May, the Bush administration detailed its views on regulating electric=
ity transmission, using coal and natural gas resources and controlling poll=
ution, all vital to Enron.
The company and its executives were among the largest contributors to Presi=
dent Bush, and company officials including Kenneth L. Lay, the chief execut=
ive who resigned last week, had at least five meetings with administration =
officials to discuss energy. Yet the company's record on shaping the admini=
stration approach is mixed.=20
Energy experts and lobbyists say Enron had reason to celebrate some of the =
administration's recommendations, especially its efforts to create a nation=
wide electricity transmission grid. But the energy plan rejected or ignored=
 many other Enron priorities, including the company's hopes of expanding th=
e use of natural gas, controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and stripping=
 states of their control of electricity transmission lines.=20
''It never looked like an Enron wish list to me,'' said Jonathan Weisgall, =
Washington representative for MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a utility compan=
y that also lobbied to shape the administration's energy policies.=20
''There were some things they and many other companies wanted that showed u=
p there,'' Mr. Weisgall said. ''On some things Enron wanted the most, they =
got nothing at all.''=20
Take electricity transmission. Because Enron specialized in trading supplie=
s of electricity, it pushed for years to create a more open, less-regulated=
 transmission grid that would allow it to buy or sell electricity regardles=
s of where the power was produced.=20
In interviews last spring with The New York Times and the PBS program ''Fro=
ntline,'' Mr. Lay said that removing transmission bottlenecks was critical =
to the company. ''It's the high-voltage backbone for the electric industrie=
s,'' he said. ''It's kind of like a superhighway system for electricity.'' =
(Fresh excerpts from the interview will be broadcast tonight on the PBS pro=
gram ''Now With Bill Moyers.'')=20
An Enron memo drafted before Mr. Lay met Mr. Cheney to discuss energy polic=
y in April expanded on the company's transmission goals. The memo, a copy o=
f which Enron gave The Times last spring, called transmission failures a bi=
g reason ''the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not=
 yet reached consumers.''=20
The final energy report reflects some of Enron's positions. The administrat=
ion said it would urge federal regulators to promote open transmission. It =
also called for a new, self-regulatory body to oversee transmission grids, =
as Enron wanted.=20
Enron also asked the Bush administration to agree to seize private land for=
 construction of more transmission towers. The energy plan endorsed that id=
ea.=20
But the administration declined to pursue the most aggressive of Enron's re=
commendations. Enron wanted the states to lose any jurisdiction over transm=
ission and proposed to have federal regulators take full control because th=
ey would presumably break up regional monopolies. But the energy plan endor=
sed no such action.=20
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat whose inquiries pro=
mpted the General Accounting Office inquiry last spring, argues that Enron'=
s apparent influence was so sweeping that a thorough investigation was need=
ed into how the administration compiled the energy plan.=20
Last month, Mr. Waxman identified 17 items in the report that he said benef=
ited Enron. He added that ''numerous policies in the White House energy pla=
n are virtually identical to the positions Enron advocated.''=20
Yet some energy experts and lobbyists said that most of the items were not =
specific favors for Enron, but broad policy goals that reflected a consensu=
s of many energy companies, including Enron's competitors. When Enron's pol=
icy goals did not enjoy broad support, the company often struck out.=20
As a natural gas trader, Enron has long promoted the use of natural gas ove=
r coal. It has even advocated that the government cap carbon dioxide emissi=
ons by power plants as a way of encouraging utilities to switch to cleaner-=
burning natural gas. Enron also hoped to profit by trading emission rights.=
=20
The administration did not deliver for Enron on these counts.=20
On other issues, Enron's track record was uncertain. During the California =
energy crisis last year, the administration pleased Enron and other energy =
traders by taking a strong stand against caps on electricity prices. The ad=
ministration also selected two candidates backed by Mr. Lay to serve on the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees electricity trading.=
=20
But after the two Republican commissioners took office, they quickly adopte=
d a plan to impose price controls in California. Some experts argue that th=
is step eased price spikes and denied continued high trading profits to Enr=
on and other companies.=20
Still, some critics said that even if the substance of the administration's=
 energy policies did not always meet Enron's expectations, they often mirro=
red longstanding industry goals and neglected the concerns of environmental=
ists and consumer groups.=20
''It was the lips of industry to the ear of God,'' said Mark Cooper of the =
Consumer Federation of America. ''This is an issue about process more than =
substance.''

THE NATION THE FALL OF ENRON Despite Recession, Perks for Top Executives Gr=
ow Pay: Hidden benefits mushroom as employees' retirement plans shrink.
LIZ PULLIAM WESTON
TIMES STAFF WRITER

02/01/2002
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

The lavish retirement plans, low-interest loans and other perquisites showe=
red on Enron Corp. managers have put a spotlight on a growing corporate tre=
nd--one of ever-richer executive benefits packages whose costs often can be=
 hidden from shareholders.=20
Compensation experts say companies are increasingly using executives' benef=
its packages, which already are far more generous than those offered to ran=
k-and-file workers, as a way to quietly beef up total pay for top managers =
regardless of how their company performs.
Sumptuous paychecks for executives are nothing new. But shareholder activis=
ts say weak regulatory requirements, along with a faltering stock market, a=
re leading to unchecked growth in executive retirement plans and other bene=
fits even as lower-ranking workers face losses and cutbacks in their own pl=
ans.=20
"The trend has been [for executives] to be greedier and greedier, even thou=
gh there's a recession," said Cynthia Richson, director of corporate govern=
ance for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. "All this is designed to =
keep executives whole while the rank and file loses ground."=20
As many workers' 401(k) retirement plans shrink, executives at some compani=
es get guaranteed returns on their investments. Other companies pour hundre=
ds of millions into special executive-only retirement accounts. Firms also =
pay for big insurance policies and offer executives multimillion-dollar loa=
ns, complete with below-market interest rates and a company promise to forg=
ive some of the payments.=20
Unlike salaries, bonuses and stock options--which must be laid out in gover=
nment filings--the true cost of these benefits is often difficult, if not i=
mpossible, for outsiders to determine, said Ken Bertsch, director of corpor=
ate governance for TIAA-CREF, the world's largest pension fund manager.=20
For a variety of accounting and regulatory reasons, companies often are not=
 required to report the price tag for many of their executive benefits to t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission. When benefits are disclosed, their c=
osts can be tucked into footnotes or lumped into a catchall category of "ot=
her compensation," said Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, which =
tracks compensation trends.=20
The costs of many executive retirement plans are particularly easy to hide,=
 since companies have to reveal few details, compensation experts said.=20
"The regulatory disclosure rules are so weak, [companies] can get away with=
 one or two ambiguously worded sentences in the middle of a paragraph about=
 the rank-and-file [retirement] plan," Richson said.=20
These feeble disclosure requirements, combined with poor stock market perfo=
rmance, have spawned a cottage industry in the last year of compensation co=
nsultants who are promoting supplemental executive retirement arrangements,=
 benefits experts said. These plans are designed and promoted specifically =
as a way to enhance compensation that's "off the radar screen of shareholde=
rs," Richson and other compensation experts said.=20
Unlike stock options or bonuses, which are tied to the company's performanc=
e, executives benefit from these supplemental retirement plans whether or n=
ot the company does well.=20
Executives can lose these retirement benefits if the company declares bankr=
uptcy, since the plans are not protected by the government-run Pension Bene=
fit Guaranty Corp. But shareholder activists say most executives are at lit=
tle risk because relatively few companies actually go broke.=20
Companies say they need to offer ample benefits to attract and retain top-f=
light managers. In addition, many of the plans designed for rank-and-file w=
orkers don't provide enough retirement pay for executives used to living on=
 much higher salaries, compensation consultants said.=20
Traditional pension plans limit benefits to highly paid executives because =
the plans can take into account no more than $200,000 of salary when determ=
ining benefits. The IRS also requires companies to cap the 401(k) contribut=
ions of their highest-paid workers, so many executives are prevented from m=
aking the full $11,000 annual contributions the law otherwise allows.=20
About 60% of the executive retirement plans Mercer surveyed in 1998 made up=
 for the benefits that otherwise would have been lost to IRS rules, said Ja=
net M. Den Uyl, head of executive benefits and compensation for William M. =
Mercer Inc., a compensation consultant.=20
The 40% of companies that offer richer plans--either to all their executive=
s or to their top one or two leaders--often are trying to lure talent from =
other firms or prevent defections, Den Uyl said.=20
The richest arrangements of all, not surprisingly, are aimed at the compani=
es' top leaders.=20
"There's more license at the CEO level," Den Uyl said. Most CEOs already ha=
ve rich compensation packages, "and they're not ready to throw those away" =
when hired by a new company.=20
Here are some of the non-salary perks companies have made available to top =
managers:=20
* Guaranteed returns on investment. Top executives at Enron could contribut=
e salary and bonuses to so-called deferred compensation accounts with guara=
nteed minimum annual returns of 12%. Struggling telecom-equipment giant Luc=
ent Technologies Inc. has a similar plan that promises to pay five percenta=
ge points more than the 10-year Treasury rate. Currently, that Treasury rat=
e is about 5%, which means Lucent executives in the plan get a 10% return o=
n their investments.=20
Enron and Lucent are far from alone. About half the companies that offer de=
ferred compensation plans provide a guaranteed minimum return, according to=
 a Mercer study.=20
* Bigger company matches. The typical company match for a 401(k) defined co=
ntribution plan is 50 cents for every dollar the employee contributes, up t=
o 6% of the worker's salary. For a worker who takes full advantage of the c=
ompany match, the employer's contribution represents 3% of his or her pay, =
or $1,500 a year for a worker making $50,000.=20
The company contribution for an executive version of a 401(k) is typically =
60% higher. The average company contributes 5%, and nearly half of the comp=
anies surveyed contribute even more, the Mercer study found.=20
The dollar amounts contributed can be substantial. Intel Corp. contributed =
$1.3 million to the defined contribution accounts of its top five executive=
s in 2000, including nearly $400,000 to the account of Chief Executive Crai=
g R. Barrett, whose salary and bonuses that year totaled $3.4 million. But =
unlike many other firms, Intel makes such contributions for all of the abou=
t 10,000 employees whose ability to contribute to the regular 401(k) is res=
tricted, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said.=20
* Huge low-cost loans. SEC filings show telecom company Global Crossing Ltd=
., which filed for bankruptcy protection this week, made an $8-million loan=
 to then-Chief Executive Thomas J. Casey in November 2000 and a $1.8-millio=
n loan to President David Walsh in March 2001. Both loans were secured by t=
he executives' homes, but the interest rates they paid--6.01% for Casey, 4.=
75% for Walsh--were three to four percentage points below prevailing rates =
on standard home equity loans at the time.=20
Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, frequently tapped a $7.5-mi=
llion line of credit he could repay with company stock that Enron had given=
 him or that he had purchased with low-cost company-provided options. His p=
redecessor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was given a $2-million loan. Enron had off=
ered to forgive the payments if Skilling stayed with the company until Dec.=
 31, 2001, but he resigned Aug. 14.=20
* Lavish life insurance. Many workers get some life insurance through their=
 employers--typically $50,000 or one year's pay.=20
Executives can get much more. About one-quarter of companies in the Mercer =
study have special executive life insurance programs that typically pay for=
 coverage equal to three to four times the executives' annual pay.=20
Sometimes the benefit is much higher. In 2000, Cendant Corp., a travel and =
real estate company, paid $3.7 million in premiums on a $100-million life i=
nsurance policy for its chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, 60. Under the =
arrangement, known as a split-dollar policy, Cendant will recoup its premiu=
ms from the life insurance proceeds when Silverman dies, with Silverman's h=
eirs receiving the rest of the money, according to Cendant's latest SEC fil=
ing.=20
* Company-paid taxes. Companies pay a variety of tax bills for certain exec=
utives. When benefits are so great that they incur a tax bill from the IRS-=
-as they often do--some executives are given money to pay the tax. Because =
that cash payment also incurs income tax, companies often add an additional=
 sum to cover the extra tax--a process known as "grossing up."=20
Lucent Chairman Henry B. Schacht was given $57,325 to pay tax on "certain f=
ringe benefits" in 2000, according to the company's SEC filings. Ray R. Iri=
tani, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, was reimbursed $486,918 for =
taxes in 1999--and $95,000 for tax preparation services, SEC filings show.=
=20
* Fringe benefits. Other perks, such as the personal use of corporate jets,=
 company-provided chauffeurs and company-paid financial planning, can add t=
ens of thousands of dollars to an executive's total compensation.=20
The footnotes of Lucent's SEC filings show the company paid $26,351 for per=
sonal financial planning advice for Schacht in a year in which he received =
a $1.1-million paycheck. At Enron, Lay's personal use of a corporate jet in=
 2000 was worth $334,179.=20
Shareholder activists note that many of the most lavish arrangements have b=
een uncovered at companies that have since hit hard times--among them Enron=
, whose compensation philosophy, according to SEC filings, was "to reward e=
xecutive performance that creates long-term shareholder value."=20
"At a minimum, it's inconsistent for companies and executives to just keep =
feasting" when financial performance falters, stock prices drop and other e=
mployees face cutbacks, Richson, of the Wisconsin Investment Board, said. "=
It's bordering on unethical."

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Scribbler's Ethics

02/01/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the fall of Enron, public and professional ethics are back in the news=
, including the mores of journalists and including our own. So maybe it's a=
 good time to rescue ethical behavior from the professional ethicists.=20
We've come in for criticism lately because one of our contributors, the Bri=
tish conservative writer Roger Scruton, wrote an essay for our European edi=
tion while being paid by a Japanese tobacco company. The British Guardian t=
urned up an e-mail in the name of his wife and business partner Sophie to J=
apan Tobacco proposing an increase in their retainer, in return for placing=
 articles in the "WSJ, the Times, the Telegraph, the Spectator, the Financi=
al Times, the Economist" and so on.
Now, Professor Scruton -- a free-marketeer with well-known views -- was a c=
ontributor for us long before he took a dime from Big Tobacco. His point of=
 view is of course precisely why the left-wing Guardian wants to portray hi=
m as tainted by filthy lucre. These are the same ethicists who lack the sam=
e passion for disclosure when it comes to finding out, for example, whether=
 Ralph Nader is financed by trial lawyers.=20
Our own view is that the financing of the advocate matters far less than th=
e quality of the advocacy. But our long-time standard is also that such fin=
ancial ties should be disclosed, so readers can make up their own minds. Mr=
. Scruton had an obligation to tell us and his readers about his tobacco fi=
nancing when he was writing about tobacco issues; he didn't, and so he will=
 be taking a holiday from our pages.=20
Meanwhile, the Internet ethicist, Andrew Sullivan, has been denouncing any =
journalist who's ever taken a dollar from Enron. This includes our contribu=
tor Peggy Noonan, who disclosed last week in her OpinionJournal.com column =
that she billed Enron $250 an hour for 100 to 200 hours of speech-writing w=
ork. In other words, she got paid like any other contract employee, which i=
s called business between consenting adults. The first time she wrote about=
 Enron for us was also when she disclosed her Enron fees, so she has nothin=
g to apologize for.=20
Certainly not to Mr. Sullivan, who recently wrote a fine piece for this pag=
e on the failure of Talk magazine but then without asking re-sold the artic=
le to the Times of London, which didn't bother to give us credit. Mr. Sulli=
van's explanation is that he didn't think we had international publication =
rights, although The Wall Street Journal Europe is distributed in London. L=
eaving aside the fine points of copyright law, Mr. Sullivan's behavior may =
not have been "unethical" but it wasn't very nice.=20
Which brings us to a larger point this page has often made about conflicts =
of interest and honesty. Avoiding the first is not the same as the latter; =
sometimes persnickety rules can become a license for larger dishonesty. So,=
 for example, the U.S. Senate poses as a more honest place because it passe=
s a ban on accepting gifts. But then New Jersey Senator Bob Torricelli is a=
ble to evade the ban by claiming that the Italian suits he received from a =
campaign contributor were from a "friend," a legal loophole.=20
The same applies to intellectual honesty in journalism. At least Mr. Scruto=
n, whatever his disclosure oversight, took money from people he agrees with=
. But New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has recently given himself a fr=
ee ethical pass because he says he disclosed his former Enron ties once he =
became a columnist.=20
Mr. Krugman wrote a puff piece on the company for Fortune magazine while he=
 was getting $50,000 as an Enron adviser, but he now denounces politicians =
and anyone else close to Enron for "crony capitalism." We'll let our reader=
s judge the ethics of that.

Despite the accurate reporting of The Post about the nature of the phone ca=

an altered the facts in his op-ed column of Jan. 24.=20
Predictably, his misrepresentation has been repeated on television by his n=

To repeat information that I volunteered earlier, the two-minute phone call=

of an economic stimulus bill.=20
Contrary to Rep. Waxman and Terry McAuliffe, no lobbying occurred. In fact,=
 the provision to make the corporate alternative minimum tax relief retroac=

FORUM IN NEW YORK: PROTESTERS
Paper Giants As a Voice For Ideas
By ANDREW JACOBS

02/01/2002
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Looking like an arts and crafts teacher who had been dropped into a Fellini=
 film, David Taylor was struggling to clothe a papier-mache giant and simul=
taneously direct paint-splattered volunteers when yet another reporter aske=
d the question: Were he and his fellow protesters planning to clash with th=
e police over the next few days? Mr. Taylor, a 24-year-old computer program=
mer from Oakland, Calif., put down the puppet he was wrestling and tried to=
 stifle his indignation.=20
''If you want to know what those young crazy radical activists are up to, y=
ou've come to the right place,'' he said, glancing around a vast industrial=
 space buzzing with politically minded artisans and packed with their handi=
work. ''I'm really getting sick of that question.''
While the police on the streets seemed to be steeling themselves for civic =
unrest, the atmosphere yesterday morning inside the garage, along the West =
Side Highway at 57th Street, was anything but martial. The message from Mr.=
 Taylor and two dozen other volunteers was clear: make art, not war.=20
There was, however, a looming sense of panic as the hours passed and the af=
ternoon debut of this cardboard pageantry neared. There were robber-baron s=
tyle top hats bearing the words ''WEF: We Are All En-Wrong'' and beachball-=
sized wine goblets painted like globes that read ''Earth For Sale.'' A blow=
n-up photograph of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman and chief executive =
of Enron, leaned against a pillar, not far from a row of huge pretzels, an =
apparent reference to the snack food that recently felled President Bush as=
 he watched a football game.=20
Over the past week, scores of volunteers from across the country have been =
flocking to the space to glue, paint and stitch together props that will an=
imate the street protests accompanying the World Economic Forum. Two New Yo=
rk organizations, Arts in Action and Time's Up, helped put together the mak=
eshift workshop.=20
But alongside the levity yesterday afternoon there was an undercurrent of f=
ear. Many of those planning to join the protests said they were worried abo=
ut the potential for violence at the hands of the police. Others said they =
were frustrated by journalists' single-minded focus on the potential for Se=
attle-style disturbances. ''We're not out there to fight with the police,''=
 said Payal Parekh, 28, an oceanography graduate student from Boston who wa=
s helping to organize the puppet making. ''We're trying to get our voices h=
eard but the media is obsessed with security issues.''=20
Whether or not their fears are real, even those organizing the puppet works=
hop were not taking any chances. Bill DiPaola of Time's Up tried to find a =
backup location, just in case something were to go awry. ''You can't be too=
 careful about these things,'' he said.=20
Still, with the demonstration at the Gap at 54th Street near Fifth Avenue a=
lready under way, there were more pressing concerns. Clapping to get the ro=
om's attention, someone urged the crowd at the garage to head east and ''he=
lp animate the images we created.'' A pickup truck was loaded with props; e=
veryone else took the crosstown bus. Ten minutes later, the truck pulled up=
 to the curb at 54th Street and into the arms of the police. ''I promise th=
ere are no rocks or bottles,'' one woman joked to an officer who was visibl=
y suspicious. ''It's just a bunch of goofy puppets.'' After a brief verbal =
tussle and a few tense moments, the police relented, gave the group five mi=
nutes to unload and everyone, it seemed, was happy.
