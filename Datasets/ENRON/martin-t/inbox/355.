Sorry I've been so absent. My weekends have pretty
much just been catching up on my chores. I'd love to
have dinner with you either Sat.10/20 or 10/27.
I'm house sitting at Barb & Rick's this week
(281/482-8069) and then at Michael's next week
(713/868-9776). I'll be at Ken & Mary Ann's on the
Saturdays.
Also I would like to do Halloween with ya'll, if
you're gonna do your usual trick or treating. Maybe
I'll catch up with Tom downtown and take the HOV home
with him that day.
See ya soon!
Love,
Mary
