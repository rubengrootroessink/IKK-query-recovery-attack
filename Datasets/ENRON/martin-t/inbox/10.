Cena is on staff with Homeinstead.  She is primarily a chauffeur.  She has driven for Mom and Dad before and they really like her.

All-
Mom and Dad have fired Joycelyn.  I don't need to go into the details, her
personality is unbearable!  I have asked Homeinstead to provide another
caregiver from the hours of 2-6pm, M, W, F.  With Cena providing
transportation for all doctor appointments and Mom's standing hair
appointments on Fridays.  I have stressed to Homeinstead that they need to
take the time to find the right person for Mom and Dad because the hours
could expand if they would find the right person.
Love, Margaret
