Gary,


I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.  The hedges 
that we have used before have worked well because we have had very warm 
winters and have correlated very well with Entex takes.  I am not as 
confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment 
which is the forecast for this winter.  

Tom
