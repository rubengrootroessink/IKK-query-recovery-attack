Jim,

It shouldn't matter one way or another, but since Dave has the $8MM operating 
cost number in his head, lets move it after the budget presentation unless 
Tom objects.

Regards,
Brian

Brian 
Attached below is Gas Control's Cost Center Budget totalling $1.3mm.  This is 
currently in Tom Martin's Budget and not in your $8mm HPL direct cost 
budget.  We can either move this from Tom's budget prior to or after your's 
and Tom's budget presentations with Dave.  He just needs to know if and when 
we do this that it is not in your $8mm.

Tom,

Below,  please find the submittal/template for  James Mckay and Gary Hanks' 
team expenses for 2001. They were combined into one cost center. If we do 
intend to roll Gas control into HPL we will need two separate team 
submittals. From then on it should be a simple transfer of budget plans. Do 
call me at ext. 37755 if you have any questions. Thanks in advance.

Jackie

Jacquelyn,

Attached is the 2001 Budget for the combined groups of myself and Gary Hanks, 
old RC's 0818 and 0332 respectively and new cost centers 105977 and 105975.  
I want to role the combined group under the new cost center 105977.  I had 
asked to do this for 2001 earlier in the summer and never heard a reply.  
Please feel free to call if you have any questions and I am sorry for being a 
few days late.

James
