Hi Jeff,
 
Becky said she faxed a request for the Klein High pool and followed up with a phone call.  She was given no indication that someone else had already put in a request and our request was already on the coach's desk.  The school did indicate that pool fees are going up Jan 1, 2002.  I'm sure that will show up on the contract they send us.  They will send the contract to Becky Miller (Oak Creek Village) and she will call me when she receives it.  See you at the pool!
