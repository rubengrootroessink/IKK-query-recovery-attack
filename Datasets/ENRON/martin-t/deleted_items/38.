Ousted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay could get a severance package w=
orth at least $25 million--and perhaps exceeding $51 million--although his =
ability to collect that payday is clouded by the company's Chapter 11 bankr=
uptcy filing.=20
Lay, who resigned Wednesday under fire, also could get parting gifts that i=
nclude a lifetime annual pension of nearly $475,000, a $12-million life ins=
urance policy and payment of taxes on any severance pay.
But Lay may never see a dime because, with most of Enron Corp.'s operations=
 tangled in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, he slipped overnight from corporate comm=
ander to yet another among the thousands of Enron creditors.=20
"I would be incredulous if he got any money, and if he did take any money h=
e'd be spending the entire amount on bodyguards," compensation expert Graef=
 Crystal said.=20
Lay, who received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 1=
999, has been accused of misleading shareholders about Enron's finances as =
it plunged toward ruin last year.=20
In his 15 years building Enron from a small pipeline company to the world's=
 largest energy trader, Lay was paid handsomely, and his severance agreemen=
t and other benefits reflect that, according to documents on file with the =
Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Exactly how much Lay might receive in severance is only vaguely spelled out=
 in Enron's most recent proxy statement, filed with the SEC in March. Enron=
 representatives declined to clarify the matter and hinted that the payout =
might not be a sure thing.=20
"The terms of Mr. Lay's separation are still being determined," Enron spoke=
sman Vance Meyer said.=20
Three Times His Salary and Bonus, Plus=20
Lay's severance is based on payments he received in 2000, multiplied by the=
 three full calendar years left on his contract. That means Lay would be en=
titled to a lump sum of about $25 million, or three times his 2000 salary o=
f $1.3 million and bonus of $7 million.=20
That $25-million tab would be further swelled by an unspecified "long-term =
grant value" received in 2000, according to the proxy statement. Compensati=
on experts said that could include the $7.5 million of restricted stock and=
 a $1.2-million cash payment that Lay also received in 2000, which Enron ca=
lled "long-term compensation."=20
If that assessment is correct, the total payout would be $51 million.=20
The SEC filing also said that Lay is entitled to a lifetime pension that wo=
uld have been valued at $475,042 if Lay, 59, had stayed until 65. In additi=
on, the company said it would pay all taxes on Lay's severance if the IRS r=
ules that the severance package is an "excess parachute payment."=20
What is more, Lay, as of the end of 2001, owns a $12-million life insurance=
 policy that Enron helped him buy, according to Lay's 1996 employment agree=
ment, also filed with the SEC.=20
Lay also remains as an Enron director, and they are paid at least $50,000 a=
 year.=20
Compensation experts said it is unlikely Lay will get his severance package=
 and most of his pension because all preexisting contracts are invalidated =
by the bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lay technically resigned, rather=
 than being terminated. But the refusal of the company to rule out a severa=
nce is "troublesome," Crystal said.=20
In any event, even as Enron was hiding losses in a murky series of off-the-=
books partnerships and using questionable accounting on its way to the nati=
on's largest bankruptcy filing, the company served another purpose that nea=
rly was hidden from public view: It effectively was a personal bank for Ken=
 Lay.=20
The company last year provided Lay with an unusual line of credit of as muc=
h as $7.5 million that he used repeatedly, often to help cover soured inves=
tments he made elsewhere, his lawyer has said. This despite the fact that L=
ay has received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 199=
9.=20
And the collateral securing the line of credit apparently was Lay's own Enr=
on stock, shares of which were showered on him by the thousands either dire=
ctly or through stock options that were part of his compensation package du=
ring Enron's explosive growth in the late 1990s.=20
Lay typically repaid the credit line with his Enron shares, then would draw=
 down the loan again and repeat the process, Earl Silbert, Lay's lawyer, sa=
id. Lay did this on 15 occasions between February and October, just as Enro=
n's collapse was accelerating.=20
Lay Expected to Face Huge Legal Bills=20
Lay's apparent financial problems, signaled by his repeated tapping of the =
credit line, are compounded by the specter of huge personal legal bills fac=
ing him. Lay is the subject of more than 50 lawsuits resulting from Enron's=
 financial meltdown, as well as numerous federal investigations.=20
His credit line is a perk that has surprised several experts in executive c=
ompensation, a field already chock-full of various stock options, bonuses a=
nd other benefits paid to Corporate America's leaders.=20
To have a standing credit line for an executive who can pay back the loan w=
ith stock the company has awarded him is "very unusual," said Alan Johnson,=
 managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consultant in New =
York. The arrangement, approved by Enron's board, allowed Lay "to treat the=
 company as a personal piggy bank," he said.=20
Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at Salary.com, an Inter=
net compensation site, said that "there is something fundamentally odd abou=
t a company loaning money to an executive and collateralizing it with the c=
ompany's own stock."=20
"Why is Enron in the business of loaning money?" he asked.=20
Company Loans to Top Management=20
It is common for a company to make one-time loans to senior managers--say t=
o help them relocate or to buy the company's shares. Sometimes corporations=
 will even waive the interest, or total repayment, as part of the executive=
's future compensation. Indeed, Enron in 1997 made a $4-million loan to Jef=
frey K. Skilling, its chief executive who abruptly quit in August.=20
Also, the dollar amount of Lay's credit line isn't sizable relative to the =
billions of dollars of debt that sank Enron. After a series of financial se=
tbacks that sent its stock plunging and eroded investors' confidence, Enron=
 filed for Bankruptcy Court protection Dec. 2, citing more than $31 billion=
 in debt and $50 billion in assets.=20
The stock, which traded around $80 a share a year ago, now trades for just =
pennies, and the options that Lay and others still have are virtually worth=
less.=20
Silbert did not return calls requesting elaboration on Lay's arrangement, a=
nd Enron spokesman Meyer said he could provide no further details.=20
No one has suggested that Lay's arrangement involved any wrongdoing, and En=
ron's proxy statement last year disclosed--in two sentences--that the credi=
t line existed. About the same time that the proxy appeared, in March, was =
when Lay was starting to use the credit line repeatedly.=20
He typically repaid it by returning shares of his Enron stock to the compan=
y, said Silbert, who said he made the public disclosure to offset speculati=
on that Lay was aggressively dumping shares because the executive knew the =
company was headed toward disaster.=20
But that disclosure--coming on top of so many other revelations, including =
that some top Enron executives had financial interests in partnerships that=
 helped finance Enron's operations--adds to the appearance that "there is a=
n awful lot of self-dealing going on in this case, and this is symptomatic =
of that," said Rajesh Aggarwal, an assistant business professor at Dartmout=
h College.=20
In September, at the same time Lay was using his Enron stock to support his=
 line of credit, he urged company employees to buy more shares only weeks b=
efore Enron disclosed the worst financial results in its history.=20
The stock then was selling for about $25 a share, and two months later for =
$4 a share. The stock's collapse wiped out billions of dollars of investor =
holdings and the retirement savings of Enron employees who owned the stock.=
=20
In general, Lay's credit-line arrangement "is not one that's shareholder fr=
iendly," said Salary.com's Coleman. The whole point of executive compensati=
on is to give top managers incentives to build the company and boost its st=
ock price for all shareholders, he said, yet Lay's credit line gave him pro=
tection from having to reach into his own wallet even when Enron's stock no=
se-dived.=20
"He doesn't get hurt," Coleman said.=20
The credit line served another purpose not afforded the average Enron stock=
holder, said Kevin Murphy, a finance professor at USC. Letting Lay repay hi=
s credit line with Enron stock "allowed him to get liquidity out of his sto=
ck that was easier than going to the open market," he said. In other words,=
 Lay didn't have to first sell $4 million or so of Enron shares on the stoc=
k exchange--an event that likely would have depressed Enron's price on the =
market--each time to pay back his Enron loans.=20
"That gives him an advantage that most stockholders don't have," Murphy sai=
d.=20
The credit line also raises questions about the amount of risk Lay was pers=
onally accepting at the same time he was leading Enron's fight for survival=
.=20
It's unclear why, in light of his enormous compensation at Enron, he was ha=
ving to repeatedly tap his credit line.=20
Besides his salary and bonuses, Lay realized $43.8 million from stock optio=
ns that he cashed in during 1999, and $123.4 million from exercising option=
s in 2000, according to Enron's government filings.=20
Lay sometimes borrowed from his Enron line of credit last year when he expe=
cted to face margin calls from other lenders, Silbert has said. That meant =
he had bought other investments partly with borrowed funds--or on "margin"-=
-and now had to repay some or all of those amounts because their underlying=
 investments had tumbled in value.=20
Lay recently put several properties up for sale, including vacation homes i=
n Aspen, Colo.=20
Now that Lay is gone, Enron is searching for a restructuring specialist to =
run the company. Sources close to the company said an interim chief executi=
ve will be announced in the next few days.=20
Enron reportedly has narrowed the candidates for its interim chief executiv=
e, and the front-runners are three New York companies that specialize in co=
rporate turnarounds, according to Bloomberg News. Those companies--Alvarez =
& Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper--all declined to comment.=20

Accounting for Enron: Enron's Top Choice For Acting CEO Is Stephen Cooper

Reorganization specialist Stephen F. Cooper is the front-runner to be named=
 acting chief executive of Enron Corp., following the resignation earlier t=
his week of Kenneth Lay as chairman and CEO, people close to the matter sai=
d.=20
Mr. Cooper, a managing principal of Zolfo Cooper, a 20-year-old consulting =
firm that specializes in bankruptcy reorganization, is set to fly to Housto=
n from New York today along with Tom Roberts, Enron's counsel at Weil Gotsc=
hal & Manges, these people said.
Mr. Cooper, who couldn't be reached, is scheduled to meet with senior manag=
ement during the next few days. Enron's board could confirm his appointment=
 as soon as today, but more likely will act during the weekend. Mr. Cooper,=
 who has worked with Federated Department Stores Inc., Morrison Knudsen Cor=
p. and a host of other companies, "is one of those guys who's done bankrupt=
cies his whole life," said one person familiar with the situation. "You don=
't want somebody learning on the job with a bankruptcy this big."=20
If Mr. Cooper is named, the board next will turn its attention to finding a=
 chairman.=20
While Enron wants a chief executive who will manage its complicated day-to-=
day operations and shepherd the firm through bankruptcy, which it entered o=
n Dec. 2, the board is seeking a chairman who can play a different role. On=
e person said the chairman's post -- for which there is no clear front-runn=
er yet -- will be offered to someone who can act as the company's ambassado=
r to Washington, where Enron is being investigated by nine congressional co=
mmittees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission=
.=20
Mr. Lay stepped down at the request of Enron's bankruptcy creditors' commit=
tee after it said it had lost faith in the energy company's management. Who=
ever is named as CEO is expected to work closely with Chief Financial Offic=
er Jeffrey McMahon, who has been the firm's public face in recent weeks aft=
er the departure of Enron's former finance chief, Andrew Fastow.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE COMPANY'S FUTURE
Trying to Salvage What Can Be Salvaged While the Creditors Line Up
By NEELA BANERJEE

Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

When he resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron on Wednesday unde=
r pressure from outside creditors, Kenneth L. Lay said he was stepping asid=
e to ensure the survival of the company. But as Enron tries to sort through=
 creditors' claims and to tally the billions of dollars in debt parked off =
its balance sheet, its chances of surviving, even in a greatly diminished f=
orm, remain far from certain.=20
The creditors' committee, which represents the big banks and other companie=
s Enron owes, wants to extract the greatest value from the assets remaining=
. So do the company's own lawyers. But to do so probably will require selli=
ng off most, if not all, of what the company still owns, industry analysts =
and energy executives said.
''There's a high likelihood that it just gets liquidated and never gets out=
 of Chapter 11,'' said Andre Meade, a senior energy analyst with Commerzban=
k. ''Enron doesn't have a business with a critical mass that it could be re=
organized around.''=20
The company is moving quickly to hire an outside executive who specializes =
in restructuring bankrupt companies, said Martin J. Bienenstock of Weil Got=
shal & Manges, the law firm that is representing Enron in the bankruptcy pr=
oceedings. Mr. Bienenstock declined to identify the candidates for the job.=
 But he said the list had been narrowed to three executives, at most, and t=
hat Enron would probably announce its decision in less than a week.=20
Right now, Enron is being run day to day by Jeffrey McMahon, who was elevat=
ed to chief financial officer to replace Andrew S. Fastow, who was forced o=
ut last fall after his role in managing the off-the-books partnerships that=
 contributed to Enron's fall came to light.=20
Mr. McMahon is working alongside Raymond M. Bowen Jr., the treasurer, and S=
tan Horton, who is in charge of gas pipeline operations.=20
''The creditors' committee thinks this is a step in the right direction to =
maximize value for all creditors,'' said Luc Despins of Milbank Tweed Hadle=
y & McCloy, which represents the committee.=20
Exactly how Enron's value will be maximized at the hands of its lawyers and=
 creditors will determine the future shape of the company. When it filed fo=
r bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, Enron reported that it had $50 billion i=
n assets and $31 billion in debt. But many industry experts are skeptical o=
f the claims that its assets are fairly valued, given how misleading Enron'=
s accounting has turned out to be.=20
Moreover, the reported debt does not include transactions that were kept of=
f the books by the company to inflate its profits, Mr. Bienenstock said. Th=
e $50 billion in assets includes contracts in its trading and power marketi=
ng businesses, industry analysts said. But with its trading operation paral=
yzed ever since the bankruptcy, no one knows what those deals are really wo=
rth.=20
The sell-off at Enron has already begun. The company recently turned over i=
ts energy trading business to UBS Warburg. In return for assuming the contr=
acts of about 600 employees and acquiring things like computers and proprie=
tary software, UBS Warburg will give Enron a third of its profits over the =
next 10 years, although it has an option to buy out Enron's claim early. It=
 made no upfront payments.=20
Enron still owns the network of natural gas pipelines that it began with in=
 the mid-1980's. But that business, while profitable, is far smaller than t=
he other units at the company. It also has a utility in Portland, Ore., tha=
t is being sold. Enron's overseas holdings, widely considered money-losers,=
 include a troubled power plant in Dabhol, India, and a utility in Argentin=
a.=20
''The main business, the one anyone would really care about -- their tradin=
g business -- they sold to UBS,'' said Gordon Howald, an energy analyst wit=
h Credit Lyonnais. ''Their international portfolio is horrible. Their broad=
band business has been disbanded. There is very, very little of value left.=
''=20
But Mr. Bienenstock contended that through a mix of asset sales and consoli=
dation of remaining business, some version of Enron can still survive. Enro=
n's lawyers are discussing with the creditors' committee the best way to se=
ll those businesses that they think are worth the most intact while trying =
to rebuild others that might bring profits and revenue in the future. Those=
 remaining businesses would form the core of a new company in which credito=
rs would receive equity positions.=20
At the same time, Enron faces a sea of shareholder and employee losses. Mr.=
 Bienenstock said those suing for mismanagement of 401(k) retirement accoun=
ts would have the same rights as creditors with unsecured debt. But those c=
harging stock fraud would be at the back of the creditors' line, along with=
 Enron shareholders. Still, such plaintiffs retain the right to pursue laws=
uits against Arthur Andersen and individual officers and board members of E=
nron.=20
''The creditors' committee is economically rational,'' Mr. Bienenstock said=
, explaining why he does not think that Enron will melt away in a fire sale=
. ''If the shares in a reorganized company are more valuable than selling t=
he assets immediately, the creditors will take the shares.''

Andersen Knew of `Fraud' Risk at Enron --- October E-Mail Shows Firm Antici=
pated Problems Before Company's Fall
By Tom Hamburger and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/25/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Arthur Andersen LLP analysts determined during the fall that there was sign=
ificantly "heightened risk of financial-statement fraud" at Enron Corp., a =
newly released document shows.=20
That determination came from a test on the Houston energy company's financi=
al statements described in an Oct. 9 e-mail sent by Mark Zajac, a risk-mana=
gement employee in Chicago, to Andersen auditors on the Enron account. Mich=
igan Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerc=
e Committee, released the e-mail as the panel's investigations subcommittee=
 opened hearings on Enron's collapse.
At the hearing, which focused on document destruction at Andersen, firm exe=
cutives acknowledged that they retained a law firm in early October in part=
 because they feared being sued over Enron -- but waited another month befo=
re telling the Houston office to preserve Enron-related documents.=20
Andersen's lead Enron auditor, David Duncan, was fired this month for alleg=
edly overseeing a massive document-destruction effort after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission opened an inquiry into Enron's accounting practices=
 in late October. Yesterday, Andersen acknowledged that personnel outside H=
ouston also destroyed documents.=20
The Zajac e-mail provides another indication that Mr. Duncan and other Ande=
rsen auditors were increasingly uncomfortable with Enron's practices as it =
spiraled toward collapse. The e-mail also offers a clue to Mr. Duncan's sta=
te of mind as he and his subordinates were shredding documents. The e-mail =
was dated a week before a previously disclosed Oct. 15 memo that recounted =
Mr. Duncan warning Enron that its upcoming third-quarter earnings announcem=
ent might be misleading. The Oct. 16 earnings news release characterized $1=
.01 billion of losses as "nonrecurring charges," a characterization Mr. Dun=
can opposed.=20
Mr. Zajac's analysis was based on a "financial statement fraud risk identif=
ication" test. Such tests are routine in auditing, but the Enron results we=
ren't. Mr. Zajac wrote that a complete test was impossible because sufficie=
nt data about administrative expenses were lacking. But a test of the rest =
of Enron's financial statements triggered a "red alert: a heightened risk o=
f financial fraud." Mr. Zajac's e-mail explained that such red alerts somet=
imes are false alarms, but must be taken seriously because the risk of frau=
d is "significantly heightened."=20
The results were relayed to Mr. Duncan a month before Enron announced on No=
v. 19 that it would restate its financial statements going back to 1997, cu=
mulatively reducing earnings by nearly $600 million. "In the context of the=
 Enron debacle, this is tantamount to yelling that the barn door is open lo=
ng after the horses have fled the scene and shown up in the next county," R=
ep. Dingell wrote in a letter to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino =
inquiring about the matter.=20
Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said he didn't know what actions its aud=
itors took to address the "red alert." But he emphasized that Andersen had =
been conducting the particular test referred to in the e-mail only "on an e=
xperimental basis" since 2000 and that past runs "have shown that it needs =
further refinement," especially when applied to companies such as Enron.=20
At the hearing, Andersen officials continued to pin responsibility for the =
shredding on Mr. Duncan and his Houston team, but committee members peppere=
d them with questions and evidence aimed at shifting the blame toward Chica=
go headquarters.=20
Andersen's internal "investigation indicated that [Mr. Duncan] directed the=
 purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents," said C.=
E. Andrews, Andersen's global managing partner. "This is the kind of conduc=
t that Andersen cannot tolerate."=20
Subcommittee Chairman James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, remained =
skeptical as the hearing closed: "What I got after four hours here is a lar=
ger question of whether Mr. Duncan is a fall guy for others at Arthur Ander=
sen."=20
The hearing provided the most detailed chronology yet of the circumstances =
surrounding the document destruction.=20
Members focused much of their questioning on the decision to hire the New Y=
ork law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, which was retained Oct. 9 -- the sam=
e day as Mr. Zajac's e-mail about financial fraud -- and now represents And=
ersen in Enron litigation. Mr. Andrews said the firm was retained to help d=
eal with Enron financial-reporting issues as well as "possible litigation."=
 By then, headquarters officials already were aware of a whistleblower's al=
legations of possible fraud at Enron.=20
On Oct. 12, Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent an e-mail from Chicago to r=
emind the Houston office of the firm's document-retention policy, which cal=
ls for preserving final audit papers but destroying nearly all other record=
s unless litigation is "threatened." By about that time, Ms. Temple testifi=
ed she had learned of the whistleblower's allegations, too, but she rejecte=
d suggestions that the reminder amounted to a document-destruction order. S=
he insisted she was merely responding to questions in prior conference call=
s "about how to appropriately document several different matters."=20
Three days after sending that e-mail, Ms. Temple had her first discussions =
with lawyers from Davis Polk about the Enron matter, which included documen=
t-retention issues. That same day, Ms. Temple asked the Houston office in a=
n e-mail to remove her name from a draft memo, in part because she didn't w=
ant to be called as a "witness." Ms. Temple explained that she was afraid t=
hat, because the memo discussed advice she offered, the inclusion of a refe=
rence to her might breach attorney-client privilege.=20
On Oct. 22, the SEC announced an informal inquiry into Enron. The next day,=
 Ms. Temple testified, she and Mr. Duncan talked by telephone. Ms. Temple s=
aid her notes indicate that Mr. Duncan said Andersen personnel were "trying=
 to gather all docs re transactions from around the world."=20
"Do your notes indicate that the documents were gathered and preserved or s=
imply gathered?" Colorado Democratic Rep. Diane DeGette asked, prompting la=
ughter. Ms. Temple responded that she understood Mr. Duncan to mean gathere=
d "in one place to have it available."=20
In fact, that was the day that, according to Andersen's account, Mr. Duncan=
 called an urgent meeting of the Enron team that led to widespread destruct=
ion of documents. Before declining to testify, he told committee investigat=
ors that he provided his team with copies of Andersen's document policy but=
 didn't directly order document destruction, according to an account releas=
ed by the panel. A follow-up memo from another Houston manager the next day=
 advised "everyone to do what is necessary to adhere to the guidelines" and=
 to work overtime if necessary to do so.=20
Buried in the Andersen officials' written testimony -- but not read aloud a=
t the hearing -- was an acknowledgment that "Enron-related documents were d=
estroyed by others" outside Mr. Duncan's team. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen sp=
okesman, confirmed that personnel outside Houston also disposed of Enron-re=
lated items -- mostly e-mails that the firm expect to recover -- but he dec=
lined to say which other offices were involved or if Chicago was one of the=
m.=20
It was only after Andersen received an SEC subpoena Nov. 8 that Ms. Temple =
sent Houston a memo advising all employees to preserve all Enron-related do=
cuments.=20
Asked why she waited so long, Ms. Temple said it was company policy to send=
 out such advisories whenever a subpoena was received. Otherwise, Ms. Templ=
e and Mr. Andrews testified, account executives -- in this case, Mr. Duncan=
 -- are expected to make reasonable judgments. "The responsibility for that=
 rests with the engagement partner," Mr. Andrews said.=20
"I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents," Ms. Temple t=
estified. "And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we =
could have consulted and addressed the situation."=20
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full committee, urged Andersen to recons=
ider its policy of leaving such matters to auditors. "If all your policies =
are to let accountants decide when it is legal to destroy documents in a pe=
nding investigation, an awful lot of people are going to be in trouble down=
 the road," he said. "If you don't change it, I promise you, we will."

October memo warned of 'heightened risk' of fraud=20
Firm draws fire for delay before halt of shredding=20
Compiled from staff and wire reports=20
Jan. 25, 2002, 9:10AM
WASHINGTON (Houston Chronicle) -- Some officials at Arthur Andersen were wo=
rried about a "heightened risk" of fraud in Enron's books a week before the=
 energy company shocked stockholders with huge losses, an auditor's memo fr=
om last October shows.=20
The e-mail by Andersen auditor Mark Zajac warned that a computer analysis o=
f Enron's financial activities in the third quarter of last year indicated =
"a red alert: a heightened risk of financial statement fraud," according to=
 investigators.=20
The document, released by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added to mounting evi=
dence that Enron's outside accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enro=
n business practices.=20
"We have considerable rascality," Dingell, ranking Democrat on the House Co=
mmerce Committee, summed up today on CBS's The Early Show. "We have to find=
 out who is at fault for what."=20
But a House hearing Thursday into the Enron Corp. collapse left lawmakers s=
till certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by En=
ron's blue-ribbon accounting firm.=20
Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to s=
tifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a Commerce subc=
ommittee concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps mo=
st devastating bankruptcy in history.=20
A week after the "red alert" memo, Enron reported a $638 million third-quar=
ter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, part=
ly because of hidden debt built up by a complex web of partnerships.=20
On the same day that Zajac wrote his memo to the head of the Enron auditing=
 team, Andersen also hired a law firm in anticipation of possible lawsuits =
involving Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that spiraled into bankrupt=
cy Dec. 2.=20
Andersen played down the significance of the computer analysis. And Zajac i=
n the memo acknowledged the system produces "false alarms."=20
Lawmakers on Thursday ferociously criticized Arthur Andersen for waiting we=
eks after a federal investigation was under way before halting in-house des=
truction of Enron documents. Andersen executives in turn tried to blame fir=
ed auditor David Duncan for sole responsibility in the shredding -- a claim=
 met with skepticism by House inquisitors.=20
Duncan, denied immunity by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, appeare=
d briefly before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, where he=
 twice invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.=20
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen provided the getaway ca=
r, and they say you were at the wheel," said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., aft=
er Duncan took his seat at the witness table.=20
A tense-looking Duncan, flanked by his lawyers, informed the committee he w=
ouldn't be answering any questions.=20
"I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my =
counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protecti=
on afforded me under the Constitution of the United States," Duncan said.=
=20
The exchange kicked off a new round of congressional hearings into the coll=
apse of Enron and the involvement of its former auditors at Andersen.=20
On the other side of Capitol Hill, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committe=
e was hearing from former SEC officials and academic experts on whether Enr=
on's troubles should have been spotted earlier and how to strengthen curren=
t safeguards.=20
The two panels are among at least nine looking into various aspects of what=
 lawmakers are calling the Enron debacle.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also are in=
vestigating, and the Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.=20
At the House subcommittee hearing, lawmakers repeatedly grilled Andersen at=
torney Nancy Temple about why she waited until Nov. 10 to instruct employee=
s to start saving Enron documents.=20
As early as Oct. 9, Andersen had hired an outside law firm in anticipation =
of possible litigation in the Enron matter, lawmakers said.=20
Enron's highly public financial free fall began Oct. 15, when the company r=
eported more than $600 million in quarterly losses and a $1.2 billion reduc=
tion in shareholder equity.=20
Enron also had disclosed as early as Oct. 22 that the SEC was probing its b=
ooks.=20
Gesturing dramatically and thumping his desk in the hearing room, Rep. W. J=
. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., chair of the committee, asked Temple why she was s=
ilent for so long about the need to preserve documents.=20
"I never counseled any shredding or destruction of documents. I only wish s=
omeone had raised the question," Temple said.=20
Tauzin fired back, "Does anybody have to raise it, or is it somebody's resp=
onsibility in the company to raise it themselves? Whose responsibility is i=
t but yours?"=20
Andersen fired Duncan last week, saying he had organized a massive destruct=
ion of Enron documents beginning Oct. 23.=20
C.E. Andrews, an Andersen global managing partner who also appeared before =
the committee, said it was Duncan's responsibility to protect the documents=
.=20
"I cannot say it more strongly, Mr. Duncan was not following company policy=
. Mr. Duncan was violating company policy," Andrews said.=20
The claim, echoed by other Andersen witnesses, drew fresh scorn from Tauzin=
, who questioned why such a sensitive legal issue was left to an accountant=
.=20
"I hope you're all OK, I don't know," Tauzin warned, referring to the legal=
 ramifications the testimony raised. "I don't know what's going to come out=
 of all this."=20
Several lawmakers said they suspect Andersen is making a scapegoat of Dunca=
n, when it appears many employees may have been involved in destroying Enro=
n documents.=20
In an internal, Oct. 24 Andersen document the committee released Thursday, =
a manager instructs staff to use overtime if necessary in complying with th=
e company's policy, which at the time called for destruction of all but the=
 final auditing documents.=20
Noting that retaining documents is largely a passive act, Greenwood asked w=
hy complying with the Andersen policy would require staff to use overtime.=
=20
"If the emphasis is on retaining documents, it doesn't seem to us that a wh=
ole lot of overtime is required," Greenwood said.=20
Tauzin added that investigators believe documents may have been destroyed b=
y Andersen in both the Houston and Chicago offices.=20
Andersen, which is rewriting its policy on document retention, called a hal=
t to the destruction of Enron materials on Nov. 10, the day after the SEC s=
ubpoenaed the auditing firm.=20
"My mother would say your policy was dumb like a fox," Greenwood told the A=
ndersen executives.=20
Dorsey Baskin, managing director for Andersen, said the firm took decisive =
steps to remedy the issues surrounding the document shredding.=20
"We certainly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud o=
f our decision to step forward and accept responsibility," Baskin told the =
committee.=20
Although the committee had originally subpoenaed Andersen CEO Joseph Berard=
ino, they accepted Baskin as a substitute to answer questions about company=
wide policy and the firm's response to the Enron crisis.=20
Subpoenas also were issued to Temple and Andersen manager Michael Odom, whi=
ch investigators said would give them legal cover in the event of future li=
tigation involving Enron.=20
Odom, an Andersen employee since 1969, was moved out of management duties i=
n Houston the day Duncan was fired. Odom told lawmakers Andersen officials =
didn't specify why he, Odom, was being disciplined.=20
"I asked what the reason was and I was told the firm felt it had to make so=
me bold moves to restore confidence in the Houston community," Odom said.=
=20
Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, a member of the committee, told lawmakers that =
Enron's collapse had devastated the city.=20
Hearing the stories of former employees, "literally, the tears would come t=
o your eyes," Green said. "Clearly the insiders knew what was going on."=20
Lawmakers in the coming weeks will be expanding the probe of document destr=
uction, and also looking at the financial and other problems that brought a=
bout Enron's historic collapse.=20
Several said that changes in the law or federal regulations may result from=
 various issues illuminated through testimony.=20
It was unclear whether any of the four who testified Thursday would return =
for more questioning when hearings resume in the House committee next month=
.=20
Duncan's request for immunity from prosecution is not likely to be granted =
by the committee, since it could later impair the Justice Department's ongo=
ing criminal probe.=20
Duncan, who also was subpoenaed by the committee, began cooperating with Ho=
use investigators the day after he was fired from Andersen. Since then, his=
 immunity request has cast a chill on his relationship with investigators.=
=20
Greenwood complained that Duncan's ongoing silence could impede the committ=
ee's work -- including unraveling the mysteries surrounding the fired audit=
or.=20
"I still haven't made up my mind on whether Mr. Duncan was a rogue employee=
 or whether Mr. Duncan was set up as a scapegoat," Greenwood said.=20

Enron Hid Losses, Ex-Worker Says Energy: Manager warned executives $500-mil=
lion deficit was attributed to another unit to create illusion of profit.
LEE ROMNEY and WALTER HAMILTON
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

A former Enron Corp. manager warned top company brass in August that more t=
han $500 million in losses from the firm's energy services unit were being =
hidden in another division so the unit could misleadingly report profit to =
Wall Street, a copy of her e-mail reveals.=20
The allegations by former employee Margaret Ceconi were made in an Aug. 29 =
e-mail to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, who Wednesday resigned from the empire h=
e built.
Ceconi's e-mail apparently wasn't connected to another whistle-blower memo =
sent by Vice President Sherron S. Watkins to Lay in mid-August.=20
Although Watkins warned that losses hidden in off-balance-sheet partnership=
s could cause Enron to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Ceconi's=
 concerns focused on the juggling of losses within Enron units. A copy of h=
er e-mail was obtained by The Times.=20
According to Ceconi, whose allegations were reported Thursday in the Housto=
n Chronicle, losses of more than $500 million were transferred from Enron E=
nergy Services to Enron Wholesale Services--the firm's lucrative trading un=
it--in a financial sleight of hand to deceive investors and analysts.=20
Until last spring, the energy services unit was co-headed by Thomas E. Whit=
e Jr., who now is Army Secretary. He could not be reached for comment Thurs=
day.=20
"EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings," Ceconi wrote. "This is co=
mmon knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. Bu=
t it should be taken seriously."=20
Ceconi wrote the e-mail--a rambling memo in which she lashes out at Enron m=
anagement--after she was fired from EES. She complains in the memo that she=
 was "fraudulently" recruited with misleading information about EES and the=
n unfairly let go.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer could not be reached Thursday. In the Chronicle=
 he characterized Ceconi as a "disgruntled" employee, but would not comment=
 on the specifics of her memo.=20
Ceconi could not be reached for comment. But her attorney, Demetrios Anaipa=
kos, said her concerns about the accounting practices outweighed her person=
al beefs with Enron. "She felt that EES was being portrayed as a money-maki=
ng operation when it was exactly the opposite," he said.=20
EES provided energy services to commercial and industrial firms, promising =
them predictable long-term energy supplies and improved energy efficiency. =
Enron touted the unit as having huge growth potential.=20
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron re=
vamped the EES unit last year, moving some commodity "risk-management activ=
ities" to the Wholesale unit.=20
As part of the restructuring, Enron restated its second-quarter 2000 result=
s for EES. Originally, the unit had revenue of $840 million and operating i=
ncome of $24 million. After the restatement, revenue was cut in half to $42=
0 million, but profit almost doubled to $46 million.=20
The restructuring could have been "an attempt to move a money-losing operat=
ion into a segment that was more profitable," said Randy Beatty, dean of th=
e accounting school at USC, who reviewed the SEC document for The Times.=20
Some analysts said Enron repeatedly restructured operations to boost the fi=
nancial results of individual units. "They kept restructuring the business =
segments so they could shift earnings from one section to another," said Pr=
udential Securities analyst Carol Coale.=20
Accounting experts said companies can freely restructure their operations, =
thus altering the reporting of profits and losses. But, said William Kinney=
, an accounting professor at the University of Texas in Austin, such reorga=
nizations should be done for valid business purposes, not just to "move thi=
ngs around."=20
"It's subject to abuse if you're trying to hide bad performance," Kinney sa=
id. But proving intent is difficult, he said.=20
Anaipakos said Ceconi, who left a senior job at GE Capital to join Enron in=
 late 2000, received a call from someone in human resources after she sent =
the e-mail. "She was told her allegations were being taken seriously, [but]=
 I can say she never heard from them again," he said.=20
Ceconi, now employed by a Houston consulting firm, also contacted the SEC b=
y phone twice in August and September to voice her concerns, Anaipakos said=
.=20
"Some would say the house of cards [is] falling," Ceconi wrote in the e-mai=
l to Lay, which also complained of favoritism and discrimination at the com=
pany.=20
"You have to decide the moral or ethical things to do, to right the wrongs =
of your various management teams. I wish you luck."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: SELLING ENERGY
Ex-Workers Say Unit's Earnings Were 'Illusory'
By ALEX BERENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A major division of the Enron Corporation overstated its profits by hundred=
s of millions of dollars over the last three years, and senior Enron execut=
ives were warned almost a year ago that the division's profits were illusor=
y, according to several former employees.=20
The division, Enron Energy Services, competed with utilities to sell electr=
icity and natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. It was run by=
 Lou L. Pai, who sold $353 million in Enron stock over the last three years=
, more than any other Enron executive, and Thomas E. White, who left Enron =
to become secretary of the Army last June.
Energy Services accounted for a small part of Enron's revenue but was promo=
ted by the company as a big growth opportunity. Unlike the complex partners=
hips and other entities that Enron used to move debt and losses on outside =
investments off its books, this unit was a real business with more than 1,0=
00 employees and customers like J. C. Penney.=20
But former employees, including three who were willing to be identified, su=
ggest that Energy Services used shoddy accounting practices to create ''ill=
usory earnings,'' in the words of Jeff Gray, who joined Enron in 2000 and w=
orked at the division for most of 2001.=20
For example, by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the =
future, Enron could book an immediate profit on a contract.=20
The employees' allegations raise fresh questions about Mr. White's role at =
Enron, where he was an executive for 11 years. In a disclosure last May, ju=
st before he became Army secretary, Mr. White reported that he owned more t=
han $25 million of Enron stock and would be paid $1 million in severance fr=
om Enron.=20
Because he went from the Army to Enron and back to the Army, Public Citizen=
 and others have voiced concerns about potential conflicts. While he was at=
 Energy Services, it sold a $25 million contract to the Army. As secretary,=
 he said that he would move energy services at bases to private companies, =
like Enron.=20
A spokesman for Mr. White did not return repeated calls for comment. Mr. Pa=
i, the former chairman, and a spokesman for Enron also did not return calls=
. Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Energy Services, said the division's fin=
ancial results had accurately reflected its business. ''It was no pie in th=
e sky,'' she said.=20
Enron created Energy Services in 1997 to take advantage of the deregulation=
 of electricity markets nationally. It promised to cut its clients' energy =
costs by installing energy-saving equipment and finding cheaper natural gas=
 and electricity.=20
Energy Services operated as essentially a freestanding company, but its res=
ults were included in Enron's financial statements, which were audited by A=
rthur Andersen. Energy Services organized itself so that it could use a fin=
ancial reporting technique called mark-to-market accounting, which Mr. Gray=
 and other former employees said the division had abused to inflate its pro=
fits.=20
Under traditional accounting, companies book profits only as they deliver t=
he services they have promised to customers. But Energy Services calculated=
 its profit very differently. As soon as it signed a contract, it estimated=
 what its profits would be over the entire term, based on assumptions about=
 future energy prices, energy use and even the speed at which different sta=
tes would deregulate their electric markets.=20
Then Energy Services would immediately pay its sales representatives cash b=
onuses on those projections and report the results to investors as profits.=
 By making its assumptions more optimistic, the division could report highe=
r profits.=20
As a result, the sales representatives and senior managers pressed the mana=
gers who made the central assumptions about deregulation and energy prices,=
 said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was fired in December=
.=20
''The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else,'' Mr. Di=
ckson said. ''The people that were having to sign off on the deals with a g=
un to their head knew that it wasn't a good deal.''=20
Mr. Dickson and other former employees said senior executives at Energy Ser=
vices knew that their assumptions were unreliable. At the same time, expens=
es ballooned as Energy Services found that the costs of managing its contra=
cts were higher than it had projected.=20
''They knew how to get a product out there, but they didn't know how to run=
 a business,'' said Tony Dorazio, a former product development manager at E=
nergy Services.=20
In 1999 and 2000, under the leadership of Mr. Pai and Mr. White, Energy Ser=
vices would sign almost any deal, a former employee said. But by the end of=
 2000, the executives were no longer paying much attention to daily operati=
ons, Mr. Dickson said.=20
None of the former employees said they knew whether Mr. Pai or Mr. White we=
re aware of any accounting lapses at Energy Services. With Energy Services =
hemorrhaging cash in 2000, even as it began to report profits to investors,=
 the unit began reviewing some of the contacts to determine whether it had =
overstated its profits. But publicly, Enron continued to promote Energy Ser=
vices' prospects. A year ago, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's president at the=
 time, told Wall Street that the division was worth about $20 billion.=20
''They said at one point they expected it to be as large as wholesale,'' sa=
id Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Company in Houston. Enron's wholes=
ale trading division, which bought and sold electricity and natural gas wor=
ldwide, was the source of most of its profits.=20
The division generated $165 million in operating profit on $4.6 billion in =
sales in 2000, in contrast to a loss of $68 million on sales of $1.8 billio=
n in 1999, according to Enron's 2000 annual report.=20
Even as Enron promoted the division's potential, it accelerated its review =
of the contracts and brought in new management. By February 2001, Enron had=
 transferred Mr. Pai out of the division and named David Delaney, who came =
from the wholesale business, as its top executive. A former brigadier gener=
al, Mr. White remained until he became secretary of the Army.=20
A former employee said that in February or March 2001, senior managers with=
in Energy Services spoke to Richard A. Causey, Enron's chief accounting off=
icer, to discuss potential losses associated with a handful of large contra=
cts. The potential losses on those deals topped $200 million, the employee =
said.=20
About the same time, Mr. Delaney discussed the potential losses with Mr. Sk=
illing and other top corporate executives, this employee said.=20
Sales slowed last year as Mr. Delaney forced the division to use more conse=
rvative and accurate projections when deciding on a contract, Mr. Dickson s=
aid. The move frustrated some sales representatives, but stemmed losses, he=
 said.=20
Although Energy Services publicly reported profits until Enron collapsed, i=
t continued to lose money last year because of the unprofitable contracts, =
employees said.=20
Margaret Ceconi, a former sales manager, sent a letter in August to Kenneth=
 L. Lay, then Enron's chairman, saying that Enron had hidden losses on its =
contracts by putting them in the wholesale division.=20
''It will add up to over $500 million that E.E.S. is losing and trying to h=
ide in wholesale,'' Ms. Ceconi wrote in her letter, which was previously re=
ported in The Houston Chronicle.=20
Today, Energy Services is essentially a shell. After filing for bankruptcy =
Dec. 2, Enron walked away from many contracts, an action allowed under bank=
ruptcy rules.=20
Energy Services' decision to exit so many contracts, including its largest,=
 a $2.2 billion contract signed only last year with Owens-Illinois, the gia=
nt glass and plastic maker, is proof of the problems at the division, forme=
r employees said.=20
''They kept telling me, and I heard it many a time, that it was a sound bus=
iness plan,'' Mr. Dorazio said. ''After being in this business for 21 years=
, it didn't seem sound to me.''

Chart: ''Many Variables, One Profit'' Enron Energy Services sold contracts =
to provide natural gas and electricity to companies for long periods. The c=
ompanies found the prices attractive. But when it had the chance in bankrup=
tcy court, Enron walked away from many of the contracts, a tacit acknowledg=
ement that they were not profitable. A HYPOTHETICAL 10-YEAR ENERGY CONTRACT=
 1. Enron would agree to provide electricity and natural gas at a fixed pri=
ce for 10 years. 2. It then used a computer model to project the cost and p=
rofit of providing this service. Among the many variables that Enron consid=
ered were the prices of power in states that were deregulating, the expecte=
d dates when states would deregulate power supplies and the expected demand=
, based in part on the installation of energy-saving devices at the company=
. Such factors are very hard to project. ENRON'S ACCOUNTING: 10 YEARS IN ON=
E 3. Even though most of Enron's contracts were unprofitable at first, and =
would only become profitable later if its projections proved accurate, Enro=
n could book those profits as soon as it signed them under mark-to-market a=
ccounting.(pg. C6)=20

Andersen Officials Grilled on Shredding; Fired Enron Auditor Declines to Te=

House members probing the sudden demise of Enron Corp. pressed executives a=
t the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, yesterday on why they didn't do m=
ore to preserve Enron audit documents last fall, after they learned that fe=
deral regulators were investigating the energy trader's finances.=20
Lawmakers cited an e-mail showing that an Andersen official in October had =
urged auditors on the Enron account in Houston to work "overtime" to follow=
 the company's rules on document retention and destruction. The e-mail did =
not specifically say to retain documents. One committee member said he inte=
rpreted the memo as a veiled suggestion to destroy documents.
Another Andersen document said a computer analysis of Enron financial activ=
ity showed that the company warranted a "red alert" of possible fraud. It w=
as dated Oct. 9, a week before Enron announced a large loss.=20
Andersen officials played down the significance of the fraud warning, sayin=
g later that the software was unreliable.=20
The Andersen witnesses staunchly defended the firm's actions, saying they s=
ent out a detailed reminder to preserve documents as soon as the big accoun=
ting firm received a subpoena in November. They blamed the shredding on Dav=
id B. Duncan, the lead Enron auditor, who was fired last week.=20
Duncan, citing the advice of his attorney, declined three times to answer q=
uestions in a brief appearance before the committee. He invoked his Fifth A=
mendment privilege against self incrimination.=20
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank," said Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), =
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on overs=
ight and investigations. "Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car. And the=
y say you were at the wheel."=20
Greenwood questioned after the hearing whether Duncan was "a villain or a s=
capegoat."=20
C.E. Andrews, a global managing partner at Andersen, tried to deflect respo=
nsibility from others at the accounting firm. "Destruction of documents dur=
ing that period was wrong, and we admitted that," he said. "I cannot say mo=
re strongly Mr. Duncan was not following company policy."=20
Andrews acknowledged that others at Andersen also destroyed Enron-related d=
ocuments, although he said the volume and circumstances were different.=20
Andrews said the document policy was later suspended because it was not cle=
ar enough. It was dropped Jan. 10 when Andersen first announced that some o=
f its employees had destroyed Enron-related documents.=20
As House lawmakers sought to determine exactly what Andersen knew about the=
 shredding -- and when the firm knew it -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman A=
lan Greenspan made pointed statements about the potential impact of Enron's=
 accounting practices in an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee.=
=20
A visibly passionate Greenspan said that if "everybody did what is alleged =
in the Enron accounting system, our [economic] system could not work" becau=
se investors have to be able to rely on the information they receive. He re=
ferred to Enron's use of off-balance-sheet partnerships to conceal a large =
amount of corporate debt as "an egregious act."=20
While saying that he is not worried that Enron's collapse will hinder inves=
tment in U.S. companies or cause interest rates to rise, he said the case "=
is going to create a really major rethinking in a lot of people about wheth=
er there is a spin game going on with respect to information coming out of =
business into the investment community."=20
An Enron hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also took=
 a broader view of the issues raised by the nation's largest bankruptcy. Se=
n. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the committee, said his panel=
's examination will include questions about whether industry regulators and=
 agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission tracked Enron's ac=
tivity closely enough. "And if not, why not?" Lieberman added.=20
One Senate witness, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., chided an array =
of people, including analysts, rating agencies and government regulators, f=
or failing to do enough to prevent the Enron debacle.=20
"Enron's collapse did not occur in a vacuum," Levitt said, adding that it w=
as partly a result of a "culture of gamesmanship" among go-go businesses th=
at believe "it's okay to bend the rules."=20
Yesterday's hearings were part of nearly a dozen congressional investigatio=
ns into Enron's collapse and allegations that it misled investors and, alon=
g with Andersen, tried to hide questionable business practices.=20
The Justice Department is investigating Andersen's document destruction as =
part of its criminal probe of Enron's collapse. In Houston yesterday, FBI a=
gents were inside Enron's headquarters investigating the shredding of docum=
ents there, which was disclosed earlier this week.=20
In remarks after the four-hour House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-L=
a.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said more people =
than previously disclosed knew about document destruction by Andersen, "per=
haps in Chicago," at the company's headquarters.=20
Greenwood scoffed at the idea of Andersen employees working overtime to uph=
old the document-retention policy. "It doesn't seem to us it takes a lot of=
 overtime to retain documents," he said.=20
The testy House session demonstrated the complexity, disagreement and postu=
ring that are quickly coming to characterize the widening investigations of=
 Enron's fall.=20
Lawmakers from both parties have pledged to examine how the energy trader c=
ollapsed, the allegations of corporate fraud and coverups, and the impact o=
n thousands of investors who lost billions of dollars when Enron's share pr=
ice dropped to less than a dollar in recent months.=20
Greenwood opened the House subcommittee hearing by calling it "just the fir=
st step in a thorough and rigorous investigation." He and other panel membe=
rs were aggressive in their questioning -- and openly skeptical of the resp=
onses of Andersen executives.=20
A focus of much of the questioning was the role of Nancy Temple, an Anderse=
n lawyer who wrote an Oct. 12 memo that she said was meant to remind Duncan=
 and others about the company's policy, which calls for the retention of so=
me documents and the destruction of others. Temple told lawmakers her memo =
was not intended as a directive to shred documents.=20
The 35-page policy statement said that under normal circumstances, employee=
s were to retain only final work papers supporting client audits, and to th=
row out drafts, but that if litigation was anticipated, all documents were =
to be retained. In her testimony, Temple said she meant employees to unders=
tand that they were to retain documents.=20
"Your memo was interpreted, as you know, as a shredding order," said Rep. E=
dward J. Markey (D-Mass.). Duncan's attorneys say he interpreted it to mean=
 he should destory Enron-related documents.=20
Temple's testimony also revealed that she contacted Andersen's outside lega=
l advisers, Davis Polk & Wardwell, before sending an Oct. 16 e-mail to Dunc=
an asking that he delete her name and other references to legal advice from=
 a memo he had written about potentially misleading statements in an Enron =
news release about its earnings.=20
She said the outside lawyers recommended she do that so that if Andersen wa=
s sued or investigated over its Enron auditing, discussions between Duncan,=
 Temple and other lawyers would be protected by attorney-client privilege.=
=20
Andrews said Davis Polk had been retained by Arthur Andersen on Oct. 9 beca=
use of "potential litigation" stemming from Enron's troublesome financial s=
tatements.=20
Tauzin and other lawmakers yesterday questioned why Andersen's general coun=
sel or compliance officer didn't issue clear instructions that day about pr=
eserving documents.=20
Temple said she e-mailed an explicit directive to preserve Enron audit docu=
ments on Nov. 10, in response to a subpoena the company had received two da=
ys earlier from the SEC. Temple said she called Duncan directly the day bef=
ore to underscore the message. After that call, Duncan's assistant sent out=
 an e-mail to other secretaries in the Houston office saying "no more shred=
ding."=20
Among the questions Duncan would not answer yesterday was why, if he though=
t the Oct. 12 memo was a directive to destroy documents, he waited 11 days =
to accelerate the process.=20
Temple also told lawmakers about a Sept. 28 telephone conversation among An=
dersen partners to discuss Enron and the possibility of problems and errors=
 in the company's past financial statements. She said one partner brought u=
p the idea of deleting a sentence acknowledging that the firm had given inc=
orrect accounting advice. She testified that she told the partners they sho=
uldn't do that.=20
Tauzin said he is troubled that an accounting partner at Andersen would eve=
n suggest such a thing, and that Temple didn't seem surprised by it, even t=
hough "she did the right thing" by forbidding it.=20
Tauzin said "the clear picture we're getting at this hearing is that somebo=
dy felt it was a good idea to get rid of an awful lot of documents . . . an=
d it's not a pretty one."=20

Judge OKs depositions on shredding=20
Order for 6 includes fired Andersen auditor=20
By ROSANNA RUIZ=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 24, 2002, 8:59PM
A federal judge has approved an order allowing attorneys for Enron stockhol=
ders to take depositions from one former and five current employees of the =
company's auditing firm concerning document destruction.=20
This settles a dispute raised by defense attorneys who asked to delay the p=
rocess, mainly because their clients are facing inquiries from so many inve=
stigations.=20
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon's order, issued late Wednesday, states t=
hat depositions may begin after Arthur Andersen completes its internal repo=
rt about the shredding of Enron-related documents. The report is due within=
 three weeks.=20
"We're glad we persisted. We're glad we prevailed," said Bill Lerach, a San=
 Diego attorney representing Amalgamated Bank. "We look forward to taking t=
he testimony under oath of the officials at Andersen who destroyed document=
s."=20
The New York-based bank is one of several plaintiffs suing Andersen and 29 =
former and current Enron executives and board members. The suit alleges the=
 insiders were aware of accounting problems that led to Enron's inflated ea=
rnings and higher stock prices.=20
Rusty Hardin, attorney for the accounting firm, opposed allowing deposition=
s of David Duncan, the lead auditor fired by Andersen last week; four Ander=
sen employees on administrative leave, and Andersen's in-house attorney, Na=
ncy Temple. Hardin argued that the depositions might interfere with investi=
gations by Congress, the departments of Labor and Justice and the Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission.=20
The four Andersen employees placed on administrative leave -- Thomas H. Bau=
er, Michael Lowther, Michael Odom and Stephen Goddard Jr. -- must also answ=
er plaintiffs attorneys' questions about the shredding or deletion of Enron=
 documents.=20
"We hoped those depositions would be put off because those people are being=
 pulled in so many directions. But we don't have any problems with the orde=
r," Hardin said.=20
Duncan, identified by Andersen as the organizer of the unauthorized destruc=
tion of Enron documents when the SEC began its investigation, invoked his F=
ifth Amendment privilege Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Comm=
ittee. He may do the same when he is deposed.=20
Temple, based in Chicago, will be deposed about an ambiguous Oct. 12 e-mail=
 she wrote regarding the company's document-retention policy.=20
During her appearance before the House panel Thursday, Temple denied that t=
he e-mail advised Andersen employees to destroy any documents.=20
Hardin said he could not predict whether Duncan or the others would provide=
 answers during the depositions. That decision, he said, rests with them an=
d their attorneys.=20
"I thought the plaintiffs would have a better chance of getting detailed in=
formation if they waited a while, but they didn't want to," Hardin said.=20
Lerach argued this week that the depositions ought to be taken now while me=
mories are fresh.=20
Harmon's order states that each deposition will last up to eight hours and =
cover only the "document and data retention, storage, removal, deletion and=
 attempts to restore or recover deleted or destroyed materials. No document=
s need be produced in connection with these depositions."=20
The six may also be deposed at a later date about the document destruction.=
=20
Andersen must allow experts hired by the plaintiffs' attorneys an opportuni=
ty to evaluate the company's efforts to recover or reconstruct Enron-relate=
d documents that were destroyed or deleted.=20
The plaintiffs' attorneys will also be given access to Andersen's document-=
storage facilities to ensure appropriate security measures are in place.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
An Optimist Sees the Chaos Become Surreal Spectacle
By JIM YARDLEY

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- In the last days before his resignation, Kenneth L. Lay=
 was up there on the 50th floor, above the city that once lionized him, a f=
allen king barricaded atop his silver tower. Mr. Lay, a friend said, had hi=
red a security guard to protect himself against death threats. Employees go=
ssiped that he arrived by private car in the loading dock and was whisked t=
o his office on a freight elevator, all to avoid attention.=20
He must have struggled to recognize the new, chaotic world below. His compa=
ny, Enron, had collapsed. His days, according to another friend, were fille=
d with lawyers. His pal, the president of the United States, who had once r=
eferred to him affectionately as Kenny Boy, complained that his mother-in-l=
aw had taken a bath on Enron stock.
The Rev. Al Sharpton showed up calling for justice. The Rev. Jesse Jackson,=
 who in November shared a private prayer with Mr. Lay, returned this evenin=
g in the midst of the crisis. That Mr. Lay merited the ministrations of Mr.=
 Jackson, who is known to gravitate toward catastrophe, was only one indica=
tion of the surreal spectacle that his precipitous fall had become.=20
''I do not think he's ever had a failure,'' said Bonnie Bourne, his older s=
ister, who lives in Columbia, Mo. ''My father was eternally optimistic. I s=
ee that in Ken: things are going to work out. And it has."=20
Until now. By stepping down Wednesday evening, Mr. Lay ends his tenure as E=
nron's chairman and chief executive and begins his new career -- that of a =
defendant in lawsuits, a witness before Congressional committees and a pote=
ntial target of criminal investigations. The questions now facing Mr. Lay a=
bout Enron's partnerships and accounting practices represent the ultimate W=
ashington endgame: what did he know, when did he know it and did he betray =
the trust of his employees and shareholders?=20
Mr. Lay, 59, gathered top Enron executives and employees in a conference ro=
om on Wednesday to deliver the news that he was leaving the company, just a=
s he had earlier told Enron's board via a conference call. He had been aske=
d to resign by the court-appointed creditors committee, but he had floated =
the idea himself as far back as November when the company was negotiating i=
ts failed merger with its energy rival, Dynegy.=20
''When the Dynegy deal was taking place,'' said Thomas A. Roberts, a lawyer=
 for Enron in New York who is serving as a liaison to the creditor's commit=
tee, ''he at that point thought if his presence as an officer of the compan=
y was going to cause a problem, he would consider resigning.''=20
Mr. Lay had been thinking about resigning, on his own terms, even before En=
ron's troubles emerged.=20
In August, when his hand-picked successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, unexpectedl=
y resigned as chief executive, Mr. Lay, then only the chairman, had told fr=
iends and family that he was easing toward retirement. But Mr. Skilling's a=
brupt departure, coupled with the steady decline in the company's stock pri=
ce, prompted Mr. Lay to reassume the chief executive position.=20
''He came home for a family reunion in August,'' Ms. Bourne said. ''Skillin=
g had just resigned. I said, 'I thought you were ready to get a boat and ta=
ke to the sea.' And he said, 'Well, not yet.' "=20
Mr. Lay called a meeting of employees on Aug. 16, two days after Mr. Skilli=
ng's departure, and was greeted with a standing ovation. For many Enron emp=
loyees, the unpretentious, folksy Mr. Lay represented the moral ballast of =
a company that they felt had spiraled out of control. He was a former chair=
man of the local United Way; a branch of the Y.M.C.A. was named after him.=
=20
Even today, some workers who have lost their jobs refuse to blame Mr. Lay.=
=20
''He had an almost cultish following,'' said one Enron executive who was am=
ong the more than 4,000 workers laid off on Dec. 3, the day after the compa=
ny filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.=20
But Mr. Lay could not work miracles, and a string of recent disclosures hav=
e raised questions. He said in August that questions about the partnerships=
 used to inflate profits were ''way over my head,'' yet that same month he =
met with a vice president who detailed her concerns.=20
At the same time that Mr. Lay was learning about these potential problems, =
he was encouraging employees to buy more Enron stock and reassuring them th=
at the company would rebound. He continued to sell shares himself in Septem=
ber and October, a decision his lawyer has attributed not to a lack of conf=
idence in his company but to pressure to pay off millions of dollars in loa=
ns.=20
Either way, Mr. Lay's legacy is more than tarnished for many employees. Fir=
ed employees have printed T-shirts that read ''Layd Off,'' and howled after=
 the company paid $55 million in retention bonuses while giving a $4,500 se=
verance to those who were let go. The retirement funds of many employees ha=
ve been wiped out.=20
''It's clear to people with Enron that the paternal figure he represented -=
- that died a long time ago,'' said the executive who was among those laid =
off. ''He should have left last year.''=20
Those who have spent time with Mr. Lay say he has expressed frustration but=
 not anger. Mr. Jackson said that when he met with Mr. Lay in November: ''W=
hen I did talk with him, and did have prayer with him, he seemed to be daze=
d by all these revelations. He seemed unaware of what all had happened.''=
=20
Robert Mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce who served on Enron's bo=
ard during the 1980's, said he spoke briefly with Mr. Lay before Christmas.=
 ''It was sort of a little telephone hug to say, 'I'm sorry,' '' said Mr. M=
osbacher, who initiated the call. ''He didn't sound great, but I don't thin=
k you or I would be any better.''=20
Others checked in, too. Mr. Lay's friend and fund-raiser, Sue Walden, said =
she spoke with him on Tuesday about his frustrations with the press coverag=
e of Enron's collapse. He felt it was one-sided, she said, and ''he seemed =
very upset that any of his political ties and his friendship with the presi=
dent could be used to hurt the president.''=20
But few people talked with Mr. Lay as much as Mr. Roberts, the Enron lawyer=
 who is liaison to the creditor's committee. He said they often talked five=
 times a day.=20
He said Mr. Lay was usually upbeat and surprisingly optimistic, mentioning =
that he and his wife ''pray over this regularly.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Robert=
s listened to the conference call as Mr. Lay told the board of his resignat=
ion. He said Mr. Lay then broke the news to top executives and staff member=
s.=20
Later, after the news was out publicly, Mr. Roberts said he called one fina=
l time, at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Mr. Lay, he said, told him, ''This has =
not been a good day.''=20
He is certain to face more of them.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
Enron Hearings Open, Focusing on Destroyed Papers
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and STEPHEN LABATON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- Lawmakers investigating the Enron Corporation said t=
oday that new evidence showed that the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen,=
 destroyed documents knowing that they might be relevant to criminal and ci=
vil investigations.=20
At a hearing this morning before a House subcommittee examining the collaps=
e of Enron, lawmakers heard evidence that two weeks before Andersen executi=
ves in Houston began destroying documents the accounting firm retained a la=
w firm to prepare to defend itself in cases that could arise from Enron's p=
roblems.
A document released by lawmakers also shows that on the same day the law fi=
rm was hired, Oct. 9, some Andersen officials were worried that there was a=
 ''heightened risk of financial statement fraud'' with Enron's books.=20
In addition, the subcommittee released copies of an e-mail message received=
 by Andersen employees a day after government regulators announced their in=
vestigation of Enron. Lawmakers said employees construed the message as a d=
irective to begin destroying records.=20
David B. Duncan, an Andersen partner until he was fired after acknowledging=
 that he took part in destruction of records, declined to respond to questi=
ons from House lawmakers, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against forced=
 self-incrimination. [Excerpts from Congressional hearings, Pages C8-9.]=20
The hearings brought together many elements of American political and econo=
mic life: the partisan battle over the proper role of government regulation=
, the bursting of the financial bubble of the 1990's and the quarrel over t=
he influence of money in politics.=20
And the sessions were yet another indication of the mounting impact on Wash=
ington of Enron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. Ev=
en as the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, argued that the company's c=
ollapse was a corporate scandal, not a political one, its political effects=
 were visible in Congress and at the White House.=20
Controversy over large political contributions from Enron helped House memb=
ers fighting to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws to move their l=
egislation closer to a floor vote, with Mr. Fleischer saying a Bush veto wa=
s unlikely. All the attention focused on the millions donated by Enron to m=
embers of the two parties has intensified the pressure on Mr. Bush and othe=
r political leaders to back change.=20
There were other signs of how Enron's fortunes had intersected with politic=
s. Associates of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, said he had r=
ecommended a lucrative consulting contract with Enron for Ralph Reed, the R=
epublican strategist, as Mr. Bush was weighing whether to run for president=
. The associates said the arrangement helped keep Mr. Reed's allegiance to =
the Bush campaign without putting him on any payroll.=20
A new computer analysis of campaign finance records showed that of the 248 =
senators and House members on the 11 Congressional committees that are inve=
stigating the Enron affair, 212 had received contributions from Enron or Ar=
thur Andersen. The donations from the two companies have been so pervasive =
that all the Senate's top 20 recipients of Enron donations are serving on a=
t least one panel investigating Enron. Because many lawmakers who accepted =
Enron donations were Democrats, the burgeoning scandal has created bipartis=
an discomfort.=20
Among those testifying today was Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the =
Securities and Exchange Commission, who had tried with limited success to i=
mpose tough conflict-of-interest restraints on the accounting industry.=20
''Too many elements of the system are not trustworthy today,'' Mr. Levitt t=
old the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ''They have failed us becaus=
e of self-dealing and self-interest.''=20
The House and Senate committees conducting today's hearings include members=
 who had beaten back earlier proposals for tougher conflict-of-interest rul=
es for auditors and who had supported legislation in the 1990's that made i=
t harder for investors to sue unethical accountants and easier for corporat=
ions to put out misleading financial projections.=20
Mr. Levitt proposed a number of changes to eliminate the possible conflicts=
 of interests of Wall Street analysts and accountants and make corporate bo=
ards more independent-minded. He also suggested the adoption of a new rule =
that required companies to change auditors every five to seven years ''to e=
nsure that fresh and skeptical eyes are always looking at the numbers.''=20
He also suggested that the recent proposals by his successor at the agency,=
 Harvey L. Pitt, were weak. Mr. Pitt, whose proposals have come under heavy=
 criticism since they were announced last week, has proposed that a group d=
ominated by outside experts should discipline the accounting industry.=20
Some lawmakers, including members who had received donations from Enron and=
 the accounting industry, said the collapse demonstrated the need for chang=
ing campaign finance laws.=20
''Because Enron has made substantial political contributions to members of =
Congress and the executive branch, some will question the independence in l=
aunching such an investigation,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Con=
necticut Democrat who heads the Governmental Affairs Committee. ''There are=
 two things we in Congress can do to overcome that skepticism and rebuild p=
ublic trust: conduct completely independent investigations of Enron and pas=
s campaign finance reform.''=20
The committee's ranking Republican, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, agr=
eed.=20
''We have an opportunity to do some good here on a bipartisan basis,'' Mr. =
Thompson said as he outlined issues raised by the scandal. ''In the process=
, we may even finally decide that allowing huge amounts of soft money contr=
ibutions to public officials is not such a good idea.''''=20
In the House hearing, Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican=
 who heads the the Energy and Commerce Committee, which will hold a hearing=
 on Feb. 6 focusing on Enron, said ''scores and scores'' of Andersen employ=
ees were engaged in document destruction.=20
''It's clear to us that our investigation, and other investigations, have b=
een impeded by this policy,'' he said.=20
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative John D. Dingell of Mi=
chigan, said Andersen's actions were ''either criminally stupid, or stupidl=
y criminal or both.''=20
Lawmakers said it appeared plain that senior Andersen officials were aware =
by early October, when the firm hired the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell=
, that lawsuits were possible, yet they did nothing to ensure that crucial =
documents were preserved, waiting until receiving a subpoena on Nov. 8 to i=
nstruct employees to ''stop the shredding.''=20
This was a major mistake, lawmakers said, and it contradicted recent commen=
ts by Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, who said Sunday on '=
'Meet the Press'' on NBC that Andersen's policy was ''not to shred document=
s, not to eliminate documents if you have a reasonable basis to anticipate =
an investigation.''=20
This morning, the first witness, Mr. Duncan, strode to the hearing table fl=
anked by his two lawyers, Robert Giuffra and Vince DiBlasi. Wearing a dark =
blue suit, Mr. Duncan, 42, rose and was sworn under oath, but he invoked hi=
s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and he was dismissed by=
 the subcommittee chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican o=
f Pennsylvania.=20
Mr. Greenwood said he was frustrated by Mr. Duncan's refusal to testify and=
 told him: ''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway ca=
r, and they say you were at the wheel.'' But speaking with reporters later,=
 Mr. Greenwood said he remained concerned that ''Mr. Duncan and others were=
 the fall guys'' for a firm that sanctioned document destruction when they =
knew litigation was likely.=20
Andersen officials at the hearing said Mr. Duncan orchestrated the shreddin=
g without direction from superiors, and a firm spokesman, Patrick Dorton, p=
layed down the timing of the hiring of the outside law firm. ''It would not=
 be unusual for this firm or any company to seek the advice of outside coun=
sel in a situation like this,'' Mr. Dorton said.=20
An Andersen spokesman dismissed the document that discussed the risk of ''f=
inancial statement fraud,'' saying it stemmed from an experimental computer=
 model Andersen was using that often registered false results.=20
In a statement after the hearing, Andersen said that it had ''deep regret f=
or the disturbing actions of several of its employees on the Enron engageme=
nt'' but that the testimony ''further demonstrates the firm's complete reso=
lve to learn the facts, make them known to the government and the public, a=
nd take every appropriate action against the individuals involved.''=20
Four Andersen officials testified today, but the committee saved its sharpe=
st questioning for Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago office who =
by early October was working closely with Andersen partners in Houston who =
were reviewing what they viewed as Enron's increasingly troubled accounting=
.=20
On Oct. 12, Ms. Temple had sent to auditors in Houston a copy of e-mail sho=
wing the firm's document-retention policy, which some lawmakers said amount=
ed to a green light to destroy documents. Mr. Duncan and other Andersen off=
icials interviewed by the committee's investigators have called her e-mail =
unusual.=20
Lawmakers also were critical that notes she took during an Oct. 23 conferen=
ce call with Mr. Duncan and other partners involved with the Enron account =
did not indicate that preserving documents was mentioned. Her notes read, i=
n part: ''AA trying to gather all docs re transaction from around the world=
.''=20
''And those notes don't say anything about preservation, do they?'' Represe=
ntative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, asked.=20
Ms. Temple also drew the ire of the subcommittee when she characterized as =
''positive'' an October report by Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins=
, on Enron's accounting.=20
Mr. Tauzin told her: ''We're trying to get the facts here. But if you will =
characterize a report that indicates a decline in the value of Enron's stoc=
k and a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation as a positive repo=
rt from the attorneys, we are going to have trouble with your testimony tod=
ay.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE IMPACT
Bipartisan Outrage but Few Mea Culpas in Capital
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 5, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 -- The Enron scandal has grown so large that it took no=
t one but two hearings on Capitol Hill today for the politicians to begin s=
orting through the mess, while also carefully sidestepping their own role i=
n it.=20
Anyone who tried to watch or listen to both proceedings simultaneously hear=
d a bipartisan chorus of outrage about shredded documents and empty retirem=
ent accounts.
''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they=
 say you were at the wheel,'' Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylv=
ania, the Republican chairman of the House Energy Committee's subcommittee,=
 told David B. Duncan, the dismissed Arthur Andersen partner who led the ac=
counting firm's audit of Enron and who invoked his Fifth Amendment right to=
day against self-incrimination.=20
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said: ''When the corporate=
 insiders at Enron realized the ship was sinking, they grabbed the lifeboat=
s and left the women and children, their workers and investors, to drown.''=
=20
While politicians were quick to blame Enron's accountants for allowing the =
giant energy trading company to collapse, few on either panel were prepared=
 today to accept any blame for the role Congress played.=20
The White House, meanwhile, once again insisted today that the company's fa=
ilure was a business scandal -- not a political one.=20
White House officials adopted the stance of outraged victim and vengeful co=
p. ''Nothing is going to stop the president and this administration from pu=
rsuing justice,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney continues to refuse to release a list of people =
who met with his energy task force last year, even though more senators hav=
e called for its release. Mary Matalin, a counselor to Mr. Cheney, said tod=
ay that the administration felt the list should be withheld to protect the =
participants' privacy.=20
On Capitol Hill, some of the members posing the toughest questions today ha=
d in earlier years voted for legislation that deregulated commodities marke=
ts. They also blocked several attempts to toughen accounting standards. Tho=
se decisions helped make it easier for Enron to escape the scrutiny of gove=
rnment regulators.=20
Several senators sitting on the Governmental Affairs Committee, like Senato=
r Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, pressured the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission in 2000 to abandon a proposed rule that would have ba=
rred accounting firms from performing auditing and consulting work for the =
same client, as Andersen did for Enron. He was one of 13 senators who inter=
vened to quash the plan.=20
Yet Mr. Torricelli offered one of the day's only mea culpas. Addressing Art=
hur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on who had pushed for the rule and testified today, Mr. Torricelli said: ''=
We were wrong. You were right.''=20
Both at the White House and in Congress, the message is simple: Punish thos=
e responsible for the Enron debacle, and do everything possible to make sur=
e another Enron does not happen. There is not much appetite on either end o=
f Pennsylvania Avenue for the news media or the public to dwell on any role=
 the legislative or executive branches may have played in creating an envir=
onment to allow Enron to flourish.=20
''After all of the sound and fury of these investigations, the bottom line =
questions are: Is Congress willing to amend the law to rein in the greed of=
 the next Enron?'' Mr. Durbin asked. ''Are we willing to concede that the g=
enius of capitalism can result in ruthless behavior without our oversight a=
nd the protection of law?''=20
Just as the White House has tried to avoid any political fallout from the E=
nron debacle, members of Congress have tried to escape any collateral damag=
e from the scandal. So the House Energy Committee resembled a bipartisan co=
rporate tribunal. Members acted as both prosecutors and judges and the accu=
sed, Arthur Andersen L.L.P., was left with almost no defense.=20
But many of the 11 House and Senate investigations into the scandal plan no=
t only on looking back, as was today's chore, but also on trying to draft l=
egislation that will prevent another Enron. Whether that includes the campa=
ign financing laws that have helped give the public the impression that man=
y legislators have been tainted by contributions from Enron or the accounti=
ng firms remains to be seen.=20
''They are going to hit the easy targets first and hit the easiest bad guys=
 first,'' said Larry Noble of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''But the=
y are going to have to deal with the tougher questions, too, about their ow=
n role in this.''=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one Democrat who has come under=
 scrutiny for his role in accounting legislation, has vowed his committee w=
ill recommend changes in the law and regulations.=20
The inquiries are reminiscent of the role played by Congress during the sav=
ings and loan crisis of the 1980's. Some lawmakers touched by the scandal, =
most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona -- who took contributions from =
Charles Keating, the operator of a failed thrift, and spoke on his behalf -=
- were deeply affected by that experience and made campaign finance overhau=
l a signature issue. Mr. McCain said of the Enron scandal, ''It's clear the=
re is a taint out there on all of us.''=20
As Mr. McCain's campaign finance bill regains momentum on Capitol Hill, it =
is unclear whether the Enron debacle will have a similar effect on House me=
mbers and senators who once sided with Enron and the accounting industry.=
=20
One candidate is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Republican chairman of th=
e House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On July 20, 2000, in a letter co-=
signed by 20 House members, Mr. Tauzin opposed any toughening of accounting=
 rules. In the previous five years, Mr. Tauzin had received nearly $150,000=
 from accounting firms.=20
As chairman of Congress's most aggressive committee investigating Enron, Mr=
. Tauzin has hammered away at the accounting profession.=20
His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said the case had changed Mr. Tauzin's view of =
auditor independence. Two years ago, Mr. Tauzin was convinced Mr. Levitt's =
plan was ''a solution to a problem that didn't exist,'' Mr. Johnson said. '=
'Now we know there's a problem. It's time to fix it.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PARTNERSHIPS
Investors Lured To Enron Deals By Inside Data
By KURT EICHENWALD

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron executives enticed wealthy individuals and institutions to invest in =
one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company by dangling the prosp=
ect that inside knowledge could potentially help them double their money in=
 a matter of months, according to partnership records and prospective inves=
tors.=20
In dozens of pages, the confidential records of a partnership called LJM2 d=
escribe the inner workings of an entity at the heart of the Enron debacle. =
The records show company executives wearing two hats, offering banks, insur=
ance companies, Wall Street firms and wealthy investors inside knowledge ab=
out Enron and its off-the-books holdings -- information that they denied co=
mpany shareholders.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Enron's acc=
ounting for its partnerships violated the law, though details of its inquir=
y have not been disclosed.=20
Under pressure from the S.E.C. investigation, Enron began disclosing detail=
s of its partnerships last fall and started down what turned out to be the =
road to collapse.=20
The records show that Enron disclosed to potential investors the conflicts =
of interest posed by Enron executives' playing a dual role, but sought to a=
llay concern over them.=20
The LJM2 partnership was run by Andrew S. Fastow, who at the same time was =
Enron's chief financial officer. It was set up, in part, to invest in entit=
ies that Enron controlled and to purchase investments that Enron did not wa=
nt on its books.=20
Mr. Fastow and other Enron executives who managed the partnership had a dut=
y to maximize returns for Enron shareholders, the documents note, even as t=
hey were offering a separate set of lucrative deals to banks, Wall Street f=
irms and wealthy individuals who owned stakes in the partnerships.=20
According to the documents, the spectacular returns were possible because t=
he partnerships would be investing in deals originated by Enron, then in it=
s heyday as a swashbuckling global pioneer of energy deregulation. The inve=
stments would draw on confidential, nonpublic information developed by the =
energy company, the documents explained.=20
''Enron frequently has access to investment opportunities that are not avai=
lable to other investors,'' the private placement memorandum for LJM2 said.=
=20
Securities experts say that knowledge of the investment plans and strategie=
s of hot companies, like Enron was at the time, is a coveted commodity on W=
all Street because it can provide investors a leg up.=20
The records show that investors in LJM2, which set out to raise $200 millio=
n and ultimately took in $349 million, were given more information about En=
ron's financial situation than the company's shareholders.=20
For example, documents sent to potential investors in 2000 revealed that En=
ron controlled about 50 percent more assets than disclosed in Enron's secur=
ities filings. The difference -- $34 billion versus $51 billion, as of June=
 30, 1999 -- was the value of assets moved off Enron's books through variou=
s partnership deals.=20
The disclosures created conflicts for Wall Street firms, as well. For examp=
le, the investment banking arm of Merrill Lynch & Company, which underwrote=
 the LJM2 offering, was aware of the off-balance-sheet figures for Enron; i=
ndeed, Merrill's name is on the cover page of the offering containing the d=
ata.=20
But because the numbers were confidential, that information could not be sh=
ared with Merrill brokerage clients who were investing in Enron stock. Joe =
Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, declined to comment.=20
Merrill was not alone. Dozens of other banks, brokerage firms, pension fund=
s and other institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just =
over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about =
the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings.=20
Enron's shareholders learned little of these deals until the company restat=
ed its financial results last fall, erasing nearly $600 million in profits =
over five years, and provided additional, but still fragmentary, details.=
=20
Wall Street firms are supposed to maintain a so-called Chinese wall to ensu=
re that customers of their brokerage operations are not made privy to insid=
e information gleaned by their investment bankers. In this case, securities=
 experts said, the intent of those laws was undermined.=20
The transactions ''followed the legal norms to produce a perverse result,''=
 said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law expert at Columbia University. '=
'It's a case where the Chinese wall is working to injure public investors, =
rather than benefit them.''=20
At the same time, analysts of the Enron stock were provided little informat=
ion about the partnerships.=20
John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston who was long a=
 skeptic on Enron stock, recalled that he once questioned company executive=
s about their partnerships.=20
''They told us, 'We can't discuss it, it's confidential, and we are enjoine=
d from disclosing anything about it,' '' Mr. Olson said.=20
Among the investors in LJM2, according to court records, are Citicorp, the =
American Home Assurance Company, the Travelers Insurance Company, and an in=
vestment partnership affiliated with Morgan Stanley.=20
The partnership documents made clear to potential investors the magnitude o=
f the conflicts of interest created by the dual roles of the executives. ''=
One of the most challenging due diligence issues for the partnership is the=
 potential for conflict as a result of the principals' dual positions as En=
ron employees and principals of the partnership,'' the offering memorandum =
said.=20
A separate document disclosed last week by Congressional investigators said=
 that Enron's board waived the company's code of ethics to allow Mr. Fastow=
 to serve as LJM2's general partner. Investors were told that Richard A. Ca=
usey, who is still Enron's chief accounting officer, was assigned responsib=
ility for monitoring the partnership and mediating conflicts of interest.=
=20
The partnership documents -- including sales presentations made by Mr. Fast=
ow to potential institutional investors in LJM2 -- describe in detail the w=
orkings and performance of several partnerships that have gotten the most a=
ttention since the Enron scandal began to unfold.=20
Among them are limited partnerships known as JEDI I and JEDI II, an acronym=
 with a ''Star Wars'' glint that stood for Joint Energy Development Investm=
ents.=20
The records said that investors in those partnerships initially were promis=
ed returns of 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. By the time LJM2 was=
 being marketed, JEDI I had returned 23 percent annually for its life, and =
JEDI II -- which was still in operation -- was expected to return 194 perce=
nt annually.=20
For the LJM2 partnership, according to internal records and marketing mater=
ials, the Enron executives were expecting a minimum annualized return of 30=
 percent. But sales agents also emphasized the earlier partnerships' result=
s.=20
''The implication of their pitch was very clear,'' said one person who hear=
d it. ''At least 30 percent could mean well over 100 percent or more.''=20
As of last March 31, according to confidential partnership records, three o=
f the four largest investments in LJM2 brought in returns of more than 100 =
percent. The lowest return, from an investment in another Enron entity call=
ed Raptor I, was 58 percent over four months; the highest, in Raptor II, wa=
s 212 percent in just over three months.=20
In the first quarter of last year, the partnership distributed $75 million =
to investors -- or about 44 percent of the total of $171 million that was i=
nvested in the partnership by the end of 2000.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
How LJM2 Tripped Up Enron
By Dylan Loeb McClain

c. 2002 New York Times Company

When Enron restated its earnings last year, reducing its profits from 1997-=
2001 by almost $600 million and shrinking its shareholder equity by more th=
an $1.2 billion, it said that the reason was partly its deals with a partne=
rship named LJM2. According to Enron, the partnership was independent of th=
e company, but the top executives of LJM2 were also top executives at Enron=
 -- a connection highlighted in the partnership offering papers as one reas=
on LJM2 would be a desirable investment. Here is one way that the partnersh=
ip became a problem. Dylan Loeb McClain

reated to invest in Enron holdings. 1. Enron lent $1.2 billion of its stock=
 to the Raptor partnerships. Enron also promised to issue more stock if the=

ticularly New Power Holdings, a company Enron had spun off. What went wrong=
 4. The interests of LJM2 and Enron were at odds. At one point, in Septembe=
r 2000, LJM2 entered into an agreement that obligated it to buy Enron stock=
 at a fixed price anytime Enron wanted to sell over the next six months. Th=
is was a way for Enron to protect itself against a decline in its stock pri=
ce. But LJM2 asked to settle the contract early when it could pay less for =
the stock than its current price, thereby making $10 million. 5. Selling so=
me of its stockholdings and assets to the Raptor partnerships insulated Enr=
on against a decline in their value. But, when the value of those assets de=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MUTUAL FUNDS
Many May Be Surprised To Be Enron Investors
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

In the last year, more than 50 mutual funds and insurance companies, includ=
ing some of the largest and best known in America, invested in a trust crea=
ted by Enron in 1997 to finance the operations of several of the energy com=
pany's shadowy partnerships. As a result, many individual investors -- thro=
ugh these funds -- unwittingly owned a piece of an entity that was used to =
finance some of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure.=20
In September 2000 the trust, called the Osprey Trust, raised $2.4 billion f=
rom institutional investors in a so-called private placement of notes due i=
n January 2003. Within the last year, mutual fund and financial services co=
mpanies like Putnam Investments, the Vanguard Group, Travelers and Prudenti=
al have bought Osprey debt.
By last fall, when Enron's troubles started to surface, prices on the Ospre=
y debt began to drop. Since they were ultimately backed by Enron shares, th=
e securities appear to have lost 60 percent of their value for any fund or =
investor still holding them.=20
Osprey seems to have been a central fund-raising entity for several of Enro=
n's partnerships, including LJM and Whitewing L.P., a partnership created b=
y Enron that invested in energy-related projects in Europe and South Americ=
a, including an electric distribution company in Brazil. Whitewing allowed =
Enron to realize cash from the partnership's investments, while keeping the=
 partnership's debt obligations -- including the $2.4 billion it raised fro=
m large investors -- off Enron's balance sheet.=20
Enron had included Whitewing in its consolidated financial statements in 19=
98 but removed it in March 1999, arguing that since it was owned jointly by=
 Enron and Osprey it no longer belonged in Enron's reports. But when Enron'=
s fortunes started to decline last autumn, it became clear that Enron's sha=
reholders were ultimately responsible for the debt raised by Osprey. In a c=
onference call with analysts and investors on Nov. 14, Jeffrey McMahon, who=
 had only recently been appointed Enron's chief financial officer, disclose=
d that Osprey's assets, which had carried a book value of $4.7 billion, had=
 declined in value by $600 million.=20
Mr. McMahon also disclosed for the first time that the Osprey debt was back=
ed by 50 million shares of Enron common stock and that the company had an a=
dditional obligation to issue more shares if the assets held in Osprey and =
the common shares were insufficient to repay the debtholders in 2003.=20
Robert McCullough, a consultant to the electric utility industry at McCullo=
ugh Research in Portland, Ore., calculated that the value of Osprey today i=
s roughly 60 percent lower than its $4.7 billion book value stated last fal=
l. His calculation takes into account the $600 million write-down disclosed=
 by Mr. McMahon last November as well as the fact that the Enron stock back=
ing the assets is now practically worthless.=20
''That means exposing the Osprey owners to a large discount from book value=
 as well,'' Mr. McCullough said.=20
But it is not clear whether those left holding Osprey notes have written th=
eir values down appropriately. In documents dated as recently as this month=
, Mr. McCullough found several funds still valuing their Osprey holdings at=
 levels that do not appear to reflect the diminished value of those positio=
ns.=20
Owning a piece of Osprey may come as a surprise to some holders of bond mut=
ual funds. Investors who buy bond funds are typically more conservative tha=
n those who buy stock funds. Bond investors usually seek income and preserv=
ation of their capital; some buy funds which limit their holdings to securi=
ties issued by the United States government or high-grade corporations, whi=
le others take on more risk by purchasing lower-grade bonds that carry high=
er yields.=20
Private placements, like the one Osprey used to raise money from investors,=
 are offered only to large institutional investors with more than $100 mill=
ion under management. As such, they are initially exempt from registration =
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although Osprey's securities s=
hould have become registered automatically with the commission six months a=
fter they were offered, no Osprey filings could be found in the course of s=
everal searches of S.E.C. documents.=20
Among the largest buyers of the debt was the AXP Bond Fund, an American Exp=
ress Financial Advisers fund, which held $10 million worth in 2001. Several=
 Prudential funds were big holders of Osprey; the Prudential Series Fund he=
ld more than $17 million of the debt. The Putnam Income Fund held $6.6 mill=
ion in Osprey. To be sure, such holdings are minuscule when compared with t=
he assets under management at these funds.=20
The Osprey notes carried high yields even before Enron began its decline. O=
ne investor who owned the debt last year said that the holdings yielded aro=
und 13 percent before trouble struck. As Enron's fortunes sank last fall, b=
ut before the company filed for bankruptcy, the notes' yields climbed to 24=
 percent.=20
Alan Papier, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said that private placem=
ent debt, like the Osprey notes, are common holdings in mutual funds, espec=
ially those seeking high levels of income. ''These securities might have a =
little bit higher yield because by design there cannot be as wide an audien=
ce for them,'' he said.=20
Delaware Investments, a money management concern in Philadelphia with $84 b=
illion under management, bought and sold a small amount of Osprey debt seve=
ral times the last 18 months. The firm, a subsidiary of the Lincoln Financi=
al Group, owned roughly $6 million of Osprey notes in several of its mutual=
 funds, which had assets totaling $2.4 billion.=20
Matt Stephens, an analyst at Delaware, explained that he bought the Osprey =
notes because they were backed by assets owned by Enron but which the compa=
ny had decided were not a part of its core business and had moved into the =
Osprey trust. That trust, Mr. Stephens explained, was set up to operate the=
 assets and liquidate them over time.=20
''We looked at it as a secured way to play the Enron credit story, and we u=
sed it as a trading vehicle,'' he said. Mr. Stephens added that the Osprey =
notes carried a higher yield than Enron's corporate debt and that made the =
investment attractive as well.=20
Delaware lost money on its Osprey holdings, but not nearly as much as it wo=
uld have if it had held on through Enron's bankruptcy filing. During the co=
urse of the last 18 months, the firm bought Osprey notes at $950 to $1,000 =
(or face value). It sold them at roughly $835 in November, after Enron exec=
utives had a conference call with investors and analysts outlining some of =
the company's problems. Mr. Stephens said the conference call created doubt=
s at his firm about Enron's credibility. ''When we lose faith in management=
, it is a clear sell signal to us,'' he said.=20
Other Osprey investors declined to comment on whether they still held the d=
ebt or whether they had written down its value in their funds. Spokeswomen =
for Prudential, Vanguard and Putnam all said their firms' policies were not=
 to comment on individual holdings.

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- A federal judge overseeing lawsuits against Enron and i=

Why Bush Stiffed Enron
By Virginia Postrel

01/25/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. gave the Bush campaign lots of money. When Enron got in trouble=
, cabinet secretaries took its calls. But they did nothing to save it.=20
What are we to make of this peculiar chain of events? What, after all, is t=
he point of handing out corporate money to politicians if the company can't=
 get favors when its life is on the line? Was there a secret bailout deal t=
hat hasn't made the papers? Or were administration officials just doing wha=
t was good for the country?
It would be nice to conclude that the Bush administration turned down Enron=
's entreaties because of its deeply held free-market principles. But the mo=
st likely explanation is more complex and cynical. In any Republican admini=
stration, there are three forces (sometimes organized in factions, sometime=
s operating within the same individuals) determining economic policy: pro-b=
usiness instincts, pro-market principles, and political considerations. Get=
 two of the three on one side, and chances are that side will win.=20
Enron's problem, then, was exactly what Bush opponents tend to think of as =
its greatest strength. It was a Houston-based oil company. Enron, in other =
words, represented just the sort of voters President Bush can take for gran=
ted. In a reelection campaign, there's no way he would lose Texas. Indeed, =
many observers believe he lost the 2000 popular vote because he didn't work=
 hard enough to get a large turnout in his home state.=20
So Enron had no electoral clout, giving the Bush administration no politica=
l reason to sacrifice its economic principles to help save the company. By =
helping Enron, the administration could only lose, angering free market sup=
porters and embroiling itself in a business mess. A bankrupt Enron couldn't=
 even promise future campaign funds. If only Enron had been based in Pennsy=
lvania or West Virginia. Then things would have been different.=20
Just ask the steel industry. There, the Bush administration has pursued a d=
angerously protectionist policy, jettisoning not only its own stated princi=
ples but American leadership in breaking down barriers to free trade.=20
To help ailing steel companies, the administration initiated what is known =
as a section 201 action. This allows the government to establish import quo=
tas or tariffs for five years, limiting competition while the domestic indu=
stry tries to get its act together. Under this law, the protected industry =
doesn't have to show that foreign producers get any unfair advantages from =
their own governments or even that imports are the main source of its probl=
ems. The industry merely has to demonstrate that it's hurt by foreign compe=
tition. Since any competition makes business tougher, that's an easy case f=
or a struggling industry to make.=20
So the free-trade president has adopted a blatantly protectionist position,=
 raising prices for everyone who buys or makes anything that uses steel. Bi=
g Steel is now demanding 40% tariffs and a bailout of $12 billion to cover =
lavish retirement benefits, particularly health costs. Steel retirees, who =
are, of course, already covered by Medicare, outnumber steel employees abou=
t 5 to 1.=20
Why is the administration that wouldn't try to save Enron entertaining such=
 pro-business, anti-market ideas? It's a simple political calculation. Pres=
ident Bush won steel-producing West Virginia (and, arguably, the presidency=
) by a mere 40,000 votes. He lost steel-producing Pennsylvania by only 200,=
000 votes. He doesn't have to worry about carrying Texas. He does have to w=
orry about the swing states of the steel belt.=20
That sort of calculation is nothing new in American politics. The first Pre=
sident Bush also denied the oil industry federal help while extending steel=
 quotas.=20
Nor is the split a purely Republican phenomenon. Back in the early 1970s, e=
conomic historian Gavin Wright took a careful statistical look at New Deal =
largess. He found that the Roosevelt administration directed money not at t=
he poorest states, which were in the solidly Democratic South, but at the s=
wing states of the West. After controlling for how rural states were, Mr. W=
right found that 80% of the variation in spending could be explained by fac=
tors that defined political swing states.=20
In a democracy of concentrated interests, some votes clearly count more tha=
n others. But, to look at the bright side, at least sometimes predictable v=
otes lead to principled policies. The Bush administration dodged a bigger E=
nron scandal because it could take Texas for granted.=20

When J.P. Morgan & Co. set up an energy-trading business in the British Cha=
nnel Islands a decade ago, the tiny venture barely caused a ripple at the g=
iant bank.=20
The operation, called Mahonia Ltd., consisted of just a small office with l=
ots of phone lines. But the Jersey-based business grew over the years to tr=
ansact billions of dollars of natural-gas contracts with other energy compa=
nies. Mahonia's trading followed a simple pattern: Many of its transactions=
 took place just before year-end. Often, the deliveries of natural gas and =
oil were sold right back to those who delivered them through complex deriva=
tive transactions. And about 60% of Mahonia's trades were with just one com=
pany: Enron Corp.
The point of the choreographed trading? People familiar with Mahonia say En=
ron used the transactions to manage tax liabilities by transferring losses =
in one financial reporting period to another. As Enron's troubles mounted, =
the Houston company eventually turned to Mahonia as a sort of surrogate ban=
k, these people say, using it to raise at least $2 billion in financing ove=
r the years.=20
For J.P. Morgan, the arrangement was lucrative -- at least at first. The ba=
nk received as much as $100 million in revenues. It also thought it had ins=
urance in place to cover any default by Enron.=20
But in the wake of Enron's collapse and bankruptcy-court filing, Mahonia co=
uld cost the nation's second-largest bank as much as $1 billion. Several in=
surers have alleged in a lawsuit in New York federal court that the trading=
 transactions were shams, thereby negating the insurance contracts. The ban=
k, now known as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., disputes the court allegation. Cre=
dit-rating concern Standard & Poor's cited J.P. Morgan's overall exposure t=
o Enron as one reason it is reviewing the bank's credit rating for a possib=
le downgrade. J.P. Morgan, which acted as a lender, underwriter and merger =
adviser to Enron, says the energy concern owes it a total of $2.6 billion.=
=20
The Mahonia arrangement -- which J.P. Morgan hadn't disclosed to investors =
until last month's suit -- represents just a sliver of the many complicated=
 ventures Enron participated in. But unlike the hundreds of partnerships En=
ron constructed on its own to keep debt off its books, this venture was con=
ceived, launched and operated by J.P. Morgan. Though many Wall Street firms=
 helped finance Enron -- acting as traditional lenders, underwriters and ad=
visers -- the fact that J.P. Morgan set up the partnership suggests that Wa=
ll Street may have played a more active role in the Enron scandal.=20
J.P. Morgan won't comment on some key aspects of the dispute, citing pendin=
g litigation. A spokesman says that "many companies routinely raise funds u=
sing pre-paid commodity forward contracts. The benefits vary from client to=
 client, including pricing advantages and diversity of credit sources."=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says the trades were "perfectly legitimate and =
proper transactions" made as part of the normal course of trading commoditi=
es.=20
Many things about the operation remain mysterious. It is unclear, for insta=
nce, who owns Mahonia. According to records from the Jersey Financial Servi=
ces Commission, the company was incorporated on Dec. 16, 1992. It has two n=
ominee shareholders, Lively Ltd. and Juris Ltd., who represent undisclosed =
owners.=20
"The question is: Was Mahonia a conduit on behalf of Enron or a conduit on =
behalf of J.P. Morgan?" says Manfred Knoll, a managing director for Germany=
's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which issued a $165 million letter of credit to=
 J.P. Morgan to guarantee against losses. He says Mahonia legally was a con=
duit of J.P. Morgan. But in practice, "it was a conduit that was set up to =
transact a variety of financial transactions for Enron."=20
On Tuesday, a New York bankruptcy-court judge ruled that Enron will have to=
 make available documents relating to Mahonia to the German bank, people fa=
miliar with the matter say.=20
As part of its broad investigation into Enron, the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is reviewing J.P. Morgan's multifaceted relationship with Enron,=
 people familiar with the matter say. Among other things, investigators are=
 examining whether the bank, through vehicles such as Mahonia, helped Enron=
 draw a misleading financial picture for investors.=20
People close to the matter say Enron told J.P. Morgan the trades were for t=
ax purposes. Tax experts say it is common for companies to manage tax liabi=
lities by, for instance, deferring certain losses from a bad year, when the=
 tax bill might be low, to a future period when they can be used to offset =
high earnings. There's nothing inherently illegal about trying to minimize =
corporate tax bills. Enron hasn't paid corporate income tax in four of the =
past five years, a spokesman says.=20
The Mahonia maneuvers may draw additional scrutiny now, however, in light o=
f admissions by Enron that it used a series of outside partnerships to hide=
 losses.=20
Whatever the ultimate goal, the transactions worked like this: J.P. Morgan =
would pay Enron between $150 million and $250 million for the future delive=
ry of natural gas or crude oil. This was constructed as a "trade," not a lo=
an. So Enron would report this as earnings that would cancel out, temporari=
ly, losses on Enron books.=20
But Enron had to eventually deliver the oil or gas, usually in regular inst=
allments with the value of $10 million to $20 million, the people familiar =
with Mahonia say. With each delivery, the losses began again to appear on E=
nron's ledger. These deliveries would begin the following year, so the loss=
es were carried from one year to the next, without showing up clearly on En=
ron's books.=20
The result: Enron kept those losses in reserve in case Enron had any profit=
 windfall on which it might pay tax, the people familiar with the matter sa=
y. If it did, it would use those losses to cancel out profits, and thus low=
er its tax burden. Or if Enron didn't have big profits to hide, it would ju=
st roll the losses over again to the next fiscal year -- by going back to J=
.P. Morgan and selling it another gas contract. Two tax experts contacted f=
or this article described the technique as unusual but potentially very eff=
ective. "It certainly makes sense as a tax strategy," says Doug Carmichael,=
 a professor of accounting at New York's Baruch College.=20
The whole process fed on itself. As one Wall Street banker put it, the arra=
ngements "practically guaranteed" Enron would come back to J.P. Morgan for =
more.=20
What was in it for Morgan? The deals generated, over the decade, fees and i=
nterest measuring as much as $100 million. In paying for future delivery of=
 gas to Mahonia, J.P. Morgan got the gas at a discount -- reflecting the in=
terest rate Enron would have paid were it getting a straightforward loan. I=
n the summer of 1999, this amounted to somewhere between 7% and 8%, or roug=
hly $7 million to $8 million for every $100 million J.P. Morgan channeled t=
o Enron under the Mahonia arrangement. (That revenue, of course, was offset=
 in part by the bank's funding costs.) The bank often got a small fee for a=
rranging the financing.=20
The arrangements were for years a source of pride within the bank's small c=
ommodities division, which directed the trades. Dinsa Mehta, one of J.P. Mo=
rgan's senior commodity traders, praised the deals to colleagues, saying th=
at while Enron put out its other commodity financing needs for all of Wall =
Street to bid on, Enron kept coming back to J.P. Morgan for trades that wou=
ld carry its losses forward. Mr. Mehta, contacted through a spokeswoman, de=
clined to comment.=20
In a basic way, the trading pact is a throwback. Prepaying for future deliv=
ery of a commodity is known as a "gold trade," because it is the way gold b=
ullion has been trading for centuries. In recent years, trading companies, =
whether from Houston or Wall Street, have been making more use of this stru=
cture to buy and sell oil, natural gas and other commodities. Some commerci=
al banks, including Chase Manhattan, a predecessor of J.P. Morgan, had to s=
et up part of these trades overseas because their banking charters wouldn't=
 allow them to take delivery of commodities.=20
J.P. Morgan also bought commodities contracts from a number of other energy=
 companies. Yet by far Mahonia's biggest customer was Enron, accounting for=
 roughly 60% of its business, people familiar with the matter say.=20
Over the years, the size of the transactions grew and the repayment periods=
 stretched out further and further into the future.=20
Mahonia's business with Enron jumped sharply in 1999. Oil prices were weak,=
 causing concerns over the future profitability of the energy industry. The=
 stock and bond capital markets had become reluctant to finance energy comp=
anies, leaving J.P. Morgan's offshore arrangements one of the few places th=
is industry could raise money.=20
In the summer of 1999, Enron officials contacted Morgan with requests to do=
 bigger and bigger trades, including a large arrangement of $650 million in=
 one trade. It was a far cry from earlier trades in the range of $150 milli=
on, and suggested to some people within the bank that Enron was no longer m=
erely interested in tax avoidance, but was actively using the arrangement t=
o meet its financing needs.=20
J.P. Morgan officials couldn't do the business without hedges. The firm wou=
ld be on the hook for a large chunk of cash if Enron defaulted before it de=
livered the natural gas. These arrangements, after all, presented the same =
default risk as any loan to Enron. J.P. Morgan effectively had been paying =
a portion of its earnings to other banks in exchange for their guaranteeing=
 portions of the arrangement. This move shifted some of the risk to other b=
anks like ABN Amro Holding NV or West LB.=20
It wasn't enough. By this time, companies including Enron wanted to raise m=
ore through Mahonia than the banking syndicate was willing to handle amid t=
he oil-price slump. So Enron, if it wanted more money, needed to find new p=
layers to share the risk of financing the gas payments.=20
Enron turned to 11 insurance companies -- including National Fire Insurance=
 Co., Safeco Insurance Co., St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. and Citigr=
oup Inc.'s Travelers unit -- to issue "surety bonds." These are financial g=
uarantees insurance companies commonly issue to ensure a project is complet=
ed, whether it's a bridge or Hollywood movie. Enron arranged these contract=
s for J.P. Morgan -- and paid the insurance companies for it -- so that the=
 bank would feel more comfortable making increasingly large trades with the=
 energy company, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.=20
As Enron's trades grew bigger and bigger, the bank was also financing other=
 energy companies, and the accounting on these trades became a source of co=
ncern within the bank. On Aug. 5, 1999, Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro and seni=
or credit officer David Pflug convened a meeting in a glass room off the ba=
nk's commodity trading floor.=20
As part of that briefing, the group went through a lengthy history of the b=
ank's trading with energy companies. The managers were told one reason comp=
anies like Enron were entering the complex trades was to carry forward loss=
es and lower tax burdens, a person familiar with the briefing said. This pe=
rson said Mr. Shapiro reviewed the trades and said they were fine. Mr. Shap=
iro declines to comment. Mr. Pflug, confirming the meeting, said it was cal=
led to discuss another client and commodity derivative contracts in general=
.=20
Two years later, the arrangement was still functioning as Enron's troubles =
deepened. Both Enron and J.P. Morgan kept looking for other institutions to=
 share the risk as Enron kept running new trades through Mahonia.=20
That's when Enron and Morgan turned to the German bank for more comfort. On=
 Sept. 10, 2001, Enron and Morgan arranged to obtain a $165 million letter =
of credit from West LB to guarantee derivatives trades between Mahonia and =
Enron North America, according to Mr. Knoll, the bank managing director.=20
In an unusual move underscoring Morgan's keen interest in the letter of cre=
dit, the legal documents were reviewed by Philip Levy, Morgan's associate g=
eneral counsel. Mr. Levy didn't return a call seeking comment.=20
Enron's woes deepened further. After a planned merger with rival Dynegy Inc=
. fell through, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2.=
 After the filing, Morgan requested to be paid under the letter of credit, =
Mr. Knoll says. So far, West LB has refused to pay, depositing the $165 mil=
lion in an escrow account which it says it will make available when the Mah=
onia transactions underlying the lending facility are proved proper.=20
It was only after the bankruptcy filing that investors first got a whiff of=
 Mahonia. Morgan's insurers, due to make a payment on the surety bonds by a=
 Dec. 21 deadline, refused to pay. Morgan sued in New York federal court. T=
he insurers filed a counterclaim, alleging that Mahonia was a fabrication m=
eant to disguise loans in the forms of commodity trades.=20
In court papers, the insurers say they were led to believe the arrangements=
 were meant to "actually supply natural gas and crude oil by Enron to Mahon=
ia." But the insurers refuse to pay the guarantees because the arrangements=
 "were not intended to be fulfilled," the insurers' complaint alleges. It a=
dds that Mahonia was a "mechanism to obtain surety bonds to secure loans to=
 be made to Enron in the guise" of trades.=20
J.P. Morgan says the insurers' claims are without merit, noting that the su=
rety contracts say the insurance liability is "absolute and unconditional."=
=20
The case is pending. But the spat already has dented Morgan's credibility. =
Morgan Chief Executive Officer William Harrison called his board shortly af=
ter the Enron bankruptcy filing and told them the bank had some $500 millio=
n in unsecured exposure and some other secured exposures, including loans o=
f $400 million backed by pipeline assets.=20
But after the insurers refused to honor their commitments on the surety bon=
ds, Mr. Harrison had to hit the phones again to directors, and raise the nu=
mber to $2.6 billion -- with roughly $1 billion of the additional exposure =
directly related to Mahonia.=20
Morgan has been defending its position ever since. Last week, the bank repo=
rted a fourth-quarter loss of $332 million, partly because of its exposure =
to Enron.=20
Meanwhile, Mr. Shapiro, the vice chairman, asserts that Morgan has known al=
l along the extent of its Enron vulnerability. "It's not an issue of what w=
e knew," he said late last month "but what was appropriate to disclose."=20

Accounting for Enron: Former SEC Chief Levitt Reverses Stand, Calls for New=
 Laws on Accounting Rules
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Lev=
itt, reversing an earlier stand, told Congress that the collapse of Enron C=
orp. uncovered systemic accounting problems that can be fixed only through =
legislation.=20
"The environment today calls for very different remedies, very different ac=
tion," Mr. Levitt told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. "If you w=
ould have asked me a year ago whether a legislative solution was desirable,=
 I would have said `no.' "
With Enron, "the smoking gun has exploded," he said, adding. "That's often =
what it takes for a wake-up call."=20
Congress needs to authorize a new, independent oversight board for the acco=
unting industry, he said. He also told lawmakers that the SEC needs to adop=
t new accounting standards to better track the effect of executive stock op=
tions and to require full disclosure of off-balance-sheet "special purpose =
entities," which Enron formed to conceal losses.=20
Mr. Levitt was joined by Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accountant, who call=
ed for an overhaul of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the industr=
y's independent rule-making body, as well as an overhaul of accounting rule=
s as well.=20
"What is reflected here is a shared sense of outrage," said Committee Chair=
man Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.). He said the committee would do a thorough=
 investigation and hold more hearings, with "a shared desire to end this in=
vestigation with serious proposals for reform."=20
In the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy filing, Mr. Levitt has been upstag=
ing his SEC successor, Harvey Pitt, in promoting needed reforms. He applaud=
ed Mr. Pitt's recently announced proposal for a new private-sector oversigh=
t board, but questioned whether it went far enough. Mr. Levitt proposed tha=
t Congress approve and fund a new board that is completely independent of t=
he accounting industry.=20
Messrs. Levitt and Turner said that FASB, which is responsible for creating=
 accounting standards, fails to approve needed changes because they are blo=
cked by board members appointed by the securities and accounting industries=
.=20
For instance, the SEC first asked the FASB to improve the standards for rep=
orting special purpose entities in 1985. The end result was a "weak set of =
rules," Mr. Turner said. Because of growing problems, the SEC called for ne=
w stiffer rules in its 2000 report to Congress. "We cannot afford to wait a=
nother 15 years," Mr. Turner said. "If the FASB were unable to resolve this=
 by the end of 2002, then I would urge the SEC to act promptly."=20
Also in testimony yesterday, University of San Diego law professor Frank Pa=
rtnoy said he has independently gathered information that Enron manipulated=
 its derivatives trading revenue. "In a nutshell, it appears that some Enro=
n employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to creat=
e false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded," Mr. Part=
noy said.=20
Mr. Partnoy, who formerly worked as a derivatives salesman at J.P. Morgan, =
said Enron's extensive use of derivatives was a major cause of the company'=
s financial downfall. Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from de=
rivatives over the three years to 2000.=20
Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman, said he hadn't seen the testimony and as a=
 general rule Enron wouldn't offer a counterpoint to testimony from Washing=
ton hearings.

WASHINGTON -- Two years ago, Arthur Levitt couldn't muster much support for=
 a proposal to make accounting firms more independent by limiting their abi=
lity to sell consulting services to their audit clients.=20
Amid strong opposition from the accounting industry, corporations and membe=
rs of Congress, the then-chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 backed down.
On Thursday, however, the same proposal held the rapt attention of a roomfu=
l of fawning senators and caused Levitt to be mobbed by reporters after his=
 testimony.=20
"So do you feel completely--or just absolutely, totally--vindicated?" quipp=
ed Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.).=20
In another sign that government priorities have changed as a result of the =
Enron Corp. bankruptcy, the Senate on Thursday held its first full committe=
e hearing to examine why the energy giant collapsed and what the government=
 could have done to prevent the loss of billions of dollars by employees an=
d investors.=20
The hearing set the stage for what is certain to be a vigorous debate in th=
e coming months over sweeping regulatory proposals to rein in financial mar=
kets, retirement funds, campaign fund-raising and the energy industry.=20
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate Governmental Affa=
irs Committee, promised Thursday to lead an aggressive nonpartisan investig=
ation into the Enron debacle, seeking answers from government agencies incl=
uding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the White House.=20
"We will follow the facts wherever they lead us," Lieberman said.=20
Among the questions Lieberman hopes to answer are: How did Enron hide its d=
ebts and losses from SEC oversight? Could the Labor Department have interve=
ned to prevent Enron employees from losing their retirement savings? Are Wa=
ll Street analysts providing objective analysis of stocks? Did regulatory g=
aps allow Enron's problems to slip through the cracks?=20
But Republicans warned against rushing to new regulations. Only a year ago,=
 the Bush administration and the Republican Party were vowing to slash gove=
rnment rules in many of the same areas currently under a microscope.=20
The blame for Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2--less than a month after it =
restated earnings to account for $586 million in previously unreported loss=
es--may ultimately rest with illegal activity of individuals, not a breakdo=
wn in regulation, said Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), the ranking Republican=
 on the committee.=20
"No system known to man can prevent unscrupulous and clever individuals fro=
m manipulating the system and even getting away with it for a period of tim=
e," Thompson said.=20
He also warned Democrats not to try to take political advantage of the inve=
stigation by focusing on "titillating" issues, such as the contacts between=
 Enron officials and the Bush administration.=20
Levitt called upon Congress to pass new laws to tighten regulation of finan=
cial markets, which he said have been eroded by a "culture of gamesmanship =
that says it's OK to bend the rules, tweak the numbers and let obvious and =
important discrepancies slide."=20
In addition to renewing his call for limits on the types of consulting work=
 accounting firms can perform for an audit client, Levitt said companies sh=
ould be required to change audit firms every five to seven years; stock exc=
hanges should require that a majority of directors on company boards be ind=
ependent; and analysts should be forced to disclose how their compensation =
is affected by their firms' investment relationship with companies they cov=
er.=20
Levitt and Lynn E. Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant, said a new ac=
counting oversight board is needed with independent members, reliable fundi=
ng and a mandate to move quickly and aggressively to eliminate accounting l=
oopholes and gimmicks.=20
Turner said it has taken the Financial Accounting Standards Board longer to=
 approve new rules for special-purpose entities--the kind of off-the-books =
partnerships used by Enron to mask its problems--than "it's taken my childr=
en to get through high school."=20
Derivatives trading is another area ripe for government regulation, said Un=
iversity of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy, who told the committee T=
hursday that Enron's heavy reliance on the high-risk market rivaled that of=
 the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, which failed in 1998.=20
In fact, Partnoy said, Enron reported earning more money from trading deriv=
atives in 2000 than Long-Term Capital Management made in its history.=20
"Enron makes Long-Term Capital Management look like a lemonade stand," said=
 Partnoy, a former derivatives trader who is writing a book about Enron's c=
ollapse.=20
Derivatives, used by sophisticated investors as a risk-management tool, are=
 complex financial instruments whose value is based upon a future variable,=
 such as interest rates or gas prices.=20
Though some derivative trading occurs on regulated exchanges, the vast majo=
rity--more than $95 trillion a year--take place on over-the-counter markets=
 that were exempted from regulation in 2000 under the Commodity Futures Mod=
ernization Act.=20
Enron used derivatives in two ways. First, they were key to structuring Enr=
on's controversial partnerships, which allowed it to hide debt, mask invest=
ment losses and inflate earnings. Enron used them as a kind of financial "p=
lastic surgery to make itself look better than it really was," Partnoy said=
.=20
Second, they were key to Enron's profit. The company used its Enron Online =
division to act as a go-between for other parties wishing to trade not only=
 energy-related derivatives, but also contracts for such commodities as fib=
er-optic bandwidth. By the time Enron filed for bankruptcy, the soaring rev=
enue from the derivatives trading business was masking problems in Enron's =
core energy business.=20
The lack of government oversight may have enabled Enron to smooth out profi=
ts from derivatives trading to make the business appear less volatile. He s=
aid that was accomplished by creating accounts that enabled Enron to carry =
over trading profits from year to year.=20
An Enron spokesman could not be reached for comment on Partnoy's allegation=
s.

Accounting for Enron: Grand Jury to Investigate Plaintiffs' Firm Involved i=
n Shareholder Suit Against Enron
By Rick Schmitt and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/25/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A noted plaintiffs' law firm, which is taking a highly visible role in a sh=
areholder suit against Enron Corp., is being investigated by federal author=
ities in connection with allegations that it improperly solicited investors=
 to file class-action suits, people familiar with the probe said.=20
The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles has convened a grand jury to investigate M=
ilberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, these people said. Officials are t=
rying to determine whether the firm paid money to people to act as plaintif=
fs in lawsuits, the people familiar with the probe said.
Milberg Weiss, which has offices in New York and San Diego, didn't return p=
hone calls seeking comment. The grand-jury investigation was reported yeste=
rday by the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal-industry newspaper.=20
Disclosure of the probe comes as Milberg Weiss is in a pitched battle with =
other plaintiffs' firms vying for the role of lead counsel in securities-fr=
aud suits filed against Enron in federal court in Houston. The firm made he=
adlines earlier this week marching into court with a box of shredded docume=
nts carted out of Enron headquarters by an ex-employee.=20
Until recently, law firms that filed securities-fraud actions first often w=
ere given control of cases -- and the chance to make the largest fees. Firm=
s such as Milberg Weiss often maintained a stable of clients to help launch=
 the suits. The probe is looking at how Milberg Weiss identified those clie=
nts, and whether they were paid.=20
Since 1995, larger, institutional investors have been taking a greater role=
 in securities-fraud suits, because of a change in federal law. In the Enro=
n case, Milberg Weiss is representing the Regents of the University of Cali=
fornia. Lloyd Lee, a university lawyer, said the regents have consulted wit=
h Milberg Weiss, and "they assured us that they were cooperating fully with=
 the inquiry."=20
Separately, the federal judge in Houston presiding over the shareholder law=
suits related to Enron's collapse, ordered Arthur Andersen LLP to make six =
of its current and former officials available for depositions by next month=
 and provide a detailed account of document shredding that took place in it=
s Houston office.=20
The order is unusual because it comes so early in the litigation. Typically=
, under federal securities laws, plaintiffs' attorneys must wait until all =
pending motions for dismissal have been resolved before they are allowed to=
 proceed with the discovery phase of a case.=20
"It is a very sensible order under these extraordinary circumstances," said=
 Jeff Kaiser, an attorney at Kaiser & May LLP in Houston, one of the law fi=
rms representing shareholders in the Houston case. His firm also is pursuin=
g a separate lawsuit against Andersen in a Galveston County, Texas, state d=
istrict court.=20
The order by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon requires Andersen to submit=
 a report within 20 days cataloging the documents it destroyed, describing =
any documents it has been able to recover and explaining the efforts it has=
 made to do so. Additionally, Andersen's report must include a description =
of Enron-related materials currently in the firm's possession.

After Enron, a Push to Limit Accountants to...Accounting
By Deborah Solomon
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/25/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When it was flying high, energy-trading company Enron Corp. was famous for =
pioneering new markets. Here is something else it is helping to develop: a =
relatively new breed of shareholder proposal.=20
A number of institutional investors -- with Enron's rapid collapse in mind =
-- are calling for companies to adopt "conflict of interest policies" that =
would prevent their accounting firm from providing anything beyond auditing=
 services. Shareholder proposals seeking to limit the accounting firms' rol=
es have surfaced at a wide range of companies following Enron's meltdown. A=
t the heart of such proposals: concerns that accounting firms have a financ=
ial incentive to sign off on overly aggressive accounting practices at comp=
anies that simultaneously pay them large sums for nonaudit work.
In Enron's case, the Houston company paid Arthur Andersen LLP $25 million f=
or its audit and $27 million for nonauditing work, including tax-related an=
d consulting services, in 2000, the last year for which figures are publicl=
y available. In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four =
years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings=
. In recent testimony before Congress, Andersen officials have said they do=
n't believe their independence as an auditor was compromised by the nonaudi=
ting fees.=20
"It took Enron to get shareholders interested in addressing this issue, but=
 many investors want auditor independence," says Patrick McGurn, vice presi=
dent of Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser that makes reco=
mmendations for how institutions should vote.=20
Shareholders are proposing these policies for about 30 companies, including=
 Apple Computer Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Motorola Inc., PG&E Corp. and Wal=
t Disney Co. Most of the companies are fighting the initiatives and have as=
ked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that they don't have to =
put the proposals to a vote. Corporate-governance specialists expect the SE=
C to rule in favor of shareholders, putting the initiatives on the ballots =
for annual meetings later this year.=20
Whether any of the proposals become policy at the individual companies is a=
nother matter; rarely do shareholder proposals pass. But some who track cor=
porate-governance developments say support for these new ones could be stro=
ng enough to prompt companies to agree to limit the use of their auditing f=
irms for other activities. "It can embarrass management," says John C. Coff=
ee Jr., law professor at Columbia University. "The real success of these ki=
nds of proposals is that they will lead to negotiations . . . that might pu=
t restrictions on the amount of consulting that these companies can do."=20
The no-conflict-of-interest initiatives are being proposed by labor unions,=
 which hold shares in companies as part of pension plans and other investme=
nts. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which controls $35 billion in pe=
nsion assets, proposed the policy at several companies after reviewing the =
ratio of audit to nonaudit fees. The SEC began requiring that companies dis=
close that information as of the year 2000.=20
Many of the companies were paying 10 to 15 times more for nonaudit-related =
services than for auditing fees. Ed Durkin, director of special programs fo=
r the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, says: "The impression somebody coul=
d get from looking at these numbers is that there might be issues of indepe=
ndence and of the integrity of the financial-reporting system."=20
But some say a blanket policy restricting the accounting relationship isn't=
 necessarily going to prevent an Enron-like blow-up. "It's probably more a =
matter of disclosure than limitations," says David Bowers, an analyst with =
Evergreen Investment Management Co., which owns shares of PG&E. While inves=
tors need to pay attention to what the accountants are doing, there is some=
 benefit to having a firm perform multiple duties, he says. "It's hard to p=
aint it over with a broad brush and say you can't have both relationships."=
=20
Companies also note that some of the fees labeled as "nonaudit" under the n=
ew SEC rules are for services traditionally provided by auditors, such as w=
ork done on registration statements or on taxes. Renee Parnell, a spokeswom=
an for PG&E, says the company often has to use its accounting firm, Deloitt=
e & Touche LLP "for things like regulatory filings," adding that PG&E is "s=
eeking SEC recommendation on whether to include the proposal" in its proxy.=
 A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment beyond what is written in the=
 proxy, which recommends that shareholders vote against the proposal. Repre=
sentatives from Apple, Motorola and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.=
=20
The shareholders' proposals aren't original in this sense: Two years ago, f=
ormer SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. sought to limit dual auditing/consulti=
ng roles for accounting firms. But his plan met fierce resistance from the =
accounting industry and its lobbyists, as well as from members of Congress,=
 and he backed down, settling for less-stringent limits on certain types of=
 nonauditing work. Mr. Levitt has said several congressmen threatened to cu=
t the SEC's appropriations if he didn't back away from the tough conflict-o=
f-interest rules he originally promoted. Current SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt h=
as said he doesn't support the limitations sought by his predecessor, belie=
ving other reforms are more relevant.=20
James D. Cox, a professor of law at Duke University who has written extensi=
vely on accounting and legal issues, says shareholder proposals may be the =
best way to change the rules. "There are a lot of investors out there, incl=
uding financial institutions, who believe this is a good idea," he says. Be=
fore the Enron debacle, "we lulled ourselves into a complacent state thinki=
ng that accountants who know their client from performing nonaudit services=
 can better perform the audit function. I think that's a mantra that after =
Enron is going to fall on deaf ears."=20
Backers of the proposals say restricting the types of services accounting f=
irms perform for clients won't eliminate the potential for fraud, but can h=
elp bolster confidence in public companies. "I don't think there's any bene=
fit for a company if its accounting firm has a consulting relationship," sa=
ys Ted O'Connor, portfolio manager at Cambiar Investors Inc., which owns sh=
ares of Motorola. He expects to vote for the proposal at Motorola.

The White House's National Security Council is the president's nerve center=
 for international crises and strategy. For a moment last year, it also act=
ed as a sort of concierge service for Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and Ind=
ia's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra.=20
A June e-mail sent from the NSC said Mishra would "be willing to meet with =
Mr. Lay and the bankers . . . but only at the residence. Pls. let me know y=
our decision on this soonest." A second e-mail, also originating in the NSC=
, added, "We are not involved in arranging any meetings for Mr. Lay. . . . =
I will ask the Indians if he is invited to the dinner. Also, the Indians di=
d not agree to see the lenders. I will go at them again, but if they come a=
round it might be for a Friday meeting and not the dinner."
The efforts to get an audience with Indian officials for Lay and the banker=
s over the company's Dabhol power plant were detailed in documents released=
 last week by the government-funded Overseas Private Investment Corp. under=
 a Freedom of Information Act request. They provide a glimpse of a governme=
nt function normally conducted in secret to avoid political embarrassment f=
or foreign governments that face U.S. pressure on behalf of American corpor=
ations.=20
Susan Schwab, a Commerce Department official from the first Bush administra=
tion and now dean of the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs,=
 said she was surprised that the commercial advocacy has become "one where =
it's not the State Department or Commerce Department but the NSC leading th=
e working group."=20
Daniel Tarullo, a Georgetown University law professor who oversaw internati=
onal economics issues for President Bill Clinton's National Economic Counci=
l, concurred that "the norm would have been NSC participation in a discussi=
on rather than NSC chairing it."=20
That change is symbolic of the heightened government priority on aiding com=
mercial interests overseas. The effort, which expanded in the first Bush ad=
ministration and in the Clinton administration, is evolving to a more expli=
cit link to national security as the Bush administration elevates ties betw=
een the NSC and economic and commercial considerations.=20
"It's a new definition of national interest that embodies the national econ=
omic interest," Schwab said. "It's not as blatant as 'what's good for Gener=
al Motors is good for America,' but it's the globalized version of that."=
=20
The trend grew after the end of the Cold War, when it appeared American com=
panies were not competitive with the Japanese and others. "It was a sense t=
hat our strategic position was at stake," said Leon Fuerth, who was securit=
y adviser to Vice President Al Gore. U.S. multinationals came to be seen as=
 "agents of American national power."=20
Under the Clinton administration, U.S. diplomats were evaluated on their pe=
rformance in cooperating with American business, according to Stuart E. Eiz=
enstat, who held a senior post in the State Department. "This was a major a=
ctivity and something they were expected to engage in," he said.=20
Even back then, Enron received a disproportionate share of government help =
-- not necessarily because of the company's political connections but becau=
se of its bold expansion into emerging markets. "With the possibility of Bo=
eing, there is no U.S. company I had more interaction with, involved in mor=
e projects abroad [and] had more of a call on our time than Enron," Eizenst=
at said.=20
The effort, which decelerated after Sept. 11, may have peaked last year wit=
h U.S. support for Enron in its dispute with India. At times it was difficu=
lt to separate Enron interests from national interests. In late August, Lay=
, frustrated with progress in India, told the Financial Times: "There are U=
.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing any aid or a=
ssistance to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of =
U.S. companies."=20
At the time, Enron was seeking $2.3 billion for itself and its lenders to s=
ell its 65 percent interest in the Dabhol plant, which had been mired for y=
ears in a dispute with its main customer, an Indian state government. "If t=
hey try to squeeze us down to something less than cost, then it basically b=
ecomes an expropriation by the Indian government," Lay told the newspaper.=
=20
The chief minister of Maharashtra state in India decried "the strong-arm ta=
ctics of Enron" he interpreted in Lay's words. Just two weeks before, the U=
nited States had indicated that it might lift sanctions imposed on India fo=
r earlier nuclear tests.=20
Enron issued a statement the next day saying Lay "was merely referring to U=
.S. laws" and was not issuing a threat. Lay sent a letter to Indian Prime M=
inister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to say "I have not asked anyone in the U.S. go=
vernment to consider sanctions. I did not say that the Dabhol power issue h=
ad been expropriated."=20
The administration correspondence released last week suggested various over=
laps between Enron and U.S. efforts in India. A July 30 memo to the "Dabhol=
 Working Group" in the administration listed among the actions taken in Jul=
y that "Enron Chairman Ken Lay visited India" and met various government of=
ficials. The Dabhol working group's plans in August included an "Enron trip=
" to a location that was blacked out on the document before the government =
released the information.=20
September's actions by the Dabhol group were to include a visit by U.S. Tra=
de Representative Robert B. Zoellick to India; Zoellick had been a paid con=
sultant to Enron before joining the administration. Zoellick has since said=
 he did not raise the issue. The group also planned to make use of a visit =
to the United Nations in September by Vajpayee.=20
The NSC working group coordinated a push at the highest levels of governmen=
t. Vice President Cheney, as reported, brought up the matter with Sonia Gan=
dhi, leader of India's Congress Party. The e-mail exchanges indicate Cheney=
 planned to raise the matter again on Oct. 3 with India's foreign minister.=
 A list of "Dabhol talking points" for Cheney's meeting with the minister w=
ere "passed to Veep's staff for inclusion" by the NSC. The minister, Jaswan=
t Singh, heard again from the administration in October, when Undersecretar=
y of State Alan P. Larson raised Dabhol.=20
Last weekend, the State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin =
L. Powell had discussed the Dabhol project on April 6 in a meeting with Sin=
gh. According to an account provided by State, Powell told his Indian count=
erpart that "failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent e=
ffect on other investors."=20
Before the November meeting between Vajpayee and Bush, at which Bush was to=
 raise the subject of Dabhol, an e-mail apparently from the NSC to the Over=
seas Private Investment Corp. suggested a resolution was close. It asked: "=
Do you still want to sign an MOU [memorandum of understanding] with the Ind=
ians or announce one during Vajpayee's visit?" Plans for Bush to raise the =
subject were scratched as Enron's problems became public.=20
The administration continues to talk about Dabhol, even after Enron's bankr=
uptcy filing. Larson mentioned it with the Indians during a visit to New De=
lhi last week with Powell.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE SECRETARY
Army Chief Being Challenged on Ties to Company
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- When Thomas E. White was chosen last spring to becom=
e secretary of the Army, administration officials portrayed his nomination =
as part of an effort to bring corporate discipline to the Pentagon.=20
Mr. White, who had been vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, arrived wit=
h a boardroom boast that he and his private-sector colleagues were the new =
''C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense.''
But now an advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader contends that Mr. White's =
business dealings present a conflict of interest. The group, Public Citizen=
, is raising questions while Congress investigates the collapse of the Enro=
n Corporation, which has filed for bankruptcy protection.=20
Mr. White, through a spokesman, denied any wrongdoing.=20
Public Citizen this week accused Mr. White of taking action to benefit Enro=
n within weeks of becoming Army secretary. In remarks to the media in June,=
 Mr. White vowed to accelerate efforts to privatize energy utilities servin=
g the military.=20
The privatization effort had slowed while California's energy crisis unfold=
ed, but Enron continued to promote the program. Mr. White himself had lobbi=
ed on its behalf while at Enron, and in 1999 the energy division had been a=
warded a contract worth $25 million over 10 years to provide energy to Fort=
 Hamilton in Brooklyn, Public Citizen said.=20
''It's a huge conflict of interest,'' said Tyson Slocum, the group's resear=
ch director. At the time of Mr. White's confirmation as Army secretary, Mr.=
 Slocum said, Enron had seven bids pending at the Pentagon.=20
A spokesman for Mr. White denied today that Mr. White had behaved inappropr=
iately. The secretary had explicitly excused himself from decisions affecti=
ng Enron, but he was determined to advance efforts to privatize Defense Dep=
artment services and save taxpayers money, said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Rya=
n Yantis.=20
As part of a government ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell h=
is shares in Enron. He was given 90 days to do so, then received an extensi=
on that gave him until Nov. 20 to complete the sale. He sold the last of hi=
s shares for $13 each in mid-October, just before the company disclosed the=
 problems that led to its bankruptcy filing.=20
Mr. White acknowledged having contacts with Enron employees since last June=
, including a call with Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, i=
n September, but he called them personal in nature.=20
Administration officials voiced confidence in Mr. White, and Congress membe=
rs investigating the Enron collapse say they have no evidence that he acted=
 in bad faith during his 11 years as an Enron executive or subsequently.=20
Mr. White, in a letter to one investigator, Representative Henry A. Waxman,=
 Democrat of California, noted this week that he had incurred ''significant=
 personal losses'' in the Enron bankruptcy.=20
In the letter, which responded to questions by Mr. Waxman, Mr. White said h=
e had briefly discussed Enron with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Nov=
ember and with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell last month.=20
''The nature of both conversations was a concern on their part for the impa=
ct that the bankruptcy of Enron may have had on my personal well-being,'' M=
r. White wrote. ''My response in both cases was that I had suffered signifi=
cant personal losses, but that I would persevere.''=20
Mr. White also detailed the 30 contacts he had with Enron employees since l=
ast June, involving both phone calls and personal meetings. The contacts in=
cluded a telephone conversation on Sept. 10 with Mr. Lay.=20
Mr. White initiated the call to Mr. Lay ''to wish him luck as he assumed hi=
s new duties as C.E.O. of Enron,'' Mr. White's letter said. The contacts wi=
th other Enron officials, he said, were all ''personal in nature, with thei=
r inquiring about my progress as Secretary of the Army and my inquiring abo=
ut their personal challenges as they dealt with Enron's deteriorating finan=
cial conditions.''=20
Mr. White added that ''at no time'' did Mr. Lay or any other Enron employee=
 ask him to intercede with federal officials on Enron's behalf.=20
Mr. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the Government Reform and Oversight Com=
mittee, is still studying Mr. White's letter, aides said, and was not avail=
able for comment.=20
A review of Mr. White's financial disclosure information shows that he amas=
sed a considerable fortune while working for Enron.=20
According to his filings in May, Mr. White last received a salary of $5.5 m=
illion at Enron and owned homes in Naples, Fla., and Aspen, Colo., valued a=
t more than $5 million each. He bought a $5.5 million penthouse in Washingt=
on last June.=20
Mr. White held more Enron stock than any other senior official joining the =
Bush administration. According to the disclosure forms, he held $25 million=
 to $50 million in Enron shares, $25 million to $50 million in stock option=
s and $5 million to $25 million in a phantom stock award, which is a promis=
e to pay a future bonus in appreciated stock or its cash equivalent.=20
To comply with the ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell 405,71=
0 shares of Enron. He made the sales, from June 13 to Oct. 14, 2001, as the=
 value of Enron stock steadily diminished. For example, he sold 92,000 shar=
es at $50 in mid-June and 86,709 shares at $13 in October.=20
In his letter, Mr. White said he had sold all of his Enron stock and had re=
nounced his stock options.

THE NATION With the Theater or PACs, Texans Saw Kenneth Lay as 'On Top of t=

HOUSTON -- For all his clout in Washington, Kenneth L. Lay's greatest influ=
ence was back home in Texas where the mirror-sheathed Enron headquarters bu=
ilding glimmers above the Houston skyline.=20
Operating here in his home base, Lay--who resigned Wednesday night as chair=
man of the once high-flying energy trading company he founded--was a kingma=
ker who could create or crush political careers, spearhead professional spo=
rts stadium drives, finance youth clubs and endow theater troupes.
"This was a man on top of the world. It was well known that if you needed s=
omething done you went to Ken Lay," recalled Felix Fraga, a former Houston =
city councilman who has known Lay more than 30 years. "He could have run fo=
r mayor, governor, or done anything he wanted."=20
As part of President Bush's celebrated "pioneers" club, Lay and his wife, L=
inda, donated more than $145,000 to the national Republican Party and the B=
ush campaign. The Lays also contributed $100,000 to the Bush inaugural gala=
 and $10,000 to the election recount fund.=20
But in Texas, where his money was less diluted, state Ethics Commission rec=
ords show Lay gave $55,000 to one state Senate campaign alone. Other large =
contributions graced the coffers of Gov. Rick Perry, Atty. Gen. John Cornyn=
 and Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown, for whom Lay sponsored a $50,000 fund-rais=
er Oct. 8.=20
However, in a sign that Enron fortunes were already on a slide, Brown campa=
ign finance director Sue Walden said Lay failed to show up for the fund-rai=
ser and never sent a check.=20
Always the Go-To Guy=20
Over the years, Texas officeholders ranging from Houston City Council membe=
rs to state railroad commissioners benefited from Lay's political largess.=
=20
"Ken Lay was a guy with swagger and loot who bought his way into whatever n=
eeded buying," said Texas populist politician and commentator Jim Hightower=
. "He had this aura of being bulletproof, a corporate superstar who was rea=
l connected to the Bushes."=20
After Lay's spectacular fall from power and grace, the extent of Lay's and =
Enron's insertion into Texas government only now is surfacing.=20
The first casualty was Texas Public Utilities Commission chairman Max Yzagu=
irre, a former Enron executive Lay helped get appointed as the state's chie=
f utility regulator. Yzaguirre, tainted by his Enron connections, resigned =
his post Jan. 17.=20
Others caught in the backwash of the Enron collapse are Perry, who received=
 a $25,000 contribution from Lay the day after he appointed Yzaguirre to di=
rect the PUC; Cornyn, a U.S. Senate candidate who reversed an earlier posit=
ion and recused himself from the state Enron investigation because of donat=
ions he received from Lay and Enron; and Texas elected Supreme Court Justic=
e Priscilla Owens, whose appointment by Bush to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court =
of Appeals now is in jeopardy because of Enron contributions she received b=
eginning in 1995 and decisions she made favoring the company.=20
According to Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, Lay displayed a=
 particular genius for picking out politicians on the rise.=20
"These were investments about where these guys were going, not necessarily =
where they were at the time," Stein said. "Ken Lay was a big supporter of B=
ush probably before Bush himself knew he was running for president."=20
According to the Austin-based watchdog group Texans for Public Justice, the=
 Lays personally donated $122,000 to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns. Si=
milarly, Lay was an early backer of Cornyn, even before the Republican atto=
rney general announced his candidacy for the seat to be vacated by Republic=
an Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring after this year's elections.=20
Payroll Deductions to the Company PAC=20
Gramm, whose economist wife served as a paid member of the Enron board of d=
irectors, is caught up in the vortex because of the tens of thousands of do=
llars he received in contributions from Enron and Lay.=20
Enron's system for political contributions operated on two fronts. Employee=
s were encouraged to give money to candidates believed to be supportive of =
company issues, particularly those involving market deregulation central to=
 the energy trading business.=20
Additionally, top executives were tapped for what amounted to a tithe to th=
e Enron Political Action Committee, one of the country's biggest corporate =
political PACs. A percentage of each executive's paycheck was withheld from=
 every biweekly pay period. For example, Joe Allen, Enron vice president fo=
r state government affairs, gave $83.34 every two weeks to the Enron PAC, f=
or an annual total of $2,166. Other executives gave much more.=20
The money primarily was used to fund campaigns of candidates for Congress, =
particularly those with key energy-related positions. According to document=
s on file with the Texas Ethics Commission, the Enron PAC collected $336,00=
0 from executives in 2001.=20
But not all of Lay's and Enron's munificence was reserved for major politic=
al offices, nor was it limited to politics.=20
Spreading Wealth Among Nonprofits=20
One of the largest political contributions Lay made in 2001 was for a state=
 Senate race in the Piney Woods of rural East Texas. In that race, one of t=
he most expensive legislative races ever undertaken in Texas, Democratic tr=
ial lawyer David Marsh was pitted against Republican businessman/rancher To=
dd Staples.=20
The race became a key contest for the Houston-based Texans for Lawsuit Refo=
rm, a conservative movement Lay supports that seeks to limit lawsuits. Stap=
les won, backed by $55,000 in contributions from Lay.=20
Even in the grandest Texas tradition of alms giving and support for the art=
s, few have surpassed Lay and his company.=20
The Lays and Enron were prominent givers to virtually every important Houst=
on charity ranging from a new cancer ward at the city's famous M.D. Anderso=
n Hospital to support for the Houston Ballet.=20
Lay encouraged giving by offering matching funds for as much as $15,000 for=
 each employee. The results often were spectacular. Enron's 7,500 employees=
 alone, led by Lay with a $100,000 pledge, accounted for $5.5 million of th=
e $75 million raised by the Houston United Way campaign.=20
"Enron was a visible leader in the charity world," said Houston Ballet mana=
ging director Cecil C. Conner, whose troupe received a $10,000 gift from th=
e Lays. "It helped make this city a vibrant, important city, not just an oi=
l town. We have lost a leading voice."=20
Occasionally, Lay's influence went beyond money.=20
When former City Councilman Fraga, 72, a longtime social worker and promine=
nt leader in the Latino community, found himself snared in a 1997 FBI bribe=
ry sting operation that sent another councilman to jail, Lay was one of the=
 prominent Houstonians who wrote a letter in Fraga's support.=20
After returning the $2,000 offered by two undercover agents, Fraga never wa=
s charged.=20
But Lay may be missed most as a civic leader. He served a term as president=
 of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's influential super-chamber o=
f commerce. Before that he served as head of the Board of Regents at the Un=
iversity of Houston, where he received his graduate education.=20
According to political scientist Stein, Lay was instrumental in the revival=
 of Houston's historically moribund downtown, including the successful refe=
rendums to build stadiums for baseball and basketball/hockey, the building =
of a light rail line connecting Houston's renowned medical center complex t=
o downtown and development of the theater district.=20
"Ken Lay was a great promoter of the city," Stein said. "His business was b=
ased on attracting productive capital and labor, and when it worked, it wor=
ked to make the city a more attractive place to live."=20
Scrambling for a New Look=20
But even this legacy already is fading, as Lay's and Enron's woes continue =
to deepen. On a recent afternoon in Houston's gritty 2nd Ward District, the=
 Enron Boys and Girls Club, renovated with $500,000 in Enron donations, was=
 busy changing its name. The Enron logo on the center of the newly resurfac=
ed basketball court was being sanded off and replaced with the new sponsor'=
s name: Holt House.=20
"We've already got us a new sponsor," said club director Glen Sherrod, show=
ing a reporter a roomful of new computers donated by Enron.=20
In a statement issued Thursday, Mayor Brown made no mention of Lay's role i=
n rebuilding the city.=20
"My fervent hope," Brown said, "is that Enron is able to hire a CEO who can=
 put the company back in a position to rehire its employees and remain a vi=
able part of the business community."

c. 2002 New York Times Company

A bizarre thing happened to me over the past week: Conservative newspapers =
and columnists made a concerted effort to portray me as a guilty party in t=
he Enron scandal. Why? Because in 1999, before coming to The New York Times=
, I was briefly paid to serve on an Enron advisory board.=20
Never mind that, scrupulously following the Times conflict of interest rule=
s, I resigned from that board as soon as I agreed to write for this newspap=
er -- making me much more fastidious than, say, William Kristol, who served=
 on that same board while editing The Weekly Standard. Never mind that I di=
sclosed that past connection a year ago, the first time I wrote about Enron=
 in this column -- and also disclosed it the one time I mentioned Enron bef=
ore, in a Fortune column. Never mind that the compensation I received per d=
ay was actually somewhat less than other companies were paying me at the ti=
me for speeches on world economic issues.
And never mind that when I started writing in this column about issues of c=
oncern to Enron -- in particular, criticizing the role that market manipula=
tion by energy companies played in the California power crisis -- my positi=
on was not at all what the company wanted to hear. (Compare this with the b=
oard member Lawrence Kudlow, a commentator for National Review and CNBC. He=
 wrote vehemently in favor of the Cheney energy plan -- and has called this=
 the ''Clinton-Levitt recession,'' blaming Arthur Levitt, the former Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission chairman, who tried to fight the accounting la=
xity that made Enron possible.)=20
Yet reading those attacks, you would think that I was a major-league white-=
collar criminal.=20
It's tempting to take this vendetta as a personal compliment: Some people a=
re so worried about the effect of my writing that they will try anything to=
 get me off this page. But actually it was part of a broader effort by cons=
ervatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it wou=
ld stick.=20
A few days ago Tim Noah published a very funny piece in Slate about this ef=
fort, titled ''Blaming liberalism for Enron.'' (Full disclosure: I used to =
write a column for Slate -- and Slate is owned by Microsoft. So I guess tha=
t makes me a Bill Gates crony. I even shook his hand once.) It describes th=
e strategies conservative pundits have used to shift the blame for the Enro=
n scandal onto the other side of the political spectrum.=20
Among the ploys: Enron was in favor of the Kyoto treaty, because it thought=
 it could make money trading emission permits; see, environmentalism is the=
 villain. Or how about this: Enron made money by exploiting the quirks of e=
lectricity markets that had been only partly deregulated; see, regulation i=
s the villain.=20
And, of course -- you knew this was coming -- it's all a reflection of Clin=
ton-era moral decline. Traditionally, as we all know, Texas businessmen and=
 politicians were models of probity; they never cooked their books or engag=
ed in mutual back-scratching.=20
One doubts that the people putting out this stuff really expect to convince=
 anyone. But they do hope to muddy the waters. If they can get a little bit=
 of Enron dirt on everyone -- the Clinton administration, environmentalists=
, liberal columnists -- the stain on people and ideas they support will be =
less noticeable.=20
Why is Enron a problem for conservatives? Even if the Bush administration t=
urns out to be squeaky clean, which we'll never know unless it starts to be=
 more forthcoming, the scandal threatens perceptions that the right has spe=
nt decades creating. After all that effort to discredit concerns about the =
gap between haves and have-nots as obsolete ''class warfare,'' along comes =
a real-life story that reads like a leftist morality play: wealthy executiv=
es make off with millions while ordinary workers lose their jobs and their =
life savings. After all that effort to convince people that the private sec=
tor can police itself, the most admired company in America turns out to hav=
e been a giant Ponzi scheme -- and the most respected accounting firm turns=
 out to have been an accomplice.=20
You might think that the shock of the Enron scandal -- and it is shocking, =
even to us hardened cynics -- would make some conservatives reconsider thei=
r beliefs. But the die-hards prefer to sling muck at liberals, hoping it wi=
ll stick.=20
Sorry, guys; I'm clean. The muck stops here.

Enron Fraud: Appoint a Special Prosecutor

Re Enron: Let's get this straight. Fraud is fraud.=20
Enron executives have conspired with their auditors to cook the books to wi=
ldly inflate profits and stock prices, failed to report illegal transaction=
s, broken multiple rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and then=
 instituted a cover-up by a massive destruction of files and evidence. The =
result has been literally billions of dollars of losses to investors and th=
e virtual destruction of employee 401(k)s, while they manipulated their per=
sonal stock options and walked away with millions in illegal profits.
Our attorney general, the overly pious John Ashcroft, has excused himself f=
or conflicts of interest, as has the entire federal prosecutor's office in =
Houston. The administration is staffed by multiple "graduates" of Enron and=
 is tainted by massive campaign contributions, as are large numbers of repr=
esentatives and senators of both parties. Isn't it time for a special prose=
cutor?=20

Regarding all the calls I see for a special prosecutor in the Enron case, w=
ith its ties to the Bush administration, I can only say this: a special pro=
secutor for what?=20
Until someone can make some sort of illegal connection between the two ther=
e is nothing but guilt by association.=20
When a special prosecutor was assigned to the Whitewater matter, at least t=
here was evidence of a shady land deal and inappropriate pressure being put=
 on people by then-Gov. Clinton to make improper loans, for example.=20
No linkage of this sort has been made between Enron and President Bush.=20
And until a linkage is made, all these shouts and murmurs for a prosecutor =
are nothing but shameless partisanship.=20

I came away from "Why Insiders Get Rich and the Little Guy Pays" (Opinion, =

 be wise for us "littles" to examine our own culpability in the sticking.=
=20
Union membership is at historical lows; we allow our representatives to gre=
en-light monopolistic mergers, and we continue to elect politicians who ign=
ore or undermine real campaign finance reform.=20
Until we start protecting ourselves from corporate avarice, we will continu=
e to be perfect "little" victims.=20

I fail to understand why President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are =

Business Spin; It's just like political spin, only not quite as dishonest.

How could the chairman of Enron have been telling his employees that they s=
hould buy the company's stock at the same time he was selling it? How could=
 Ken Lay have been saying that the company was in great shape when he had a=
 report from one of his vice presidents saying it most definitely wasn't?=
=20
Well, it might have been an innocent mistake. You don't need to believe eve=
ry report that crosses your desk. If some of your own actions had slipped y=
our mind, you might find them as hard to believe as anyone else would. And =
you might be selling your stock for reasons other than concern that it migh=
t be about to tank.
So now that we've gotten the presumption of innocence out of the way, let's=
 consider two other possibilities. One is that he was lying. The other is t=
hat he was spinning. What's the difference? It's often said that there is n=
one. (Come to think of it, I've said this myself.) But there is: Lying mean=
s flouting the truth. Spinning means indifference to the truth. The culture=
 of spin is one in which the relation between what you're saying and what h=
appens to be true is a question that doesn't even arise. This doesn't make =
spin less objectionable. In fact, it's more objectionable precisely because=
 it's culturally ingrained. We all know that it's wrong to lie. The signals=
 we send and receive about spin are very different.=20
The political equivalent of Ken Lay would be a politician who insisted he w=
as going to win the election even though all the polls showed him heading f=
or near-certain defeat. In the political world, though, spin is not merely =
tolerated: It is required. It is regarded as a basic test of competence.=20
Tim Russert: Senator, you're down by 40 points in every poll. Your opponent=
 is openly consulting real-estate agents in Washington. Your own dog called=
 a news conference yesterday to demand that you withdraw from the race. Are=
 you going to lose?=20
Politician: No, Tim, it'll be a tough fight -- make no mistake about that -=
- but I'm confident that . . . blah blah blah. And my cat is behind me 100 =
percent.=20
The purpose of such exchanges is not to elicit the truth, but to see how we=
ll the politician can spin. If he admits that he's probably going to lose, =
he flunks. If he survives the barrage with his preposterous optimism and po=
ker face unbroken, he wins.=20
But this example is entry-level spin. It shows a basic willingness to ignor=
e reality, but no special effort or talent in creating an alternative reali=
ty. The other difference between lying and spinning is that while lying is =
often spontaneous, spinning usually involves advanced planning. There are a=
 few naturally gifted improvisational spinners, such as the brilliant White=
 House spokesman, Ari Fleischer. Characteristically, though, spin does not =
wing it. Often spin production is an industrial process involving many peop=
le, maybe or maybe not including the person who ultimately delivers it.=20
In recent years the Washington spin industry has invaded the corporate worl=
d, as professional spinmeisters who learned their craft from politicians (o=
r who actually used to be politicians) have come to realize that big compan=
ies are just as spinologically needy as politicians and have more money. Of=
 course, the corporate world is where PR and advertising were invented -- t=
wo activities that also strain the relationship between assertion and truth=
. But in some ways spin, or at least untruthful spin, remains less acceptab=
le in the corporate world than in politics.=20
One reason for this is that in spinning a commercial product -- which goes =
by the polite name of "marketing" -- the mountain can come to Mohammed. Tha=
t is, you can design the product around the spin rather than design the spi=
n around the product. John Kenneth Galbraith argued 35 years ago in "The Ne=
w Industrial State" that corporations often create the demand for their pro=
ducts rather than satisfy hungers that already exist. Controversial at the =
time, this now seems obvious. And when marketing is paramount, the product =
itself is secondary. Oddly, this makes it easier for corporate spin to be t=
ruthful: You can decide what you want to say and build reality around it. B=
usinesspeople used to marketing sometimes trip up when they forget that rea=
lity is less malleable in non-marketing situations.=20
Spin is also illegal in many corporate circumstances where it would be lega=
l, acceptable and even expected in politics. If a corporate insider knows s=
omething important about the company's future, he or she not only may not s=
ay something that directly contradicts the truth -- in most circumstances t=
hey may not even spin by silence. Imagine if politicians were under that ki=
nd of legal requirement! And why aren't they? Well, obviously because money=
 is at stake with the business executive whereas nothing depends on the pol=
itician's truthfulness except democracy.=20
In the pervasive culture of spin, it's possible that Ken Lay was describing=
 a reality he wanted without even considering the relation of what he was s=
aying to reality as we actually experience it. If so, his mistake was forge=
tting that he's not a politician.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Excerpts From a House Hearing on Destruction of Enron Documents

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following are excerpts from remarks at a hearing yesterday before the House=
 Energy and Commerce Committee on the destruction of documents related to t=
he Enron Corporation, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a=
 private transcription service. The speakers included Representatives James=
 C. Greenwood, Peter Deutsch, Billy Tauzin and Diana DeGette; the Arthur An=
dersen officials C. E. Andrews, Dorsey L. Baskin and Nancy Temple; and Davi=
d B. Duncan, a former partner at Arthur Andersen.=20
REPRESENTATIVE GREENWOOD -- The chair will now call the first panel.=20
Mr. Duncan, will you please come forward? Please be seated right there. Tha=
nk you, sir.=20
Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
DAVID DUNCAN -- Morning.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Duncan is here with us today under subpoena. To date, =
Mr. Duncan has cooperated with this committee in our search for the facts b=
y submitting to an interview last week with our committee investigator that=
 lasted more than four hours.=20
Yet, we received a letter from his counsel yesterday stating that Mr. Dunca=
n authorized his counsel to advise the committee that he will, quote, ''rel=
y on his constitutional right not to testify,'' close quote.=20
I believe that this privilege should be personally exercised by, before the=
 members, and that's why we have requested Mr. Duncan's appearance here tod=
ay and request that he reconsider.=20
Mr. Duncan, you are aware that the committee is holding an investigative he=
aring and that, when doing so, we have the practice of taking testimony und=
er oath. Do you have objection to testifying under oath?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- No, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you.=20
The chair also advises you that, under the rules of the House and the rules=
 of the committee, you are entitled to be advised by counsel.=20
Do you desire to be advised by counsel during your testimony today?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. In that case, would you please rise and raise your ri=
ght hand, and I will swear you in.=20
Mr. Duncan, do you swear that you will tell -- the testimony you will give =
this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, I do.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you, Mr. Duncan. You are now under oath, and you may=
 give a five-minute summary of your written testimony if you choose to.=20
MR. DUNCAN -- I have no summary, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. The chair will recognize himself for questioning.=20
Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car=
, and they say you were at the wheel.=20
I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Andersen =
last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Andersen-Enron en=
gagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files =
relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities=
 and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions.=20
Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governm=
ental investigations into Enron's financial collapse? And if so, did you do=
 so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Andersen or at Enron?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's question=
s, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the que=
stion based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the Uni=
ted States.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me be clear, Mr. Duncan. Are you refusing to answer th=
e question on the basis of the protections afforded to you under the Fifth =
Amendment to the United States Constitution?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Again, on the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to=
 answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the United S=
tates Constitution.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to=
 all of our questions here today?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Respectfully, that will be my response to all your questions.=
=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- I'm disappointed to hear that, but it is therefore the cha=
ir's intention to dismiss the witness.=20
Mr. Duncan, we thank you for your attendance today and your respect for thi=
s committee's process. You are dismissed, and perhaps we will see you on an=
other occasion.=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir. . . .=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- I think it is very important to lay out for the subcommitt=
ee, our panel and our audience our current understanding of Mr. Duncan's re=
collection of relevant events based on the committee counsel's interview of=
 Mr. Duncan last week.=20
It is my understanding that Mr. Duncan said that, in the September and Octo=
ber time period, he participated in frequent meetings and teleconferences w=
ith a group of senior-level Andersen partners in Houston and Chicago to dis=
cuss matters relating to the Enron account.=20
That group included Ms. Nancy Temple from the legal group and Mr. Michael O=
dom, the audit practice director, both of whom are testifying today.=20
The consultation group, which was created in late August or early September=
, was fluid in membership and was formed in response to growing concerns ov=
er the accounting for Enron's special-purpose entities.=20
Specifically, Mr. Duncan said that the group was formed at the suggestion o=
f Mr. Odom and himself in response to, one, Sherron Watkins' allegations of=
 accounting improprieties on the Enron Raptor and LJM transactions; two, th=
e $1 billion accounting error discovered in August by Enron and Andersen wi=
th respect to the accounting for the Raptor entities; and, three, the rapid=
ly declining stock price of the Enron merchant assets transferred to the Ra=
ptor partnerships, which made it look like there would be a significant wri=
te-down by Enron.=20
During these conference calls prior to Oct. 12, 2001, Mr. Duncan recalls re=
ceiving advice from Ms. Temple with respect to the proper documentation of =
Andersen's evolving position with respect to the correct accounting for the=
 Raptor transactions.=20
Also, prior to receiving Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail regarding compliance w=
ith Andersen's documentation retention policy, Mr. Duncan recalls Ms. Templ=
e, on one or two of these three group conference calls, asking him, quote, =
''How are you on compliance with the document retention policy on Enron?'' =
He said that his response to her was, ''At best, irregular.''=20
Mr. Duncan then received Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail, forwarding from Mr. O=
dom with a note, quote, ''More help,'' close quote. He did not know what Mr=
. Odom meant by that phrase, but he viewed Ms. Temple's e-mail as a follow-=
up to the question she had posed to him orally about compliance with the re=
tention policy and as a device from his attorney to ensure that the entire =
Enron audit engagement team was in compliance with that policy.=20
He added that he had never before, during his lengthy tenure at Andersen, b=
een asked about compliance with the retention policy, nor had he ever recei=
ved such an e-mail about ensuring compliance with that policy from anyone i=
n Andersen's legal group.=20
Mr. Duncan does not recall the precise date, but sometime after Oct. 12, 20=
01, Mr. Duncan met with his top Enron audit partners, Mr. Tom Bauer, Ms. De=
bra Cash and Mr. Roger Willard, to discuss the advice he had received from =
Ms. Temple.=20
According to Mr. Duncan, the meeting participants concluded that they shoul=
d call a meeting of all the Enron audit managers to discuss timely complian=
ce with the retention policy.=20
Mr. Duncan does not recall when this meeting occurred but does not dispute =
that his secretary sent out an e-mail on Oct. 23, 2001, calling an urgent m=
eeting of the Enron managers for later that same day.=20
Just days earlier, on either Friday, Oct. 19, or Saturday, Oct. 20, Mr. Dun=
can had first learned of the S.E.C. informal inquiry of Enron. He recalled =
that he had discussions with the Andersen consultation group about the S.E.=
C. development over the weekend, including Ms. Temple.=20
He also recalled that on Oct. 22 he and other Andersen engagement team memb=
ers met with Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey to discuss the S.E.=
C. inquiry. Duncan said that Causey requested Andersen's assistance in crea=
ting documents to explain the related party transactions to the S.E.C.=20
Mr. Duncan said that at the meeting he called with all the Andersen audit m=
anagers on the Enron account, whenever it may have occurred, he advised the=
m of the importance of compliance with the document retention policy and ha=
nded out copies of the policy to participants.=20
Mr. Duncan said that he observed individuals on the engagement team activel=
y complying with the firm's document policies by shredding documents, and t=
hat the activity continued up until the 9th of November, when he received a=
 voice mail from Ms. Temple ordering the preservation of all Enron-related =
documents.=20
Mr. Duncan also said that he destroyed some of his own Enron-related docume=
nts in an effort to comply with Andersen's document retention and destructi=
on policies.=20
Again, that is my understanding of Mr. Duncan's interview with committee st=
aff.=20
Mr. Deutsch, would you agree that I have characterized our current understa=
nding of Mr. Duncan's recollection of relevant events accurately? . . .=20
MR. DEUTSCH -- I would.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you.=20
MR. BASKIN -- My name is Dorsey Lee Baskin Jr.=20
Since 1999, I have been managing director of Andersen's assurance professio=
nal standards group, which has firm-wide responsibility for providing guida=
nce on auditing standards, including professional standards relating to the=
 preservation of audit work papers and client files. I've been at Andersen =
for almost 25 years, since receiving my M.B.A. from Texas A&M University in=
 1977.=20
I'm here with my partner, C. E. Andrews, who is managing partner for Anders=
en's global audit practice. He and I will both answer the committee's quest=
ions.=20
I would like to make three essential points at the outset of our testimony.=
 First, as our C.E.O. has said, this is indeed a tragedy on many levels.=20
Second, the committee and the broader public should know that Andersen came=
 forward voluntarily and disclosed the destruction of documents by Andersen=
 personnel. However improper that destruction was, Andersen did not hide fr=
om its obligation to do what it could to take corrective action. We promptl=
y alerted all investigative authorities, including this committee.=20
Although the firm was well aware of the potentially devastating impact this=
 disclosure could have on our reputation, we did the right thing. We certai=
nly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud of our deci=
sion to step forward and accept responsibility.=20
Third, it bears emphasis that Andersen has cooperated fully and unreservedl=
y with all of the ongoing investigations into the destruction of Enron-rela=
ted documents. We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened.=20
We have publicly acknowledged, and will continue to acknowledge, mistakes t=
hat we have made. We have tried, and will continue to try, to answer every =
question that is put to us. And we will take whatever decisive action is ne=
cessary to restore public confidence in the firm.=20
I have to tell you, in all candor, that we are limited in what we can say t=
oday about the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel working on th=
e Enron engagement.=20
Our investigation into that destruction is far from complete. We have not y=
et had the opportunity to review all of the many relevant documents or to h=
ear from all of the people who have relevant information.=20
But having said that, this is what I can tell you about Andersen's retentio=
n and destruction of documents.=20
To begin with, it is the usual, routine and wholly legitimate practice of a=
uditors to preserve their final working papers while disposing of drafts, p=
ersonal notes and other materials that are not necessary to support the aud=
it report. So far as I'm aware, this is the policy of all the large account=
ing firms.=20
This policy toward document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit =
practice. It is designed to assure that the audit work papers, which are th=
e principal materials reflecting and documenting the conclusions of the aud=
it, unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached.=20
This understanding of proper audit practice was reflected in the Andersen d=
ocument retention policy in effect last fall, which provided that documents=
 other than work papers ordinarily should be disposed of when no longer nee=
ded but that such documents should be retained when litigation has commence=
d or is threatened.=20
Of course, precisely when that occurs, often we'll require the application =
of informed judgment to the particular circumstances of a given case. And t=
hat may well be a point on which reasonable people can differ.=20
As for the destruction of Enron-related documents, we know that on Oct. 23,=
 just six days after the S.E.C. requested information from Enron, David Dun=
can, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, called an urgent meet=
ing of the Enron engagement team, at which he organized an expedited effort=
 to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents.=20
This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm=
 or, so far as we are aware, with legal counsel.=20
Over the course of the next several days, a very substantial volume of docu=
ments and e-mails were disposed of by the Enron engagement team. This activ=
ity appears to have stopped shortly after Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-=
mail to other secretaries on Nov. 9, the day after Andersen received a subp=
oena from the S.E.C. telling them, ''No more shredding.''=20
Once this activity came to light, Andersen's response was immediate. Anders=
en notified the Department of Justice, the S.E.C. and all relevant congress=
ional committees. At the same time, the firm suspended its records manageme=
nt policy and asked former Senator Danforth to conduct an immediate and com=
prehensive review.=20
On Jan. 15, approximately two weeks after our C.E.O. learned about the docu=
ment destruction, Andersen dismissed Mr. Duncan. The firm also placed three=
 other partners from the Enron engagement on administrative leave, pending =
completion of the investigation into their responsibility for these events.=
=20
The firm relieved four partners in its Houston office of their management r=
esponsibilities, and the firm indicated that it will take disciplinary acti=
on against any Andersen personnel who are found to have acted improperly.=
=20
I should address the question, why Andersen took the forceful action it did=
 regarding Mr. Duncan. In our view, Mr. Duncan's actions reflected a failur=
e of judgment that is simply unacceptable in a person who has major respons=
ibilities at our firm.=20
He was the lead engagement partner for a significant client, exercising ver=
y substantial responsibility within the firm. Yet our investigation indicat=
ed that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume=
 of documents just as the government investigation was beginning. This is t=
he kind of conduct that Andersen cannot tolerate.=20
When Andersen's C.E.O., Joe Berardino, testified before Congress almost six=
 weeks ago, he observed that all of us here today, and many others who are =
not here, have a responsibility to seek out and evaluate the facts and take=
 needed action.=20
We have tried to fulfill that responsibility. We uncovered the document des=
truction. Our firm's management brought it to the attention of the governme=
ntal authorities.=20
We already have started to implement decisive disciplinary and remedial act=
ion, and we're continuing our investigation resolved to take all steps that=
 are necessary to restore public confidence in the integrity of our firm. .=
 . .=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me turn it to Ms. Temple, and since I don't have any o=
ther members here right now, I'll continue with the questioning.=20
We have a memo from you, Ms. Temple, that's dated, I believe, Nov. 10. . . =
.=20
And that memo is very explicit and it's very clear that you took action on =
that date in the form of that memo to make it crystal clear that no one was=
 to destroy documents.=20
Can you explain to us why it took you until Nov. 10 to issue a statement wi=
th that clarity, when, a month ago, you knew that the question of retention=
 and destruction of documents was going to be critical to investigations an=
d to litigation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'll tell you the circumstances of sending=
 the Nov. 10 memo and the facts, as I understood them, in the previous time=
 period.=20
On Nov. 10, the memo we sent, it was drafted by our outside counsel, a law =
firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- When was that firm retained for this purpose?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not personally retain that law firm. I know I spoke to =
a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Is your testimony that you do not know when they were reta=
ined?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the exact date of the retention. I know I spok=
e to a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K., you may proceed.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- It is the legal group's practice and protocol, when Arthur An=
dersen receives a subpoena or a request for documents, to send a written no=
tification ----=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My recollection, the firm received a subpoena from the Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission at the end of the business day on Nov. 8. And =
a voice mail was distributed to the audit engagement team, notifying them o=
f that the following business day. And once this e-mail was drafted, it was=
 circulated to the engagement team.=20
Now, moving back in time frame to the previous period that you talked about=
, the firm does have a written policy that provides guidance. It is self-en=
forcing, and we trust our partners to exercise their good judgment and to c=
onsult with either the legal group or the practice directors as appropriate=
.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me interrupt you for a second. I asked Ms. Temple when=
 Davis Polk was retained for this purpose, and she indicated that she, her =
response was that she didn't know.=20
Mr. Baskin, Mr. Andrews, do you know when this firm was retained?=20
And I will remind you that I asked you last night to be prepared to answer =
that question this morning.=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Mr. Chairman, the firm was retained on Oct. 9 and commenced =
work with us on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. And what was the purpose for retaining that firm on O=
ct. 9?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Well, as if we -- just for a moment -- what was going on dur=
ing that particular period of time, around that Oct. 9 time ----=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Are they handling the potential litigation for the firm no=
w?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- But what they were, are they handling it now? Yes, they are.=
=20
What was going on at that particular time was that we were involved, the co=
mpany was closing its third quarter. They were about to reach conclusions o=
n the third quarter. There were a lot of financial reporting issues occurri=
ng during that period that were obviously unusual and were concerning. So w=
e engaged them to help us with the financial reporting issues and with poss=
ible litigation.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Baskin or Mr. Andrews, or even Ms. Temple, you may wan=
t to answer this question.=20
The document in Tab 29 in your binder is a copy of an Enron announcement to=
 its employees and others on the Enron worldwide e-mail list, which I belie=
ve includes Andersen, on Oct. 25, 2001, telling them to preserve records re=
lating to the related party transactions including the accounting of those =
transactions.=20
Did Andersen learn about this action by Enron, which by the way also seems =
rather late given that it is eight days after Enron learned of the S.E.C. i=
nquiry? And if so, why didn't Andersen act right then to order its employee=
s to do the same?=20
MR. BASKIN -- Well, as it pertains to --this is the first time I've read th=
is memo -- but as it pertains to our actions, again, we believe that it was=
 the engagement partners' responsibility in this situation, given what was =
occurring in that late-October period, which is the date of this memo, that=
 there was enough information available that, in that partner's judgment, t=
he instruction and oversight of that partner would in fact cause us not to =
destroy documents. And certainly, you would not convene a meeting and give =
instructions, if you will -- apparently that's what happened -- to destroy =
documents.=20
So we would agree that during this period it would be appropriate to, at a =
minimum, seek counsel before doing such an exercise.=20
And destruction of documents in that period is wrong, and we have admitted =
that. It is wrong. And once we learned of that in our investigation, we too=
k firm actions. That is not Andersen, that is not what we encourage our emp=
loyees to do, and it is inappropriate. . . .=20
REPRESENTATIVE TAUZIN -- The gentleman's time has expired. The chair recogn=
izes himself for a round of questions.=20
First of all, I want to turn to the week of Oct. 9. Now, you've testified O=
ct. 9 was the date that Arthur Andersen hired counsel, outside counsel, rig=
ht? And the outside counsel firm was Davis Polk & Wardwell of New York, rig=
ht? Is that correct, sir? Mr. Andrews?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, that's correct.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- My understanding is that's a litigation team, right?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Davis Polk is a reputable firm. I'm sure they do litigation =
in other things, but we hired them for purposes to help us with the financi=
al reporting and possible litigation.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- And possible litigation, right?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, sir.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- This Oct. 9 -- I want to turn to you, Ms. Temple, real quickl=
y. Sometime before the week of Oct. 12, in your interviews with us, you inf=
ormed us that there was a conference call about the Enron engagement team's=
 compliance with the document retention policy.=20
Mr. Duncan says that it was you who raised the question about the retention=
 policy. You had some other recollections of that conversation.=20
Give us your recollections of what happened in that conference call. And wh=
at date was that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Sure. Let me give you the context of my role in this matter.=
=20
I was asked, beginning on Sept. 28, 2001, to participate in a conference ca=
ll. I understood that the firm was addressing one accounting issue that had=
 arisen at that point in time.=20
And between that time and Oct. 12, I provided legal advice, including, afte=
r consultation with my supervisor and others, about specific documentation =
and retention issues.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, in that conversation, though, that occurred right=
 about the time that the firm was hiring other litigation counsel -- you're=
 the litigation attorney for the firm, isn't that correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My background is in litigation, yes.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But they just hired an outside litigation firm to advise them=
 on possible litigation. About the same time, there's a conference call and=
 there's a discussion about the retention policy. And obviously, the memo i=
s sent out following it regarding that policy that includes information abo=
ut destruction of documents as well.=20
You said something to our investigators about conversations in that confere=
nce call, referencing changing memos and deleting information from past mem=
os, substituting a memo to the file for an old memo with a new memo. Is tha=
t accurate? Was that discussion held in that conference call?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The advice I gave was different from that, Mr. Chairman. The =
advice I gave was ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What were the questions being asked that you had to give advi=
ce?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The team was discussing a draft of a memo about a particular =
accounting issue on asset impairment. The advice that my supervisor and I g=
ave initially was that that memo, which was being currently drafted, needed=
 to be dated currently ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But what did they want to do that you told them they couldn't=
 do? What did they ask you to do?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall with respect to that particular legal advice t=
hat there was a question raised, but we pointed out to the team ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there not a request or discussion of substituting a new m=
emo for an old memo and, in effect, backdating a memo to the file?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, there was not a question about backdating that particular=
 memo, but the date ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there a question about substituting it and deleting infor=
mation from the memo?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There was a question in that current memo that was raised, ca=
n we delete a sentence, acknowledging that the firm had given incorrect acc=
ounting advice in the first quarter of 2001 ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is ----=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and I said absolutely not.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is, essentially, you said don't do that.=
=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Right.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Is it customary that in those kind of discussions, when the f=
irm finds itself in error, that anyone would suggest substituting memos or =
deleting information that was in memos already in the file? Was that unusua=
l conversation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I expect the engagement partners to raise questions about doc=
umentation and seek advice, which they were doing.=20
The other legal advice that I gave on documentation was, the memos for any =
prior periods, first quarter of 2001, year-end 2000, could not be changed o=
r deleted.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You're telling them no changes. I understand that. I'm asking=
 you, was it customary? Was this unusual for members of the firm to be talk=
ing to you about changing documents, altering documents, substituting docum=
ents that were on file already regards to Enron operations?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- At the time, based on my recollection, I understood that ther=
e were good-faith questions that were being asked about how to properly doc=
ument the firm's ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was it a good-faith question to change a memo that's already =
in the file with a new memo?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I received the question and consulted with my supervisor and =
others -- --=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You said, don't do it.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and gave the advice. And to the best of my knowledge, th=
e advice was followed.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Were you shocked that they would raise such a question? Were =
you alarmed? Were you disturbed? Did it bother you, as litigation counsel f=
or the firm, that any member would even suggest altering the record, alteri=
ng documents, substituting memos to the file?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall everything going on in my mind. I recall makin=
g sure, giving advice to make sure that the written record was complete and=
 accurate and truthful. And I do recall seeing that my advice was followed.=
=20
MR. TAUZIN -- And my time is up, but you do recall also that Oct. 16 memo, =
that you did discuss with them changing that memo so that your name was not=
 included because you might be a potential witness. Is that correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I do recall giving legal advice after consultation with other=
s, including outside legal counsel, Davis Polk, that the audit partners sho=
uld document the recommendations and communications he had with the client =
about the client's, Enron's, draft press release.=20
And I did, after consulting with outside legal counsel, and it's our standa=
rd practice in the legal group to advise the engagement team not to write d=
own and discuss in their memos legal advice that the legal group might give=
, because it might be a waiver down the road of attorney-client privilege.=
=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady.=20
The chair recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. DeGette, for a round of questions.=
=20
REPRESENTATIVE DEGETTE -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. . . .=20
If you can tell me very briefly, under what circumstances you believe docum=
ents should be retained? When is it, what is the trigger under which docume=
nts need to be retained?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There are several provisions in the policy that address reten=
tion.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And, in fact, there's an exhibit to document No. 27 here, Ex=
hibit 1, that says examples of situations to be reported, and that's a list=
 of examples of situations where, if you see that coming, then you treat th=
at as threatened legal action under Section 2.5 of the litigation procedure=
s and you retain them. Is that right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, there is a list of examples to be reported to the legal =
group that calls for notification. I don't believe ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And that would trigger, then, a notification such as the one=
 that you made, I think, on Oct. 12 in your e-mail, right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My understanding ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- I mean, it's not just threatened litigation, is it? There's =
other things that would trigger Arthur Andersen to recommend retention of d=
ocuments.=20
MS. TEMPLE --The policy does require retention of all related material if t=
here's threatened litigation.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Or other situations, right? And one of those situations woul=
d be oral indications from management or owners that the firm was somehow r=
esponsible for the failure of operations or the failure to detect fraud, ri=
ght? That's the third one on the list of examples of situations to be repor=
ted, right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Right. And this list of examples is from the policy statement=
 No. 780, which ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Right.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- requires notification to the legal group of those exampl=
es.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- -- O.K. So now, there was a memo that was written on Aug. 15=
, 2001, from Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, alleging improper ac=
counting and all kinds of other problems. Was the legal department aware of=
 that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall if I was aware of that particular document. I =
was aware of circumstances about allegations by an employee of Enron, and t=
he fact that Vinson & Elkins had conducted an investigation and concluded a=
nd reported positively to the board the week of Oct. 8.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- So you were aware that in August an employee had made these =
allegations, and then Vinson & Elkins had done an investigation also in Aug=
ust. Is that right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Not exactly.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- No?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Before Oct. 12 I was aware that Vinson & Elkins had been enga=
ged and completed and reported orally to the board that the results of thei=
r investigation were positive.=20
And the engagement team also assured the practice directors who were being =
consulted at that time and myself that they had reviewed the information ab=
out the allegations, and that the allegations were, to the extent that they=
 had any information in them in reference to transactions, involved transac=
tions that the audit team had carefully reviewed in its prior work.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K. So you thought that, because Vinson & Elkins had said t=
here's no problem, that that did not trigger any kind of requirement. Is th=
at correct? Yes or no, please.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that's not ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, thank you.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- what I was thinking at the time.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Now, what caused you to send that memo on Oct. 12? Did you d=
o that on a regular basis?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There were several factors that caused me to send the memo on=
 Oct. 12.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, let me back up for a minute. How many times in your two=
 years, roughly, at Andersen did you send memos like this, reminding people=
 of the document retention and destruction policy?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times. I have referred ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Had you done it before?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I believe I had referred people to the firm's policies on doc=
ument retention and destruction, as well as ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- How many times before?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- One time? Five times? Ten times?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- To the best of my recollection, at least one other occasion, =
and I ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And was that in relation to Enron, or was that in relation t=
o another client?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that was not in relation to Enron. . . .=20
MR. TAUZIN -- I just want to clarify your testimony to the gentlelady's que=
stions. You indicated that Vinson & Elkins issued a positive report. I want=
 a quote from that report.=20
''There is a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation. It also appe=
ars, because of the inquiries and issues raised by Ms. Watkins, Arthur Ande=
rsen will want additional assurances that Enron had no agreement with LJM t=
hat LJM would not lose money,'' et cetera.=20
Is that a positive report?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- As I recall, the outcome of the report, as reported to me, th=
e ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You have a copy of this, I believe we've submitted, you have =
a copy of this letter, don't you, from Vinson & Elkins? You saw it yourself=
, didn't you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- After the week of Oct. 12, I did receive a copy ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But here's the point, Ms. Temple. I mean, we're trying to get=
 the facts here. But if you will characterize a report that indicates a dec=
line in the value of Enron's stock and the serious risk of adverse publicit=
y and litigation as a positive report from the attorneys, we're going to ha=
ve trouble with your testimony today.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Later on, when I did receive a copy of the report and sent a =
copy to outside counsel, I did note the comments that you referenced. But I=
 also noted that the law firm reported that there was nothing further to fo=
llow up on at that point in time.=20
And the law firm was representing Enron Corporation, not Arthur Andersen. A=
nd I understood and recall at the time thinking that there might be a chall=
enge to the business judgment decisions of Enron to enter into certain tran=
sactions.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Did you know at the time that Vinson & Elkins had signed off =
on these agreements as a counsel for the firm? There may have been a confli=
ct of interest in them commenting on them now?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the circumstances ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You're not aware of that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall at this time.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Do you recall a conversation with Mr. Duncan in which he ass=
ured you he was gathering the documents to preserve them? Do you recall spe=
cifically having that conversation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- According to your notes?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- his specific words, but I do recall that we had a group =
conference call on Oct. 23. And I have these notes from that call.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And the notes don't say anything about preservation, do they=
?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes. . . .=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes do not have the word ''preservation'' in them.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And on Oct. 12, you had just sent a memo to Mr. Duncan and h=
is group, advising them of the Arthur Andersen document retention and destr=
uction policy, which involved destroying of all of the notes and backup doc=
uments and so on. Correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No. Actually, I sent a reference to the policy to the practic=
e director in Houston.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- So you never sent that to Mr. Duncan?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not send it personally to Mr. Duncan.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Mr. Odom had that, correct? Mr. Odom, did you have that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, I sent it to the Houston practice director, based on sev=
eral factors ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Just cutting through, in this Oct. 23 phone call, you don't =
recall specifically -- and your notes do not reflect -- you telling Mr. Dun=
can to retain records, do they? Yes or no.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't see that in my ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no, ma'am?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, it's not. . . .=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Thank you. I yield back.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, if you received this e-mail from Mr. Duncan indic=
ating he was collecting all these documents, and assumed that he was preser=
ving them, why did you feel it necessary on November the 9th to leave a voi=
ce mail with Mr. Duncan, directing him to preserve those documents because =
of the receipt of the S.E.C. subpoena? If he was preserving them already, w=
hy on earth did you feel it necessary to advise him to preserve them on Nov=
. 9?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- It is our firm's practice to notify the engagement team when =
the legal group receives a subpoena. I believe it had been received in the =
general counsel's office, and I promptly notified the engagement partner an=
d reminded about the need to, at this point in time, we'll have to collect =
the documents for production.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Well -- but you understand why common sense gets a little los=
t here. If you're in a position where you know that the retention policy al=
so means destruction -- you know that, didn't you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There are aspects of instruction guidelines ----=20
MR. TAUZIN: -- Yes.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- in that policy. Yes.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- So you know that the retention policy, as long as it's operat=
ing, permits Mr. Duncan and however many people he has working for him to d=
estroy documents.=20
You hear, you get a memo from him saying, ''I'm gathering them all up.'' An=
d you tell us today that you assumed that meant he was gathering up to pres=
erve them for litigation, not to destroy them.=20
Why would you even bother to say, ''By the way,'' on Nov. 9, ''quit destroy=
ing documents. We've just got an S.E.C. subpoena?'' Why would you do that?=
=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The legal group notifies the engagement partner and engagemen=
t team when subpoenas are served. It was received by the legal group, and I=
 felt it was appropriate to follow the firm protocol to notify the engageme=
nt partner.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Yes. But, you see, we also have your memo on November the 10t=
h, and I'm going to read you from it. It says, ''One of the first things we=
 must do in preparing to respond to these subpoenas and lawsuits is to take=
 all necessary steps to preserve all of the documents and other materials t=
hat we may have relating to claims that are being filed.''=20
Now, if that was already being done, if you had received a notice from Mr. =
Duncan that he's gathering them all up to preserve them, if that was your c=
onclusion, why would you say, ''the first thing we have to do now, now that=
 the subpoena has arrived is start preserving these things?''=20
You see, common sense, Ms. Temple, common sense tells me that destruction w=
as going on up until this time when the subpoena arrived and that until you=
 said, ''preserve them'' they may well have been gathered up for destructio=
n, and that somebody should have known that. And was that somebody you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents. =
And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we could have =
consulted and addressed the situation.
