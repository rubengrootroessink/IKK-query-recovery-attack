Becky said they are going up in Jan.  She could probably find out the cost.
The other big issue is the bulk head starts for 10 and unders at Klein Oak.
I know that concerns some of my team's board members and Kleinwood's.  They
would rather be able to start all the races from the starting blocks at one
end of the pool.  We can do that at Klein but not at Klein Oak.

It seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein
Oak or Klein..  I guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone
up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air.  Who
knows the prices?
