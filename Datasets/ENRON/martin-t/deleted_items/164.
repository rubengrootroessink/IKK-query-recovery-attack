> scammed!  MAJOR SCAM:
> Don't respond  to Emails, phone calls, or web pages which tell you to
call
> an  "809" Phone Number. This is a very important issue of ScamBusters
>  because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading *extremely*  quickly
and
> can easily cost you $24,100.00 or more, and is  difficult to avoid
unless
> you are aware of it. We'd like to thank  Verizon for bringing this scam
to
> our attention.  This scam  has also been identified by the National
Fraud
> Information Center  and is costing victims a lot of money. There are
lots
> of different  permutations of this scam.
> HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
> You will  receive a message on your answering machine or your pager,
which
>  asks you to call a number beginning with area code 809. The  reason
you're
> asked to call varies. It can be to receive  information about a family
> member who has been ill, to tell you  someone has been arrested, died,
to
> let you know you have won a  wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you
are
> told to call the 809  number right away. Since there are so many new
area
> codes these  days, people unknowingly return these calls. If you call
from
> the  US, you will apparently be charged $2425 per-minute. Or, you'll
get
> long recorded message. The point is, they will try to keep you on  the
> phone as long as possible to increase the charges. Unfortunately,  when
you
> get your phone bill, you'll often be charged more than  $24100.00.
> WHY IT WORKS:
> The 809 area code is located in the  British Virgin Islands (The
Bahamas).
> The 809 area code can be used  as a "pay-per-call" number, similar to
900
> numbers in the US. Since  809 is not in the US, it is not covered by
U.S.
> regulations of 900  numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned
> of charges  and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call" number.
There
> is  also no requirement that the company provide a time period  during
which
> you may terminate the call without being charged.  Further, whereas
many
> U.S.  homes that have 900 number  blocking to avoid these kinds of
charges,
> do not work in preventing  calls to the 809 area code. We recommend
that no
> matter how you get  The message, if you are asked to call a number with
an
> 809 area  code that you don't recognize just disregard the message. Be
wary
>  of email or calls asking you to call an 809 area code number. It's
>  important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying  to
fight
> the charges afterwards can become A real nightmare. That's  because you
did
> actually make the call. If you complain, both your  local phone company
and
> your long distance carrier will not want to  get involved and will most
> likely tell you that they are simply  providing the billing for the
foreign
> company. You'll end up  dealing with a foreign company that> argues
they
> have done  nothing wrong.
