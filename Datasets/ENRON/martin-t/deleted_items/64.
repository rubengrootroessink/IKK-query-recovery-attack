NEW YORK, Jan. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Last fall, Commerce Secretary Donald Evan=
s, who was halfway around the world in Moscow on a trade mission, reached o=
ut to Enron CEO Kenneth Lay in Houston to discuss with him Enron's disastro=
usly controversial, financially-draining electricity plant in India. Specif=
ically, Evans suggested that Lay consult with Sig Rogich, a veteran Republi=
can PR man (and another friend of the Bush family), who was on his way to N=
ew Delhi to pitch his services to the government. Perhaps Rogich could soot=
he the locals, who had been loudly accusing Enron of price-gouging, report =
Chief Political Correspondent Howard Fineman and Investigative Corresponden=
t Michael Isikoff. While such calls are typical, what makes this one notewo=
rthy is the date on which it took place, October 15. On that day, Lay knew =
that his world was about to fall apart.
(Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020113/NYSU004 )=20
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts the next day, Lay would have=
 to disclose that Enron, the largest energy trading company in the world, h=
ad lost an astounding $618 million in the third quarter. More important, he=
 would be forced to admit that Enron had lost $1.2 billion in a labyrinth o=
f partnerships that hadn't been -- but should have been -- counted on the c=
ompany's books. The company was near collapse. In the January 21 issue of N=
ewsweek (on newsstands Monday, January 14). Fineman and Isikoff write that =
while Evans was an old friend in the Texas energy business, he and Lay say =
they did not discuss the impending crisis.=20
The company, which imploded last December 2, produced the largest bankruptc=
y in American history and now the shockwaves have moved from Enron headquar=
ters in Houston and Wall Street to Washington. The Lay-Evans call, it turns=
 out, was the prelude to a flurry of others (all initiated by Lay) in which=
 the Enron chief executive emitted increasingly urgent distress signals to =
Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Gr=
eenspan. But Lay apparently got no help, Fineman and Isikoff write. White H=
ouse officials insist that he never contacted them and they never contacted=
 him, even though he was running (into the ground) the seventh largest corp=
oration in the country and the second largest in Texas. They flatly deny th=
at President George W. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney (or any aides) ha=
d direct knowledge of Enron's predicament. No evidence surfaced last week t=
o contradict their story and the Bushies point out with relief that someone=
 else had called O'Neill on Enron's behalf: Robert Rubin, the highly-regard=
ed (Democratic) Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton and now a leader of C=
itigroup, one of Enron's largest creditors. And though Lay and Enron papere=
d the Congress with campaign donations to Republicans and Democrats alike, =
six committees were planning to investigate.=20
Lay built his business by getting regulatory relief from Congress - from Re=
publicans, to be sure, but from the Democrats as well. There were silent pa=
rtners in the myriad Enron off-the-books secret partnerships. They might in=
clude, inconveniently, a fair number of the Democrat's top donors. Numerous=
 officials in and around the White House have or had extensive financial ti=
es to Lay and Enron. They include political adviser Karl Rove, economic adv=
iser Larry Lindsay and GOP Chairman Marc Racicot, who last week declared th=
at he would cease lobbying work. Lay is also the biggest individual contrib=
utor to President Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaigns. In=
vestigators will also have numerous contacts to examine. On October 29, Lay=
 called Evans and discussed with him the impending lowering of Enron's cred=
it rating. Lay talked with O'Neill twice, and Enron's president Greg Whalle=
y, had several conversations with Under Secretary Peter R. Fisher. Lay's at=
torney, Robert Bennett, tells Newsweek that his client was merely "doing th=
e responsible thing" by informing officials of "the possibility of bankrupt=
cy" at Enron.=20
Enron, writes Wall Street Editor Allan Sloan, turned out to be another bubb=
le. However, unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, whose implosions did little dam=
age outside of costing dice-rolling speculators some money and techies some=
 jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grenade: stockholders and lenders a=
re out tens of billions of dollars; at least 20,000 Enron employees have lo=
st their jobs and many of them have lost their retirement savings too. And =
the collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthu=
r Anderson, Enron's outside auditor, which admitted last week that some emp=
loyees destroyed documents, has been tarnished to the point that the Big Fi=
ve accounting firms might shrink to the Big Four. Wall Street's credibility=
 has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, for which Enron was the poster=
 boy, is now on the back burner. The spectacle of impoverished, unemployed =
Enronites has thrown a harsh spotlight on the risks of 401(k) accounts stuf=
fed with company stock. And confidence in financial markets has been shaken=
 too.=20
Sloan reports that Enron's end is emblematic of a wholesale systemic failur=
e. The multi-layered system of checks and balances that is supposed to keep=
 a company from running amok completely broke down. Executives of public co=
mpanies have legal and moral requirements to produce honest books and recor=
ds, but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors are supposed to mak=
e sure that a company's financial reports not only meet the letter of accou=
nting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair and accurate picture=
 of what's going on, but Enron's auditor, Arthur Anderson, failed that test=
. Regulators didn't regulate and Enron's board of directors didn't direct. =
In reconstructing Enron's fall, Sloan, who first reported on Enron's demise=
 in the December 10, 2001 issue of Newsweek and again on December 17, 2001,=
 identifies the "too-clever-by-half" financial structures that Enron plante=
d that led to its undoing and how and why those off-the-books partnerships =
worked for so long without detection.=20
(Articles attached. Read Newsweek's news releases at=20
http://www.Newsweek.MSNBC.com. Click "Pressroom.") To George W. Bush, the h=
ead of Enron was 'Kenny Boy' - until now. As the shock waves from the large=
st bankruptcy in U.S. history shake Washington, the scandal machine is cran=
king up in search of a White House connection. Let the Enron Wars begin.=20
Lights Out: Enron's Failed Power Play=20

Commerce Secretary Donald Evans was busy, halfway around the world in Mosco=
w, but not too busy to reach out to Ken Lay in Houston last fall. "Kenny Bo=
y," as President George W. Bush had nicknamed him, was not just any CEO. He=
 was the Big Enchilada of Texas business, head of Enron, the largest energy=
-trading company in the world -- and the biggest sugar daddy in Bush's poli=
tical career. So although Evans was conducting a trade mission to Russia (t=
he first trip abroad by a cabinet member after September 11), he took time =
to call Lay to discuss Enron's money-losing power plant in India. Specifica=
lly, Evans suggested that Lay consult with Sig Rogich, a veteran Republican=
 PR man (and another Bush family friend), who was on his way to New Delhi t=
o pitch his services to the government. Perhaps Rogich could soothe the loc=
als, who had been loudly accusing Enron of price gouging.=20
Ever since there have been Commerce secretaries (nearly a century), they've=
 made such phone calls: strands in a global web of American dealmaking. But=
 what makes this one noteworthy -- and worthy of suspicion to Bush's enemie=
s -- is the date on which it took place, Oct. 15, for Lay knew that his wor=
ld was about to fall apart. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts =
the next day, he would have to disclose that Enron had lost an astounding $=
618 million in the third quarter. More important, it would soon become clea=
r that Enron had lost $1.2 billion in a labyrinth of partnerships that prob=
ably should have been -- but weren't -- counted on the company's books. Enr=
on, one of the most innovative and admired companies in the world, was near=
 collapse. Didn't Lay and Evans, an old friend in the Texas energy bidness,=
 discuss the impending crisis? They both say no. But investigators -- at le=
ast on Capitol Hill -- will want to ask, preferably in a hearing on TV.=20
As Enron's beleaguered employees and investors know all too well, the compa=
ny imploded last Dec. 2, producing the largest bankruptcy in American histo=
ry. But now the shock waves have moved from Houston and Wall Street to Wash=
ington, rattling a White House that had been focused on the popular enterpr=
ise of fighting the war on terrorism. The Lay-Evans call, it turns out, was=
 the prelude to a flurry of others (all initiated by Lay) in which the Enro=
n chief executive emitted increasingly urgent distress signals -- and barel=
y disguised pleas for help -- to Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and=
 Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.=20
Despite his munificence as a contributor -- perhaps, ironically, because of=
 it -- Lay apparently got no help. White House officials insist that he nev=
er contacted them, and they never contacted him, though he was running (int=
o the ground) the seventh largest corporation in the country and the second=
 largest (after Exxon-Mobil) in Texas. They flatly deny that Bush or Vice P=
resident Dick Cheney (or any aides) had had direct knowledge of Enron's pre=
dicament. No evidence surfaced last week to contradict their story and, as =
they say in the law, the thing speaks for itself: Enron did collapse. Bushi=
es pointed out with relief that someone else had called O'Neill on Enron's =
behalf: Robert Rubin, respected Treasury chief under Bill Clinton and now a=
 leader of Citigroup, one of Enron's largest creditors. Lay, who, with Enro=
n, gave $500,000 to Bush in 2000, had become a mere acquaintance. At a pres=
s "avail," Bush referred to him stiffly as "Mr. Lay." Over at Commerce, a t=
op aide laughingly called him "Ken Who?"=20
Still, the collapse of Enron was no laughing matter. In Houston there was g=
rowing and justifiable outrage. Earlier in 2001, Enron's brass had feverish=
ly unloaded company stock. But at the very time Lay was sounding his alarms=
, the rank and file were barred from touching their modest, but Enron-heavy=
, 401(k) portfolios. Inside the Beltway, the scandal-making machinery -- id=
led since stripping a gear on the Gary Condit saga last year -- sputtered t=
o life. Though Lay and Enron had papered Congress with donations to Republi=
cans and Democrats alike, six committees were planning to investigate. (The=
 first hearing, later this month, will be led in the Senate by presidential=
 hopeful Joe Lieberman, who got a paltry $2,000.)=20
The Democrats were aware of the risks. Bush remains genuinely popular. Lay =
built his business by getting regulatory relief from Congress -- from Repub=
licans, to be sure, but from the Democrats as well. There were silent partn=
ers in the myriad Enron off-the-books secret partnerships. They might inclu=
de, inconveniently, a fair number of the Democrats' top donors. The public,=
 the handlers know, is likely to be disgusted by another partisan auto-da-f=
e.=20
Even so, the Dems couldn't resist plunging in. Average workers had been scr=
ewed. Wasn't there something the administration should have done to prevent=
 it? The Enron issue seemed aimed straight at the GOP's -- and Bush's -- ch=
ief vulnerability: their profile as the party of Texas-based Big Energy and=
 the moneyed class in general. And, arithmetic favored the Democrats: Enron=
/Lay had given nearly three quarters of its largesse to Republicans over th=
e years. "We don't have to say much," said one top Democratic strategist. "=
This story will carry itself for quite a while."=20
At the White House, aides projected an attitude of studied calm. Bush's fir=
st mention of the Enron inferno was after Nov. 30, according to counselor K=
aren Hughes, when he allowed that the seeming callousness toward company em=
ployees "really stinks." Aides claimed that neither Bush nor Cheney knew of=
 Lay's distress calls until Evans and O'Neill mentioned them to the preside=
nt last Thursday morning. "I know you think it strains credulity, but it's =
the truth," said White House aide Mary Matalin. "Every tentacle of this lea=
ds away from the White House."=20
That will be for investigators -- not spin doctors -- to decide. Numerous o=
fficials in and around the White House have or had extensive financial ties=
 to Lay and Enron. They include political adviser Karl Rove, economic advis=
er Larry Lindsey and GOP Chairman Marc Racicot, who last week declared that=
 he would stop all lobbying work. Investigators will have numerous contacts=
 to examine. Lay called Evans last Oct. 29 and discussed the impending drop=
 in Enron's credit rating with him. Lay talked with O'Neill twice, and Enro=
n's president, Greg Whalley, had several chats with Under Secretary Peter R=
. Fisher. Enron's attorney, Robert Bennett, told Newsweek his client was me=
rely "doing the responsible thing" by informing officials of "the possibili=
ty of bankruptcy" at Enron.=20
As Bennett knows (he represented Bill Clinton), a Washington scandal is hal=
f circus, half court of law. The powerful presence in the latter is the Jus=
tice Department where, as usual, there were Enron ties to untangle. Last we=
ek the department made the rare decision to run its probe from Washington h=
eadquarters. Why? Because the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston had too man=
y personal ties to Enron employees. Attorney General John Ashcroft had to r=
ecuse himself, having taken $58,000 in Enron-related cash for his own faile=
d 2000 presidential campaign. That left the probe to Deputy A.G. Larry Thom=
pson, formerly a partner in an Atlanta law firm that has done extensive wor=
k for -- you guessed it -- Enron. (Since he didn't personally represent the=
 company, officials said, he didn't need to bow out.)=20
The pivotal question is not likely to be about administration actions in th=
e first instance, but its candor about them now. Bush's aides say they have=
 nothing to hide. But they and their boss strained nevertheless to distance=
 themselves from Lay. Just last spring he met privately with Cheney to disc=
uss energy policy and influenced nominations to the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry Commission.=20
Now, in the White House telling, he was some guy they hardly knew until 199=
5. In the Texas gubernatorial race of 1994, the president told the press, L=
ay "was a supporter" of his Democratic foe, Ann Richards. True, but only in=
 the Clintonian sense. In fact, Lay supported Bush the First in 1988 and 19=
92, organized the GOP Houston convention for him and raised money for the B=
ush library. Lay gave money to Richards in 1994, but he and Enron gave much=
 more to Bush: $146,000. Much of that money came in after Election Day, a B=
ush ally recalled contemptuously. So "Ken Who" was never really a friend of=
 George's -- and certainly isn't considered one now.=20
With Tamara Lipper in Washington=20
It's the scariest type of scandal: a total system failure. Executives, lend=
ers, auditors and regulators all managed to look the other way while the co=
mpany ran amok.=20
Who Killed Enron=20

Enron was supposed to be the next new thing, a New Economy company with sub=
stance to it. Unlike flaky Internet start-ups that substituted ethereal yar=
dsticks like "eyeballs" and "stickiness" for revenues and profits, Enron ha=
d real businesses, real assets, real revenues and what seemed to be real pr=
ofits. It owned natural-gas pipelines and electricity-generating plants and=
 water companies. Not only would it do well, it would improve the planet by=
 substituting the efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of gover=
nment regulation.=20
And it seemed to work. From humble beginnings as a natural-gas company, Enr=
on rose in a mere 15 years to No. 7 on the Fortune 500, doing $100 billion =
of business in 2000. Along the way, Enron became one of America's most admi=
red companies, and a perennial favorite on "best places to work" lists. The=
 guys running the show were hailed as magicians with newfound secrets that =
would change the future of business.=20
But Enron turned out to be another bubble. Unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, w=
hose implosions did little damage outside of costing dice-rolling speculato=
rs some money and techies some jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grena=
de. Today Enron is a smoking ruin, the biggest corporate bankruptcy in Amer=
ican history. A year ago the stock market valued Enron at more than $60 bil=
lion. Its stock has since lost 99 percent of its value -- and still seems o=
verpriced. Stockholders and lenders are out tens of billions of dollars. Ma=
ny of Enron's 20,000 employees lost their retirement savings when the compa=
ny collapsed. About 5,000 of them, from computer jocks in Houston to newspr=
int recyclers in New Jersey, lost their jobs, too. By contrast, chairman Ke=
n Lay made $205 million in stock-option profits in the past four years alon=
e, and other big hitters and board members made out, too. What's especially=
 galling is that a handful of executives and outsiders made millions by inv=
esting in off-balance-sheet deals with Enron that played a large role in de=
stroying the company.=20
The collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthu=
r Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, which admitted last week that some emp=
loyees destroyed documents. Andersen's reputation has been tarnished to the=
 point that the Big Five accounting firms might shrink to the Big Four. Wal=
l Street's credibility has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, for whic=
h Enron was the poster boy, is now on the back burner. The spectacle of imp=
overished, unemployed Enronites has thrown a harsh spotlight on the risks o=
f 401(k) accounts stuffed with company stock. Confidence in financial marke=
ts has been shaken -- and rightly so. With the action in Afghanistan slowin=
g down, Enron shock waves have finally reached Washington, raising the spec=
ter of another 'Gate. L'affaire Enron is becoming a classic Washington scan=
dal: criminal probes, investigations of destroyed documents, pols being ask=
ed what they knew about Enron and when they knew it. There's no sex, alas -=
- but there sure is lots of money.=20
Life would be simple if we could blame the whole thing on Enron chairman La=
y. Or on George W. Bush, who goes way back with Lay, among the biggest indi=
vidual contributors to Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaign=
s. But Enron isn't that simple. It's something far more scary: a wholesale =
systemic failure. The multilayered system of checks and balances that is su=
pposed to keep a company from running amok completely broke down. Executive=
s of public companies have legal and moral responsibilities to produce hone=
st books and records -- but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors=
 are supposed to make sure that a company's financial reports not only meet=
 the letter of accounting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair =
and accurate picture of what's going on -- but Arthur Andersen failed that =
test. To protect themselves, lenders are supposed to make sure borrowers ar=
e creditworthy -- but Enron's lenders were as clueless as everyone else. Wa=
ll Street analysts are supposed to dig through company numbers to divine wh=
at's really happening -- but almost none of them managed to do that. Regula=
tors didn't regulate. Enron's board of directors didn't direct.=20
Why did all these people look the other way for so long? Money talks. Or, w=
ith Enron, shouts. The company put lots of money in pockets of the people a=
nd institutions that were supposed to police it. Enron's incessant dealmaki=
ng generated huge fees for Wall Street investment banking houses. And guess=
 what? Wall Street loved Enron, with most analysts rating its stock and bon=
ds as the greatest thing since money was invented, at least until they fina=
lly heard Enron's death rattle. Even when it became clear last fall that En=
ron was engaging in creative bookkeeping, almost no analysts recommended se=
lling the stock, says Chuck Hill, who tracks analyst recommendations for Fi=
rst Call/Thompson Financial. "They should have thrown in the towel a lot ea=
rlier," he said. Enron paid huge fees -- $52 million in 2000 -- to Arthur A=
ndersen for auditing and consulting services. Andersen allowed it to get aw=
ay with accounting that was, at best, aggressive and, at worst, criminal. I=
f Andersen had stood on principle, Enron would doubtless have changed accou=
ntants. Enron famously made heavy political contributions. Pols got peanuts=
 compared with what Wall Street and Andersen got, but it was enough to help=
 Enron run roughshod over regulators at the national and state levels.=20
With so many dollar signs floating around and the company's stock soaring, =
no one was interested in bad news -- a problem that's hardly limited to Enr=
on. "A lot of people don't want to hear the straight truth," says Thomas Do=
naldson, a business-ethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wh=
arton School. "Investors don't want the CEO to say something negative that =
will drop the stock, even for the short term. There's a culture of puffery,=
 a culture of winking." The winking stopped last year when regulators and t=
he financial markets finally reined in Enron -- at least five years after i=
ts big-time financial shenanigans had begun.=20
Enron started out innocently enough, born of a mildly innovative 1985 deal =
to combine two boring businesses: an Omaha-based natural-gas-pipeline compa=
ny called InterNorth and a Texas pipeline company called Houston Natural Ga=
s. Ken Lay, a soft-spoken statesman kind of guy with a Ph.D. in economics, =
found a hyperaggressive financial whiz named Jeff Skilling working in McKin=
sey & Co.'s energy practice in Houston. They had a brilliant insight. Inste=
ad of just delivering gas to customers at a modest profit, Enron could use =
newly deregulated pipelines to match buyers and sellers. In other words, En=
ron became a gas trader, as well as a gas company. Because trading was much=
 more fun and much more lucrative than building pipes and drilling wells an=
d selling gas at regulated, low-profit prices, Enron morphed into a trading=
 company with a utility attached to it.=20
And make no mistake, these guys were deregulation's True Believers. At a di=
nner I had with Skilling in the late 1990s, he was like a religious zealot =
who couldn't stop repeating his favorite mantra as the solution to all the =
world's problems. There are rolling blackouts in the Midwest? Deregulate. S=
ome energy companies look like they're price gouging? Deregulate more. And =
if salad dressing had dripped onto my tie? ... You get the picture.=20
With Lay and Skilling in charge, Enron's revenues and profits climbed sharp=
ly. People from all over the country clamored to join Enron and its crusade=
. TV monitors in the Enron Building in downtown Houston displayed the stock=
 price. Employees could get pumped up by inspirational elevator messages on=
 the way to work. In the best dot-com tradition, employees were treated to =
subsidized Starbucks, an on-site gym and lavish company outings. Enron wasn=
't just a business, it was a lifestyle that rewarded foam-mouthed aggressio=
n. "There's nothing wrong with ambition, but there was simply a warped cult=
ure at the top," says John Allario, 38, who worked six years in Enron's bus=
iness-development department before losing his job in the collapse. "They w=
anted to climb to the top of the mountain and pound their chest and crush a=
nyone or anything that got in the way."=20
The most important measure of Enron's growth was its rising stock price. It=
 was the oil that made the Enron machine run smoothly. After faltering in 1=
997, Enron shares went on a run in late 1998, doubling, then doubling again=
. Enron stock options were making employees rich and helped the company att=
ract the best and brightest. Not wanting to miss out on a sure thing, Enron=
ites stuffed company shares into their 401(k) plans. The company required m=
ost employees to have a chunk of their 401(k)s in Enron stock -- but many e=
mployees had far more stock than Enron required, and far less in diversifie=
d investments, such as mutual funds.=20
But what made Enron successful -- innovation and daring -- got the company =
into trouble when it decided in its arrogance that it could "financialize" =
almost anything. Rather than sticking to natural gas and electricity, which=
 it understood, Enron in the mid- and late-'90s branched into whatever stru=
ck its fancy: water, coal, fiber-optic capacity, weather derivatives (whate=
ver those are) and newsprint. It bought and sold properties, and traded up =
a storm. But many of its businesses tied up lots of capital while earning v=
ery little or running in the red. In the late 1990s, by my count, Enron los=
t about $2 billion on telecom capacity, $2 billion in water investments, $2=
 billion in a Brazilian utility and $1 billion on a controversial electrici=
ty plant in India. Enron's debt was soaring. If these harsh truths became o=
bvious to outsiders, Enron's stock price would get clobbered -- and a risin=
g stock price was the company's be-all and end-all. Worse, what few people =
knew was that Enron had engaged in billions of dollars of off-balance-sheet=
 deals that would come back to haunt the company if its stock price fell.=
=20
And it was in those too-clever-by-half financial structures that Enron sowe=
d the seeds of its undoing. Before we proceed to the story of Enron's final=
 days, let's get out our trusty lightsabers and take an accounting trip, on=
e made more lively by some Enron financial techie's fondness for "Star Wars=
."=20
Our case involves something called JEDI, as in Jedi knight. JEDI stands for=
 Joint Energy Development Investments, which was an investment partnership =
between Enron and the California Public Employees Retirement System, known =
as Calpers. Enron and Calpers invested $250 million each into the partnersh=
ip in 1993. JEDI prospered -- the Force must have been with it -- as Enron =
deftly bought and sold energy stocks, power plants and other investments, e=
arning a 23 percent annual return for Calpers. Very nice. So Calpers welcom=
ed Enron's offer in late 1997 to do a sequel. They ramped up JEDI II, with =
each side putting up $500 million. But first, Calpers wanted to cash in its=
 JEDI I stake, worth $383 million. Enron obliged. Instead of liquidating th=
e partnership, Enron went looking for someone to ante up $383 million to ta=
ke Calpers's place. That would keep JEDI I off Enron's balance sheet and it=
s profit-and-loss statement. Making JEDI I part of Enron would have cut the=
 company's reported profits sharply, and increased its reported debt by mor=
e than $500 million.=20
To solve this problem, Enron ginned up Chewco Investments - as in Chewbacca=
 the Wookiee. Chewco was a partnership of Enron executives and some undiscl=
osed outsiders. Chewco didn't have $383 million sitting around. So Enron le=
nt it $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan. This left about $11.=
5 million for Chewco to come up with. Not a whole lot, given the size of th=
e deal. But $11.5 million was an important number. Why? Because it was more=
 than 3 percent of Chewco's capital. And what's magical about that number? =
Clearly you're not an accountant. If outsiders put up at least 3 percent of=
 the capital, accountants are allowed to keep the deal off the parent compa=
ny's books. But Enron couldn't even get this right. It turns out that Enron=
 had provided collateral for about half of Chewco's $11.5 million investmen=
t. This meant Chewco had only about 1.5 percent at risk, not 3 percent. So =
JEDI and Chewco should have been treated as part of Enron by Arthur Anderse=
n from late 1997 on. But they weren't. In congressional testimony last mont=
h, Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino admitted the accounting was wr=
ong, but said it wasn't Andersen's fault because no one told his firm about=
 the collateral Enron had provided. What Berardino didn't say then (and he =
wouldn't talk to us) is that even if Chewco had met the 3 percent rule, the=
 result would still be outrageously misleading. Keeping JEDI and Chewco off=
 the books inflated Enron's 1997 profits by 75 percent. And the move inflat=
ed profits for three more years, for a total of $396 million. Did keeping J=
EDI and Chewco off Enron's books when their impact was so great "present fa=
irly" Enron's financial situation, as Andersen certified? Not to me. But I'=
m only an English major.=20
Now, to the death spiral. Enron had started 2001 in great shape. Its stock =
was $83, close to its previous high of $90. CEO Jeff Skilling said in Janua=
ry that the stock was really worth $126. But rather than heading north, Enr=
on stock started falling as the year wore on. The continuous decline in Int=
ernet and telecom issues helped drag it down, as did falling natural-gas pr=
ices. What some Enron insiders knew -- but outsiders didn't -- is that the =
falling stock price was going to cause trouble, big time. That's because En=
ron was going to have to fork over lots of money, or give ruinous amounts o=
f stock, to institutions that had lent billions to Enron's off-balance-shee=
t entities. The commitment to provide that stock made the off-balance-sheet=
 entities creditworthy, because it reassured lenders about getting their mo=
ney back.=20
Skilling quit unexpectedly in August, triggering speculation that something=
 was amiss (he said he wanted to spend more time with his family). Skilling=
 wouldn't talk to Newsweek, but his spokesman said that Skilling "left beli=
eving the company was in very good shape." Asked if Skilling felt any respo=
nsibility for Enron's failure, his spokesman said he believes that "what ha=
ppened to Enron is a tragedy. He does not understand the reasons for it."=
=20
The reasons, actually, are sort of obvious. The end began on Oct. 16, when =
Enron held a conference call to discuss its third-quarter profits. Or, more=
 accurately, losses. Buried in its release was the fact that Enron's net wo=
rth had mysteriously shrunk by $1.2 billion. That was because of a complex =
off-balance-sheet deal involving four partnerships called Raptor, but Enron=
 didn't explain that.=20
For the first time, Enron found itself fielding lots of hostile questions f=
rom its formerly docile constituency on Wall Street. Meanwhile, The Wall St=
reet Journal had been picking away at the Enron facade, revealing, among ot=
her things, that Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had made m=
ore than $30 million in fees for running some of the supposedly independent=
 partnerships. That, plus the losses and the vanished $1.2 billion of net w=
orth, started a Wall Street uproar. This went virtually unnoticed in Washin=
gton, where all eyes were on Afghanistan. But a few days later the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission informed Enron that it had begun an informal inv=
estigation. Enron did what comes naturally to any large company in trouble =
-- it ran for a lawyer: University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers =
Jr. It put Powers on its board and named him to chair a special board commi=
ttee to deal with the SEC, and to investigate. Powers hired William McLucas=
, a former head of the SEC's enforcement division and a partner at the Wash=
ington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. McLucas assembled a legal ta=
sk force and hired accountants from Deloitte & Touche to dig into the books=
.=20
Guess what? Inside a month, McLucas & Co. found unpleasant truths that Enro=
n's board (and presumably Andersen) had ignored or overlooked for years. Th=
en again, McLucas didn't have a vested interest in ignoring them. McLucas's=
 conclusion: Enron's profits had been grossly overstated and its debts unde=
rstated for five years.=20
On Nov. 8, Enron issued a report, clearly crafted by McLucas, saying that i=
ts numbers dating back to 1997 could no longer be relied on. About 10 days =
later, it issued its third-quarter report, containing additional damaging i=
nformation. The end was nearing. As a trading company, Enron needed huge am=
ounts of credit to carry inventory (and, as we've seen, to cover losses) an=
d also needed the confidence of trading partners. With Enron's numbers hink=
y, its credit failing, a cash crisis clearly on the horizon, Enron's belove=
d free market did it in. Creditors fled, trading partners fled, money gushe=
d out the door. After an aborted attempt to sell out to crosstown rival Dyn=
egy Inc., which walked away from the deal at the last moment, Enron was out=
 of cash, out of credit, out of luck and out of time. It filed for bankrupt=
cy on Dec. 2. And it may well never emerge from it. Its energy-trading busi=
ness is still very valuable, but the bankruptcy is looking messy, even by b=
ankruptcy standards.=20
Former Enron employees can't stop shaking their heads over the sorry saga. =
"There was a time not so long ago when we all thought Ken Lay was just the =
most wonderful person in the world," says Shane Yelverton, who had worked a=
s a senior administrative assistant in Enron's engineering department. "But=
 now we're hearing all this stuff: that he was selling off stock, even whil=
e he was telling us not to sell our stock. It's disgusting."=20
Charles Prestwood is more than disgusted. A pipeline operator who had been =
with Enron since day one, he retired in October 2000 with $1.3 million of E=
nron stock in his 401(k). Now, he's watching pennies. "All those dreams are=
 gone now," he says. "I've lost everything I had. I'm just barely surviving=
."=20
Remember John Allario, the former Enron employee who so elegantly described=
 the corporate culture in Enron's heyday? He's getting a measure of revenge=
. Invoking his former CEO's last name, he started a Web site, laydoff.com, =
that peddles I GOT LAY'D BY ENRON T shirts. "We've sold about 450 so far," =
Allario said last week. "It's my way of showing the company that its former=
 employees whom they left in the lurch are still creative, and that we have=
 something to offer."=20
The Enron fallout promises to be severe and far-reaching. With a criminal i=
nvestigation underway, some of the Enron players face the prospect of spend=
ing time in the big house. The only question about Arthur Andersen is how m=
uch the partners will have to pay to settle this mess, and whether the comp=
any can survive as an independent entity. The accounting profession is wish=
ing it were once again faceless and colorless, instead of being in the hars=
h spotlight. Financial conglomerates like JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are=
 going to be scrutinized over their multiple and often conflicting roles at=
 Enron: lenders, trading partners, investors, advisers, investment bankers.=
=20
Small investors, understandably, are frightened when a giant, well-regarded=
 company collapses overnight. The obvious lesson: don't keep too many eggs =
in one investment basket, especially in the company you work for. Utilities=
 deregulation has suffered a severe blow: if a huge company like Enron can =
disappear overnight, how can you trust new market players to provide you wi=
th essentials like electricity, gas and water? And maybe it's time to chang=
e the name of the Houston Astros' home park, Enron Field, to House of Cards=
.=20
The bottom line: Enron wanted to change the world. It did. But not quite th=
e way that it had in mind.=20

THE NATION Enron Chief Misled Employees, Waxman Says Inquiry: Kenneth Lay's=
 e-mails painted a bright future for the firm, even as its stock was falter=
ing.

WASHINGTON -- Key congressional investigators charged Saturday that Enron C=
orp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay misled his 21,000 employees late last summer w=
hen he gave them a rosy picture of the company's financial health, even as =
the giant energy conglomerate was sliding toward financial ruin.=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, the ranking Democrat on the House Comm=
ittee on Government Reform, released copies of e-mails sent by Lay to emplo=
yees in August that suggested all was well with the company and that its st=
ock would rebound.
But Waxman said Lay must have known then that Enron was falling into deep f=
inancial trouble.=20
The e-mails were sent as Enron shares tumbled in the wake of Jeffrey Skilli=
ng's abrupt Aug. 14 resignation as company president.=20
"It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was pr=
ospering and that its stock price would rise," Waxman said in a letter to L=
ay, asking him to respond by Friday.=20
Repeated calls seeking comment from officials at Enron's headquarters in Ho=
uston went unanswered Saturday. But Enron spokesman Mark Palmer told Associ=
ated Press that the company was on solid footing when Lay sent the e-mails =
and that its financial problems did not become clear until later.=20
"Ken Lay was telling the truth," Palmer said. "We had had 21 consecutive qu=
arters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive quarters of volum=
e growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in better shape."=20
In an Aug. 14 e-mail, Lay told employees "that I have never felt better abo=
ut the prospects for the company."=20
Two weeks later, on Aug. 27, an e-mail advised employees that his work to s=
hore up investor confidence in the company likely would "result in a signif=
icantly higher stock price."=20
In other developments Saturday, two Republican House leaders, Reps. W.J. "B=
illy" Tauzin of Louisiana and James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania, called on=
 Enron accounting firm Andersen to turn over additional records to congress=
ional investigators.=20
Late last week, the Chicago-based company disclosed that from September to =
November it had destroyed thousands of documents involving Enron Corp.=20
Tauzin and Greenwood asserted in a letter to Andersen that the documents we=
re "knowingly destroyed" and said they did not want to risk the loss of any=
 other paperwork. They gave the company until Monday to produce some docume=
nts and until Friday for others.=20
Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said, "We are committed to being forthrig=
ht and doing the right thing in this matter."=20
Also, the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based watchdog group th=
at studies political fund-raising, said a review of federal disclosure form=
s shows that 14 of the Bush administration's top 100 officials owned Enron =
stock. Based on the disclosure forms, in which officials provide an estimat=
ed range of their assets' values, the Enron holdings by the administration =
officials were worth between $284,000 and $886,000.=20
Bush Officials Were Shareholders=20
Senior officials who owned stock included Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsf=
eld; Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political advisor; and Peter Fisher,=
 an assistant Treasury secretary. It was disclosed Friday that a top Enron =
executive called Fisher several times in the fall asking him to help the co=
mpany secure a bank loan. White House officials say Fisher did not interven=
e in the matter.=20
Lay has been a friend of Bush, and he and other Enron executives have contr=
ibuted about $550,000 to the president's political endeavors.=20
But Enron officials have been generous to Democrats as well, contributing t=
o Al Gore, Bush's opponent in the 2000 presidential campaign, and to more t=
han half the 50 Democrats in the Senate.=20
Enron officials have acknowledged that, during the latter part of last year=
, they were desperately trying to save the company from the bankruptcy fili=
ng that occurred in December. As a result of the company's collapse, thousa=
nds of families who owned Enron stock lost money.=20
Last week, new details emerged about company executives, including Lay, see=
king help from Bush administration officials to stave off the company's dem=
ise. Those contacted included Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commer=
ce Secretary Don Evans; both have said they took no action to help Enron.=
=20
The e-mails offer a glimpse into the inside world of Enron at a time when i=
ts financial problems were growing but before company executives turned to =
O'Neill and Evans for help.=20
Though he cited personal reasons for leaving the company, Skilling's depart=
ure Aug. 14 triggered a battering of Enron stock.=20
"I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for=
 the company," Lay's e-mail read that day.=20
"All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the l=
ast few months. One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant a=
mount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible."=20
He added that "our performance has never been stronger; our business model =
has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain.=20
"We have the finest organization in American business today."=20
On Aug. 27, Lay sent another e-mail to employees, who received a grant of s=
tock options, and told them that "one of my highest priorities is to restor=
e investor confidence in Enron."=20
He added that his efforts "should result in a significantly higher stock pr=
ice."=20
Waxman, in his letter to Lay about the e-mails, noted that, by the time of =
the second computer message, the stock price was at $37 a share, down from =
a high the previous August of $90.56.=20
"You had already sold $40 million of Enron stock during 2001 and over $100 =
million since October 1998," Waxman told Lay.=20
Enron stock hit a low of 26 cents a share Nov. 30.=20
As Stock Fell, So Did Severance=20
Waxman further noted that, while the company stock was plummeting, Lay soug=
ht a $60-million severance package for himself. When employees objected, Wa=
xman said, "you proposed reducing your package to $40 million."=20
And when Enron employees again objected, Lay decided in mid-November not to=
 accept the severance package compensation.=20
Waxman said he was bothered that Lay told his employees everything was fine=
, but less than two months later he was telling Bush officials in Washingto=
n that the company urgently needed help to prevent a bankruptcy filing.=20
"At a minimum," Waxman said, the statements by Lay "create the appearance t=
hat you misled Enron employees about the value of their investments in Enro=
n and the security of their jobs.=20
"If this were accurate, it would be a gross betrayal of your employees' tru=
st, as well as possibly illegal conduct."

The World: School for Scandal
Trying To Pass Damage Control 101
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- WILL they ever learn?=20
The rules in the damage-control playbook are deceptively simple: be the fir=
st to release the bad news (all at once, if possible). Do not misrepresent =
information. And the cover-up is always worse than the crime.
Yet, last week, Washington once again watched as a new administration seeme=
d to ignore the old rules when it scrambled to deal with what may be its fi=
rst full-blown political scandal -- its close ties to the Enron Corporation=
, one of the largest contributors to President Bush's 2000 presidential cam=
paign.=20
Almost every day, the White House disclosed new contacts between administra=
tion officials and executives at Enron, the once-powerful, now-bankrupt Hou=
ston energy trading conglomerate that first sought favorable regulatory pol=
icies from the Bush administration before literally pleading for its help t=
o survive. The White House is insisting it has done nothing for the company=
. But by the end of the week, some strategists said the White House's trick=
ling out of information helped the Enron story gather enough momentum that =
it pushed terrorism off the front page.=20
Perhaps it is the political survival instincts of a new administration. Or =
perhaps it is nothing more than a White House's stubborn refusal to give th=
e press what it wants. Whatever the reason, every new scandal seems to doom=
 a president to repeat his predecessors' mistakes.=20
''They are learning, very slowly, the way to do this, the fact that you hav=
e to get out in front of these stories, but they haven't learned entirely y=
et how to do it,'' said Lanny J. Davis, the Clinton administration spin doc=
tor who made an art form out of the Friday night damage-control leak to a w=
ire service reporter so news would hit the Saturday papers, thought to have=
 the least readership. ''Some things, you have to learn the hard way.''=20
Even the most experienced Washington hands said there might be nothing ille=
gal in the late fall conversations between Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman=
, and two cabinet officers. Mr. Lay sought help for Enron's dire financial =
condition from Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.=20
''They were hesitant and not on top of things in the first hours of this cr=
isis,'' said David R. Gergen, a longtime political strategist who worked in=
 the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. ''This is an administ=
ration that is sometimes hesitant in the first moments of a crisis or chall=
enge, but it recovers very well. I think they made a strong effort to get m=
uch more out at the end of the week. The problem is, we just don't know if =
there is any more, if there are things being held back.''=20
There are many moments in the modern presidency when the temptation to hold=
 back the truth prevailed, but always to the everlasting regret of the Oval=
 Office occupants. No one did more holding back than Richard M. Nixon, and =
the Watergate cover-up sank his presidency.=20
In the first days of the Iran-contra scandal, Ronald Reagan appeared to be =
following the damage-control scenario by releasing what the administration =
said was virtually everything about the arms-for-hostages deal. Of course, =
many more details emerged later, and it was again the cover-up that proved =
far more politically toxic than the original allegation.=20
Bill Clinton insisted he ''did not have sexual relations with that woman.''=
 But his denial, maintained by his aides for eight months, dragged the coun=
try through a scandal that lasted more than a year before it ended with Mr.=
 Clinton's impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate.=20
How long the Enron inquiry will last, some strategists say, depends on what=
 else may be waiting out there about the company's relationship with the Wh=
ite House. ''I just worry that some other shoe is going to drop,'' said a R=
epublican strategist with ties to the White House.=20
The Enron inquiry is unlike the scandals that bedeviled the Clintons, inclu=
ding the Monica S. Lewinsky affair and the Whitewater land deal. Most of th=
e information related to those scandals was located in the White House -- e=
ven, literally, inside the Oval Office.=20
But Enron is a wide-ranging private sector debacle, being investigated by t=
he Justice Department, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission and five separate Congressional committees. Documents have been de=
stroyed by employees of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
''It's somewhat more complicated because the information sits in various pl=
aces, not all of which are under the control of the White House,'' said Suz=
anne R. Garment, author of ''Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American P=
olitics.'' ''The opportunities are multiplied for screw-ups.''=20
The allegations of influence-peddling are almost impossible to prove. The c=
ampaign finance quid pro quo is always elusive. The White House attempted t=
o chase away the allegations by arguing -- so far without being contradicte=
d -- that Enron got nothing for its many years of generosity. Other than a =
few meetings, the administration did not give it the energy policy it wante=
d, or the bail-out assistance requested as Enron hurtled toward bankruptcy =
last fall.=20
''What you have here is a case where a contributor called up and asked for =
something but did not get it,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House press s=
ecretary. Moreover, no evidence has emerged that President Bush is in any w=
ay involved.=20
Mrs. Garment said the ''contributor calls could turn out to be nothing, but=
 they are precisely the kind of tendrils by which scandal classically creep=
s up the brick wall.''=20
FORMER Clinton administration officials watched with incredulity as their c=
ounterparts attempted to put out the Enron fire. ''Since Sept. 11, they hav=
e all performed well under ridiculous pressure,'' said Jennifer Palmieri, t=
he press secretary of the Democratic National Committee, ''but they have ne=
ver been through anything like this.'' Yet some Democrats might also be ent=
angled.=20
Some Republican administration officials were furious at some of the press =
coverage. ''They act like there's some billing records or some cattle scam =
or some fired travel aides or some blue dress,'' Mary Matalin, an aide to V=
ice President Dick Cheney, said, referring to many points she used when att=
acking the Clinton administration.=20
It took several days of disclosures from the Bush White House to jump start=
 the political scandal machine, hibernating since Sept. 11. Political resea=
rchers and Democratic operatives sent out blast-faxes of past favors done f=
or the Bush family by Mr. Lay and Enron. And reporters began asking: what d=
id the president know, and when did he know it?=20
''Even if no more damaging information comes out,'' Ms. Palmieri said, ''th=
is is a major problem for this administration. It is going to damage the pr=
esident's credibility and it is going to hurt their ability to get their me=
ssage out.''=20
Mr. Gergen said, ''Washington journalists believe there is blood in the wat=
er,'' but he said most of the public views Enron as a failed corporation wh=
ose employees watched helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated. Th=
e blame does not touch the White House.=20
To ensure the budding scandal does not ''have legs,'' Mrs. Garment said the=
 White House should immediately investigate whether anyone else in the admi=
nistration had any contact with Enron. ''I assume the White House is making=
 a complete sweep of the upper levels of government for any information on =
contacts between members of the administration and Enron,'' she said. ''And=
 if they find anything that they think is relevant, they should say what it=
 is immediately. Surely, they have learned from the past. Right?''

Bush, Enron chief rose out of the same circles of achievement
By DEB RIECHMANN
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush bestowed the nickname "Kenny Boy" on embat=
tled Enron executive Kenneth Lay back when the two were up-and-comers in Te=
xas.=20
That doesn't mean they are best buddies; Bush dispenses nicknames freely an=
d not just on intimates. Yet as their careers soared, their interests becam=
e more intertwined, whether in business, politics or baseball.
Bush's largest financial benefactor, Lay found him to be a friend of the en=
ergy industry when Bush was Texas governor. And Bush made a special trip to=
 Houston during his presidential campaign to attend the Astros' first game =
at Enron Field, as Lay threw out the first pitch.=20
They've enjoyed "quality time," Lay has said.=20
How close their friendship grew has come under scrutiny since Enron, the Ho=
uston-based energy giant, filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history last=
 month.=20
It has since been disclosed that Lay contacted officials in the Bush admini=
stration, which has at least 15 high-ranking members who owned stock in the=
 company last year. Several Cabinet members acknowledged contacts from Enro=
n but said they did not tell Bush or take any action.=20
The president calls Lay a "supporter," in recognition of the money poured i=
nto his campaigns over the years by Lay, his company and its employees.=20
But he denies speaking with Lay about the company's financial problems and =
says his administration will aggressively investigate the failure of the co=
mpany. Enron's fall cost thousands of jobs and vaporized the retirement sav=
ings of many employees.=20
"My sense is that Bush cares about him," said Bill Miller, a political cons=
ultant in Austin, Texas, who witnessed Lay's ascent in the corporate world =
and Bush's rise to governor, then president.=20
"It was a friendship-friendship, not just a business friendship."=20
White House and Enron officials insist the two were never all that close. A=
ny idea that Lay is a "close intimate" of Bush is ludicrous, said Bush advi=
ser Karl Rove=20
"It would be a stretch to call them personal friends," said Enron spokesman=
 Mark Palmer, adding he recalled hearing Lay say that Bush had called him "=
Kenny Boy" once or twice.=20
Parsing his words carefully, Bush said last week that it was when he became=
 governor after the 1994 election that "I first got to know Ken." But their=
 relationship apparently goes farther back.=20
Lay, as chairman of the University of Houston board of regents in the late =
1980s, tried to bring the senior Bush's presidential library to his school.=
 George W. Bush was involved in setting up the library, which eventually we=
nt to College Station, Texas, instead.=20
Lay says he spent "a little more quality time with George W." during that t=
ime.=20
Criminal, civil and congressional investigations are looming into whether E=
nron defrauded investors, including 401(k) plan investors, by concealing in=
formation about its financial problems.=20
Bush, sitting on high approval ratings, is hoping his connections to Lay wo=
n't become a political liability.=20
Bush has received more than $550,000 from Enron, its employees and their re=
latives during his political career - the most from any source. Altogether,=
 more than 250 members of Congress from both parties have received Enron co=
ntributions.=20
Lay's relationship with the Bush family dates back to when the president's =
father was the only Bush in national politics.=20
Lay was co-chairman of former President Bush's 1990 economic summit for ind=
ustrialized nations, which was held in Houston.=20
Lay and his wife, Linda, dined on hickory grilled veal medallions and Texas=
 peaches and cream with summit attendees who included British Prime Ministe=
r Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand.=20
Lay also was co-chairman of the host committee for the Republican National =
Convention when it was held in Houston in 1992. George W. Bush played an ac=
tive role in his father's unsuccessful campaign for a second term that year=
.=20
The businessman had Democratic connections as well, serving Democratic Gov.=
 Ann Richards as leader of her business council. He gave money to her campa=
ign and Bush's in 1994, and when Bush defeated her that year, the new gover=
nor kept Lay on the business council.=20
As Lay was donating money to Bush's 1994 and 1998 governor's campaigns, he =
also was lobbying legislators to deregulate the electric industry, an area =
into which Enron was expanding.=20
Bush signed a deregulation law in 1999 clearing Enron's path into new marke=
ts.=20
"Bush has always delivered on Kenneth Lay's political pitches," said Craig =
McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, a campaign-finance advocac=
y group.=20
Even if Bush's dad hadn't been in the White House, the two men would have b=
een on similar trajectories.=20
"They're both from the energy business; they both like baseball," said W.J.=
 "Jack" Bowen, a retired gas executive who hired Lay twice, at a Florida en=
ergy company and then at Transco Energy Co. in Houston.=20
They have similar personal traits, said Miller, who has watched Texas polit=
ics for years. Both are bright and down-to-earth. Each tends to delegate au=
thority.=20
"Neither one of them pretends to be an intellectual," Miller said. "Lay is =
reserved, but not shy. Bush has got more ham bone in him."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Complex Web of Relationships in Boom and Bust
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 26, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The cast of characters in the Enron drama is lengthy, and their relationshi=
ps are complex.=20
THE EXECUTIVES=20
Kenneth L. Lay gained national fame as the chairman and chief executive of =
Enron, a company that reshaped the nation's energy markets -- and notoriety=
 as the company flamed out spectacularly.
A man with a doctorate in economics and an evangelical belief in free marke=
ts, Mr. Lay turned an old-fashioned gas pipeline operator into the world's =
biggest energy trader. But when Enron faltered, he could not explain the co=
mpany's finances to the satisfaction of Wall Street or of Dynegy Inc., a ri=
val that offered to rescue Enron but ultimately walked away from a proposed=
 merger.=20
Mr. Lay's longtime No. 2, Jeffrey K. Skilling, fostered a culture at Enron =
described as creative and cutthroat. He led the company into new markets, s=
etting up trading desks for paper, chemicals, water rights and high-speed I=
nternet service.=20
Mr. Skilling was chief executive for six months, resigning last August. He =
said last month that he was stunned by the company's rapid decline.=20
Enron replaced its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, in October, s=
eeking to placate investors and regulators who had begun questioning a set =
of unusual partnerships he arranged to shift debt off the company's books. =
Two weeks later, the company revised its accounting for the partnerships, w=
iping away about $600 million in profits it had reported over the previous =
five years. Mr. Fastow earned $30 million from his investments in the deals=
.=20
THE BOARD=20
Enron recruited prominent people to its board of directors, but given the c=
ompany's collapse, analysts give them low marks. The directors include Wend=
y L. Gramm, the former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commis=
sion and the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.=20
Ms. Gramm serves on the board's audit committee, which is responsible for t=
he company's accounting and financial reporting. Until 1998, she owned Enro=
n shares; when the Gramms decided that the stock presented conflict of inte=
rest issues, she sold her shares for $300,000. Since then, the company has =
placed her board pay in a ''deferred account'' that can be tapped later.=20
Also on the board is Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of the M. D. Anderson C=
ancer Center, one of Houston's most prestigious institutions. Enron has don=
ated more than $600,000 to the center in the last five years. Another audit=
 committee member, Lord John Wakeham, was in Margaret Thatcher's inner circ=
le when she was Britain's prime minister.=20
THE LAWYERS=20
No corporate crisis would be complete without celebrity lawyers, and the En=
ron debacle has enlisted some of the biggest. David Boies, who took on Micr=
osoft in the federal antitrust suit, is representing Mr. Fastow. Robert S. =
Bennett, who represented President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones scandal,=
 is representing Enron in Washington.=20
THE POLITICIANS=20
Mr. Lay -- ''Kenny Boy'' to his friend George W. Bush -- is a major contrib=
utor to both political parties. Mr. Lay and other Enron executives have giv=
en more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush in his political career.=20
Enron's executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney four times last year=
 to discuss energy matters. When Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Hallibur=
ton, a unit of the company built Houston's new baseball stadium, Enron Fiel=
d. Before he became the president's top economic counselor, Lawrence B. Lin=
dsey was a paid adviser to Enron. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political str=
ategist, and I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, were investors in=
 the company.=20
The ties reach far beyond the White House. The Republican national chairman=
, Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana, was a lobbyist for the comp=
any until last week. In Texas, Mr. Bush's successor, Rick Perry, has been c=
riticized for appointing a top Enron executive to the state's Public Utilit=
y Commission.=20
THE ACCOUNTANTS=20
Joseph F. Berardino, chief executive of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen=
, Enron's longtime auditor, is caught in the Enron net. In December, he tol=
d Congress that Enron might have illegally hidden information from its audi=
tors. Last week, Andersen disclosed that its employees had destroyed docume=
nts related to its auditing of Enron -- even after the government began inv=
estigating Enron's fall.=20
If the story seems to take on the breadth of a Cecil B. DeMille epic, that =
may only be appropriate. For there is a cast of thousands: the company's in=
vestors, including Enron employees who saw their retirement savings disappe=
ar virtually overnight. Their loss -- and their anger -- guarantee that the=
 investigations of Enron are only beginning.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Before Debacle, Enron Insiders Cashed In $1.1 Billion in Shares
By LESLIE WAYNE

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

While investigators are focusing on how much money investors and employees =
lost in the Enron Corporation's collapse, some shareholders and lawmakers a=
re now setting their sights on another target: the millions that Enron insi=
ders received by selling their shares while the price was still high.=20
As Enron stock climbed and Wall Street was still promoting it, a group of 2=
9 Enron executives and directors began to sell their shares. These insiders=
 received $1.1 billion by selling 17.3 million shares from 1999 through mid=
-2001, according to court filings based on public records. They continued s=
elling just before Enron's stock started to tumble early last year and the =
company began its slide into bankruptcy protection.
One of the biggest sellers was Kenneth L. Lay, who became prominent as the =
company's chairman and a leading contributor to President Bush. He was amon=
g more than a dozen Enron executives who received $30 million or more, incl=
uding one who sold shares valued at $353.7 million.=20
Lawyers and spokesmen for the executives, board members and the company sai=
d that the sales were proper, and that the insiders had no special informat=
ion or advantages over other investors.=20
''This issue is being investigated,'' said Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for =
Enron. ''But at this point in time, I am unaware of any evidence that suppo=
rts the allegation there was improper selling by members of the board or se=
nior management.''=20
Many of these Enron executives retain large holdings in the company, sellin=
g shares regularly, as executives at other companies do. ''In many instance=
s, the sale of the stock was preplanned according to a strict timetable,'' =
Mr. Bennett said.=20
Mr. Lay himself sold Enron stock 350 times, trading almost daily, receiving=
 $101.3 million. In all, Mr. Lay sold 1.8 million Enron shares between earl=
y 1999 and July 2001, five months before Enron filed for bankruptcy. As of =
last February, he still owned more than 7.7 million shares.=20
Mr. Lay sold his stock for $31 to $86 a share; this week, Enron was selling=
 for under 70 cents a share. Often, Mr. Lay sold in amounts as small as 500=
 shares, while at other times he sold as many as 100,000 shares.=20
It has not been determined how much Mr. Lay or the others paid for their sh=
ares, or how much they gained. Much of Mr. Lay's holdings, and those of oth=
er executives, were in the form of stock options, which allowed them to buy=
 shares at a discount.=20
Other top sellers were Lou L. Pai, the former chairman of an Enron subsidia=
ry, who received $353.7 million for his 5 million shares; Rebecca P. Mark-J=
usbasche, a director and former Enron executive who received $79.5 million =
for 1.4 million shares; and Ken L. Harrison, a director who sold 1 million =
shares for $75.2 million.=20
Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's former chief executive, received $66.9 m=
illion for 1.1 million shares. Beginning in December 2000, Mr. Skilling beg=
an to sell his holdings at a pace of 10,000 shares about every seven days. =
He still owns about 600,000 shares and options, according to public filings=
.=20
Andrew S. Fastow, the company's ousted chief financial officer, who set up =
many of the financial partnerships that have been criticized for concealing=
 Enron's large debts, received $30 million for his holdings.=20
A detailed accounting of these trades is contained in a lawsuit brought by =
Amalgamated Bank, of New York, which invested the pension money of union me=
mbers in Enron shares. Representing the bank in this case, which is now in =
the Federal District Court in Houston, is the same law firm that brought sh=
areholder suits against Charles H. Keating Jr. in the savings and loan scan=
dal and against Michael R. Milken, the junk bond financier, for securities =
fraud.=20
While the suit has received little attention so far, it highlights one of t=
he main points in the political debate now taking place in Washington -- wh=
ether small shareholders were left out of a flow of information about Enron=
's deteriorating financial condition.=20
The differences in the trading strategies of the two groups -- those outsid=
e the company who were buying Enron's shares and those inside the company w=
ho were selling them -- reflect the different information that each group h=
ad, according to the suit.=20
''The defendants employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud,'' the =
lawsuit states. It accuses the 29 defendants of ''unlawful insider trading'=
' and says the group ''materially misled the investing public'' by issuing =
false statements.=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Se=
nate government affairs committee, has already announced hearings that will=
, in part, look at how Enron shareholders might have been deceived by the c=
ompany's financial statements. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of Californi=
a, has also expressed concern for Enron's small shareholders, especially em=
ployees who put its shares in their 401(k) retirement plans only to lose th=
eir savings.=20
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the H=
ouse Commerce Committee, released a letter yesterday asking Mr. Lay to answ=
er questions about optimistic statements Mr. Waxman said that Mr. Lay had m=
ade in e-mail messages to employees last August. In the e-mail, gathered by=
 staff investigators, Mr. Lay said that Enron remained strong.=20
At Enron, more than half of the employees' 401(k) assets, or about $1.2 bil=
lion, was invested in company stock, which is now nearly worthless. Billion=
s more were lost by other investors, from individuals to large institutions=
 that bought Enron shares for the pension plans of unions and corporations.=
=20
The lawsuit claims the insiders withheld information, allowing Enron's shar=
es to remain at an artificially high level while they were selling their sh=
ares. ''This is the most massive insider bailout that we've ever seen and w=
e've been prosecuting these cases for 30 years,'' said William S. Lerach, o=
ne of the bank's lead attorneys. ''The overall size of this case is unprece=
dented.''=20
Spokesmen for some of the defendants say that this group had done nothing w=
rong. An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, dismissed the suit as ''completely w=
ithout merit'' and a ''weak argument.''=20
Gordon G. Andrew, a spokesman for Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial of=
ficer, declined to comment, but said that Mr. Fastow still had about 50 per=
cent of his original holdings. Mr. Andrew said that Mr. Fastow's last stock=
 sale took place in November 2000 and that Mr. Fastow had purchased shares =
in early 2001.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling, the former chief executive, said that ''the=
re is absolutely no basis to the allegation that Mr. Skilling did anything =
improper with regard to the sale of Enron stock.'' The defendants have not =
yet filed answers to the complaint. Arthur Andersen & Company, also named, =
declined to comment.=20
At the top end of the selling was Mr. Pai, who headed an Enron subsidiary c=
alled NewPower Holdings, an online retailer of electricity and natural gas.=
 Before leaving Enron last spring, Mr. Pai sold five million shares of Enro=
n between January 1999 and July 2001 for $353.7 million.=20
In January 2000, just 60 days after the formation of NewPower, Mr. Pai rece=
ived more than two million Enron shares. He began to sell them almost immed=
iately, mostly while they were trading above $70.=20
Enron directors, also named in the case, sold stock too. All Enron director=
s receive stock options as part of their $380,619 annual fees. Of that, 15 =
percent was paid in cash, the remainder in stock.=20
One director, Wendy L. Gramm, the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of=
 Texas, sold all her 10,256 shares for $276,912. She sold the stock on one =
day -- Nov. 3, 1998 -- for $27 a share. Ms. Gramm said earlier that she and=
 her husband decided to sell their Enron shares to avoid the appearance of =
a conflict. She was then paid in cash.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are both =
investigating Enron. A Senate committee issued 51 subpoenas Friday as part =
of an investigation into the insiders' stock sales.=20
The investigations should aid the case against the insiders, said Michael H=
ennigan, a Los Angeles lawyer in the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy laws=
uit. ''I assume that the government is going after the exact same things th=
at Lerach is after,'' he said, referring to the lawyer for the bank suing E=
nron.=20
Last week, a federal judge declined to immediately freeze the assets of the=
 defendants, asking for further information before reconsidering the reques=
t.

Enron chairman and CEO Ken Lay spoke to Commerce Secretary Evans on October=

USA: US senator - Enron accountant could face charges.

01/13/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - If Arthur Andersen ordered workers to destro=
y audit material related to Enron Corp., the Big Five accounting firm could=
 face criminal indictment, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, was referring to a report by=
 Time magazine that Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, ordered employees in =
an Oct. 12 memo to destroy all audit material on Enron Corp. except the mos=
t basic "work papers."
The magazine reported on Sunday that just four days before Enron disclosed =
a stunning $618 million loss for the third quarter - its first public discl=
osure of its financial woes - the workers who audited the company's books w=
ere ordered to destroy the records, and reminded to do so in the weeks lead=
ing up to the first Security and Exchange Commission subpoenas issued on No=
v. 8.=20
"We know that Arthur Andersen, the supposedly independent auditor, covered =
up facts very relevant to the condition of Enron," Lieberman told CBS's "Fa=
ce the Nation."=20
"It may well be" criminal, he said. "Arthur Andersen is a great company wit=
h a great name. That name is being sullied and ultimately this Enron episod=
e may end this company's history."=20
"From what I've seen of the Time magazine story, the memo about destroying =
the documents of Enron was not just a routine 'clear your files' memo. It w=
as specifically about Enron and it came at a time when people inside, inclu=
ding the executives of Arthur Andersen and Enron, knew that Enron was in re=
al trouble and that the roof was about to collapse on them," said Lieberman=
, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.=20
Lieberman's panel has begun an investigation.=20
"This kind of memo to destroy documents raises very serious questions about=
 whether obstruction of justice occurred here. That's not for me to make a =
judgment on now. Obviously I don't know enough about it," he added. "But yo=
u've got lawsuits being filed ... you've got criminal investigations going =
on.=20
"If this memo was what it looks like, I'm afraid that the folks at Arthur A=
ndersen could be on the other end of an indictment before this is over."=20
Arthur Andersen admitted last Thursday its employees had deleted documents =
related to its review of the bankrupt energy trader's finances, and congres=
sional sources said thousands were destroyed.=20
A spokesman told Time it would be inappropriate to discuss the situation un=
til the company completes its own review.=20
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also has issued 51 docu=
ment subpoenas to Andersen, Enron and 49 unnamed Enron executives, employee=
s and directors.=20
Sen. John McCain told CBS the accounting firm was receiving $50 million dol=
lars a year for "consulting" as well as $50 million for auditing.=20
"That's hard to understand how you can audit objectively while you are gett=
ing huge sums of money for consulting to an energy firm," McCain said.=20
Arthur Andersen did accounting for the global energy trading giant before i=
t declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, wiping out the jobs and pensions savings o=
f thousands of workers and inflicting losses of millions of individual inve=
stors. In addition to the regulatory and congressional investigations, the =
Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.

 Democrat from the failed energy trading giant.=20
The $21,933 the senator received came during his 1998 race and was the four=
th largest in the Senate, even topping donations to some House lawmakers fr=
om Enron's home state of Texas, according to a study by the Center for Resp=
onsive Politics, which monitors campaign donations. The money came from com=
pany employees, including chairman Kenneth Lay, and its political action co=
mmittee.
Although Enron overwhelmingly favored Republicans, Schumer collected more f=
rom the company than any non-Texan, except for Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.),=
 who got $23,200 and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, which d=
oles out the nation's spending money. Enron's top recipient in Congress was=
 Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Texas), an appropriations member who got $99=
,500 from 1989 to November of last year.=20
Schumer is on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Banking, H=
ousing and Urban Affairs Committee. Both panels expect to investigate how a=
nd why Enron imploded, sinking employees' pension funds, and to learn how m=
uch the Bush administration knew of the company's troubles before the publi=
c fall. Other committee members also received contributions from Enron.=20
Schumer received the donations during his battle with incumbent Alfonse D'A=
mato, one of the most watched and expensive races in the nation. In a posit=
ion favored by Enron, Schumer made power deregulation one of the keystone c=
ampaign issues upstate because the high energy prices there were damaging t=
he economy. Since he got into the Senate, there have not been many key ener=
gy votes.=20
Schumer spokesman Bradley Tusk said nothing untoward happened: "Did Enron g=
ive us contributions? Yes. Have they asked us to do anything? No."=20
Once Schumer arrived in the Senate, Tusk said, he led and won the fight aga=
inst the company's main priority in 1999 when it came to reauthorizing the =
Commodities Exchange Act. "The bill would have allowed electronic trading c=
ompanies like Enron to be exempt from federal oversight," Tusk said. "We th=
ought it would put consumers at risk."=20
The money may be explained by a common denominator between Enron and Schume=
r. One was a prolific giver, the other a prolific fund- raiser.=20
Schumer is "going to get a lot of money from a lot of donors . . . and his =
fund-raisers don't stop at the border" of New York, said Steven Weiss, a sp=
okesman for the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
The company's employees and PAC also contributed to several other New Yorke=
rs, according to campaign records. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton got $950 dur=
ing her race, and former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan $1,000 in 1992. In th=
e House from 1989 to 2001, Reps. Gary Ackerman (D-Jamaica Estates) and Char=
les Rangel (D-Manhattan) each got $3,500; Vito Fossella (R-Staten Island) $=
3,000; Edolphus Towns (D- Brooklyn) $500; Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn) $500;=
 and Peter King (R- Seaford) $300. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuli=
ani got $3,000; D'Amato $13,000 from 1996 to 1998; and Rick Lazio $9,400, m=
ostly during his failed Senate bid in 2000.=20
On the state level, Enron employees gave $1,000 to Gov. George Pataki last =
year and the same this year to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Cu=
omo. They spent $60,000 to $70,000 in lobbying at the state capital each ye=
ar from 1998 to 2000, but substantially less in 2001.=20

Enron echoes past scandals

Here's a modest proposal to major news media: Accompany every news story ab=
out Enron Corp. with a profile of an Enron victim so we don't forget who th=
is scandal is really about.=20
It's easy to forget the little people as we sort through the big people who=
 let the little people down in what is growing into Washington's latest big=
 scandal.
Chandra Levy's ex-boyfriend, Rep. Gary Condit, is not the only Washington s=
candal target to be relieved of pesky press attention by the war on terrori=
sm. Were it not for the Sept. 11 terror attacks, it would not have taken un=
til last week, when the Justice Department opened an investigation, to put =
this story on the front burner of media attention.=20
Houston-based Enron has been Bush's most generous corporate contributor thr=
oughout his political career. Thousands of investors and Enron employees wh=
o presumably worked hard and played by the rules suddenly lost their saving=
s and pensions, because there was less to Enron's finances than they had be=
en led to believe.=20
While their stock crashed, top Enron executives may have been able to bail =
out quickly without telling the public or Enron's employees, who were not a=
llowed at that point to move their pension funds from Enron stock to an inv=
estment that was making money.=20
Investors like to think they can trust the information they receive about a=
 company's stability and finances, especially when it is a company for whic=
h they work. If Americans cannot look to Washington to help them to protect=
 their hard-earned life savings from rip-offs like the Enron bankruptcy, yo=
u have to wonder what Washington is for.=20
Yet when you look at Enron's cozy Washington connections, particularly with=
 the Bush administration, you begin to wonder, as they say out in the rural=
 areas, whether the fox was guarding the henhouse.=20
It is premature to put this developing blowup in the same league with major=
 White House scandals of the past, but there are numerous unfortunate echoe=
s:=20
Bush's declaration that his good pal Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay never hinte=
d at the company's precarious financial position echoes Bush's father decla=
ring that he was "out of the loop" of the Iran- Contra affair in the 1980s.=
=20
Disclosures that Enron's Chicago-based auditor, Arthur Anderson LLP, destro=
yed thousands of Enron files sounded like the 18 1/2 minute gap in Presiden=
t Nixon's White House tapes.=20
We even have--Hello, again!--a familiar face: savvy attorney Robert Bennett=
, who defended Clinton against Paula Jones' accusations of sexual harassmen=
t. Now Bennett is defending and spinning for Enron to reporters.=20
That's Washington. The same faces keep coming back. So do a lot of the same=
 questions, to which the White House has its damage-control machinery worki=
ng. The strategy includes:=20
(1.) Look proactive. Get Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who received a now-embar=
rassing $25,000 contribution from Enron for his Senate campaign, to recuse =
himself.=20
(2.) Have President Bush announce the criminal investigation, express sympa=
thy for investors who got the shaft in "this awful bankruptcy" and announce=
 new pension disclosure rules to protect workers in other companies.=20
Among Enron's ripped-off workers, that reform is called, "closing the barn =
door after your horses, your mule and all of your dairy cattle have walked =
away."=20
(3.) Deny, deny, deny. "I have never discussed the financial problems of th=
e company," Bush told reporters at a photo-op. "The last time I saw Mr. Lay=
 was at my mother's fundraising event for literacy. That was in Houston las=
t spring . . ."=20
Jocular George usually refers to his pals by first names or nicknames. But =
Enron's chief, one of his biggest benefactors, suddenly was just "Mr. Lay."=
=20
No, this scandal probably is not going away soon. Bush will have to learn t=
o live with his losses, just like Enron's investors, although Bush's losses=
 probably won't cost him as much.=20

Editorial
Learning From Enron

01/13/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

LAST WEEK the scandal around Enron deepened. The Justice Department announc=
ed a criminal investigation into the firm's collapse, and the Bush administ=
ration belatedly came clean about a number of high-level contacts it had wi=
th Enron and its creditors as the firm headed toward bankruptcy. More may y=
et come out. But for the moment there is no evidence that the Bush team was=
 improperly embroiled in the firm's deceptive schemes. Enron appears to hav=
e sought help from the administration in securing fresh credit from its ban=
kers and in staving off a downgrade by a credit-rating firm. But no help se=
ems to have been given.=20
The real scandal about Enron is different. It is that a public company, wit=
h a legal obligation to report accurately on its finances, concealed the tr=
ue state of those finances from its owners. Those owners included many smal=
l investors who either held Enron stock directly or through their retiremen=
t funds, and who have been cheated. Many Enron employees, who were encourag=
ed by the company to fill their retirement plans with company stock, have b=
een left with little or nothing. Meanwhile Enron's senior managers, who eit=
her perpetrated the fraud or at a minimum failed to prevent it, have extrac=
ted millions in pay and bonuses from the company.
The task now is to identify those responsible for this disaster and to devi=
se regulations that might prevent its recurrence. As well as senior officia=
ls within Enron, the spotlight must fall on Arthur Andersen, the auditing f=
irm that was supposed to certify the accuracy of Enron's accounts. Auditors=
 often defend themselves in such cases by blaming the firm, claiming that m=
anagers gave them false numbers to work with. But in Enron's case, Andersen=
 has already admitted that it spotted accounting mistakes and suggested tha=
t they be put right, but then certified the accounts as accurate without an=
y corrections. What's more, Andersen now confesses to have destroyed docume=
nts related to Enron, not the usual behavior of an innocent party.=20
Three kinds of reform might make corporate accounts more accurate in future=
. The first is to make corporate board members take their responsibilities =
more seriously. Boards are supposed to ensure that managers act in sharehol=
ders' interests, and a key part of their job is to appoint tough auditors t=
o verify financial statements. But board members often do managers' bidding=
, either because they are drawn from management ranks or because their inde=
pendence is compromised by consulting contracts with the company. Enron boa=
rd members received thousands of dollars from the managers they oversaw. Th=
is practice should be strictly limited.=20
Second, and most important, the rules by which auditors work should be made=
 tougher. At present, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is reluctant=
 to take a hard line on accounting tricks used to deceive shareholders, in =
part because the board depends on auditing firms and public companies for i=
ts budget. As a result, Enron's practice of concealing its risky financial =
instruments in partner firms may actually have been legal under the board's=
 standards, even though it rendered its published accounts meaningless. Thi=
s is scandalous; no investor, no matter how sophisticated, could have known=
 the full extent of Enron's obligations (which sank the firm). Until firms =
are required to disclose completely their obligations, how can stockholders=
 know which firms are burdened by debts that don't appear on their balance =
sheets? And if stockholders can't reliably know the extent of corporate obl=
igations, how can it be safe to buy stocks?=20
Finally, auditors' independence should be ensured. At present, auditors pro=
vide consulting services to the firms they oversee, harming their independe=
nce in the same way that board members compromise themselves. Setting a cap=
 on such services, or requiring more detailed disclosure of them, is worth =
considering.=20
None of these changes will be easy, to be sure. But Enron threatens "a mass=
ive loss of public confidence in the numbers that are the bedrock of Americ=
an markets," in the words of Arthur Levitt, the former head of the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission. He is right, and it is time to do something abo=
ut it.

THE NATION NEWS ANALYSIS White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted That =
no warnings were issued as Enron collapsed raises the specter of special tr=
eatment, critics charge.

Even though they mounted no formal effort to bail out Enron Corp., Bush adm=
inistration officials are coming under fire for not publicly disclosing the=
 extent of the company's troubles when they became aware of them.=20
Some legal experts contend the administration was in a position to sound a =
warning to the public or the Securities and Exchange Commission after a ser=
ies of phone calls from Enron executives to Treasury Department officials l=
ast fall. The fact that they didn't, while Enron's financial situation grew=
 darker and its stock price declined steadily, raises the specter of specia=
l treatment for a powerful corporation, congressional critics say.
But the Bush administration, despite close ties to Enron, did not help the =
firm stave off bankruptcy as the federal government had done for failing en=
terprises such as Long-Term Capital Management, Chrysler Corp. and Lockheed=
 Corp.=20
Enron was different. Many experts on government-business relations say the =
company's relationship with the Bush administration made aiding it a potent=
ial political embarrassment. But others say the administration decided not =
to help the company because its failure did not threaten widespread damage =
to financial or energy markets and the economy as a whole.=20
Yet the fact that Enron's failing condition went on without public disclosu=
re for so long--even as high government officials were apprised of it--puzz=
led legal experts.=20
"I'd be surprised if they [Treasury officials] didn't call the SEC," said a=
ttorney John Hanson, a specialist in bankruptcy cases for the law firm Noss=
aman Guthner Knox Elliot LLP, which has offices in four California cities, =
including Irvine and Los Angeles, and in Washington.=20
In October and early November, Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whalley made=
 a series of six to eight calls in which he asked Peter Fisher, Treasury un=
dersecretary for domestic finance, to help secure loans from the company's =
bankers. Fisher refused, and on Nov. 8 Enron Chairman and Chief Executive K=
enneth L. Lay telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to tell him of =
Enron's dire financial situation.=20
That same day, Enron filed documents with the SEC revising its financial st=
atements back to 1997, evaporating $600 million in nonexistent profits and =
accelerating its stock plunge.=20
Although the administration's accounts of what happened are incomplete, it =
appears that neither Fisher nor O'Neill asked the SEC to demand that Lay te=
ll stakeholders and investors about the firm's deteriorating condition, obs=
ervers note. "I cannot comprehend why they did not inform [SEC Chairman Har=
vey] Pitt," said a onetime lawyer for the federal government who asked for =
anonymity because he still does business with the government.=20
"My counsel would have been to call Lay back and request him to do full dis=
closure," said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the SEC.=20
In the 1998 case of Long-Term Capital Management, a foundering investment f=
irm kept out of bankruptcy by a government-assisted infusion of capital, Fe=
deral Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan communicated constantly with then-SEC=
 Chairman Arthur Levitt and with the Treasury Department and the Commodity =
Futures Trading Commission, Turner said.=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) charged last week that Bush administra=
tion officials had "done nothing to mitigate the harm of the Enron bankrupt=
cy to thousands of its employees and shareholders." In response, White Hous=
e Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Enron officials had not provided the T=
reasury officials with any information that was not already in the general =
news.=20
Stock Rose After Earnings Revision Filed=20
But the record of SEC filings and public statements by Enron officials show=
s that Lay and other company officials maintained publicly that the company=
's energy trading business was strong and that it had the financial wherewi=
thal to survive the crisis even as some of the firm's difficulties became e=
vident in October and November.=20
The company reported a $618-million loss and a reduction in its shareholder=
s' equity Oct. 16, and Nov. 8 it revised its earnings for the previous four=
 years, although without public reference to its overwhelming debts or the =
financial peril it was telling Treasury officials about. In fact, Enron sto=
ck rose almost 20% in the four days after the Nov. 8 disclosures as investm=
ent analysts anticipated its proposed merger with Dynegy Inc.--later cancel=
ed--and said most of Enron's troubles were behind it.=20
Because the precise dates of Whalley's phone calls to Fisher were not relea=
sed, it cannot be determined how much shareholder value was lost between th=
e time Fisher was first contacted and Enron stock plummeted (it dropped fro=
m $33.84 a share on Oct. 16 to $8.41 on Nov. 8). But company shareholders a=
nd employees lost more than $18 billion of market value in that decline.=20
From that point, Enron stock fluctuated until the end of November, when its=
 bonds were reduced to junk status, and the firm filed Dec. 2 for protectio=
n from creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Enron stock closed Friday at =
67.5 cents a share.=20
Legal experts are not certain whether officials have a responsibility to di=
sclose information received in communications from private industry. "It's =
a tough question," said Turner, the former SEC accountant. "Officials can h=
ave confidential communications."=20
In the case of Enron "the courts will decide" whether government officials =
should have pushed for public disclosure, said William Bagley, a lawyer in =
private practice who in 1974 served as the first commissioner of the Commod=
ity Futures Trading Commission.=20
Matters of disclosure are only one part of the mounting debate concerning E=
nron's collapse. Some say the Enron-Treasury discussions alone raise seriou=
s questions.=20
"It's a terrible precedent for the rest of the economy if major companies f=
eel like they have access to the highest levels of government and feel comf=
ortable asking the government to intervene in their private negotiations," =
said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago G=
raduate School of Business. Goolsbee termed the Enron phone calls "borderli=
ne unethical."=20
But Alice Rivlin, a former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and a Cli=
nton administration budget director, saw a responsibility for officials to =
communicate.=20
"When a really big company is in really big trouble, having the CEO call to=
 say 'You ought to know what's going on' is a good thing," Rivlin said. "If=
 they had gone down and not said anything, that wouldn't have been responsi=
ble. I think the reaction of the Treasury secretary, if that had happened, =
would have been, 'Why didn't somebody tell me?' "=20
Some See Secrecy as Part of Problem=20
Others see Enron's secrecy in all things as part of the firm's difficulties=
. "There's a front door in government and a back door, and most of these co=
ntacts were through the back door, hidden from public scrutiny," said Paul =
C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a no=
npartisan Washington think tank.=20
More appropriate, Light said, would have been public appeals by Enron for b=
ailout legislation, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission "or=
 other above-board, in-the-sunshine approaches for help."=20
But many experts see Enron's political influence as a reason for its failur=
e to get a bailout. Politically, the Bush administration already had been o=
n the defensive for taking massive contributions from Enron, which in Calif=
ornia had been pilloried for allegedly trying to gouge the public during th=
e energy crisis.=20
But Edward Muller, an investor in energy projects and former president of E=
dison Mission Energy, said Bush administration energy officials did not rel=
y on political considerations in their decisions to withhold help. "They si=
mply decided that a bankruptcy of Enron would not disrupt energy or financi=
al markets or the economy," said Muller, who was in touch with officials la=
st fall in connection with his own business interests.=20
Enron, despite generating massive revenues, did not employ hundreds of thou=
sands of workers, as did Chrysler in the 1980s or Lockheed in the 1970s. An=
d unlike Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s, its collapse did not th=
reaten banks across the country and the world.=20
Indeed, Enron's bankruptcy did not greatly affect prices for electricity an=
d natural gas, nor did it disrupt markets that trade in those commodities. =
One effect of Enron's bankruptcy, energy analysts said, has been to make ba=
nkers and financial institutions more cautious about lending and investing =
in power companies. But such caution typically follows any publicized bankr=
uptcy.=20
In any case, lawyer Bagley explained, federal bailouts are not easy to do. =
"There is no institutional structure, so it takes extraordinary action by C=
ongress--as in Chrysler or Lockheed." (In 1971, Congress narrowly voted spe=
cial financing to save the aerospace firm from bankruptcy after an unwise i=
nvestment in building a commercial airliner.)=20
Long-Term Capital was saved by emergency bank financing, but that was organ=
ized by the Federal Reserve. Enron could have been "rescued" by a similar i=
nfusion of capital, Bagley noted. "But where would the capital come from? T=
he Bush administration would have had to seek congressional action for Enro=
n." And given Enron's closeness to the White House, such an effort may well=
 have raised political difficulties too great to surmount.=20

Interview With John Dingell, Tom Davis
Tony Snow, Brit Hume

01/13/2002
Fox News: Fox News Sunday
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

SNOW: Continuing our discussion of the Enron collapse, we welcome two key p=
layers from the House of Representatives: Democrat John Dingell, ranking me=
mber of the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and Republican Tom Davis, =
chairman of his party's National Congressional Committee.=20
Also here with questions, Brit Hume, Washington managing editor of Fox News=
.
Representative Dingell, based on what you've seen so far, is there any case=
 for political hanky panky so far in Enron?=20
REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's too early to say. I think wha=
t we have to do is have a thorough investigation, get all the facts, and th=
en make the necessary judgment.=20
Certainly Enron's behavior, Andersen's behavior, have raised questions. And=
 certainly the fact that the administration would not reveal the matters th=
at went on with regard to the vice president's panel on energy and Enron's =
part in it raises some questions.=20
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS: Well, let me just ask a follow up on that if I can, Co=
ngressman. What link do you see between the discussions the administration =
had on energy policy and the financial collapse of this company? Is there a=
ny connection?=20
DINGELL: Well, there's no connection there, but there is a connection which=
 is even more important, and that is what energy policy was put.=20
Remember, Enron was pushing very, very hard to have total deregulation of e=
nergy, particularly electrical utility energy sales that had a particular e=
ffect upon California and which caused huge disasters to the people of Cali=
fornia with regard to energy. Plus...=20
HUME: Well, how many investigations are you talking about here, Congressman=
? Are you talking about one about the financial collapse of Enron, or are y=
ou talking about two, including a separate investigation of energy policy, =
California's predicament, Enron's discussion with the vice president on tha=
t matter?=20
DINGELL: All this ties together.=20
HUME: How?=20
DINGELL: Enron was busy doing many things including stripping its employees=
 of their 401(k) benefits, including possible insider trading, including fi=
ling false reports with the SEC, the 10-Ks, the 10-Qs and annual reports, a=
nd they were also tied up in a peculiar relationship with Andersen, their a=
uditor.=20
SNOW: OK, Representative Davis, what do you think? I want to get your respo=
nse to what Representative Dingell said.=20
REP. TOM DAVIS (R), VIRGINIA: First of all, I think a lot of what Represent=
ative Dingell says goes to what the Post says this morning.=20
SNOW: That's The Washington Post.=20
DAVIS: The Washington Post, it's: "Poll finds bad news for Democrats lookin=
g for a traditional mid-term election edge."=20
Of course we ought to investigate the collapse of Enron and what happened t=
o the employees and how some of the largest owners of this and the CEO were=
 able to cash out while forbidding their own employees to do that. We ought=
 to take a look at the financial accounting standards on this. We ought to =
see if new rules and regulations ought to come forward.=20
But taking a look at these overall policies, just this politics, there's ab=
solutely no evidence to date that the administration did anything improperl=
y. And we know that Enron gave a lot of money to a lot of players in Washin=
gton on both sides.=20
SNOW: Carl Levin, who is going to be running an investigation on the Senate=
 side, has said on another broadcast that he thinks that Ken Lay, in fact, =
was asking over the phone for inappropriate favors from the administration.=
 Do you see any evidence of that?=20
DAVIS: Well, we know he was on the phone. We know that they had Bob Rubin, =
who was President Clinton's Cabinet secretary, call up on their behalf. And=
 we don't know all those answers yet.=20
What we do know so far is we found no indication that the administration, i=
n any way, did anything improper or answered any calls that might have come=
 forward.=20
HUME: But you are, as the head of the National Republican Congressional Com=
mittee, in the process of returning campaign contributions.=20
DAVIS: Absolutely.=20
HUME: Well, if there's nothing improper here, why return the money?=20
DAVIS: Well, I'll tell you why, because they gave $100,000 in corporate dol=
lars, it could go back and help those employees, help fund their pension pl=
ans. And, frankly, I think that is a better use of $100,000 at this point.=
=20
SNOW: Representative Dingell, you also got some money over the years from E=
nron. Did anybody at Enron try to contact you?=20
DINGELL: Well, Enron talks to everybody. And I've told them no at almost ev=
erything they've said...=20
(LAUGHTER)=20
... and that includes deregulation of electrical utility sales and things o=
f that kind.=20
SNOW: But during this period when Enron officials were contacting the treas=
ury secretary, the commerce secretary and the undersecretary of treasury, d=
id anybody call you and say, we want you to take a look into rating service=
s or we want you to give us some help?=20
DINGELL: No, they did not, and I would not have done so.=20
And by the way, Tony, they gave me $10,500, and we're going to give that mo=
ney -- I've already instructed my campaign treasurer -- to the funds that h=
ave been set up to help the employees, and I urge everybody to do the same =
thing.=20
HUME: Well, just to follow that up for a second, Tony's questions, when did=
 they contact you, how often and about what?=20
DINGELL: Well, they were usually contacting me about deregulating electrica=
l utility sales, and we always told them no.=20
HUME: When was the last time? When did that happen last?=20
DINGELL: Oh, over a period of some time, and we told them no.=20
HUME: What? Last year, last six months, last month, when?=20
DINGELL: Oh, over a long period of time. They contacted us about that. We t=
old them no. I opposed the proposal. I think it was the right thing to do.=
=20
HUME: Sounds like the $10,500 was a bad investment.=20
DINGELL: Well, if they regard it as an investment, they lost their shirt. B=
ut what we're going to do with that money is give that to the employees' fu=
nds to try and help make whole from the fact that so many of their employee=
s lost everything in the process of the collapse because Enron would not le=
t them cash out their 401(k)s.=20
HUME: Congressman Dingell, when the hearings get under way, will you be wan=
ting to have Bob Rubin among those testify about attempts to gain influence=
 or bailout for Enron?=20
DINGELL: If you watched me when I ran investigations, and I ran a lot of th=
em, and they were very, very effective, we had everybody in. And we saw to =
it that we got all the facts.=20
HUME: That would be a yes?=20
DINGELL: And that's what I want of these investigations in the Senate and t=
he House.=20
HUME: Would that be a yes then?=20
DINGELL: That means absolutely yes.=20
SNOW: Representative Davis, I've heard you talk about returning contributio=
ns, Representative Dingell talk about returning contributions. If you retur=
ned everybody's contributions, you probably would be able to save one or tw=
o of the people who worked. You've got thousands at Enron.=20
This is token help.=20
Now, is there going to be some move on Capitol Hill to make these people wh=
ole? And if so, shouldn't other people who have been the victim of bad busi=
ness practices and had their portfolios hampered, shouldn't they also expec=
t help from Capitol Hill?=20
DAVIS: Well, I don't know that they can expect a government bailout at this=
 point.=20
But, look, I agree with Congressman Dingell. We need to get to the bottom o=
f this matter. We have a criminal probe going on from the Justice Departmen=
t. I think that's appropriate.=20
But I think on Capitol Hill, we need to look at why the seventh- largest co=
rporation in America fell so quickly, why their corporate executives were c=
ashing out and their ordinary employees that had grown the company were not=
 able to do that and lost their pension funds.=20
SNOW: Is it your suspicion that corporate executives deliberately misled em=
ployees and told them everything was going to be fine, meanwhile, they cash=
ed out while the employees were left holding the bag?=20
DAVIS: That's the appearance is. I think we need to nail that down, but tha=
t is the appearance.=20
And the question then is, were they acting illegally, improperly, and do we=
 need to put in new rules and regulations to stop this in the future?=20
SNOW: Representative Dingell, getting back to the investigations, Attorney =
General John Ashcroft, who received money just last year from Enron in a fa=
iled Senate bid in Missouri, said he's going to recuse himself from the cas=
e.=20
Do you think anybody who's received money from Enron over the years should =
recuse themselves from the investigations? And that would include you.=20
DINGELL: I think there's a judgment that should be made.=20
Well, Tony, I'm just going to tell you, I've opposed Enron at every turn. A=
nd I intend to -- with regard to deregulation and questions that they regar=
d important and contacted me on, and I intend to continue that practice.=20
No, I'll give Enron an honest investigation. We'll look and see what kind o=
f rascality went on.=20
Remember, there's plenty here to look into. There's the fact that Enron, ap=
parently, made false representations in connection with their annual report=
s, their 10-Ks and their 10-Qs. They, either alone or together with their a=
ccountant, misrepresented facts. Their accountant also destroyed large volu=
mes of papers.=20
I don't think you can find anybody in the country who doesn't want to get t=
o the bottom of this. That includes me and every other member of Congress.=
=20
SNOW: Representative Davis, do you think either political party is going to=
 be able to gain political advantage out of this Enron scandal?=20
DAVIS: Well, right now there is absolutely no evidence that anyone in elect=
ed office or in the administration acted improperly. So at this point, I do=
n't see any advantage. I see people -- they're jockeying for it, when you l=
ook at the polls and how these have been used in the past. But I can assure=
 you, we'll have a fair hearing on the House side.=20
SNOW: All right, Representative Dingell, very quickly, either side getting =
an advantage? We'll get 10 seconds.=20
DINGELL: Well, Tony, I want to see a fair, thorough and complete investigat=
ion.=20
SNOW: All right.=20
DINGELL: I don't think we ought to make a partisan issue out of this. I thi=
nk we ought to get to the facts.=20
SNOW: All right. Representative Dingell, Representative Davis, thank you bo=
th.=20
Now for some viewers on the West Coast, Fox Sports and the NFL playoffs are=
 coming up. For everyone else, our panel is next. Either way, stay tuned to=

Interview With Paul O'Neill
Tony Snow

Fox News: Fox News Sunday
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

TONY SNOW, HOST: In one year Enron went from the toast of Houston to just p=
lain toast. Executives walked off with millions of dollars, employees lost =
their life savings, and accountants shredded critical papers.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The administration is deepl=
y concerned about its effects on the economy. We're also deeply concerned a=
bout its effects on the lives of our citizenry.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
SNOW: Did Enron executives break the law, bend the law or fall victim to ba=
d luck? Will any politicians take a fall? We'll ask Treasury Secretary Paul=
 O'Neill and two key congressional investigators, Representatives John Ding=
ell and Tom Davis.=20
Plus, the latest on the hunt for bin Laden and a round-up on the war agains=
t terror. And our quadra-pundit panel: Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, Fred Barnes=
 and Juan Williams.=20
This is the January 13 edition of FOX NEWS SUNDAY.=20
Good morning. We'll talk with our guests after an update on America at war.=
=20
(NEWSBREAK)=20
SNOW: The top domestic story this morning: the collapse of Enron. Not long =
ago the company was the world's largest energy trader, worth $70 billion. B=
ut last fall the company acknowledged several hundred million dollars' wort=
h of previously unreported liabilities, and its stock, already hit by a wea=
kening economy, went into free-fall from a high of more than $80 a share to=
 less than 50 cents today.=20
A company that once boasted of never having had a bad quarter now has filed=
 for the biggest bankruptcy in our nation's history. In the process, thousa=
nds of employees have seen their retirement savings vanish, while some comp=
any executives managed to sell stock then worth millions.=20
Adding to the intrigue, Arthur Andersen, the firm auditing Enron's books, c=
laimed it didn't get some important records from the company and destroyed =
thousands of other pages of documents. The administration and at least four=
 congressional committees have launched investigations, but the complex cas=
e may take years to resolve.=20
So is this a corporate scandal, a political scandal, both, neither? For ans=
wers we turn to the treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill.=20
Good morning.=20
PAUL O'NEILL, SECRETARY OF TREASURY: Good morning.=20
SNOW: Now, in October you received the first of three phone calls from Ken =
Lay, the chairman of Enron. In his first phone call to you, what did he say=
?=20
O'NEILL: He called to tell me that he thought it would be useful for our te=
chnical people to talk with his technical people to understand the complex =
derivative contracts they had, to assure ourselves that their problems were=
 not going to get translated into larger problems for the U.S. and the worl=
d capital markets.=20
SNOW: So he did not seek direct help? He didn't ask for, at least at that j=
uncture, any intervention with rating services or anything?=20
O'NEILL: Absolutely not. No, he just called me to alert me that he thought =
we ought to pay attention to the technical details.=20
SNOW: All right. And when you got that request from him, did any alarm bell=
s go off? Did you say, this is an unusual request?=20
O'NEILL: No, I didn't think it was unusual at all. I get dozens of calls fr=
om people every day, and his call wasn't unusual.=20
SNOW: So you mean corporate executives will often call and ask for your adv=
ice about technical details of their derivatives trades?=20
O'NEILL: Well, they -- well, you know, this is a very unusual case in the s=
ense that Enron's the biggest energy -- or was the biggest energy trader in=
 the world. And so, in that sense, I didn't think it was unusual.=20
You know, I think one thing that's been missing through a lot of the conver=
sation about this is a lack of understanding of what goes on in the world.=
=20
As the treasury secretary at the time that I had this call, I was working o=
n the economic stimulus bill with the leadership of Congress. I was trying =
to get the Congress to pay attention to and pass a terrorist risk insurance=
 proposal, which, unfortunately, they failed to do. I was working on pursui=
ng terrorist financing all over the world.=20
So, you know, this is three, four-minute conversation in the midst of a sea=
 of things going on in the world, and I didn't think it was unusual at all.=
=20
SNOW: So it wasn't a big deal. The following day he calls. What did he ask =
for then?=20
O'NEILL: You know, I guess I don't remember two conversations back to back.=
 You're telling me something new.=20
I think what our records show is that I had two conversations with Ken, and=
 I think the dates are the 28th of October and another one on the 8th or 9t=
h of November.=20
And, you know, the second call that I had from Ken was to tell me that they=
 were being looked at by the rating agencies. It was just a heads-up, and t=
hat was it.=20
SNOW: So, at this point, one of the questions a lot of people want to know =
is, why didn't you tell the president, why didn't anybody tell the presiden=
t at this point?=20
O'NEILL: Well, again, you know, if you put this in the context of what's go=
ing on, the president's prosecuting the war against the terrorists -- you k=
now, I have been involved in big-league events for, I don't know, most of t=
he last 40 years. I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the s=
treet and telling the president. I don't go across the street and tell the =
president every time somebody calls me.=20
SNOW: This is the seventh-largest corporation in America. When you got thos=
e phone calls, did it occur to you that Enron might very soon be bankrupt?=
=20
O'NEILL: I had no idea. You know, I had -- I frankly think what Ken told me=
 over the phone was not new news. You all had been reporting for weeks that=
 Enron had problems, that they were in trouble and the rest of that. And, y=
ou know, it's part of the reason I didn't think there was any reason for me=
 to talk to anybody else, because I thought what Ken said to me was public =
property. It was not new news.=20
SNOW: So were you surprised by the collapse of Enron's stock value?=20
O'NEILL: Well, not really. I guess, you know, I've watched lots of corporat=
ions come and go. It's an interesting fact that there are very few companie=
s that have been around for 40 or 50 years or 100 years.=20
So, you know, in the broader scheme of things, not really. Companies come a=
nd go. It's -- part of the genius of capitalism is, people get to make good=
 decisions or bad decisions, and they get to pay the consequence or to enjo=
y the fruits of their decisions. That's the way the system works.=20
SNOW: Now, a few years ago, a company called Long-Term Capital got a bailou=
t from the federal government as it was facing bankruptcy. At least one --=
=20
O'NEILL: I don't think that's...=20
SNOW: I'm sorry. Go ahead.=20
O'NEILL: I don't think that's a correct characterization. My recollection i=
s that Long-Term Capital had a problem, and the New York Fed, I think it's =
true, played a role in convening the banks that were at risk, but I don't t=
hink the federal government provided anything at all, Tony.=20
SNOW: OK. In that case...=20
O'NEILL: There was no bailout. There was no bailout.=20
SNOW: OK. Well -- and there was no requested bailout here. There was a requ=
est for perhaps some aid in intervening with Moody's, which was doing corpo=
rate ratings.=20
O'NEILL: Not to me.=20
SNOW: OK. But to people under your jurisdiction, correct?=20
O'NEILL: According to accounts that I've read in the newspapers, that's rig=
ht.=20
You know, this thing has become a subject of lots of conversation. We have =
taken what I think are prudent steps, so that I've not spent any time talki=
ng to the undersecretary about the conversations he had with other people, =
to make sure that we do this correctly.=20
You know, I think we have done the right thing. We're going to continue to =
do the right thing.=20
The president has asked me to lead a couple of different groups, to see if =
there are lessons that we should learn, and possibly change law, rules or r=
egulations to better protect individuals who have a stake in a 401(k) plan =
or a pension plan, to make sure that the people that are involved out there=
 in companies are not disadvantaged by decisions that their leaders make.=
=20
SNOW: Now, is the philosophy of this administration that, when a company ge=
ts into a bind like this, it's on its own?=20
O'NEILL: Absolutely. You know, unless there's an issue related to the compa=
ny that reaches to public responsibility, you know, in the American capital=
ist system, companies are responsible for their actions.=20
And there is a broad scheme of laws and rules and regulations that instruct=
 and tell companies what they're supposed to do. And so, of course, you kno=
w, we don't have an interest in individual companies, and that's it.=20
SNOW: So you're not talking to Peter Fisher, who's your undersecretary work=
ing on this. There seems to be almost a see-no- evil, speak-no-evil kind of=
 atmosphere. You're not talking to a guy who's working for you. You and Don=
 Evans don't talk to the president until a meeting just very recently.=20
Surely there had to be some sense in your mind that these calls were inappr=
opriate, or that there was something about them that you did not want to pa=
ss along to the president. Is that correct?=20
O'NEILL: No, it's not. I didn't think there was anything inappropriate abou=
t someone calling me to give me a heads-up that there were some technical t=
hings that we ought to pay attention to. I don't find that inappropriate. I=
t seems to me it's exactly the right discharge of my duties to make sure th=
at the public's not going to be hurt by some individual company action.=20
SNOW: Now, Henry Waxman is saying that this administration -- well, let me =
read a quote from Congressman Waxman. He's going to be conducting an invest=
igation; a lot of people are. He's making allegation about the way the Whit=
e House has handled this. We're going to get it up on the screen here prese=
ntly.=20
He said, "It is now clear that the White House had knowledge that Enron was=
 likely to collapse but did nothing to protect innocent employees and share=
holders who ultimately lost their life savings. I'm deeply troubled that th=
e White House stood by and let this happen to thousands of families."=20
Your reaction?=20
O'NEILL: My reaction is, you know, it's just amazing to me to have this kin=
d of comment. What we knew, what I knew, I think what those of us in the ad=
ministration knew was public property. Everyone knew from Enron's disclosur=
es that they were struggling. We didn't know more than that.=20
The company had a duty to inform its shareholders and its employees about t=
hings that were going on inside the company. That's not a federal governmen=
t responsibility.=20
And again, we didn't have any knowledge that wasn't general public property=
. You all in the television world and in print media were reporting on kind=
 of a day-to-day basis what was going on in Enron. I didn't know anything m=
ore than you did.=20
SNOW: So when Ken Lay e-mailed employees in August saying he thinks the bes=
t times are ahead, do you think he was being straight with his employees?=
=20
O'NEILL: Well, I don't know. You know, that's something you need to ask Ken=
 Lay. I don't know. I didn't have inside knowledge of what the company's pr=
ospects were. You know, having been a CEO, I often -- I always communicated=
 with my people what I thought was going on. And you need to ask Ken Lay wh=
at he had in his mind when he sent that e-mail.=20
SNOW: Do you think the federal government or Congress ought to do anything =
to try to make whole some of the shareholders, especially people who worked=
 for Enron who've lost their life savings, or is that just the breaks?=20
O'NEILL: Well, again the second group the president asked me to lead is to =
look and see whether the laws and rules and regulations about disclosure ar=
e appropriate and whether something's been missing in the requirements for =
disclosure, especially in these areas that are so complicated.=20
I don't know whether you've ever spent any time trying to understand the de=
rivatives business. I did, because when I was at Alcoa we ran a billion-dol=
lar, multi-billion-dollar derivatives process in the 36 countries we were i=
nvolved in around the world. And it's an enormously complicated subject.=20
The president's asked me to look at the rules and regulations and see wheth=
er we need to modify them in some way to assure that shareholders and emplo=
yees are not disadvantaged because the disclosure rules are not strong enou=
gh.=20
SNOW: Mr. Secretary, final question. I'm going to read a Fox News Opinion D=
ynamics Poll question. We asked people about their optimism about the econo=
my, whether they think things are going to get better or worse in the next =
year. And 74 percent said better; only 14 percent said worse.=20
Are they realistic or guilty of irrational exuberance?=20
O'NEILL: No, I think they're on the right track. I think -- you know, I thi=
nk the information we have so far in the data on economic performance is a =
mix but I think it's mixed toward the positive side, and I'm optimistic we'=
re going to return to a good rates of real growth.=20
SNOW: With or without a stimulus package?=20
O'NEILL: Well, the stimulus package, I still believe, would hasten the move=
ment out of a slow economic period. It would help people who were directly =
affected by the events of September 11.=20
The president said over and over again, every person who has a prospect of =
losing their job or who has lost their job, we should care about them and t=
herefore, yes, we should do the stimulus package.=20
I'm hoping the Congress will come back informed by their constituents that =
they, the constituents, want a stimulus package and that we'll finally get =
a vote in the Senate. We already passed two bills in the House. Hopefully t=
he Senate's going to be responsive, and we're going to do something in the =
next few weeks.=20
SNOW: All right. Secretary O'Neill, thanks for joining us.=20
O'NEILL: My pleasure.=20
SNOW: Up next, Congress takes a look at the Enron mess.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
BUSH: This administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron b=
ankruptcy to make sure that workers are protected.=20

White House Says it Offered Enron No Assistance

The Enron investigation is dominating Sunday's news talk shows. The big que=
stion is: What is the likely political fallout from the Enron bankruptcy?=
=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: The Enron investigation is dominating today's Su=
nday's news talk shows, along with the war in Afghanistan. The big question=
, though, what is likely economic -- what is the likely economic and politi=
cal fallout from the Enron bankruptcy. Well CNN's John King has more now fr=
om the White House. A lot of people are asking that question John.
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: A lot of people asking Kyr=
a, and the political side of these investigations will go hand in hand with=
 the exploration, not only by the Justice Department and other government a=
gencies, but by the Congress as well, is into just how Enron filed for bank=
ruptcy and did it mislead its shareholders and its employees. That is the b=
usiness side of it, if you will.=20
On the political side, members of Congress want to know about contacts betw=
een senior Enron officials and senior Bush administration officials. There =
are political connections, the company is a prolific donor for political ca=
mpaigns, not only the Republicans, the Democrats as well. Also some persona=
l relationships between the president and the CEO of Enron, and as well as =
other senior Bush administration officials who have long-standing relations=
hips with the company and its senior officials.=20
Two Cabinet secretaries, Don Evans at Commerce, Paul O'Neill at Treasury, o=
ut making the round of the talk shows again today. They did receive a phone=
 call from the Enron CEO, Ken Lay, late last year before the company filed =
for bankruptcy, in which at least in the Evans conversation, Secretary Evan=
s says Ken Lay asked for help. Now two ways to get into trouble in a contro=
versy like this -- one is to do something hard and the Bush administration =
officials insist when Enron asked for help, the answer was no, and they say=
 any investigation will show that, that they did not help them at all.=20
But another way you can get in trouble and at least extend the political co=
ntroversy is if the answers don't match up. Here at the White House on Thur=
sday, the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was asked if Secretary =
Evans or Secretary O'Neill passed on word to anyone here at the White House=
 -- the president or any other senior officials that Ken Lay had called the=
m and asked for help. Ari Fleischer said not that he was aware of, that it =
was not passed on to the best of his knowledge. Today discussing this on "M=
eet The Press", Secretary Evans said he did indeed pass word on to the Whit=
e House.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DON EVANS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: I was in the White House, a lot more started=
 to happen with respect to Enron. They announced the Dynegy merger. Shortly=
 after that, there was some question whether or not the Dynegy merger would=
 make or not. And so with all the ongoing and continuing activity at Enron =
and Dynegy, I thought the White House ought to know. I was over there one d=
ay, and I stepped into Andy Card's office and told him I received his call,=
 he simply listened to me and said thank you very much.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Evans said that Andy Card told him he did not pass that information o=
nto President Bush. Again, though, members of Congress, especially the Demo=
crats want more details of any and all contacts between the administration =
and Enron. Any regulatory decisions or other decisions made by the administ=
ration that might have benefited Enron and so you have not a conflicting an=
swer, but certainly new information today from Secretary Evans that he did =
pass some information onto the White House.=20
You can be sure that will be another request as Democrats in Congress as th=
e investigations of the political side of all of this go hand in hand with =
the criminal investigations and other regulatory investigations into just w=
hat happened at Enron -- Kyra.=20
PHILLIPS: John King, live at the White House. Thanks so much.=20

Enron-White House Relationship Continues Causing Controversy

 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

More questions and few answers this morning as the investigation of fallen =
energy giant, Enron, shifts into high gear. A high-ranking Democrat has ask=
ed some tough questions from Enron CEO.=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: More questions and few answers this morning as t=
he investigation of fallen energy giant, Enron, shifts into high gear. A hi=
gh-ranking Democrat has asked some tough questions from Enron CEO.
Congressman Henry Waxman has asked Kenneth Lay to explain two upbeat e-mail=
s sent to employees that talked up the company's future, even though it was=
 sliding toward bankruptcy. Waxman also wants to know why Enron barred work=
ers from selling their Enron stock after the company acknowledged its finan=
cial problems. Enron also had some links to the Bush administration.=20
And CNN's John King is at the White House with more on this. John, how worr=
ied is the Bush administration about this investigation?=20
JOHN KING, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kyra, Bush administration o=
fficials say they have absolutely nothing to hide, but they also acknowledg=
e that this is likely to become a political question -- some would say cont=
roversy -- for weeks, if not months.=20
The administration initially reacted a bit defensively to all these questio=
ns about contacts between senior Enron officials and senior Bush administra=
tion officials. Ken Lay, the CEO, is a long-time Bush family friend, not on=
ly of the president, but also of his father. He's close to the vice preside=
nt. Many officials in the administration actually have worked as consultant=
s for Enron. So there are a great deal of questions about contacts.=20
But you will see today, the Sunday news shows, you'll see the Commerce secr=
etary, the secretary of the Treasury out talking publicly. They've been on =
CNN over the weekend, and as early as Friday and Thursday as well. The admi=
nistration saying that the bottom line will be at the end of all these inve=
stigations, that a major political contributor of the president called and =
asked for help and the answer was no.=20
That won't satisfy people in Congress initially. You mentioned Henry Waxman=
, a key Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. He wants to know=
 everything about the administration's contacts with Enron. He wants to kno=
w if in any way once they became aware in the administration of Enron's fin=
ancial difficulties, did they do anything to try to help.=20
There's a provision in what the president wanted in a stimulus package that=
 you could say would have helped Enron. It would have helped a lot of compa=
nies, but would have helped Enron specifically as well. So Congress will as=
k a lot of questions about this, but the Bush administration says in the en=
d though the answer will be, and they insist the answer will be, that a fri=
end of the president asked for help and the answer was no.=20
PHILLIPS: So the focus will be on whether the company deliberately lied abo=
ut its financial position?=20
KING: That is one of the questions, and then there's a subplot to that. One=
 of the things Congressman Waxman wants to know is, if the secretary of the=
 Treasury and if the secretary of Commerce knew that Enron was in trouble a=
nd that Enron was saying different things in public, did they have a respon=
sibility to put other government agencies on alert. Did they have a respons=
ibility to pressure the company to be more candid and honest.=20
Bush administration officials say when those conversations took place betwe=
en cabinet members and senior Enron officials, that there was public knowle=
dge of the company's troubles, perhaps not detailed public knowledge, but t=
hat Enron was already on record.=20
But one of the things you mentioned in the lead-in, Henry Waxman wants to k=
now, why was Ken Lay writing optimistic e-mails to company employees at aro=
und the time he was calling Bush administration officials, there's a month =
or so difference, around the time he was calling them and saying the compan=
y was in trouble.=20
In one of those e-mails he said he wants to know if --- Henry Waxman says t=
o Ken Lay, if you sent those e-mails, then "they create the appearance that=
 you misled Enron employees about the value of their investments." And of c=
ourse, it was critical because many Enron employees were putting their savi=
ngs into the company's 401(k) plan and buying Enron stock in doing so.=20
PHILLIPS: Well, John, since we've been talking about the subject matter, I =
continue to get bombarded with e-mail. I just want to sneak one in here, if=
 you don't mind.=20
KING: Not at all.=20
PHILLIPS: This one comes from John. He says, "if these same set of circumst=
ances had occurred during the Clinton Administration, the outcry from the R=
epublicans and the various news media would have been so deafening that imp=
eachment proceedings would be the talk of D.C. by now. Why is the reaction =
to George W. Bush administration indiscretion so muted, compared with Clint=
on-era political scandals?"=20
KING: Well, I'd have to say I would, I guess disagree somewhat with the pre=
mise of the question. The inquiries are just beginning in the past few days=
. The Bush administration has launched investigations of its own. Congress =
will launch its investigations.=20
There are many committees looking into this in Congress, and as Congressman=
 Waxman is asking questions, he serves on the same committee as Congressman=
 Dan Burton, who is the chairman of that committee, who is the Republican t=
hat many Clinton Administration officials came to, I'll use the word dislik=
e. They might use a stronger term. There will be some to and fro here. Ther=
e's a great deal of media inquiry into this, media inquiry into the contact=
s between Bush administration officials.=20
As of this moment, Sunday morning here in Washington, there is no evidence =
that anyone in the Bush administration did anything to help this company, b=
ut there are a lot of questions. We're asking them at CNN. Others are askin=
g them in the news media. Congress is asking them as well.=20
And you can be sure in the weeks and months ahead, Congress will be asking =
for any and all documentation of contacts between the company and the admin=
istration.=20
And if any evidence surfaces that the administration did help the company, =
did reach out to help the company or in any way help hide information that =
should have been put in the public domain, then you can be certain those in=
vestigations will intensify.=20
PHILLIPS: John King, great to see you on this Sunday. Thanks so much.=20

Interview: Bennett Roth and David Ivanovich discuss the Enron debacle and h=
ow it might affect the Bush administration

01/13/2002
NPR: Weekend Edition - Sunday
Copyright 2002 National Public Radio, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

LIANE HANSEN, host: From NPR News in Washington, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I=
'm Liane Hansen.=20
Executives and directors of the Enron Corporation sold more than $1 billion=
 worth of the company's stock just before the energy trading company fell i=
nto bankruptcy last year, according to a report in today's editions of The =
New York Times. The Times reports that company chairman Ken Lay sold 1.8 mi=
llion shares of Enron stock between early 1999 and July 2001. But last Augu=
st in two e-mail messages to Enron employees, Lay boasted that Enron's perf=
ormance was robust and called the company the, quote, "finest organization =
in American business today."
In our studio this morning are two Washington-based reporters for the Houst=
on Chronicle who have been covering the Enron story. David Ivanovich report=
s on business and Bennett Roth covers the White House.=20
Good morning and welcome to you both. Thanks for coming in.=20
Mr. BENNETT ROTH (Houston Chronicle): Good morning.=20
HANSEN: David, let's start with you and these reports of possible insider t=
rading and potentially misleading e-mails from Ken Lay to Enron employees. =
What do you make of these reports?=20
Mr. DAVID IVANOVICH (Houston Chronicle): Well, it's certainly interesting t=
o see the extent of the insider trades in light of the company's collapse. =
I'm not surprised that the executives would have been talking up the compan=
y. Executives tend to do that. But what's so controversial about this, of c=
ourse, is that so many of the rank-and-file employees at Enron had Enron sh=
ares locked in their 401(k) plan, and were unable to sell their shares at t=
he crucial point when the stock was nose-diving.=20
HANSEN: So the executives were able to get--sell their stocks and the emplo=
yees were unable to get into their retirement accounts. What about the acco=
unting firm of Arthur Andersen? It disclosed this past week that it had des=
troyed documents relating to Enron's finances. Is that going to have an eff=
ect--what effect would it have on any investigation?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Oh, sure, I think that it really puts the limelight on Ander=
sen. On Friday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been inv=
estigating the Enron debacle vigorously, told the accounting firm that they=
 want to see the personal files of six partners who were looking in the Enr=
on case, and they want those documents by Monday.=20
HANSEN: Bennett Roth, Enron, and particularly Ken Lay, have long connection=
s, close connections with President Bush and members of his administration.=
 The president seemed to be distancing himself from Enron's troubles this p=
ast week. How close can you tell us are those ties?=20
Mr. ROTH: Well, they certainly go way back to Bush's father, who appointed =
Ken Lay to help run the economic summit in 1990 and the Republican conventi=
on in 1992 in Houston. Ken Lay and Enron have been Bush's most generous ben=
efactor over the year, giving him somewhat over a $1/2 million. And, you kn=
ow, when Bush was governor, there's this correspondence between the two men=
 in which Governor Bush wished Ken Lay happy 55th birthday, and Ken Lay wro=
te a letter, you know, talking about Bush's knee surgery. So I mean, there =
certainly has been a long relationship between them.=20
But certainly, Bush has done his best this week to distance himself, someho=
w suggesting that he inherited Ken Lay from Ann Richards, the former govern=
or, who appointed Bush to a business board. However, it appears to be a lit=
tle bit of a stretch there. Yes, indeed, Richards did appoint him to the bo=
ard, but Lay has said himself that he supported Bush in the 1994 gubernator=
ial race against Richards, and Enron and Bush actually gave Bush more money=
 than Richards.=20
HANSEN: Hmm. But Enron executives put out some feelers to the Bush administ=
ration. They wanted to help get some loans to forestall the bankruptcy, but=
 there's no indication the administration actually followed through. So wha=
t do you think we're seeing here? Is it just a potentially embarrassing foo=
tnote, or is a bigger problem looming for the administration?=20
Mr. ROTH: Well, we really don't know yet. I mean, this information has been=
 dribbling out. A month ago, it appeared that--I mean, from the Bush admini=
stration, there'd been no contacts, and all of a sudden this week we find t=
here's all these contacts, and much of it really depends on the congression=
al investigations, the Justice Department investigation, and this could go =
on. Now right now it's a distraction, and Bush would like to talk about the=
 economy, the war and other things, and this week ended up talking about En=
ron, and that's certainly a political minus. But it really remains to be se=
en. But there's certainly a lot more questions out there.=20
HANSEN: David, a lot more questions out there, I'm sure.=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: There certainly are. We have questions that--the congression=
al panels are all looking into this. We have so many members of Congress th=
at are now calling for investigations, it's hard to keep track of how many =
hearings and how many subpoenas have been sent out.=20
HANSEN: But there have also been members of the Bush administration that ha=
ve had to recuse themselves from involvement in this investigation, and Enr=
on has also made contributions to Democrats over the years. So how might th=
is affect the congressional investigation?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Well, you have so many members who don't know what to say ab=
out Enron right now. They--some want to speak up; some are afraid to. Most =
of the Enron money did go to Republicans, but there are a large number of D=
emocrats on the Hill that received money, as well.=20
HANSEN: Do you really think it's just going to be a distraction for the Bus=
h administration?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Oh, I don't know. I think that they're panicking right now. =
It's interesting to see their reaction. I don't think that they're reacting=
 in a calm manner about this at this time.=20
HANSEN: And, briefly, Bennett, what do you think, just a distraction or som=
ething more?=20
Mr. ROTH: Oh, I--it could be more than that. And I agree with David. The wa=
y they're reacting makes you somehow think that maybe there's more there. I=
 mean, why would they be so eager to distance themselves from Enron and so =
eager to point to the Democrats right now. I mean, they certainly are worri=
ed about this.=20
HANSEN: Houston Chronicle correspondents Bennett Roth and David Ivanovich. =
Thank you both for coming in this morning.=20
Mr. ROTH: Thank you.

CNN: Sunday Morning
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House,=
 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

Michael Weisskozpf of "TIME" magazine discusses the Enron collapse.=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: Right now four Congressional committees are look=
ing into what went on at Enron before the company filed for the largest ban=
kruptcy in history. And, too, we wanted to point out that more than 250 law=
makers on Capitol Hill received campaign contributions from Enron.
"TIME" magazine's Senior Correspondent Michael Weisskozpf joins us now from=
 Washington to further discuss the political fallout from this bankruptcy a=
nd the investigations.=20
Good to see you, Michael.=20
MICHAEL WEISSKOZPF, "TIME" MAGAZINE: Good to be here.=20
PHILLIPS: Well, we received a number of e-mails from viewers on this subjec=
t matter. Remember yesterday, actually, we did a reporter's notebook talkin=
g about the subject matter. And if you don't mind, can I just read some of =
these e-mails to you and have you respond to them?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Please.=20
PHILLIPS: OK. This one comes from Jean. It's one of the first ones -- we go=
t a couple hundred of these actually. "I'm a stock investor that still owns=
 my Enron shares. What will happen to the stockholder's shares in the Enron=
 debacle?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: There are shareholder suits ongoing now, and most of their argu=
ments is directed against the insider trading by 29 top Enron executives wh=
o unloaded about $1 billion worth of shares before they dropped.=20
PHILLIPS: Now, a lot of people have been talking about this situation as th=
e next -- next White Water. Do you think that's going a little too far?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Well, certainly, the administration has a perception problem al=
ready because of its long-standing political connections with Enron and Ken=
 Lay, its Chairman. However, any scandal needs more than that. And unless w=
e find any type of official action in this administration which favored Enr=
on, I would guess that this would have short life.=20
PHILLIPS: This question comes from Dale -- this e-mail -- the question is, =
"What kind of tax advantages did Enron reap as a result of its political ca=
mpaign contributions?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: None. Taxes are -- campaign contributions are not tax deductibl=
e.=20
PHILLIPS: Now, Enron executives gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in po=
litical contributions. From your perspective, as a correspondent covering t=
his story, does it appear that this was a company that gave money to get wh=
at they wanted from the government? Do you think there was a favor exchange=
 here?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Corporations are not charitable when it comes to political care=
ers. They all have some motivation. However, even the wiliest of corporate =
executives realize those contributions only take you so far. It probably on=
ly gets you an audience, which is a great deal more than the ordinary Ameri=
can gets. But an opportunity to put your argument to decision-makers, that'=
s what they got.=20
PHILLIPS: Michael, another e-mail. This one comes from Kevin. "As a laymen =
to the inner workings of the legal system, I don't quite understand the del=
ay in bringing Enron executives to justice. They clearly violated the law a=
nd misrepresented the company's financial standings to their workers and th=
e world. What kind of outcome can the American people expect in this case, =
and when?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: That's really the job of these investigating committees in Cong=
ress; also, the Justice Department and the SEC. It must be proven that comp=
any executives were aware of misleading the public while they were hiding l=
osses. You need to show more than action, you have to show a kind of conspi=
racy behind it.=20
PHILLIPS: Michael Weisskozpf, "TIME" magazine. I enjoy your articles. We'll=
 definitely be following these hearings. No doubt, this is not going to go =
away for a while. Michael, thanks for being with us early on this Sunday.=
=20
WEISSKOZPF: A pleasure.=20

Enron Collapse Brings Bush Administration Under Scrutiny
Carol Lin, John King

The Enron collapse continues to reverberate in Washington. Top Bush adminis=
tration officials today appeared on Sunday news programs to shed more light=
 on their contacts with the energy giant.=20
CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: The Enron collapse continues to reverberate in Washi=
ngton. Top Bush administration officials today appeared on Sunday news prog=
rams to shed more light on their contacts with the energy giant.
CNN senior White House correspondent John King joins us now with more -- Jo=
hn.=20
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you Carol.=
=20
We learned more about those contact today. We also saw a shift, if you will=
, in the Democratic focus in its criticism of the Bush administration for i=
ts dealing with Enron before Enron filed for bankruptcy.=20
One Democratic criticism is two secretaries in the Bush Cabinet -- Don Evan=
s in Commerce, Paul O'Neill at Treasury -- had phone calls from the top off=
icial at Enron, the CEO and the Chairman Ken Lay in the weeks prior to Enro=
n's filing bankruptcy. Many Democrats say Secretary Evans and O'Neill had a=
 responsibility to give a public warning so that shareholders and employees=
 at the company who were continuing to buy the stock had some indication th=
e company's finances were headed south.=20
Secretaries O'Neill and Evans dismissing that today, saying they were told =
nothing by Ken Lay that wasn't available in the public domain. Treasury Sec=
retary Paul O'Neill says yes, he had two conversation with Ken Lay, but he =
considered them routine; and he says there was no reason at all to tell the=
 president.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
PAUL O'NEILL, TREASURY SECRETARY: Well again, you know, if you put this in =
the context of what's going on -- the president's prosecuting a war against=
 the terrorists. You know, I have been involved in big league events for, I=
 don't know, most of the last 40 years. I didn't think this was worthy of m=
e running across the street and telling the president. I don't go across th=
e street and tell the president every time somebody calls me.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Secretary Evans said today that Ken Lay did ask for his help, but tha=
t he refused and decline to intervene. Secretary Evans also disclosed that =
several weeks after that phone call he did tell the White House Chief of St=
aff Andy Card. He says Andy Card did not tell the president; that, in fact,=
 that the president learned about all these phone calls from Ken Lay to the=
 members of his Cabinet just last Thursday, a full two months after the fac=
t.=20
As all this plays out, four committees in Congress looking into it. Senator=
 Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential candidat=
e in the last election, is the chairman of one. He says Democrats have many=
 questions of the administration, but that so far he sees no evidence of an=
y wrongdoing.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: I have not seen any evidence up to =
this time that officials of the Bush administration acted improperly with r=
egard to Enron. In fact, based on the stories that are being told, I'd say =
that the Cabinet members in the Bush administration who were called by Enro=
n executives for help as the company was about to go into bankruptcy acted =
properly by not giving any help.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Still, other Democrats say they want men many more details of any and=
 all administration dealings with Enron -- not just in the weeks before its=
 bankruptcy. Democrats want to know if the administration made any regulato=
ry or other policy decisions that could have benefited the company once its=
 top officials here in the administration found out that Enron was in troub=
le.=20
Bush officials saying they will cooperate with those congressional investig=
ations and, indeed, are investigating the company from the administration's=
 standpoint. They say in the end it will be proven the administration did n=
othing wrong.=20
But again Carol, Democrats have questions. The political side of this inqui=
ry could go on for weeks, if not months.=20
LIN: All unfolding as we speak. Thank you very much. John King reporting li=
ve from the White House tonight.=20

Cabinet members say they didn't inform Bush about Enron calls for help
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer

01/13/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Two Bush cabinet members said Sunday they never considere=
d intervening in Enron's spiral toward bankruptcy, nor informed President B=
ush of requests for help from the fallen energy giant.=20
"Companies come and go. It's ... part of the genius of capitalism," said Tr=
easury Secretary Paul O'Neill, when asked if he was surprised at the sudden=
 collapse of Enron. The company's failure has left the one-time energy trad=
ing behemoth's stock virtually worthless and thousands of workers' pension =
funds in disarray.
Last fall, a month before Enron declared bankruptcy, O'Neill received two t=
elephone calls from Enron's chief executive, Kenneth Lay. Lay also called C=
ommerce Secretary Don Evans at the time, reaching out for help to harness t=
he energy company's financial slide.=20
O'Neill's view of Enron's collapse was characterized as "cold-blooded" and =
reflective of "the 18th century, but not the 21st century" by Sen. Joseph L=
ieberman, D-Conn., whose Committee on Governmental Affairs is leading Senat=
e investigations into the Enron debacle.=20
Separately, Lieberman said that an internal Arthur Andersen LLP memo on Oct=
. 12 directing that all but basic Enron working papers be destroyed "raises=
 very serious questions about whether obstruction of justice occurred."=20
Andersen this past week revealed that Enron documents had been destroyed. B=
ut Lieberman said most troubling was that the memo, disclosed in a report i=
n Time magazine, "was specifically about Enron" and not a general directive=
 to clean out files. Congressional investigators want to find out why Ander=
sen did not raise flags about Enron's business practices.=20
Andersen, in a statement Sunday, acknowledged "there were internal communic=
ations that raise questions" about the handling of Enron documents and that=
 the company "is committed to getting the facts and taking appropriate acti=
ons in the Enron matter." The statement said it would be inappropriate to c=
omment further on the Time magazine report.=20
Lieberman and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on CBS' "Face the Nation" the=
 administration may have been right in not intervening to try to save Enron=
. But they said the government's response - as well as earlier federal moni=
toring of its business practices - may have been hampered by the energy com=
pany's freewheeling flow of campaign contributions.=20
"We're all tainted by the millions and millions of dollars that were contri=
buted by Enron executives, which ... creates the appearance of impropriety,=
" said McCain, a longtime voice for campaign finance reform. McCain acknowl=
edged getting $9,500 in Enron contributions in two Senate campaigns.=20
Lieberman, who said he received $1,000 from Enron in his 1994 Senate campai=
gn, said one focus of his committee's investigation will be "whether any of=
 the influence" from Enron money affected the administration's handling of =
the Enron collapse, or oversight by federal agencies.=20
"I don't feel at all compromised," added Lieberman, referring to his commit=
tee's investigation.=20
Since 1990, Enron and its employees contributed $5.77 million to political =
campaigns, about three-fourths of it to GOP candidates. About half of the m=
oney was spent in the 2000 election, with President Bush a major beneficiar=
y.=20
O'Neill and Evans said Sunday that while they received calls from Lay in la=
te October and early November, they dismissed any suggestion of intervening=
 to help the company.=20
Evans said that Lay was looking "for all the possible ways that he could st=
abilize his company" and asked that Evans consider contacting credit rating=
 agencies. "I considered it and said, 'Thank you for the call,"' Evans said=
 on NBC's "Meet the Press."=20
O'Neill said that Lay, in a call of three or four minutes, "asked me for no=
thing." But O'Neill acknowledged that during one conversation Lay said Enro=
n's ability to sustain its credit rating "was a critical aspect" of keeping=
 a merger with rival Dynegy on track. The merger later fell apart.=20
The Treasury Department has acknowledged that, around the same time in late=
 October and early November, another Enron executive repeatedly contacted P=
eter Fisher, a Treasury undersecretary, trying to get the government to enc=
ourage banks to extend credit to the struggling company.=20
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., whose Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee ha=
s issued 51 subpoenas in connection with its Enron investigation, said Sund=
ay on ABC, "I have no doubt that they were asking for the government to tak=
e action."=20
But an Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said the calls "were informational" an=
d "not about trying to improve our credit rating."=20
Neither O'Neill nor Evans said they informed President Bush of the telephon=
e calls. But Evans said he frequently discussed Enron's situation during ge=
neral meetings with the president in November and December.=20
The tone of those conversations was "how sad it was to see what was happeni=
ng to that once great company," Evans said on NBC.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2.=20
O'Neill said his concerns involving Enron were over the possible impact on =
U.S. and global capital markets, but he was assured by Fisher that there we=
ren't going to be problems in that area. O'Neill said that at the time of t=
he calls he was deeply involved in pushing the president's stimulus package=
 in Congress, pursuing the financial trail of terrorists and dealing with o=
ther issues of greater concern.=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street (to the Whi=
te House) and telling the president," O'Neill said on "Fox News Sunday." "I=
 don't ... tell the president every time somebody calls me."=20
As to the sudden collapse of Enron and the nosedive of the company's stock,=
 O'Neill said he was not surprised.=20
"I've watched lots of corporations come and go. ... There are very few comp=
anies that have been around for 40 or 50 years. ... Companies come and go. =
It's part of the genius of capitalism.=20
"People get to make good decisions or bad decisions, and they get to pay th=
e consequences or to enjoy the fruits of their decisions. That's the way th=
e system works."

O'Neill - I did not discuss Enron case with subordinates.

01/13/2002
EFE News Service
(c) 2002 Distributed via COMTEX News

Washington, Jan 13, 2002 (EFE via COMTEX) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'=
Neill said Sunday he never spoke to his subordinates about the Enron case a=
nd did not consider his conversations with executives of the now-bankrupt e=
nergy trader to be unusual.=20
During an appearance on the "Fox News Sunday" television program, O'Neill s=
aid he did not mention telephone calls from Enron president and executive d=
irector Kenneth Lay to his subordinates in the Treasury Department to ensur=
e that he acted appropriately.
Likewise, O'Neill said he did not consider it unusual that Lay called him o=
n a couple of occasions before Enron declared bankruptcy.=20
O'Neill said Lay did not ask for help and that the conversations on Oct. 28=
 and Nov. 8 or 9 "didn't last more than three or four minutes."=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling=
 the president ... I frankly think what Ken told me over the phone was not =
new news. You all had been reporting for weeks that Enron had problems, tha=
t they were in trouble," O'Neill said.=20
The Justice Department and four congressional committees are investigating =
the bankruptcy of Houston-based Enron, a company whose executives were larg=
e contributors to Republican candidates and President Bush, as well as many=
 Democratic candidates.=20

Enron `gift' to Democrats for Dabhol project?
By Sridhar Krishnaswami.

(c) 2002 Katsuri & Sons Ltd

WASHINGTON, JAN. 12. Enron Corporation, which is becoming a major embarrass=
ment for and liability to the Republican Party and the administration in an=
 election year, is said to have given $100,000 to the Democratic Party when=
 the $3-billion deal with India was being clinched.=20
According to a media report, the Enron Corporation had discussed the power =
plant proposal with the then President, Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, Thom=
as "Mack" McLarty in 1995 and 1996; and the White House continually monitor=
ed the India Dabhol Project through the American Embassy. And in 1996, four=
 days before New Delhi approved the project, the Houston Firm contributed $=
100,000 to the Democratic Party. However, Enron, according to the report, h=
as denied that its "gift" to the party was any kind of repayment for the Cl=
inton administration's attention to the project.
The controversy over the failed corporation has come to embarrass the Bush =
administration with many saying that it is now becoming the Republican vers=
ion of the Whitewater scandal that dogged the Clinton Presidency from almos=
t start to finish. The U.S. President, George W. Bush, and his senior aides=
 are maintaining that nothing improper has taken place.=20
The Houston-based firm is now the focus of a Justice Department enquiry, go=
ing into whether top Enron executives improperly shielded investors from lo=
sses and prevented the employees from selling billions of dollars of stocks=
 which were plummeting. Many Republican and Democratic law-makers also want=
 to know if Enron, with ties to the Grand old Party, sought any favours fro=
m the Bush administration.

United News of India GUHAGAR (Maharashtra). Jan. 13. - As the Centre and th=

er disregard for the need to find ways to re-open the Dabhol Power Company,=
 a sizeable section of the people rendered jobless by the closure of the 2,=
184-MW Dabhol power plant has taken to crime.=20
Villagers in this coastal region of Ratnagiri district resplendent with sce=
nic beauty are in real dire straits. In a rare consensus, all villagers des=
ire the re-opening of the plant at the earliest.
The villagers categorically state: both the Centre and the state government=
 should keep off their political differences to find ways to restart the DP=
C. "Poor farmers have lost their farms and many others their jobs," pointed=
 out a village elder, Mr Mankeshwar Gurav.=20
Significantly, with a major shift in the people's attitude, more and more v=
illagers are now joining the pro-Enron bandwagon, advocating resumption of =
the power plant.=20
According to a pro-Enron activist and former sarpanch of Anjanwel taluka, M=
r Iqbal Mastan, many villagers left their jobs in Mumbai and settled down h=
ere accepting work for lower wages. Over 3,000 people from surrounding vill=
ages were also employed in the project work and the plant. "They are now jo=
bless and it's a matter of grave concern that crime rate in the villages is=
 picking up," he observed. The 68 year-old man claimed he hadn't seen not a=
 single case of crime in Anjanwel. But the closure of the plant made youths=
 engage in pilfering and stealing. Recently, eight youths of a village were=
 arrested for stealing copper rods from the DPC premises.=20

AUSTRALIA: Enron Australia book wind-up moves slowly.

01/13/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Enron Australia administrators said on Monday=
 that a wind-up up the group's electricity and weather derivatives book wou=
ld be a slow process following the rejection of bids for its sale.=20
"It is going to take quite some time for the book to be worked out just in =
terms of how all the counterparties are terminated and securing valuations =
on the books as well," administrator consultant Alan Topp told Reuters.
The Australian unit of Enron Corp appointed voluntary administrators Sims L=
ockwood in early December after its U.S. parent filed for Chapter 11 bankru=
ptcy.=20
The electricity book at the start of the sales process was estimated to be =
worth about A$5 million based on the mid-point between bids and offers on t=
he forward price curve, although valuations on outstanding contracts are st=
ill to be agreed.=20
The administrators last month provided data room access for nine potential =
bidders in the electricity and weather derivatives book, but the sale did n=
ot go ahead.=20
"The offers we received were in a form that could not be accepted, and seco=
ndly we had not received a number of confirmations from counterparties that=
 they would agree to the assignment of their book in any event," Topp said.=
=20
Topp said a creditors meeting was likely to be held on January 29.=20
"There are still a number of counterparties which haven't closed out," he s=
aid.=20
Enron has been a major provider of Australian power market liquidity, holdi=
ng a 15-20 percent share of the over-the-counter market which allows genera=
tors and retailers to hedge their exposure to the volatile spot market.=20
The company was once the world's biggest trader of gas and electricity and =
other commodities. The operations, dormant since early December 2, generate=
d most of Enron's US$101 billion in revenue in 2000.=20
Topp said the sale in the U.S. of Enron Corp's trading operation to Swiss b=
ank UBS AG , announced on Friday, was not likely to affect the Australian p=
rocess.

 in December.=20
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay "was like the Pied Piper. We followed him like l=

Congressional committees as well as the Justice and Labor departments want =
to know why many senior Enron executives and board members sold their stock=
 when it was still valuable, while workers were barred from selling stock i=
n their 401(k) funds.=20
Enron says its stock price, which stood at about $80 a year ago, already wa=
s down to $13.88 when a coincidental 10-day freeze on 401(k) transactions w=
as implemented because the plan changed administrators. By the time transac=

America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Institute of Cha=

The Bush administration faces the possibility of a full-scale scandal in th=
e Enron bankruptcy. It can be dealt with quickly or drawn out painfully. Wh=
at will decide this is how fast and how thoroughly the administration comes=
 clean on all of its ties to Enron, and whether Democrats can avoid the tem=
ptation to pay back the Republicans for their long campaign against Bill Cl=
inton. White House forthrightness and Democratic restraint are the winning =
combination here.=20
It is now clear that Bush administration contacts with Enron were not confi=
ned to Vice President Dick Cheney's task force; they went deep into the Cab=
inet. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and other officials are try=
ing to spin their way out by dismissing all questions as partisan politics,=
 but the only way for the administration to clear itself is to open up its =
records, starting with the secretive energy task force.
That means minutes of meetings, phone logs, notes, e-mails, everything. Oth=
erwise, the White House will feed the perception that it is trying to cover=
 up involvement in a scandal that led to the collapse of one of the biggest=
 corporate donors to the Bush campaign--the largest corporate bankruptcy in=
 the nation's history.=20
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who received $25,000 from Enron CEO Kenneth L. La=
y a week before being defeated in the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Missouri, ha=
s acted appropriately in recusing himself from the Justice Department's cri=
minal investigation. But contacts between Enron and Treasury Secretary Paul=
 H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans also need to be explored fully=
.=20
The Treasury Department added Friday that Enron President Lawrence "Greg" W=
halley asked Undersecretary Peter R. Fisher for help in getting banks to ex=
tend more credit and that the two men spoke six or eight times in October. =
If the administration did have extensive contacts with Enron and knew that =
the company was about to collapse, why did it do nothing to protect the emp=
loyees who eventually lost their retirement savings, locked up in Enron sto=
ck? Exactly how many officials met with or had e-mail communications with E=
nron employees? Was the president aware of what his officials were doing?=
=20
Until recently, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) was almost alone in de=
manding that the administration produce records of its contacts with Enron.=
 He shrewdly avoided stepping from demands for information to allegations o=
f wrongdoing. Now that five congressional committees have issued subpoenas =
concerning Enron, other Democrats should find strength to resist the innuen=
do and partisanship that marked Republican investigations of the Clinton Wh=
ite House.=20
Rumblings are also starting, though not yet on the record, among congressio=
nal Republicans who seem as alarmed as Democrats about Enron's ties to the =
White House. When Congress reconvenes, perhaps supporters of campaign finan=
ce reform will whisper "Enron" in the ears of members who refuse to petitio=
n for a vote on the languishing reform bill.=20
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who heads the Senate Governmental Affai=
rs Committee, will need to walk a line between tough questioning and needle=
ssly heated rhetoric when he chairs the first hearing Jan. 24. The administ=
ration will do itself a favor by cooperating fully. It may well turn out th=
at there is nothing to hide. But first the administration has to open its b=
ooks on its dealings with Enron.

Change the system that gave us Enron

As one congressional aide put it last week, the Enron debacle is the "perfe=
ct storm" - a catastrophic mix of all the worst in business, government and=
 politics.=20
After the biggest bankruptcy in history, the revelations kept coming last w=
eek:
The company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, confessed to destroying Enron docum=
ents during the very period last fall when it was becoming clear they'd be =
needed to explain why Andersen had not raised the alarm over the huge energ=
y-trading firm's high-risk practices.=20
The White House acknowledged that Enron Corp.'s chairman, one of President =
Bush's biggest political contributors, had contacted two cabinet officials =
as the company was collapsing. Enron denied it was seeking favors, but one =
of those contacted, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, said Enron chairman Ke=
nneth Lay had indicated he could use government help shoring up the company=
's bond ratings. Ratings reductions are what pushed the firm into its final=
 downward spiral. Administration officials said they had given no help.=20
The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation while Attorney Gen=
eral John Ashcroft said he would not take part because he, too, had receive=
d generous Enron contributions during his Senate campaign in Missouri in 20=
00.=20
A string of congressional committees prepared for hearings, while Democrats=
 positioned themselves to exploit the Enron catastrophe in next fall's camp=
aigns.=20
It's far too soon to know all the implications of the Enron story. But what=
 is known so far is enough to point clearly to the need for change in the w=
ay business and politics are conducted in this country.=20
If it wasn't obvious before, the Enron case underscores the need for campai=
gn finance reform. President Bush may spend months trying to convince Ameri=
cans that Enron hadn't bought access and influence in his administration. T=
hat's going to be difficult, given the contacts disclosed last week and ear=
lier disclosures that Enron executives had met six times with Vice Presiden=
t Cheney during energy policy discussions last year. Enron has long been kn=
own as one of the most aggressive lobbyists in Washington.=20
Even without evidence of a quid pro quo between contributor and recipient, =
common sense tells you many contributors must believe they will get special=
 treatment, else they wouldn't spend the money. People who think they've bo=
ught protection are more likely to fudge the rules. Hence, the perceived co=
rruption in politics encourages corruption in business.=20
While much is still to be learned about the relationship between Enron and =
Arthur Andersen, it's already clear the case demonstrates the need for acco=
unting reform. Accountants are supposed to be watchdogs for shareholders an=
d the public. Too many have become lawyerlike advocates for the corporate e=
xecutives who hire them.=20
Part of the problem is the conflict of interest that has developed as accou=
nting firms have moved more heavily into corporate consulting. Many are sim=
ply afraid to jeopardize lucrative consulting deals by issuing critical aud=
its. Washington should tackle this conflict of interest by forcing these fi=
rms to divest their consulting operations.=20
Accounting rules also need to be strengthened so that reports to shareholde=
rs and regulators accurately portray earnings and risks. For years, Enron w=
as able to inflate its profits by concealing debts in a string of "off-bala=
nce-sheet" transactions. While some of this may have been done improperly, =
current rules do allow companies to hide debts and other obligations. Even =
Wall Street analysts were unable to figure out Enron's statements.=20
No one knows how many Enron-type time bombs are ticking at other companies.=
 But if the accounting rules permit deception, it's sure to take place. And=
 if the public concludes that corporate financial statements are not to be =
trusted, confidence in the stock and bond markets is sure to be undermined.=
 That's not what we need as we try to recover from a two-year stock market =
slump.=20
Finally, it's already clear that 401(k) retirement plans need major reform.=
 Thousands of Enron employees' retirement accounts were devastated when the=
 company's share price fell from $90 to less than $1. Company rules had pre=
vented most employees from selling Enron shares held in 401(k)s, even thoug=
h Enron executives were locking in fortunes by unloading shares as the comp=
any's troubles mounted.=20
Bills recently introduced in Congress would limit employees' risk by placin=
g a cap on the amount of the employer's stock that could be held in 401(k)s=
, or by giving employees the right to sell those shares.=20
While that would be an improvement, it wouldn't resolve the broader problem=
 - that investment choices in most 401(k) plans are just too limited. Parti=
cipants are left with too many eggs in too few baskets, an especially serio=
us problem if the boss offers poor investment choices.=20
There's a simple solution: 401(k)s should be changed to work like individua=
l retirement accounts, allowing participants unlimited investment choices.=
=20
Because Enron was so big - the seventh-largest U.S. corporation at its heig=
ht - it's tempting to see this mess as unique. In fact, political influence=
 peddling, accounting shenanigans, and abuse of employees and shareholders =
are widespread. Perhaps the Enron case is big enough to produce some sorely=
 needed systemic change.

POLITICS EMERGE IN ENRON FALLOUT

(Copyright 2002)

WASHINGTON - It was a curious bit of scheduling in the midst of a president=
ial campaign, but George W. Bush broke away from a trip to California on Ap=
ril 7, 2000, because of a pressing bit of business back home.=20
The Texas governor had to get to Houston to attend the opening of Enron Fie=
ld, a baseball park named after the energy-trading firm headed by his frien=
d and biggest individual donor, Kenneth Lay.
The $248 million stadium had been built by Halliburton Co., the Dallas oil-=
services and construction company that was run by Dick Cheney, whom Bush la=
ter picked as his vice presidential running mate.=20
Such connections between Bush and the Houston energy company that last mont=
h became the largest US company to file for bankruptcy protection - devasta=
ting many of its retirees' pension plans in the process - have given Democr=
ats the first whiff of scandal from an administration that has pledged to r=
estore honor and integrity to the White House.=20
To date there have been no allegations that anyone in the White House acted=
 illegally, or that Lay was able to exploit friendships within the administ=
ration.=20
But the investigation into how Enron handled its financial problems, and ho=
w the administration responded upon learning about them, could provide the =
Democrats with grist for the campaign trail as the party seeks to regain co=
ntrol of the House and to tighten its tenuous grip on the Senate in the 200=
2 elections.=20
Republicans are especially vulnerable because Enron and Lay gave a majority=
 of their campaign donations to the GOP, raising the specter of influence p=
eddling.=20
"This is the largest alleged stock fraud in American history," said Paul Be=
gala, a Democratic political consultant who had been a longtime adviser to =
Bill Clinton. "This is not about anybody's personal life, not about anybody=
's private failings. It's about allegations of insider access in a corporat=
e rip-off."=20
However, the company also donated to Democrats, prompting some Republicans =
to argue that they are inoculated from across-the-aisle criticism. The Demo=
cratic connections were highlighted on Friday, when the Treasury Department=
 disclosed that Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury secretary in the Clinton admi=
nistration and now chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, called=
 a top Treasury Department official last November to discuss help for Enron=
.=20
Moreover, Democrats risk a backlash if their investigation is perceived as =
payback for the GOP's Whitewater inquiry during the Clinton administration.=
=20
Bush has been riding a popularity crest following his response to the Sept.=
 11 attacks.=20
"I think there's a great danger for Democrats if they seem opportunistic ab=
out trying to create a political scandal out of a business scandal," said S=
tuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant who was one of Bush's top advi=
sers, and who has worked on campaigns with William F. Weld, the former Mass=
achusetts governor.=20
"I don't think, just because Chuck Schumer received contributions from Enro=
n, he did anything wrong," Stevens said of the Democratic senator from New =
York. "And this is a case where there's every reason to believe the Bush ad=
ministration has handled itself exactly the way the public would want an ad=
ministration to act."=20
The comment hinted at the balancing act both parties face as Enron moves fr=
om the name of an energy company to a synonym for corporate failure - and p=
erhaps much more.=20
At least eight government investigations are under way.=20
What is not in dispute is that Lay and Enron were deep-pocketed political d=
onors. In the 2000 election cycle, the company gave money to 71 current sen=
ators and 188 current members of the House. It donated $1.77 million to Rep=
ublicans and $681,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive =
Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group. Through his political career, =
Bush has received about $650,000 from Lay.=20
What is also not in dispute is that Enron suffered a spectacular decline. W=
hen Bush was inaugurated as president last year, Enron's stock was trading =
at around $80 per share. When he marks his first anniversary a week from to=
day, the share price will be less than $1.=20
In between, the company announced on Oct. 16 that it was posting a third-qu=
arter loss of $618 million. As the stock price began to spiral downward, En=
ron blocked its employees from selling Enron shares from their 401(k) accou=
nts, ostensibly because the company was changing administrators for the pen=
sion plan. In the meantime, however, 29 senior executives cashed in more th=
an $1 billion of stock. On Dec. 2, the company filed for bankruptcy protect=
ion, as thousands of employees said they had lost their life's savings.=20
Prosecutors are believed to be looking at how Enron used complex partnershi=
ps to keep about $500 million in debt off its books. The administration and=
 Congress agree that it is proper to investigate whether any laws were brok=
en during the collapse. Bush himself has called for an inquiry into the rul=
es restricting employee stock sales. He has also established a committee to=
 determine how to protect pension plans from similar corporate failures.=20
The fuel for a political debate centers on contacts between Lay and Bush ad=
ministration officials, as Enron's worth plummeted.=20
Lay was one of 474 people to serve on Bush's presidential transition team l=
ast year. He also was a member of a panel advising the administration on it=
s energy policy.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the panel, has refused to give names=
 of committee members, or dates of their meetings. But last week, the admin=
istration said that Lay and Enron officials met with Cheney and his staff s=
ix times last year; the most recent meeting was six days before the third-q=
uarter loss was reported.=20
On Thursday, the White House said that three times shortly before the bankr=
uptcy filing Lay phoned Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Sec=
retary Don Evans. In those calls, Lay warned the officials of his company's=
 financial problems.=20
Evans says he was asked if there was anything he could do as Enron faced a =
downgrading of its debt. In the conversation with O'Neill, Lay suggested th=
e possibility of a federally arranged bailout with private money, the White=
 House said.=20
Then, on Friday, the administration said that a top Treasury Department off=
icial was contacted separately by Enron's president and Rubin, the former s=
ecretary, and that they discussed the possibility of a credit extension for=
 Enron.=20
In all these instances, the administration officials said they did not take=
 action. Evans and O'Neill have said they determined that the fallout from =
Enron's problems was not wide enough to warrant special help from the gover=
nment.=20
O'Neill also said that as overseer of the capital markets, he hears from ma=
jor companies every day. "I was not surprised at all that I would get a cal=
l saying, `Hey, we've got a problem over here and you should know about it,=
' " O'Neill said Thursday on CNN.=20
But it is the lack of action that bothers one Democrat.=20
"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col=
lapse, but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholder=
s who ultimately lost their life savings," said Representative Henry A. Wax=
man of California, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committe=
e.=20
A Republican National Committee spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, noted that Lay h=
ad ties to the Clinton administration - he slept at the White House and pla=
yed golf with the president once - and significant links to the Democrats w=
ho are now trying to sit in judgment.=20
"If people are going to grouse about contributions, everybody is in trouble=
. Joe Lieberman took contributions from them and he's holding hearings. Joh=
n Ashcroft took donations and he's recusing himself," Tucker said of Lieber=
man, the Connecticut senator, and Ashcroft, the attorney general.=20
Begala, who answered questions about a stream of political and sexual scand=
als while advising former President Clinton, said the Bush administration w=
ould be wise to release all information about its dealings with Lay and Enr=
on, and to return the focus to the company's operations - and not its deali=
ng with the White House.=20
"I have a Ph.D. in scandal management," Begala said. "These are hard and pa=
inful lessons, but I would offer my friends - and many are my friends - the=
 tip to just put it out there and stop pretending this is a not a scandal."=

CEO'S LONG PATH FROM FARM TO RIG

A.14
(Copyright 2002)

WASHINGTON - Kenneth Lay came from humble roots that, his friends and assoc=
iates say, he never forgot. He became one of the premier community philanth=
ropists and political donors in the country.=20
He also built and presided over a company whose failure, amid allegations o=
f financial improprieties, has ruined the retirement prospects of thousands=
 of its employees.
The portrait of Kenneth Lay, who will turn 60 this year, is disjointed: The=
re is both a folksy man of the people and a tough corporate operator, a man=
 whose contradictions have been brought into view as his economic and polit=
ical power has disintegrated into economic and political scandal.=20
"For a lot of us it's causing a conundrum that we're in, because it's kind =
of hard to put all these pieces together," said Bob Eury, president of Cent=
ral Houston Inc., a nonprofit civic group, and a friend of Lay's for 15 yea=
rs. "At this point everybody's kind of like, it's very hard to understand a=
ll this stuff."=20
Kenneth Lee Lay was a minister's son, born to Omer and Ruth E. Rees Lay, on=
 a Missouri farm. The family lived in tiny Rush Hill, a wisp of a community=
 outside Columbia, close enough that the three Lay children could live at h=
ome when they attended the University of Missouri.=20
"I spent a lot of time on a tractor and had a lot of time to think," Lay to=
ld the Houston Chronicle in 1991. "I must confess I was enamored with busin=
ess and industry. It was so different from the world in which I was living.=
"=20
Nevertheless, he thought his path might take him into the law, until he too=
k his first economics class at the University of Missouri.=20
"It was something that clicked with me," Lay told the Portland Oregonian in=
 1997. "I just found the power and effectiveness of the market system to be=
 incredible, which I pretty much believed anyway."=20
After finishing his undergraduate work in 1964, Lay moved among private-sec=
tor, government and academic work, making stops at the Department of the In=
terior (as deputy secretary for energy, from 1972 to 1974), the University =
of Houston (as a doctoral candidate; degree awarded in 1970), and Humble Oi=
l, later known as Exxon (from 1965 to 1968).=20
In 1985, Lay helped two struggling natural gas pipeline companies combine, =
and quickly emerged as the chief of the new company: Enron.=20
Over the years, Lay moved to orient Enron away from the staid business of n=
atural gas pipelines to the riskier - and more profitable - world of energy=
 markets. These were markets, through lobbying and crusading, that Lay help=
ed to create.=20
Lay also quickly made himself, and Enron, central figures in the Houston co=
mmunity. As the company grew, he pointed out that a company of its scope co=
uld have picked headquarters anywhere, and that Houston was a conscious cho=
ice.=20
"He was the go-to man for Houston, the individual in the corporate communit=
y who would get it done, the corporation in the corporate community who wou=
ld take the lead on those major issues," said Jim Kollaer, president and ch=
ief executive officer of the Greater Houston Partnership.=20
Lay's friends pointed to Enron's philanthropy and the lead role Lay took in=
 the creation of Enron Field, the home of baseball's Houston Astros, as exa=
mples of his leadership.=20
But Lay's generosity was not limited to community causes: He became one of =
the state's and nation's most prolific donors and political activists. Whil=
e a Republican by instinct, Lay and Enron gave money to both parties, not l=
east because Texas was dominated by Democrats until the early 1990s.=20
Lay drew close to the Bush family, supporting the father's two presidential=
 runs and helping the son's gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.=20
Lay served as one of George W. Bush's "pioneers," a group of fund- raisers =
who promised to each raise $100,000 for the presidential effort. Lay and En=
ron were among the biggest donors to Bush's presidential campaign.=20
His connections were clear: When Governor Bush addressed Texas's antipollut=
ion laws, Enron was one of a few energy-producing companies invited to help=
 redraft the law.=20
When Enron Field opened in 2000, Lay celebrated with Governor Bush and his =
father, the former president, in the owner's box.=20
Lay's early years in Washington had given him an understanding of the impor=
tance of establishment connections. He moved with relative ease between the=
 parties, whether staying overnight in the White House of former President =
Bush or playing golf with President Bill Clinton in 1993.=20
But in the end, his connections failed him: As his company careened toward =
bankruptcy, he reached out to some of those contacts, apparently to no avai=
l.=20
Enron's collapse has triggered a curious round of Washington confessions as=
 various administration officials have stepped forward to disclose their co=
ntacts with the corporation and the CEO.=20
At the same time, Karl Rove, Bush's top political operative, played down th=
e relationship between the two.=20
"The president knows him. He is a friend. But the idea that he is a friend =
in the sense that this is a guy who's a close intimate is just ridiculous,"=
 the Associated Press quoted Rove as saying on Friday.=20

CORRECTION: ATTENTION - ADDS details
WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (AFP) - US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was savaged b=
y leading members of Congress on Sunday for describing the biggest corporat=
e collapse in US history as "part of the genius of capitalism."=20
O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, appearing on the Sunday talk s=
hows, distanced the Bush administration from the collapse of the company, w=
hich left thousands of workers holding worthless pension fund securities wh=
ile top executives reportedly cashed out for hefty profits.
O'Neill, speaking on "Fox News Sunday," said the president knew nothing of =
appeals for help from the company prior to its collapse, which he described=
 as a textbook illustration of capitalism at work.=20
"Companies come and go," said O'Neill. "It's -- part of the genius of capit=
alism is, people get to make good decisions or bad decisions, and they get =
to pay the consequence or to enjoy the fruits of their decisions. That's th=
e way the system works."=20
The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation and members of=
 Congress have announced a series of probes into the affair.=20
Speaking on the CBS show "Face the Nation," Senator Joseph Lieberman, a for=
mer Democratic vice-presidential candidate, described O'Neill's comments as=
 "outrageous."=20
"Those are statements that might have been made by the secretary of the tre=
asury in the 18th century, but not in the 21st century."=20
"The death that Enron experienced was not a natural death. We know enough t=
o know that now," he added. "This was not capitalism as we want it to be."=
=20
While Enron sped toward a corporate train wreck and executives pulled some =
one billion dollars out of the firm, chairman Kenneth Lay was telling worke=
rs that prospects for the energy giant had never looked better, according t=
o information released by congressional investigators to US media.=20
Republican Senator John McCain, also speaking on CBS, said the collapse of =
Enron was "tainted" by the firm's massive contributions to politicians.=20
McCain and Lieberman said they agreed with a federal judge in Houston, Texa=
s, who was considering freezing the assets of top company executives, so th=
at ordinary shareholders could be compensated if the case went to the court=
s.=20
O'Neill and Evans both said they had received phone calls from Lay, a big f=
inancial supporter of Bush, prior to the company's collapse, but said that =
no demand from the company for help had been passed on to Bush.=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street (to the Whi=
te House) to tell the president," he said.=20
For over a decade Enron has been a major contributor to US politicians both=
 Democrat and Republican, and among those benefitting most was Bush, who re=
ceived 623,000 dollars from Enron since launching his political career in 1=
993, according to news reports in Washington.=20
But Evans, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" talk show, said there was no =
payback.=20
He also rejected criticism from Henry Waxman, the senior Democrat of the Ho=
use Committee on Government Reform, who said the White House could have int=
ervened to prevent tens of thousands of ordinary people from losing their s=
avings.=20
"If I had stepped in I think it would have been an egregious abuse of the o=
ffice of secretary of commerce of the United States of America," he said.=
=20
Enron hid its losses and overstated its profits prior to the collapse while=
 the firm's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, has admitted shredding documents =
related to its audit of the firm.=20

MOST of us figure that state unemployment insurance is a safety net. If we =
get laid off, we can always rely on up to $319 a week we can collect in une=
mployment benefits from the Texas Workforce Commission.=20
But you can't be so sure these days.
If you're receiving severance payments from your old employer, take a close=
 look. You may have waived your rights to unemployment benefits without rea=
lizing it.=20
Four former employees from Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. found out th=
e hard way. They not only lost their unemployment benefits, but they also w=
ere hit with a $41,479 judgment after Mitchell Energy successfully argued i=
n federal court that they relinquished their rights when they accepted an e=
arly retirement package.=20
In an attempt to reduce their state unemployment insurance tax, some employ=
ers like Mitchell are forcing their employees to make a choice: Either take=
 a company-sponsored buyout package or state unemployment compensation - bu=
t not both.=20
The lure is attractive to employers because companies pay unemployment taxe=
s based on the number of ex-employees who receive benefits. The fewer filin=
gs for unemployment benefits, the lower an employer's tax. The amount of we=
ekly benefits received by former employees is based on salary levels.=20
While it's unclear how many companies have adopted this practice, several e=
mployment law experts believe it will become far more common now that a fed=
eral judge has ruled they can do it.=20
And it is a significant expense. Employers can pay as much as 6.54 percent =
of the first $9,000 in wages per employee, or $588.60 each year, when they =
have a lot of claims filed against them.=20
Employment taxes may be costly. But there's a problem when employers force =
employees to waive their rights to unemployment benefits: Texas law prohibi=
ts it. In fact, the penalty is a six- month jail term for an employer who e=
ven accepts a waiver.=20
Mitchell Energy, however, argued that such waivers do not break the law bec=
ause its early retirement plan is covered under the federal Employee Retire=
ment Income and Security Act and therefore supercedes state law.=20
Under ERISA, companies that provide benefits such as health insurance and p=
ensions have a wide berth in structuring their plans, giving them freedom t=
o override related state regulations.=20
Until now, no one questioned whether ERISA would pre-empt state law concern=
ing unemployment compensation.=20
In mid-November, U.S. District Judge David Hittner ruled that because Mitch=
ell's early retirement plan doesn't allow employees to file claims against =
the company, they're not entitled to unemployment benefits. Hittner's rulin=
g, according to W. Fulton Broemer, the attorney representing the four Mitch=
ell workers, is the first time a federal judge in the United States has rul=
ed ERISA overrides a state law that carries criminal penalties.=20
It's like saying that if a severance plan that's covered under ERISA requir=
es you to kill a mockingbird before you can get your money, you must kill t=
he bird, even though it's against state law in Texas, Broemer said.=20
Hittner also ruled that the waiver the employees signed to receive their ea=
rly retirement benefits - which said they wouldn't file any claims against =
Mitchell Energy, but did not specifically mention unemployment benefits - w=
as not vague and was fully enforceable.=20
A spokesman for Mitchell Energy said the company did not want to comment on=
 the case.=20
...=20
Legislation planned=20
Concern over the Mitchell case has U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D- Houston, vowing=
 to introduce legislation that would prevent employers from using ERISA as =
a shield against unemployment taxes.=20
Unemployment insurance was designed as a bridge, he said.=20
"It's not like someone is getting rich on it," said Green. "They're just tr=
ying to keep their homes and insurance."=20
The Mitchell case has unnerved many ex-Enron employees who also agreed not =
to apply for unemployment benefits in exchange for hefty severance checks. =
Enron's severance agreement specifically states that if an ex-employee file=
s for unemployment benefits, severance benefits will stop.=20
Johnnie Williams knew that when she agreed to forfeit unemployment benefits=
 in exchange for about $52,400 in severance when she lost her job in mid-No=
vember. But that was before Enron filed for bankruptcy. Now Williams is sta=
nding in line with thousands of other creditors questioning whether they'll=
 get paid.=20
And like those thousands of other ex-Enron employees, Williams has bills to=
 pay. Those unemployment checks would come in handy.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Enron officials decided they didn't want=
 employees to collect both unemployment insurance and severance.=20
It's not illegal to put that condition into the severance plan, she said.=
=20
Denne said Enron's internal rule doesn't affect the employees who lost thei=
r jobs after the bankruptcy filing and received $4,500 in severance pay, wh=
ich isn't subject to ERISA rules. They can apply for unemployment benefits,=
 she said.=20
...=20
Clash at Mitchell Energy=20
As for the Mitchell Energy case, it all started in December 1998 when emplo=
yees were told they would lose their jobs if they didn't agree to take a vo=
luntary early retirement package, according to court documents.=20
The employees, who worked for Mitchell in Mineral Wells, agreed to take the=
 package and were told by representatives of the Texas Workforce Commission=
 that they could file for unemployment insurance for the 90-day period befo=
re their retirement benefits kicked in. The commission representatives had =
been asked by Mitchell Energy to speak to the employees who worked in the t=
own of 14,000 west of Fort Worth.=20
The employees filed for unemployment benefits and initially began receiving=
 checks. But when Mitchell Energy found out, company officials reminded the=
 employees that they had agreed not to file any claims against the company.=
=20
All but four of the employees dropped their claims for unemployment benefit=
s. Mitchell Energy sued the four for damages.=20
Initially, the Texas Workforce Commission sided with the employees, saying =
that they were entitled to unemployment benefits. But after Mitchell appeal=
ed, the commission reversed itself. In a 2- to-1 vote, commissioners sided =
with Mitchell, agreeing the four employees left the company voluntarily.=20
...=20
Dissenting voice=20
In his dissent, T.P. O'Mahoney, the commissioner appointed to represent wor=
kers, said he believed the employees were clearly facing a layoff.=20
"The employer's refusal to tell the employees when the work was ending or m=
ake it clear which particular positions were targeted for layoff appears to=
 have been nothing more than an attempt to leave the employees in the dark =
and prevent the receipt of unemployment benefits," O'Mahoney wrote.=20
The four employees sued the Texas Workforce Commission over its decision in=
 state district court in Austin. That case is pending.=20
Meanwhile, Judge Hittner ruled that the four employees - Vada L. Fain, Lest=
er G. Trollinger, John F. Wilkins and Greer H. Yoes - violated their agreem=
ent not to file any claims against Mitchell and must pay $41,479 in attorne=
y fees and other expenses to Mitchell to litigate the case.=20
But when an employee files for unemployment benefits, it's not a claim agai=
nst a company, argued Rick McHugh, staff attorney with the New York City-ba=
sed National Employment Law Project, a public policy group that examines wo=
rkplace issues.=20
Unemployment benefits are a statutory benefit given by the Legislature, McH=
ugh said.=20
"It's not a matter for employers to bargain about," said McHugh, who works =
in Ann Arbor, Mich.=20
Using that logic, McHugh asked, would the Texas Workforce Commission pay un=
employment benefits to striking employees if an employer agreed to those pa=
yments in an ERISA severance plan? Under current law, strikers aren't eligi=
ble for unemployment benefits.=20
While McHugh said he doubts the Texas Workforce Commission would adhere to =
such an ERISA plan, it's hard to know for sure.=20
Texas Workforce Commission spokesman Larry Jones said his agency isn't awar=
e of the Mitchell Energy case in federal court and can't comment. And since=
 the four employees have sued the commission, Jones said it isn't appropria=
te to comment.=20
And there's another issue, McHugh said. How can ERISA supersede state unemp=
loyment laws when state unemployment compensation was created by federal la=
w in the first place? The federal unemployment system was created by the So=
cial Security Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.=20
...=20
A precedent?=20
McHugh is worried about the precedent the Mitchell case may set for other s=
tates that have laws similar to Texas prohibiting employee waivers.=20
If the Mitchell case gets upheld on appeal, McHugh worries there'd be nothi=
ng to stop employers from doing the same thing with other benefit plans, su=
ch as workers' compensation, said McHugh. An employer could easily offer ea=
rly retirement or severance to an injured worker in exchange for dropping a=
 workers' compensation claim.=20
Broemer has appealed Hittner's ruling to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appe=
als in New Orleans. McHugh said his group would like to pitch in and help w=
ith the appeal.=20
Joe Ahmad, a Houston employment lawyer with Ahmad, Zavitsanos & Anaipakos, =
doesn't think the ERISA pre-emption argument will hold up.=20
The courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the 5th Circuit, have been=
 showing a bias against ERISA pre-emption in other issues. Instead, they've=
 been focusing more and more on states' rights.=20
But Tony Rosenstein, an employment lawyer at Baker & Botts, believes Hittne=
r was right on target.=20
There was clearly an ERISA pre-emption, said Rosenstein. And the unemployme=
nt statute isn't like embezzlement or bank robbery, which are part of state=
 criminal law.=20
Meanwhile, Rep. Green has directed his staff to look into the case, and if =
the appeal of the four ex-Mitchell employees fails, he plans to introduce l=
egislation to prohibit an ERISA pre-emption on unemployment benefits.=20
This kind of pre-emption was never intended by Congress, Green said, especi=
ally since unemployment insurance was created by federal law.=20
...=20
Push for action in Texas=20
The issue needs to come up in the next session of the Texas Legislature, sa=
id Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, who has vowed to lead =
the fight.=20
It's an "atrocity" that the Texas Workforce Commission allows employers to =
get out of paying benefits even though the Legislature said employees who l=
ose their jobs are clearly entitled to them, Shaw said.=20
Texas already disqualifies many more employees than other states, so many o=
ut-of-work Texans don't receive unemployment benefits, said Rick Levy, lega=
l director for the Texas AFL-CIO.=20
Levy said that's because the Texas Workforce Commission has a broader defin=
ition of misconduct than most states and it doesn't count the last quarter =
of wages when computing eligibility.=20
Meanwhile, Williams decided to file for unemployment benefits while she wai=
ts for the bankruptcy court to act.

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

When a newly minted President Bush strode into the White House nearly a yea=
r ago, the influence and interests of Kenneth Lay, and his massive Enron en=
ergy trading company, were only a few steps behind.=20
Lay, an old Bush family acquaintance and the chairman of Houston- based Enr=
on, was already a member of the new president's transition team on energy i=
ssues. Within a few months, he consulted with White House personnel directo=
r Clay Johnson on possible presidential appointees to the Federal Energy Re=
gulatory Commission, which oversees some of Enron's markets. Bush made an E=
nron vice chairman secretary of the Army. Vice President Dick Cheney's ener=
gy task force turned to Lay for his expertise six times.
The repetitive presence of Lay and his energy monolith during the opening y=
ear of Bush's presidency is extraordinary for its frequency and for its sor=
ry conclusion.=20
When Enron's wobbly house of trading cards began to tumble in late October,=
 Lay and his assistants did not hesitate to make hot-line- style calls to B=
ush's treasury and commerce secretaries to drop their bombshell about the c=
ompany's precarious state and to hint at a government-led bailout, which ne=
ver happened.=20
Bush, former governor of Texas, has said he never discussed the company's t=
roubles with Lay, whom he has known for years. Other White House aides dism=
issed any suggestion that the administration took steps to save Enron from =
its impending collapse and the bankruptcy proceeding that followed.=20
But while Democrats were quick to point out the chummy Bush-Lay relationshi=
p of days gone by, they have lately taken a more cautious tone.=20
"There's smoke here, but there's no proof of fire," said Sen. Joseph Lieber=
man (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which=
 will examine Enron's collapse at a Jan. 24 hearing.=20
Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, on Saturday r=
eleased copies of two e-mail messages Lay sent employees in August. In one,=
 the Enron chairman said: "Our performance has never been stronger; our bus=
iness model has never been more robust." In the other, he detailed an emplo=
yee stock option program that spoke of "a significantly higher price" for E=
nron stock in the future.=20
"It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was pr=
ospering," Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Comm=
ittee, said in a letter to Lay that the lawmaker also made public.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said Saturday that "Ken Lay was telling th=
e truth" in August. He added that only later did the company's financial pr=
oblems become clear.=20
As for Bush-Lay chumminess, Lieberman's tone is as practical as it is diplo=
matic. The fact is, Lay and Enron were working Washington long before Georg=
e W. Bush came to town, and there was plenty of money and influence being s=
pread around both political parties.=20
"One mistake is to think that this all started with the Bush administration=
," said Chuck Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity,=
 a Washington watchdog group. "They extracted favors from the Clinton admin=
istration and from Congress prior to Bush arriving. These guys are players.=
"=20
Clinton connection=20
Lay was no stranger to the Clinton White House, playing golf with the presi=
dent and staying overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom. Enron hired away Linda R=
obertson, a senior Treasury official in the Clinton administration, to head=
 the firm's Washington office.=20
Enron made a $100,000 contribution in 1997 to the Democratic National Commi=
ttee just days before its representatives accompanied Commerce Secretary Mi=
ckey Kantor on a trade mission to the former Yugoslavia, where Enron hoped =
to win a large contract.=20
Lay contributed $11,000 to former President Bill Clinton during his two cam=
paigns; Vice President Al Gore got $13,750 from Enron in the 2000 election.=
 During Clinton's eight years in office, the company and Lay contributed ab=
out $900,000 to the Democratic Party.=20
That sort of generosity was well-known in fundraising circles in Washington=
 and across the country. In the past 10 years, Enron contributed $5.8 milli=
on to political candidates of all stripes, from former New York Mayor Rudol=
ph Giuliani to Clinton to House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).=20
"The name of the game for both Democrats and Republicans is raise as much d=
amn money as possible with no holds barred," said Leon Panetta, Clinton's f=
ormer chief of staff. "And so both sides are going after huge contributors =
that will give largely soft money contributions that are unlimited.=20
"That just means it's an open invitation to companies that want to exert in=
fluence to play that game. And until there are some limits that are placed =
on soft money campaign contributions, what you see happening with Enron is =
going to continue to happen in the future."=20
But no candidate benefited more from Enron than President Bush. First as a =
candidate for governor of Texas and later as a presidential contender, Bush=
 has received $623,000 from Enron since launching his political career in 1=
993.=20
The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan group that tracks money =
and politics, said 73 percent of Enron's contributions in the last decade h=
ave gone to Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats.=20
"It definitely buys access," said Larry Noble, executive director of the gr=
oup and former counsel of the Federal Election Commission. "It gets their p=
hone calls returned. When you make that many contributions and Kenneth Lay =
is a friend of President Bush's, you have to ask very serious questions abo=
ut what that access bought."=20
Enron officials contributed $10,500 to the Bush campaign for legal expenses=
 in the Florida recount. When Bush became president, they donated $300,000 =
for the inaugural celebration.=20
Contributions to lawmakers=20
Though in far smaller amounts, political contributions were given to the ma=
jority of congressional lawmakers.=20
Nearly half of the representatives in the House and three-fourths of the se=
nators received money from Enron executives, according to campaign finance =
reports filed in Washington. Texas lawmakers received the most, with Republ=
ican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison topping the list with $99,000 in contributio=
ns since 1989.=20
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft received about $25,000 in Enron contributions duri=
ng his unsuccessful Senate re-election campaign in Missouri. Ashcroft last =
week recused himself from an Enron criminal investigation launched by a Jus=
tice Department task force. The department later disclosed that Ashcroft, w=
hile serving as attorney general, was invited by Lay to speak to a group of=
 chief executive officers about law-enforcement issues.=20
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) received $21,933 in contributions during the =
same period. He sits on the Senate energy committee. Senate Majority Leader=
 Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) received $6,000.=20
The Enron governmental affairs office in Washington has nearly a dozen empl=
oyees, in addition to contract lobbyists. Telephone calls to that office we=
re not returned late last week.=20
But money was only part of the game. Lay and Enron are clearly more comfort=
able with the Republicans who are now in office, and, until early December,=
 those officials appeared content with Enron.=20
Wendy Gramm, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under form=
er President George Bush, is a good example. Not only did she once head the=
 agency that regulated some of Enron's trading activities, but she was marr=
ied to Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Banking Committee.=
=20
While at the agency, Wendy Gramm shepherded a commission ruling that exempt=
ed a significant amount of Enron's energy trading from federal oversight. S=
everal weeks later, she left government and was elected to Enron's board.=
=20
In December 2000, with his wife still on Enron's board, Sen. Gramm sponsore=
d the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which made the exemption law. A =
Gramm spokesman said the senator did not work on that part of the legislati=
on.=20
As an Enron board member, Wendy Gramm sold $277,000 worth of Enron stock in=
 1998, according to the Center for Public Integrity.=20
Senior Bush adviser Karl Rove also held Enron stock worth $100,000 to $250,=
000, but he was required to sell it under government ethics rules.=20
In at least one high-profile instance, an Enron official joined the federal=
 government. Bush's secretary of the Army, Thomas White, had been vice chai=
rman of Enron Energy Services. Bush's nomination of the former brigadier ge=
neral had raised congressional concerns because White had headed Enron's ef=
forts to win federal contracts to run the utilities on military bases.=20
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), among others, asked White to recuse himself fro=
m the contract-letting process, to which White agreed, though he still favo=
rs the trend toward privatizing such services. White sold about $50 million=
 in Enron shares before the price of the company's stock plummeted.=20
Slew of investigations=20
Three congressional panels, the Justice Department, the General Accounting =
Office, the Department of Labor, and the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 have opened inquiries into Enron's failure and the firm's activities befor=
e its bankruptcy filing. Though the first Senate hearing is less than two w=
eeks away, it will take months, if not several years, to sort through the w=
eb of commodities trading schemes and off-the-books deals that regulators a=
nd congressional leaders say brought on Enron's collapse.=20
A thorough investigation of Enron's market influence likely will reveal a g=
ood bit of the dealmaking that occurred not on trading floors, but in Washi=
ngton offices.=20
"There are so many tentacles to Enron, and so many different elements that =
it could have impacted, that it may take some time to dig out and discover,=
" said Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity. "When they go back and loo=
k at . . . the actual influence over personalities and policies that played=
 out over the last two months, that's when we're going to see exactly what =
Enron got, and what they didn't get."

Enron's oily aftermath

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Enron's corpse is providing evidence of a major financial scandal that will=
 take years to unravel. It took only moments, though, for official Washingt=
on to sniff out the potential for a political scandal.=20
The comparisons to Watergate and Whitewater already are flying: What did Pr=
esident Bush know, and when did he know it?
The answers from the administration are: nothing and never.=20
The White House has revealed that the chairman of Enron, Kenneth Lay, calle=
d two Cabinet members late last year, apparently seeking government help wi=
th the failing company's desperate situation. The administration says that =
no offer of help was given, and that President Bush learned of the calls on=
ly last Thursday.=20
If that's the case, it speaks well of the Bush administration. Lay has been=
 a major contributor to Bush's state and federal campaigns. To hear the adm=
inistration tell it, the big-bucks donor got turned away at the door.=20
That, of course, won't stop the press and members of Congress from sniffing=
 around this, to see if there's more to the story. And well they should. Th=
at's not a slap at Bush's integrity. It's a comment on the fact that in U.S=
. politics, firm denials have a funny history of going soft when exposed to=
 scrutiny.=20
With the facts at hand this is, for now, a financial scandal, not a politic=
al scandal. It involves the stunning collapse of the nation's 7th largest c=
ompany, possible criminal fraud, destroyed documents, and executives cashin=
g in company stock at big profits while the retirement portfolios of Enron =
workers were wiped out.=20
The Justice Department is probing possible crimes leading up to Enron's Dec=
. 2 bankruptcy filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Dep=
artment are investigating, as are numerous congressional committees. A floo=
d of shareholder litigation has begun.=20
Last week's stunning revelations provided more fodder for the investigators=
:=20
- Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald =
Evans last fall, as Enron was collapsing. Some reports indicate that Lay, a=
nd Enron President Lawrence Whalley, in a series of phone calls to Treasury=
 officials, sought assistance to stave off bankruptcy. Lay also called Fede=
ral Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to alert him the company was in a=
 free fall that could impact financial and energy markets.=20
- Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who also received campaign contributions from E=
nron and Lay, has recused himself from any involvement in the investigation=
. Ashcroft's chief of staff and the entire U.S. Attorney's staff in Houston=
 have also recused themselves because of potential conflicts.=20
- Arthur Andersen revealed that its employees had destroyed a "significant =
but undetermined number" of Enron documents. Employees apparently began del=
eting and shredding in September, before the full extent of Enron's trouble=
s became known, and may have continued even after the SEC began investigati=
ng.=20
- Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met with Enron executives half a =
dozen times last year when the administration was developing an energy poli=
cy.=20
None of this indicates the administration improperly intervened as Enron he=
aded for bankruptcy. But precisely because the ties that bind this company =
to this administration are so strong, the Bush government must be honest an=
d forthcoming. It is essential that these criminal and civil investigations=
 be thorough, conducted fairly and free from any political influence.=20
Scandals at accounting houses just don't have as much sizzle as scandals at=
 the White House. But that's where this one is focused, and it may well lea=
d to welcome changes that have nothing to do with politics and everything t=
o do with the integrity of the information that investors rely on when judg=
ing a company's stock.=20
The true state of Enron's finances were hidden from its investors because t=
he company and its auditors permitted a series of senior level partnerships=
 that kept hundreds of millions in debt off the books. When the extent of t=
hat deception became clear, Enron's downfall was assured.=20
Did Enron criminally misrepresent its condition by hiding the full extent o=
f these partnerships? Was Arthur Andersen compromised because it received n=
early as much last year from Enron for consulting services ($23 million) as=
 it did in accounting fees ($25 million)?=20
The questions of politics will sort themselves out. The most pressing conce=
rn is that thousands of people lost their retirement savings --and may have=
 been victims of a crime.

Clinton link with Enron lowers the heat on Bush
Rupert Cornwell in Washington

01/13/2002
The Independent - London
FINAL
21
(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

The Democrats were dragged into the growing Enron scandal yesterday as it e=
merged that Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary, contacted a to=
p official at his old department to find out if the Bush administration cou=
ld step in to help the energy group.=20
Mr Rubin made his call last November to Peter Fisher, head of the Treasury'=
s domestic finance section, in his current capacity as chairman of Citigrou=
p, one of the main creditors of Enron. A month later the company went bankr=
upt in the biggest financial collapse in modern US history.
Mr Rubin was one of the most admired members of the Clinton team, and his i=
nvolvement will dent Democratic efforts to turn the affair into a new White=
water. "This could be a flu shot for Bush," one observer said. "This could =
inoculate him from the worst of the scandal."=20
The debacle of what was once the seventh largest US corporation has caused =
great embarrassment for the White House because of the close ties of Enron'=
s chief, Kenneth Lay, with President George Bush.=20
Since 1994, the company donated almost $600,000 (pounds 430,000) to the pre=
sident's various campaigns, and helped to cover the costs of both the recou=
nt battle and his inauguration gala. In return the company has had a major =
influence on the Bush energy strategy, successfully pressing for greater de=
regulation.=20
But though three quarters of Enron's $5.8m of political donations since 199=
0 went to Republicans, Democrats too were beneficiaries. The investment pai=
d off when Congress exempted Enron's key energy trading activities from a b=
ill overhauling federal oversight of commodity markets.=20
In his call to the Treasury, Mr Rubin asked Mr Fisher about the possibility=
 of pressing the bond-rating agencies not to lower their estimate of Enron =
bonds - and thus provoke a crisis of confidence in the group. According to =
the Treasury Department yesterday, Mr Fisher opposed the idea. Subsequently=
, agencies did indeed slash their assessment of Enron's creditworthiness, t=
riggering its demise.=20
The latest disclosure capped three days of turmoil. First, details emerged =
of numerous calls by Mr Lay to senior Bush officials last autumn, telling t=
hem of Enron's growing problems. Hours later John Ashcroft, Attorney Genera=
l and thus head of the Justice Department, which is now conducting a crimin=
al probe of Enron, formally took himself out of the case, admitting he had =
taken $60,000 of Enron donations in his failed 2000 campaign to retain his =
Senate seat.=20
But the biggest bombshell was the confession by the Arthur Andersen account=
ing firm, which audits Enron, that it had destroyed many documents relating=
 to the audit. Andersen was already under fierce criticism for failing to d=
etect the private partnerships into which Enron executives had shunted mill=
ions of dollars of debt to keep them off the main balance sheet.

Features - Sunday Comment - They can't pin this on Bush It was Clinton who =
lavished over $4 billion on Enron.

The first time I gave any thought to Enron, the world's biggest energy trad=
er, was during last summer's California blackouts, when the state had a go =
at blaming their woes on the company's chief executive, Ken Lay. "I would l=
ove," said Bill Lockyer, California's Attorney-General, "to personally esco=
rt Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says,=
 `Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "=20
Fortunately for Mr Lay, he lived not in California but in Texas, beyond the=
 reach of Mr Lockyer's summary cell-share programme. And, as Enron itself h=
as now short-circuited, in the largest bankruptcy in US history, Lockyer an=
d his fellow Democrats have moved on. These days, they and their media chum=
s are positively salivating at the prospect of using Enron to do to the Bus=
h Administration what the State of California wanted Spike to do to Mr Lay.=
 On Friday on CNN, in the corner of the screen where of late "AMERICA FIGHT=
S BACK" has been emblazoned, there loomed instead the dread suffix: "ENRONG=
ATE". The New York Times has lapsed into its lethal passive voice: "Questio=
ns were being raised."
The only "question" really being "raised" is: How can we pin this on Bush? =
Short answer: You can't.=20
For those who want to turn a bona fide business scandal into a political on=
e, Ken Lay is supposedly the unacceptable face of Bush capitalism - of a pa=
rticular Texan energy-industry backslapping business culture. The argument =
is that Lay has been writing cheques to Dubya's political campaigns since h=
e first ran for dogcatcher, and that in return he's been rewarded with "acc=
ess". Thus the headline in Friday's Washington Post: "Enron Asked For Help =
From Cabinet Officials. CEO Sought Intervention Before Bankruptcy."=20
Hmm. I must fish out The Washington Post of November 23, 1963: "President M=
akes Visit To Dallas. JFK Well-Received By Most Texans." The real news in t=
he story is not Lay's phone calls but the officials' response: when Dubya's=
 buddy tried to call in his chits, the Bush guys were unmoved. The headline=
 should have read: "Cabinet Officials Declined To Help Enron. CEO Told, `Aw=
fully Sorry To Hear About All These Problems, Ken. Look, I Gotta Run, But L=
et's Get Together And Do Lunch Sometime Next Year.' "=20
Meanwhile, the Attorney-General, John Ashcroft, has recused himself from th=
e Justice Department investigation on the grounds that he too has been the =
beneficiary of Enron's largesse. At a stroke, Ashcroft sets the bar at a he=
ight the Democrats can't rise to. After all, in terms of their political in=
vestments, Enron had a widely diversified portfolio: 71 of America's 100 Se=
nators got cheques from the company, among them half the Democratic caucus,=
 including Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton. If Senators and Representatives=
 are as punctilious about conflict of interest as the Attorney-General, the=
re'll barely be enough of them to man the Congressional hearings.=20
In other words, if this is "another Whitewater", it's a bipartisan one: in =
Monica terms, it's as if, in between oral sex with the President, she was s=
queezing in bondage sessions with Newt Gingrich and rounding out the day la=
pdancing with Strom Thurmond.=20
In so far as anybody did "special favours" for Enron, it wasn't Bush but th=
e Clinton Administration, which lavished over $4 billion in Federal funds o=
n the company.=20
But Bush? Ken Lay must be utterly bewildered: he gives half a mil to his Te=
xas buddy and what does he have to show for it? Nothing, except investigati=
ons by the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Securities and Exchange=
 Commission and eight Congressional committees. Right now, 30 days with Spi=
ke would be a pretty good plea bargain.

ENRON / Shoes keep dropping; let's see the closet

The Enron mess continues to grow messier with each passing day. Enron's aud=
itor, Andersen, says its employees destroyed many Enron records. Who is wat=
ching the watch dogs? It's revealed that Ken Lay called Commerce Secretary =
Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, not for help, according to L=
ay, but to alert them to the energy company's problems. O'Neill and Evans s=
ay they never told President Bush about Lay's calls.=20
Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Walley reportedly asked Peter Fisher, the T=
reasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, to try to influen=
ce bankers to extend credit to Enron. Fisher never called the bankers, Trea=
sury officials said.
And so it goes, one day after another with new revelations about the energy=
 giant's dealings and its relationship with politicians and others.=20
A number of investigations are under way, and a number of politicians, no d=
oubt, are champing to have a go at the Bush White House over its Enron asso=
ciations.=20
All of this, plus concerns about the future of remaining and former Enron e=
mployees and stockholders, underscores the need for the probes to go forwar=
d with swiftness, fairness and openness.=20
The shoes keep dropping, but we need now to see the whole closet.

ABC News: This Week

ed.

Announcer: From ABC News, THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts. S=
AM DONALDSON, co-host:=20
It burst into the headlines, the collapse of Enron. How the biggest corpora=
te disaster in American history lost billions of dollars, bankrupted thousa=
nds of investors, and forced President Bush to answer questions about his l=
argest contributor, Enron chief Kenneth Lay.
President GEORGE W. BUSH: I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial=
 problems of the company.=20
Senator JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (Democrat, Connecticut): The relationship between =
Enron, its executives and the Bush administration is a part of the story.=
=20
DONALDSON: Who made it happen? Who let it happen? And how can the governmen=
t keep it from happening again?=20
Unidentified Man: This hearing will come to order.=20
COKIE ROBERTS, co-host:=20
Our guests from the White House: Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, the Senat=
e's top investigator, Democrat Carl Levin, shareholder advocate William Ler=
ach and former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt.=
=20
Announcer: That's THIS WEEK featuring George Will and George Stephanopoulos=
. Now Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.=20
ROBERTS: Welcome to the program. Today we've decided to devote the entire b=
roadcast to a single subject: the collapse of Enron. With criminal, Congres=
sional and regulatory investigations all under a political overlay, Enron's=
 troubles have taken center stage here in Washington. Sam:=20
DONALDSON: Absolutely, Cokie. Just a year ago, Enron, the giant Houston-bas=
ed energy company that traded natural gas contracts, marketed electricity a=
nd other commodities, was riding high. The seventh-largest corporation in t=
he country, its stock hitting $83 a share, its revenues $100 billion a year=
. But as the months went by, things began to fall apart. A huge debt was mo=
unting out of public view. The stock price fell, and in desperation, top En=
ron officials reached out to the Bush administration last fall for help. Af=
ter all, Enron and its officers had been the single biggest contributor to =
Bush political campaigns. Administration officials say they did nothing to =
help, and on December 2nd, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection=
, wiping out an estimated $60 billion of stockholder investment and approxi=
mately $1.3 billion of employee retirement savings.=20
In the wake of this debacle, investigations are planned by the Justice Depa=
rtment, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and fi=
ve different Congressional committees, all spurred on by last week's bombsh=
ell admission by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen that its Houston em=
ployees have shredded documents relating to its audits of Enron. For its pa=
rt, Enron says it will cooperate with investigations and warns the public a=
gainst allowing the scandal machine to take over spreading unsupported spec=
ulation. Enron's embattled chief executive, Kenneth Lay, blames what happen=
ed on the recession.=20
Mr. KENNETH LAY (Chief Executive Officer, Enron): Many companies in 2002 ar=
e undergoing the difficult but cleansing effects of the current economic do=
wnturn. Enron itself has been a casualty of these events and many other eve=
nts. For this consequence, I am deeply saddened.=20
DONALDSON: Inevitably, Enron's collapse has resulted, as Cokie says, in pol=
itical battle lines being drawn here in Washington. Our chief White House c=
orrespondent Terry Moran has the latest on that. Terry:=20
TERRY MORAN reporting:=20
Well, Sam, those investigations you mentioned are certainly heating up. The=
 latest development: this six-page letter from Representative Henry Waxman.=
 He's the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. It's a=
 letter to Treasury Secretary O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Evans, and it =
can fairly be categorized as a blanket request for information and document=
ation by the two men's contacts with Enron. All this comes as the shock wav=
es from Enron's collapse continue to reverberate in both political parties =
this weekend.=20
(VO) On Friday, the Bush administration disclosed that Energy Secretary Spe=
ncer Abraham called Enron chairman Ken Lay last November 2nd to ask about t=
he company's situation. And former Clinton administration secretary, Robert=
 Rubin, spoke yesterday for the first time about this November 8th phone ca=
ll to Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher, seeking help in propping up Enr=
on's credit rating.=20
Yesterday Rubin told ABC News: "I called Peter and said, `I think it is pro=
bably not a good idea. On the other hand, this is a national economic issue=
.'=20
Pres. BUSH: In light of the most recent bankruptcy, Enron, there needs to b=
e a full review.=20
MORAN: (VO) The political storm broke Thursday morning at an Oval Office me=
eting with his economic team to announce administration action on the Enron=
 collapse. President Bush was asked about his relationship with Ken Lay.=20
Pres. BUSH: Ken Lay is a supporter, and I got to know Ken Lay when he was t=
he head of the--what they call, the Governor's Business Council in Texas. H=
e was a supporter of Anne Richards in my run in 1994.=20
MORAN: (VO) Democrats say that answer understates how close Mr. Bush has be=
en over the years with Enron's founder.=20
Democrats are also looking at phone calls from Lay to Commerce Secretary Do=
n Evans and to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill last fall as Enron neared co=
llapse. Lay was looking for help.=20
Mr. ARI FLEISCHER (White House Press Secretary): Secretary Evans talked to =
Secretary O'Neill and they agreed that no action should be taken.=20
MORAN: (VO) At the same time, Enron President Lawrence Greg Whalley called =
Treasury Undersecretary Fisher six or eight times, asking Fisher to interve=
ne with Enron's bankers. As he did with Rubin's request, Fisher declined.=
=20
The flurry of calls and years of political contributions have some Democrat=
s in the mood for a major investigation.=20
Sen. LIEBERMAN: This series of contacts between the highest official of Enr=
on and the Bush administration is a source of concern.=20
MORAN: The main investigation so far is the nationwide criminal probe launc=
hed by the Justice Department. But in a sign of just how complicated this s=
ituation is for the administration, the attorney general, John Ashcroft, wi=
ll not be leading that probe. He has recused himself because his campaign c=
ommittees in his 2002 Senate rate--race took more than $50,000 from Enron. =
And finally, Newsweek has added some details to an October 15th call betwee=
n Ken Lay and Commerce Secretary Evans. Evans was in Moscow at the time. Th=
e key information there is the date, October 15th. The next day, Enron anno=
unced a stunning, more than $500 million loss that led to its collapse. Sam=
:=20
DONALDSON: Thank you, Terry.=20
Joining us now from Pittsburgh is the secretary of the treasury, Paul O'Nei=
ll.=20
Welcome, Mr. Secretary.=20
Mr. PAUL O'NEILL (Treasury Secretary): Good morning.=20
DONALDSON: Well, on October 28th, which was a Sunday--I presume you were at=
 home--Kenneth Lay...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I was.=20
DONALDSON: ...Enron's CEO called you. What did he want?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He called to tell me that he thought it would be useful for hi=
s technical people to talk to our technical people so that we could assure =
ourselves that the problems they were having were not going to cause disloc=
ations in the US and world capital markets.=20
DONALDSON: Did he specifically bring up Long-Term Capital Management, which=
 was a company that had a--help from government in a financial bailout?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, first, let--let me correct what you just said. As I reca=
ll, Long-Term Capital didn't get any assistance from the government at all.=
 The New York Fed, I believe, called together the major banks that were inv=
olved with Long-Term Capital, and the major banks decided to take some acti=
on to avert a problem in the US capital market. So I think Long-Term Cap--h=
e mit--he mit--I think he may...=20
DONALDSON: It did--excuse me, Mr. Secretary. It did not get any direct gove=
rnment subsidy, but government officials...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Right.=20
DONALDSON: ...helped organize a bailout. And did he not bring that up?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I--as I recall, he mentioned that we should pay attention to t=
he technical details because the technical problems could well be of the na=
ture of Long-Term Capital.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Now, you then subsequently--according to what you've =
already said--called Peter Fisher, the undersecretary, and asked him to loo=
k into it. Is that correct?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I did, yes.=20
DONALDSON: And did he do so?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Yes, he did. And he came back to me and said he didn't think t=
here were parallels, that he was talking with people in the capital markets=
, and it didn't look like it would cause problems at other places.=20
DONALDSON: Well, now, the president of Enron, Peter--rather, Lawrence Greg =
Whalley, called Fisher six or eight times. Which is it?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, I honestly don't know. You know, as I've been watching t=
his the last few days, I've been surprised to see--I didn't know there were=
 six or eight calls. I knew that Peter was in touch with the president of E=
nron, and I didn't know unti--frankly, until I saw it on the news that Bob =
Rubin had called Peter as well. So, you know..=20
DONALDSON: What do you--what do you think of former Secretary Rubin's call?=
 Was that proper?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, you know, when I left Washington the last time, I--I wen=
t to New York and I made a deliberate decision that I was not going to trad=
e on what I knew about the government and people that I knew in the governm=
ent. And--and so, for me, I never would have made such a call. But Secretar=
y Rubin, I think, did a great job when he was in the government. He'd gone =
on to be a very high-level official at Citigroup. And--and, you know, I--I-=
-I think, at face value, Secretary Rubin's involvement, that he felt it was=
 appropriate for him to make that call. And, you know, I'll let other peopl=
e decide that. But I--you know, the whole idea of finding fault and--and--a=
nd--and other things in--in what I would consider to be kind of normal busi=
ness of people calling when there are problems like this, you know, making =
a big deal out of it, I--I--I just don't understand it.=20
DONALDSON: But--but you would not have made that call? That's what you told=
 me.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, you know, because I decided when I left Washington, I wa=
s done with Washington.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Now, the spokesman--the spokesperson for the Treasury=
 Department, Michelle Davis, said--and let me just take a look at what she =
said--that Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher inferred he, meaning Kennet=
h--meaning Whalley, was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit=
 to Enron lenders. Do you agree with that?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I don't know. You--you have to rely on what Peter and Michelle=
 have said about this.=20
DONALDSON: Well, didn't he discuss it with you, Mr. Secretary? Do you mean.=
..=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He didn't. Never, no.=20
DONALDSON: All during this time, you asked him to look into it, and he--he =
didn't discuss it with you?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, he just came back to me and said that he couldn't find a=
ny evidence that it was going to be a problem. You know, Sam, I think it he=
lps to put these things in context. You know, the call I had from Ken Lay w=
as three or four minutes. At the same time, I'm working on prosecuting the =
financial war on terrorism and putting together World Wide Web to--to inter=
dict and confiscate the money the terrorists have used to do things like Se=
ptember the 11th. At that time, I was working very hard trying to get the C=
ongress to pass a stimulus bill to help people who were affected by Septemb=
er 11th, slow down the economy, trying to get the Congress to pass a terror=
ist risk insurance bill, working on the problems of Argentina and Turkey an=
d other places around the world that have got problems. You know, this is a=
 three or four-minute telephone call...=20
DONALDSON: All right.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: ...and--and what I got from Ken Lay was no more than what I al=
ready read and--in the newspaper and seen on--on your and other television =
shows saying Enron was having problems.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Granted, lots on your plate, Mr. Secretary. But on No=
vember 8th, he called again. Did you make that call or did you place the ca=
ll?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: No, he called me.=20
DONALDSON: What did he want?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He called me to tell me that they were deep into conversations=
 with Dynergy, another energy company, and that sustaining their credit rat=
ing was--was a critical aspect of their deal. It was an information call. H=
e asked me for nothing.=20
DONALDSON: He asked you for nothing. You know, Bob Bennett, who is now Enro=
n's attorney here in Washington, says, and I quote, that Whalley told Fishe=
r, "It would be nice if you could get these banks to lend us some money, bu=
t I should tell you our credit is not good." Bennett said that Whalley then=
 laughed, meaning that that was a joke. It doesn't sound like a joke to a l=
ot of people.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, what would you have me make of that, Sam?=20
DONALDSON: Well, I'm asking you. I mean, you...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I'm--what--what are you asking me?=20
DONALDSON: Well, I'm asking you, if it does not appear from these separate =
little pieces that I've just read, that your own spokesperson says that Fis=
her inferred that he was being asked to do something. Then it says...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: OK, well, perhaps--perhaps so, but nothing was done.=20
DONALDSON: All right, nothing was done.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: What does--what does that tell you? I think it tells you we we=
re doing the diligent thing to make sure that the world and US capital mark=
ets didn't get damaged, and we had no responsibility to help an individual,=
 private firm and we didn't.=20
DONALDSON: Well, I want to show you what Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer has=
 said about all of these calls, and not only to you but to Don Evans. He sa=
id, "At no time did Lay ask for any assistance from the government, nor did=
 he intend to leave any impression that he was ask--asking for assistance."=
 We've had what you've had to say, but, of course, Don Evans says flatly th=
at he was asked to help out on the Moody's Investment Service. So that stat=
ement isn't correct, is it?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: You know, you can draw your own conclusions. Ken Lay didn't as=
k me to do anything, and, you know, there--we did nothing. I think we did t=
he right thing. We made sure that in our area of responsibility, which is t=
he US and the world capital markets, that the problems that were occurring =
at Enron had no spillover effect for the rest of the economy.=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Secretary...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: But, you know what the president has charged me to do now is t=
o look at these events and see if there are necessary changes in the rules =
to protect individual employees and to protect investors, to see if there a=
re weaknesses in the rules that we should correct, because the president's =
really concerned as he sees these stories about people losing their 401k pl=
ans, savings, and--and--and--and as a special concern, he wants to make sur=
e that disclosures are appropriate so that investors are not misled or...=
=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Secretary, I think a lot of people think that's a good idea,=
 of what the president has asked you to do. But coming back to what has hap=
pened, when you knew, no matter how long the phone calls were, that this bi=
g company was in deep, deep trouble, didn't you feel an obligation to tell =
the public so that the stockholders...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Sam--Sam, you and your other friends in the print media were t=
elling the people every day, I didn't learn anything from Ken Lay that wasn=
't public property.=20
DONALDSON: So you don't think that the secretary of the treasury and the se=
cretary of the commerce, if they had spoken out, wouldn't admit more to inv=
estors and employees than a newspaper story?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, I--you know, I don't think so. Would you have had me say=
 something as I watched LTV Steel going down? Should I have gotten on top o=
f the building and said, `LTV is going down.' I don't think--that's not the=
 role of government officials to call attention to the things that are al--=
already being recorded in the media in--in a very--in a very strong way. I =
didn't know anything that you didn't know.=20
DONALDSON: All right, Mr. Secretary. Finally, I'm told that you didn't info=
rm the president until last Thursday.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Right. That's true.=20
DONALDSON: Wouldn't it have been better to give him a head's up...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I didn't--I...=20
DONALDSON: ...because of this political problem that's coming, was one that=
 could have been foreseen.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I--well, frankly, I don't think so. You know, I get lots of ca=
lls from lots of people in big and small companies, and governments around =
the world. You know, do I run across the street every time I've had a telep=
hone call with, say, the finance minister in Argentina and tell the preside=
nt? Absolutely not. Why would I do that? I'm a big boy. I've got responsibi=
lity. I swore to uphold the laws and--and--and--and constitutional duties o=
f the United States, and I'm going to keep doing that. And--and--and I'm no=
t going to spend, you know, endless hours running across the street telling=
 the president about telephone calls.=20
DONALDSON: Secretary O'Neill, thank you very much for joining us this morni=
ng.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: You're welcome.=20
DONALDSON: It's always good to see you.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Nice to see you, too.=20
DONALDSON: Cokie:=20
ROBERTS: Joining us now from New York is Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Mi=
chigan. He's chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which=
 will be holding hearings into the whole Enron situation.=20
Thanks for being with us, Senator Levin.=20
Senator CARL LEVIN (Democrat, Michigan): Good being with you, Cokie.=20
ROBERTS: Now, starting with these phone calls that Sam and--and the secreta=
ry were talking about, were those calls proper? Should Ken Lay have been ca=
lling these Cabinet secretaries?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, it depends on what he said. I have no doubt they were ask=
ing for the government to take action. I think when Ken Lay denies it and o=
ther representatives of Enron deny that they were asking for things, I thin=
k that is a--just false. It's as false as some of their financial statement=
s. As a matter of fact, I don't believe that for one minute. But I do accep=
t when Secretary O'Neill says that nothing was done in response to those re=
quests, and I have no doubt, again, that there were requests made. And I ju=
st don't believe Enron on that, but I do believe Secretary O'Neill when he =
says that no action was taken.=20
ROBERTS: Should the secretaries have informed the regulators? Forget about =
the public, as he said, there were newspaper stories out there, but should =
they have informed the SEC of these conversations?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I don't know what the requirements are there. The SEC, of=
 course, had already been involved in this matter, as they should have been=
. But what we're focusing on at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation=
s, is--are the deceptive practices of Enron, and the failure of the auditor=
s, Arthur Andersen, to try to block those deceptive practices, to say no--t=
he failure of the board of Enron--to say no to the deceptive practices whic=
h cost the employees their jobs, their future retirements, which cost thous=
ands--tens of thousands of stockholders to go under with this stock. And--a=
nd that's what we're focusing on. And there's a lot there to be investigate=
d. Let me tell you, what Enron did here was to use outside entities in orde=
r to deceive the public and to increase the value of their stock.=20
ROBERTS: All right.=20
Sen. LEVIN: These were not accounting errors, by the way, these just weren'=
t errors...=20
ROBERTS: These partnerships you're talking about...=20
Sen. LEVIN: ...these were outside partnerships.=20
ROBERTS: But Senator, you--you heard earlier in the broadcast, your colleag=
ue Senator Lieberman saying that the relationship between Enron and the adm=
inistration, the fact that Ken Lay has been the biggest contributor to the =
administration, is an area of concern. Is that something that you will be l=
ooking into?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Yeah, campaign contributions are a major concern, but it's not =
the concern of our investigation. It's the concern of what we're trying to =
do in Congress, to pass campaign finance reform to put a ban on these big c=
ontributions by corporations. Corporations are not supposed to give any mon=
ey at all to campaigns, and yet because of that loophole, as you well know,=
 tens of thousand, hundreds of thousands of dollars went from Enron to the =
political parties, both political parties, and that's what we've got to put=
 an end to to stop these kind of appearances of impropriety that are create=
d, and the sale of access. I have no doubt that Enron had greater access be=
cause of huge campaign contributions.=20
ROBERTS: Greater access to Cabinet secretaries and to White--White House st=
aff and secretar--and Vice President Cheney?=20
Sen. LEVIN: I have no doubt that they had greater access, not just to the a=
dministration, but to members of Congress because of huge campaign contribu=
tions, and that's what we've got to end.=20
ROBERTS: Now...=20
Sen. LEVIN: But it's the actions of Enron, the improprieties, the false sta=
tements. They were selling glass as real diamonds, and that is false. We've=
 got to put an end to it. That is the major concern of my subcommittee. And=
 that is what, it seems to me, the American people want us to focus on.=20
ROBERTS: Now, Congressman Waxman from California has sent letters to the se=
cretaries asking for all of the documents, all of the meetings, any--any co=
ntacts at all between the administration and--and Enron. And implying that =
maybe--that even though Enron didn't seem to get energy policy changed to s=
uit it, but maybe the administration was advocating a tax policy that would=
 be helpful to Enron at the time that all these contacts were taking place.=
 What's your reaction to that?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I think it's appropriate to ask for all that material. Ou=
r 51 subpoenas, which we requested this--which we issued this week and have=
 now been served, are the subpoenas to Enron, its board, its managers, to A=
rthur Andersen for all the documents involved in the creation of these enti=
ties and in terms of any stocks sales and option sales. That's what we're f=
ocusing on are the failures of this corporation, the deceptive practices of=
 this corporation and the failures of its auditors and board that are suppo=
sed to be a check on manager--managers to be a check on managers. That's wh=
at our focus is on.=20
ROBERTS: Do you see a change in the laws coming as a result of this? Re-reg=
ulation of energy, for instance?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I'm not sure about the re-regulation of energy, but I am =
confident that in terms of the practices of boards and auditors that we hav=
e got to tighten up the law significantly. We have to be able to rely on bo=
ard members and on auditors to carry out their fiduciary duties. And that--=
those duties mean that a corporation is supposed to be in business for its =
stockholders and not for its managers.=20
ROBERTS: Of course...=20
Sen. LEVIN: Managers here line their pockets with--with hundreds of million=
s of dollars of stock sales at the same time a corporation was going under,=
 and the stockholders and employees were left holding the bag.=20
ROBERTS: Now...=20
Sen. LEVIN: I think we've got to tighten the laws.=20
ROBERTS: One of those..=20
Sen. LEVIN: I'm sure the tightening will come as a result of these hearings=
.=20
ROBERTS: One of those board members was Wendy Gramm, the wife of Senator Ph=
il Gramm of Texas. And--and Senator Gramm appears to have, in one of those =
late-night end-of-session moves, been the person who was successful in gett=
ing the--the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to exempt Enron from it=
s oversight. I know it's uncomfortable for senators to look at other senato=
r's actions, but is this part of the scope of your investigation?=20
Sen. LEVIN: The scope of the board is surely part of our investigation, the=
 activities of the board, all members, including Wendy Gramm. I don't know =
whether or not--I think that Senator Gramm has denied, as a matter of fact,=
 that that amendment that was added was added by him. So I don't even know =
that it's accurate that he was the one that added that amendment. But in an=
y event, as I understand the background for that now--and again, as you poi=
nt out, it was not a subject of the vote of the Senate--but as I understand=
 now, that had broader application than just Enron. But I--I'm not sure of =
the details of that, because that's not the focus of my investigation. Othe=
rs will be looking into other activities and other pieces of this puzzle.=
=20
ROBERTS: Senator, I--we're out of time, but I know that you are looking at =
the company. But there are a lot of Democrats licking their lips over this =
at the moment, and seeing an--an opportunity to get at the Bush administrat=
ion. Do you think there's a danger for Democrats here?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I think if anyone is doing that, they're making a mistake=
. I think the public has been burnt here. Democrats, Republicans and indepe=
ndents have been hurt. And it's our obligation, on a nonpartisan basis, to =
go after Enron, to go after its auditors, to go after board members, to loo=
k for improprieties here, to tighten the law. That is our responsibility. W=
e're going to do it on a bipartisan basis. We have the support in our inves=
tigation of my ranking Republican, Senator Collins. I know that Senator Lie=
berman has the support of Senator Thompson in the broader investigation of =
the full committee. So this is going to be a bipartisan investigation, as i=
t should be.=20
ROBERTS: Thank you very much, Senator Carl Levin.=20
Sen. LEVIN: Thank you, Cokie.=20
ROBERTS: Still ahead, who was to blame for the fall of Enron? But first, wh=
en we come back, those hurt most by its demise: the employees and other inv=
estors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Stay with us.=20
Announcer: THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts brought to you by=
...=20
(Commercial break)=20
DONALDSON: As we heard earlier, Enron chief Kenneth Lay blames his company'=
s collapse on the recession. Well, a lot of people think other factors, inc=
luding some that may result in criminal charges, are to blame. Our chief Ca=
pitol Hill correspondent Linda Douglass takes a closer look. Linda:=20
LINDA DOUGLASS reporting:=20
And Sam, one of the big questions is: Was there insider trading when the to=
p officials sold their stock when the stock was up? The people who were har=
dest hit by this, of course, were the employees. They were stripped of thei=
r jobs and they were robbed of their retirement savings.=20
Offscreen Voice: We're going to investigate that.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Sixty-four-year-old Janice Farmer had begun living off her r=
etirement fund when suddenly it vanished.=20
Ms. JANICE FARMER (Former Enron Employee): I trusted the management of Enro=
n with my life savings. Senators, I won't mince words here, they betrayed t=
hat trust.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Enron's employees had put their money into company-run 401ks=
, made up mostly of Enron's stock. When employees begun suspecting trouble =
in the company last summer, they worried about their stock. CEO Ken Lay rea=
ssured them in a e-mail, saying: "Our performance has never been stronger. =
Our business model has never been more robust. Our growth has never been mo=
re certain."=20
In mid-October, Enron finally revealed it was losing money. But panicked em=
ployees were told that because the company was in a transition period, they=
 would not be allowed to sell their stock. Many Enron officials had made a =
billion dollars selling their own stock months before.=20
Senator RON WYDEN (Democrat, Oregon): Enron was just sinking like the Titan=
ic, and you've got the top officers up on the deck selling the shares and a=
ll of you are locked in the boiler room, not able to get rid of the stock.=
=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) There were other victims: big pension funds which held Enron=
's stock. Florida's lost $325 million, Ohio's lost $59 million, California'=
s lost $45 million, New York's lost $58 million. And small investors whose =
brokers kept telling them Enron was hot. Widow Mary Bain Pearson lost $175,=
000.=20
Ms. MARY BAIN PEARSON (Enron Shareholder): I'm just a pebble in the stream.=
 A little bitty shareholder. I didn't lose millions, I didn't even lose a b=
illion. But what I did lose seems like a billion to me.=20
DOUGLASS: The employees and the shareholders have filed separate lawsuits t=
rying to recover some of what they've lost. But it is not clear at all wher=
e Enron would get the money to pay those claims if they should win in court=
, Sam.=20
DONALDSON: Thank you, Linda.=20
Yes, more than 60 lawsuits have already been filed in an attempt to recover=
 money lost by investors and Enron employees. But most of these suits have =
been put on hold by Enron's bankruptcy filing. One of them, however, a clas=
s action suit titled Amalgamated Bank vs. Kenneth Lay, is ongoing since it =
is directed at Enron officials and board members rather than the company it=
self. And joining us now is the lead attorney in this suit, Bill Lerach.=20
Welcome, Mr. Lerach.=20
Mr. WILLIAM LERACH (Shareholder Advocate): Good morning. Thank you.=20
DONALDSON: Company's go belly-up in capitalism all the time. What did Enron=
 do wrong?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, Enron did a great many things wrong. But most importantly=
, Enron falsified its financial statements, reporting over $600 million in =
phony profits and over a billion dollars of phony stockholder equity over a=
 four-year period while the top insiders in that company were selling off $=
1.1 billion of their stock. We think this is one of the most massive securi=
ty frauds we have ever encountered.=20
DONALDSON: Well, now, a federal judge has now agreed that she the authority=
 to freeze these assets of the officials that you are suing, but she says y=
ou have yet to make your case that she should do that.=20
Mr. LERACH: We haven't had an opportunity yet to trace where the money is, =
whether it's offshore in the Cayman Islands or it's been used to buy yachts=
 or whatever. We're going to be doing that, we hope, with the judge's permi=
ssion in the next few weeks. And I think if we find any significant amount =
of that money is in danger of being secreted or dissipated, I think the fed=
eral court will take appropriate action to freeze it.=20
DONALDSON: Well, let's look at just three of these 29 Enron officials, or f=
ormer officials, and some of their sales. And I want to ask you about it.=
=20
TEXT:=20
ENRON EXECUTIVE STOCK SALES=20
Stock sales from 10/19/98 to 11/27/01=20
Total shares Value sold Kenneth Lay 1.8 mil $101 mil Jeff Skilling 1.1 mil =
$66.9 mil Wendy Gramm 10,256 $276,912=20
Source: Amalgamated Bank v. Kenneth L Lay=20
DONALDSON: Kenneth Lay, the chief executive, from 1998 to last year, during=
 the period that you are suing for, sold stock worth $101 million. Jeff Ski=
lling, the former CEO sold stock worth $66.9 million. And Wendy Gramm, a bo=
ard member, sold stock worth $276,912. But Mr. Lay says he only sold 24 per=
cent of his holdings. He has lost most of his holdings along with anyone--e=
verything else. And Wendy Gramm says she sold hers in 1998, long before any=
 suggestion of this funny wrongdoing came to light. Why is it fair to go af=
ter them?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, first of all, Mr. Lay only paid pennies a share for his s=
tock. His stock was stock option stock. So it's wrong to say that he lost m=
oney when the stock collapsed because he didn't pay the inflated price for =
his stock that ordinary investors did. And you have to look past the playin=
g with the percentages. A hundred and one million dollars of stock by a CEO=
 or chairman of a company is a huge bailout, especially when it's compared =
to what's happening to the workers inside the company who are losing everyt=
hing and who aren't on the inside knowing the profits have been falsified a=
nd the company is failing.=20
DONALDSON: You're suing for $25 billion, and I know that Arthur Andersen is=
 also part of the suit. Where do you think you can get that money?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, Arthur Andersen is a large company. They have the wherewi=
thal to respond. In addition, there's directors' and officers' liability in=
surance running to the hundreds of millions. And, I must tell you, Sam, not=
 all the defendants have been named yet. This case is going to continue to =
evolve and expand. There are other professionals, lawyers, investment banke=
rs and the like who appear to be deeply implicated. A fraud of this scope a=
nd size simply cannot be perpetrated without the assistance of sophisticate=
d professionals to get stuff ba--past the regulators.=20
DONALDSON: Are you going to name any politicians?=20
Mr. LERACH: No, I didn't think we're naming politicians as such as defendan=
ts. We're not concerned with the politics of the case, we're concerned with=
 the economics of the case.=20
DONALDSON: Knowing what you know now, do you think people will eventually g=
o to jail here?=20
Mr. LERACH: It's dangerous to speculate, but the fraud here appears to be v=
ery substantial. It must have been deliberate. I don't like to see anyone g=
o to jail, but there has to be accountability in the system so that this ki=
nd of thing won't continue to happen. If there's not accountability for tho=
se who perpetrate it, then it will happen again and again.=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Lerach, thanks very much for joining us today.=20
Mr. LERACH: Thank you, Sam.=20
DONALDSON: When we come back, how did this happen? We'll examine the role o=
f Enron's management, its accountants and government regulators. And then G=
eorge Stephanopoulos will speak with the former Securities and Exchange Com=
mission chairman, Arthur Levitt, right after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS reporting:=20
We've seen that both Enron and Arthur Andersen will be playing defense in t=
he courts, but Congress will also be asking who else is to blame. Here's Li=
nda Douglass again with more on the blame game.=20
DOUGLASS: George, everyone is trying to figure out who is to blame for the =
collapse of Enron. Was it the government regulators? Was it the accountants=
? Was it the stock analysts? Was it the Enron officials cutting too many co=
rners as they tried to get rich?=20
(VO) Enron reeked of success. Its revenues had tripled in three years, maki=
ng it the seventh largest company on the Fortune 500. Brokers urged investo=
rs to, `Buy! Buy!' even though most did not really understand how the compl=
ex energy trading company made its money.=20
Mr. PATRICK McGURN (Institutional Shareholder Services): The company was su=
ch a good performer that people really weren't willing to say that the empe=
ror potentially didn't have any clothes on.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Turns out Enron was built on a house of cards. It hid its de=
bt by shifting it to mysterious partnerships, some of which were run by top=
 Enron officials, such as Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who made $3=
0 million in the process.=20
In November, Enron was forced to admit it that it had overstated its profit=
s by half a billion dollars. Did Enron's accountant, Arthur Andersen, help =
the company cover up a lie?=20
Sen. LIEBERMAN: Why did the Enron's auditors allow the company to overstate=
 its profits for four years using what appear now to be very questionable a=
ccounting practices?=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Enron was paying Andersen a million dollars a week to be a c=
onsultant and to audit its books. The SEC permits such arrangements, which =
some call a conflict of interest. Andersen now admits that some of its empl=
oyees destroyed Enron documents which could be crucial to the investigation=
.=20
(OC) Now, the Enron employees are also, again, the victims. Their 401ks wen=
t up in smoke, and many people say that's because 60 percent of those retir=
ement funds were made up of Enron stock. Some in Congress are now saying th=
at the percentage of company stock that should allowed in a 401k should onl=
y be 20 percent. George:=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks, Linda.=20
And now we're going to turn to someone who's an expert on all these issues.=
 Arthur Levitt was chairman of Securities Exchange Commission from 1993 to =
early 2001, and he joins us now from Santa Monica, California.=20
Good morning, Mr. Levitt.=20
Mr. ARTHUR LEVITT (Former Chairman, Securities & Exchange Commission): Good=
 morning, George.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Levitt, I think a lot of people are wondering if the SE=
C should bear some of the blame. When--when 29 top officials of a corporati=
on sell off $1.1 billion in stock--nearly half their holdings--shouldn't al=
arm bells go off at the SEC?=20
Mr. LEVITT: The SEC bases its security regulation not on merit regulation b=
ut on full disclosure. It's interesting, the issues that brought about the =
Enron debacle could have occurred in almost any other corporation, and some=
 of the people now who are calling for reforms were the very same people wh=
o frustrated the SEC in our efforts to get full disclosure, in our efforts =
to get the accounting industry to have some semblance of auditor independen=
ce.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: But--but these sales were disclosed, were they not?=20
Mr. LEVITT: The sales were disclosed, but the blame here falls on a whole h=
ost of factors. It's not just the auditors, it's the security analysts, it'=
s the rating agencies that dropped the ball, it's the investment bankers wh=
o cooked up the scheme to hide matters from the general public. And I think=
 this is a time we've got to take a look at how standards are set. This has=
 been a long-standing battle that the Commission has had to fight, and we'v=
e been frustrated by the business community and their impact on the Congres=
s to dissuade these standards-setters from doing the job they should be doi=
ng.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Levitt, Secretary O'Neill was on this phone--was on thi=
s program earlier. When he got those phone calls from Ken Lay, do you belie=
ve he had an obligation to call the SEC chairman?=20
Mr. LEVITT: I'm not sure whether it's an obligation, but historically when =
there have been economic problems of this kind--Long-Term Capital, for inst=
ance--or any of the other events that occurred while I was there--Alan Gree=
nspan and Lloyd Benson and Bob Rubin always communicated with--with me so t=
hat we were aware of the problem at the same time and could do something ab=
out it.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: So it would have been a good idea?=20
Mr. LEVITT: It just happened during--during my years.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: This--this whole episode is over real serious problems in t=
he accounting industry. Arthur Andersen just this weekend revealed that the=
y shredded documents related to the Enron case, maybe even after the SEC in=
vestigation began. That's a crime, isn't it?=20
Mr. LEVITT: I think it is. I think it is a violation of our securities laws=
, and it's highly unusual, at best. Arthur Andersen was one of three firms =
that fought the commission on this issue of auditor independence about a ye=
ar ago.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, this is the latest in a series of problems for Arthur =
Andersen. They paid millions of dollars in fines for the Waste Management c=
ase, the Sunbeam case. Do you think they can survive this third strike?=20
Mr. LEVITT: Well, that's very difficult to tell. I--I'm simply not sure. I =
think it's easy to look at this in a vacuum and say this will kill the firm=
. But I think it's premature to say that. They've got a real problem. But a=
s I've said before, this could happen in other American corporations. And I=
 think we've got to take a new look at the way standards are set, in the wa=
y the accounting industry is overseen, in the way rules are formulated in t=
he business community.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that mean independent boards and banning accounting fi=
rms from being both consultants and auditors?=20
Mr. LEVITT: Not necessarily a blanket ban but it does mean the appointment,=
 in my judgment, of an independent group to oversee the accountants. But mo=
re than that, I think it calls for a new look at the way America's boards a=
re constructed. I think that we should have a majority of members of a boar=
d come from the public, rather than from within the corporations. And the a=
udit committee should be empowered to prevent this kind of occurrence from =
happening by having to approve any consulting contract that is given to the=
 auditor before it is awarded to the auditor.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Mr. Levitt, thank you very much.=20
Mr. LEVITT: OK, George.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: When we come back, the ROUNDTABLE weighs in on Enron. Georg=
e Will joins us after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
Announcer: THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts will continue in =
a moment after this from our ABC stations.=20
(Commercial break)=20
DONALDSON: Now our ROUNDTABLE and Enron, where we give our opinions. And as=
 always, joining us, George Will.=20
Good to see you, George.=20
GEORGE WILL reporting:=20
Sir.=20
DONALDSON: And, of course, George Stephanopoulos back.=20
Does George W. Bush have anything to worry about here, George Will?=20
WILL: He has lots to worry about. Look, the Democratic Party is always an i=
nherently vulnerable to the suspicion that it is associated with the wilder=
 shores of the cultural left. The Republican's inherent vulnerability is bi=
g business in the sense that big business is corrupt. Furthermore, there's =
the whole stereotype of Texas culture. Furthermore, the president, in his s=
tatement in the Oval Office when he said, `Mr. Lay supported Anne Richards =
in 1994,' was being Clintonian. That is, slippery. That is, he was technica=
lly right, but on the real matter, wrong.=20
DONALDSON: Well, George Stephanopoulos...=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Slapped on the wrist by George Will, that's not the...=20
DONALDSON: Well, Mr. Lay said in a television interview before that electio=
n that while it was difficult, he was actually going to support George Bush=
.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, yeah, he was, and he gave, like you say, three times =
as much to George Bush than Anne Richards in `94. It was an odd moment for =
the president. I think it was to distinguish between the kinds of trouble h=
e is in. You know, you hear all week long this is like Whitewater. It's exa=
ctly like Whitewater in this respect: No matter how much you investigate, y=
ou're not going to find any abuse of power in the White House or by top gov=
ernment or Cabinet officials. You're not going to find that. Where--where B=
ush could be vulnerable is just this whole web of influence and contacts th=
at he had with Enron. And these ties, as George says, to big business, part=
icularly big oil.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, the Democrats are in danger of overreaching, as the=
y always are, or as either party is when it comes to something like this. A=
nd they--they understand that. And there some people urging caution and par=
ticularly since many Democrats also took large sums of money from Enron.=20
DONALDSON: But Senator Levin said to you, Cokie, that he was not going to..=
.=20
ROBERTS: Right.=20
DONALDSON: He--he accepted all this that O'Neill and others were saying; th=
ey didn't do anything.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, I do think that the president could do a couple of =
things that would make you crazy (looking towards George Will). The first w=
ould be to come after campaign finance reform. He doesn't care about it. He=
's made it clear he doesn't really care much about it, so why not support i=
t, and then--and then he gets rid of that whole issue. The other thing that=
 the White House could do that would make a big difference would be to stop=
 all of the bandying about with the House members--Republicans and Democrat=
s and the general accounting office--about the energy task force. Just thro=
w them mounds of paper from the energy task force.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: And if they don't--if they don't, they're going to get sued=
...=20
ROBERTS: Sued by the GAO.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: ...by the GAO. But, you know, I spoke with a White House of=
ficial late Friday and yesterday, and they are still insisting that they ar=
e going to go right down the line on this. And what they're doing is making=
 these documents more valuable.=20
DONALDSON: Well, the stone wall seldom works.=20
WILL: Cokie's right. Look, there are four things. You've mentioned two of t=
hem. Campaign finance may get passed. It shouldn't, but it will because of =
this. He may lose--Cheney may lose his argument with the GAO. He shouldn't,=
 but he may because of this. Gray Davis will be helped in his election in C=
alifornia because he can turn his mismanagement of their energy crisis back=
 on evil Texans. And furthermore, the whole drive to privatize--partially p=
rivatize Social Security will be hurt by this. Shouldn't be, but...=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it wasn't going anywhere, anyway.=20
WILL: I understand.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. But what else will be hurt, though? There's ano=
ther part of Bush's agenda which will hurt him substantively but help him p=
olitically: this whole effort to deregulate, particularly in the environmen=
tal area. It's going to be much harder for him to do that. If he doesn't do=
 it, though, it takes away one of the Democrat's best issues.=20
ROBERTS: But you know what, on the longer term, one of the things that--tha=
t both parties--but particularly Democrats because they have been the party=
 of government--is going to have to worry about is that we have seen in the=
 last few months since September 11th this tremendous surge and trust in go=
vernment and a trust in the Congress, of all things, and the--and the presi=
dent and the leadership. I think this is going to send that sinking.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: But--no, but right now there might be more calls now for th=
e use of government, for the tools of government, calls for the re-regulati=
on...=20
WILL: I agree--I agree entirely with George. War is the health of the state=
. We've said often this fall scandal can be the health of the state. Becaus=
e now attention will be turned back to the 1995 bill...=20
ROBERTS: But don't you think it all gets to...=20
WILL: ...where by one vote...=20
DONALDSON: They chose it...=20
WILL: ...they overrode Clinton's veto of a deregulate--of a weakening of th=
e securities bill.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Make Congress cease...(unintelligible).=20
DONALDSON: Another aspect. I mean, let's assume that the administration doe=
sn't have any culpability in this directly. Who did? Who is to blame? What =
happened here?=20
ROBERTS: It--it looks like a good many people are out there to blame.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean, there's two people are going down for sure. I mean,=
 Jeffrey Fastow (sic), the--the man who set up the partnerships is in big t=
rouble. Arthur Andersen looks like it it's going straight down the tubes. T=
hey've tried to blame it on--on Enron, but they're not going to get away wi=
th. The other day I spoke with a man who made a fortune short-selling Enron=
. His name is James Chanos. And he said all the clues were there. You had t=
he insider selling, you had indecipherable footnotes on these--on these par=
tnerships...=20
ROBERTS: And he was sending up warnings a year ago.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: ...and you had front loading of profits. Those clues were a=
ll there. Arthur Andersen is to blame for a lot of it.=20
DONALDSON: Well, clear--clearly, employees of Arthur Andersen in Houston ma=
de the calculation it was better to take the rap, which could be criminal, =
for shredding these documents than actually letting the documents be made p=
ublic.=20
WILL: I argued last Sunday, Sam, that this is not a Washington story. Prima=
rily, it's a New York Arthur Andersen and Houston/Enron story. But, you kno=
w, in--in California and other states that have `three strikes and you're o=
ut,' you got to jail forever. Sunbeam, Waste Management and Enron, how many=
 strikes does Arthur Andersen get?=20
DONALDSON: And what about the other accounting companies? How do we know th=
at some of them haven't also been playing fast and loose?=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: We don't. In fact, that bill that George was talking about =
just a--just a minute ago, since then there have been four to 500 restateme=
nts by accounting firms of all of their different reports. And this is goin=
g to go across the board.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, it's also true that Enron is not the only company t=
o have done what its done in terms of the executives getting big bucks out =
and the employees being left holding the bag. And I do think that that's wh=
at most--most people care about. Most people want to make sure their 401ks =
are OK, most people want to make sure they're not getting stiffed. And--and=
 really, Enron is just one example of that in recent years.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: And--and that's why you can bet that the first Bush task fo=
rce to report back is going to be the one for 401k reform. They're going to=
 try to move something through very quickly on that. Harder to get reform o=
f corporate governance. even though people will want it, all the lobbyists =
are going to come in and try to slow that down.=20
ROBERTS: And that's going to be a real test of the ideology of this adminis=
tration as well. Does the ideology take over and--and the whole idea of reg=
ulation of corporations become forbidden?=20
WILL: Well, 120 large US corporations have 401ks for their employees in whi=
ch at least a third of the stock held by them are those corporation's stock=
. That ought to change. But there's a larger point here that you point to. =
And conservatives have to understand that capitalism and free markets don't=
 just spring up like crab grass. They're the product of a very complicated =
set of laws and enforcement and provisions.=20
ROBERTS: That's right.=20
WILL: Capitalism's a government program.=20
DONALDSON: And also you--I must understand and I think people do--in capita=
lism there are winners and there are losers. And not everyone can be protec=
ted against loss. But you would think that if there is a fraud involved..=
=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: That's right.=20
DONALDSON: ...the kind of mismanagement that we see here, there ought to be=
 some protection.=20
ROBERTS: And the rule of law has to prevail.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, and the rule of--if it looks too good to be--if it lo=
oks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't even ask.=20
DONALDSON: You got the last word, George. Thank you.=20
And when we come back, there are more questionable transactions causing con=
troversy in THIS WEEK's edition of the George Will commentary. George expla=
ins it right after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
ROBERTS: George Will, Enron and football?=20
WILL: Cokie, Enron's accounting books should be filed under fiction. And af=
ter last Sunday, so should the NFL's record book. Going into the last regul=
ar season game, New York Giant Michael Strahan needed just one sack of the =
quarterback to set a record. Late in the fourth quarter, he still needed it=
. So quarterback Brett Favre, whose Packers had the game won, gave it to hi=
m. Watch this. Favre kept the ball and ran towards Strahan. Your Aunt Minn =
(ph) could have sacked Favre. Then Strahan's teammates gave Favre's friendl=
y pats. Everyone was so nice.=20
In 1998, a Connecticut basketball player suffered a career-ending injury ju=
st one basket shy of the school scoring record. So, her coach and the visit=
ing team agreed to exchange uncontested lay-ups. The player got the record.=
 Everyone was nice.=20
Some say Joe DiMaggio got help with his 50-game hitting record. Official sc=
orers may have turned what should have been errors into Dimaggio hits. The =
scorers were being nice.=20
In 1910, Ty Cobb was detested and Napoleon LaJoie was nice. On the last day=
 of the season, one team tried to help LaJoie beat Cobb for the batting tit=
le. The team's third baseman played far back, LaJoie got eight hits, six of=
 them bunts towards third. The team was being nice.=20
Last Sunday, many people said, `Michael Strahan is nice, and Brett Favre wa=
s nice, so what's the harm?' Well, here's the harm: The moral seriousness o=
f sport derives from the integrity of the competition. Absent that, you hav=
e a sham like professional wrestling. Records are worth keeping and celebra=
ting and striving to break because they certify excellence, excellence achi=
eved under the pressure of competition. Rig the competition in order to be =
nice, and records will certify nothing. Sport is morally serious because at=
hletic excellence cannot be faked. Niceness isn't nice when it produces fak=
ery on the playing field.=20
ROBERTS: So much for nice.=20
Sam and I will be right back.=20
(Commercial break)=20
ROBERTS: Well, Sam, it's neither Enron nor football on dot-com.=20
DONALDSON: That's right. Some news organizations, including ours, want the =
trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who is charged with complicity in the Septembe=
r 11th attack on America, to be televised. And prosecutors say that's too d=
angerous. You can see the arguments if you logon to sam.abcnews.com.=20
ROBERTS: And until next week, that's THIS WEEK.
