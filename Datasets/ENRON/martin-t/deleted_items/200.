Tom, I am going to go to a Fire Warden Class today from 1:30 - 4:30 to become a Fire Warden for the new building.  Is there anything you need me to do before I go to help you get packed up ... especially since you're working a half day tomorrow?

I can't remember if you replied or not, but is it okay for me to go to this class tomorrow?  Do you think that Jessica will be back?
