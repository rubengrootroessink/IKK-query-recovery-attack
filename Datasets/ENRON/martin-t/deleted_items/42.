HOUSTON -- Kenneth L. Lay was ousted Wednesday from Enron Corp., the Housto=
n company that he spent 15 years building into the world's largest energy t=
rader only to watch it crumble amid allegations of financial trickery.=20
Enron announced it is beginning a search for a turnaround specialist to sav=
e what is left of what was once the nation's seventh-largest company, but w=
hich now holds the dubious distinction of having filed the largest-ever ban=
kruptcy petition.
Lay said his decision to resign as chairman and chief executive was reached=
 in cooperation with Enron's board and the 15-member creditors' committee s=
elected as part of Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. Enron filed for bankrupt=
cy protection Dec. 2, listing more than $50 billion in assets and more than=
 $31 billion in debts.=20
The bank-dominated creditors' committee had been pushing for Lay's resignat=
ion so that new managers could oversee Enron's attempt to reorganize and re=
pay the money it owes, sources familiar with the situation said. The decisi=
on was reached Wednesday morning during a board meeting with Enron's far-fl=
ung directors checking in by telephone.=20
"The creditors just want a green-eyeshade guy who gets their money back for=
 them," one source said.=20
Lay will remain a director of the company.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100% of his efforts on reorganizing the company and pre=
serving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay said in a =
statement. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations t=
hat currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficul=
t to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders."=
=20
Lay, 59, has been named in more than 50 lawsuits, and his company's disinte=
gration is being investigated by several congressional committees, the Just=
ice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
That Lay was tossed out comes as less of a surprise than the leisurely time=
 it took to do it, Enron watchers said.=20
Lay held on as a series of damaging financial disclosures about murky off-b=
alance-sheet partnerships and overstated earnings hammered Enron's stock pr=
ice, wiping out billions of dollars of investor holdings and the retirement=
 savings of Enron employees.=20
Lay survived a failed last-ditch merger attempt with cross-town rival Dyneg=
y Inc., which fled claiming that it hadn't realized the depths of Enron's t=
roubles. He lasted as Enron's debt plunged to junk status and lenders turne=
d their backs, causing an all but fatal cash crunch that pushed Enron into =
bankruptcy.=20
But the heat rose in the last few weeks with revelations that Lay and other=
 Enron executives contacted Bush administration officials late last year se=
eking help for the flailing company, that Lay was touting the stock to empl=
oyees and urging them to buy shortly before Enron announced its worst quart=
er in corporate history, that Lay was warned in August by a company vice pr=
esident of a possible corporate implosion if details of the off-balance-she=
et transactions became known and that documents were shredded by Enron empl=
oyees and those of its auditor, Andersen.=20
"For whatever value remains in Enron to be realized, Lay's resignation was =
necessary," said Edward Muller, an investor in energy ventures and former p=
resident of Irvine-based Edison Mission Energy. It was necessary because "L=
ay's presence, with an obvious personal interest, stood in the way of decis=
ions being made to realize value for creditors and move the organization fo=
rward."=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said the decision comes too late =
and is likely to play poorly on Wall Street.=20
"When Wall Street was calling for Ken Lay's head, it was early in the game,=
" said Coale, who is based in Houston and has followed Enron closely. "Wall=
 Street thought that would be the responsible thing for the board to do. Bu=
t at this point, it makes him look guilty."=20
"I don't think the market's going to react favorably to that," she said, no=
ting that the company's stock took a steep plunge when CEO Jeffrey Skilling=
 resigned abruptly in August. Enron, which little more than a year ago trad=
ed at nearly $90 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Wednesday a=
t 34 cents in over-the-counter trading, down 9.5 cents. Lay's resignation w=
as announced after markets closed.=20
The reaction from Enron employees, current and former, was bitter.=20
"It was bound to happen," said Maritta Mullet, a former 10-year employee wh=
o lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement benefits. "I'm =
surprised he's been able to face up to all these people and stay in there s=
o long.=20
"I feel terribly betrayed by him," added Mullet, who said Lay was "blushing=
 over with how good everything looked" in a September online chat with empl=
oyees.=20
That enthusiasm cost her and others dearly.=20
Rumors had swirled in recent days that a new management team was about to b=
e named, perhaps to be led by Jeffrey McMahon, Enron executive vice preside=
nt and chief financial officer. McMahon was named to those posts in late Oc=
tober, replacing Andrew Fastow, who helped engineer the off-balance-sheet p=
artnerships that greased Enron's slide into bankruptcy.=20
McMahon was treasurer in 2000 and reportedly objected to the conflicts of i=
nterest caused by Fastow's twin roles as Enron chief financial officer and =
manager of two of the partnerships. McMahon then moved to a small Enron sub=
sidiary but was brought back in a futile attempt to calm investors.=20
With Lay's departure, McMahon would be the only remaining member of Enron's=
 three-person office of the chairman. The third member, Enron President Law=
rence Greg Whalley, is leaving Enron to run the trading operation that Enro=
n is selling to UBS Warberg in a noncash profit-sharing deal.=20
Enron officials have touted the pending sale of the company's trading opera=
tion to UBS as the beginning of a new future. The deal was blessed by the U=
.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday, and UBS has already extended job offers to =
640 Enron employees.=20
Still, if Enron management believes the company can move forward more smoot=
hly and reorganize without Lay, Mullet and others are doubtful.=20
"I didn't think the company could survive with him staying. But I don't thi=
nk the company can survive either way," she said. "I don't see what's left.=
"=20
"It's about time," said one former Enron vice president who spent four year=
s at the company. "I think he's entirely culpable. He knew what was going o=
n. He was responsible. He was captain of the ship."=20
The former vice president, who asked not to be named, said the board of dir=
ectors has been passive and should have acted sooner.=20
"I was wondering when they were going to get around to it. I've been shocke=
d that the [Bankruptcy] Court allowed the same management to stay in place.=
 It seems like the shredded documents were the last straw."=20
One current Enron finance executive said, "Good. Now they can start cleanin=
g house. He's a great guy, but he fell asleep at the wheel a bit. There has=
 to be someone taking some responsibility here, and he's chairman."=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he did not know what kind of retirement pa=
ckage Lay was being given, but noted that any agreement would have to be ap=
proved by the Bankruptcy Court.=20
Lay earned hundreds of millions of dollars at Enron, primarily through lucr=
ative stock options in recent years.=20
In 2000, Lay exercised options worth $123.4 million, according to Enron fil=
ings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His base salary that year=
 was $1.3 million, and he was given a $7-million bonus.=20
At the end of 2000, Lay held 5.1 million options worth $257.5 million, and =
an additional 1.5 million options worth more than $100 million that were sc=
heduled to vest in coming years, according to the SEC documents.=20
However, the plunge in Enron's stock price probably renders any unexercised=
 options worthless.=20
Lay received a $3.6-million bonus in January 2001. The company has not rele=
ased figures relating to his 2001 salary and option grants.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
Enron Chief Quits Under Pressure And Calls Inquiries a Distraction
By JIM YARDLEY and JOHN SCHWARTZ

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- Kenneth L. Lay resigned this evening as chairman and ch=
ief executive of the Enron Corporation under pressure from outside creditor=
s, nearly two months after his company filed for one of the largest bankrup=
tcies in the history of American business.=20
Mr. Lay, 59, suggested in a statement that he had decided to resign ''in co=
operation'' with the court-appointed creditors committee that is overseeing=
 the bankruptcy proceedings. He said the various federal inquiries into Enr=
on's collapse were too large a distraction as he tried to resuscitate the c=
ompany he has led since 1986.
''I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at th=
e helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company=
 and preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees,'' he sa=
id in a statement released by the company.=20
''Unfortunately,'' he added, ''with the multiple inquiries and investigatio=
ns that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly diff=
icult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholder=
s.''=20
Mr. Lay will remain on Enron's board. The creditors committee is searching =
for a specialist in reorganizing companies to join Enron and serve as actin=
g chief executive as soon as possible.=20
Thomas A. Roberts, a lawyer for Enron in New York, said that Mr. Lay had be=
en discussing the possibility of resigning since early December. Mr. Robert=
s said that a representative of the creditors committee had called him Tues=
day night. ''The creditors committee really thinks Ken should think about s=
tepping down as an officer and employee of the company,'' he said.=20
Mr. Roberts then called Mr. Lay at his home about 10 p.m. Tuesday. ''I pass=
ed that along and said, 'We probably need to think about this.' We talked a=
bout it awhile, and he said he was going to get something to eat and talked=
 with his wife,'' Mr. Roberts said.=20
The two men talked again the next morning; Mr. Lay said that he would conve=
ne a conference call among the directors later that morning. Mr. Roberts wa=
s included in that call.=20
During the call, Mr. Lay gave a synopsis. ''He said the time had come for h=
im to resign as an officer of the company so that somebody could get in the=
re and work on rebuilding it because his time was going to have to be dedic=
ated to all of these investigations that were taking place,'' Mr. Roberts s=
aid.=20
Mr. Roberts said that it was very important that Mr. Lay was staying on as =
a board member because ''he will continue to be available to advise the com=
pany.''=20
The resignation of Mr. Lay comes after a string of recent revelations that =
have raised questions about the conduct of Enron's top executives, includin=
g Mr. Lay himself. Disclosures by Congressional investigators have shown th=
at Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the financial arrangements tha=
t helped lead to Enron's collapse.=20
In August, he was warned in a private memorandum from a company vice presid=
ent that Enron's accounting practices could bring down the company.=20
Yet even as he was selling his own shares of Enron stock in September and O=
ctober, he was reassuring employees that the company would rebound and enco=
uraging them to buy. His lawyer has said Mr. Lay was selling not because of=
 lack of confidence in Enron but because he faced margin calls as investmen=
ts in his personal portfolio declined in value.=20
Mr. Lay will now face scrutiny for his role in Enron's collapse from federa=
l investigators and Congressional committees. On the day he resigned, the c=
ompany that he had once helped develop into the nation's largest energy tra=
der was instead a half-empty tower in which two floors were secured by fede=
ral agents.=20
A White House spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said, ''This doesn't change the pre=
sident's focus, which is on the ongoing criminal investigation and on the p=
olicy reviews to protect people's pensions.''=20
Mr. Lay had been a popular leader as Enron grew the last 15 years into an e=
nergy giant that he transformed, Cinderella style, from an unglamorous gas =
pipeline company. He was considered by peers as a man of big ideas, a crusa=
der for free markets and a risk taker in the Texas wildcatter tradition. Bu=
t while he was busy befriending the nation's most powerful politicians, ere=
cting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and pledging $100 million to =
put Enron's logo on the city's new ballpark, the little things were turning=
 out to be Mr. Lay's big problems.=20
One after another, disclosures spilled out of his company in recent months:=
 off-balance-sheet partnerships had hidden billions in debt; years of Enron=
's reported profits had been exaggerated. The stock price, once at more tha=
n $90 a share, tumbled to less than a dollar. A flood of lawsuits resulted =
as retirement systems, shareholders, former employees and others said that =
Enron's failure to disclose its accounting flaws amounted to a violation.=
=20
''He fell on his sword,'' said John Olson, an energy industry analyst here =
who was a lone skeptic about Enron when the company was flying high. ''It w=
as probably the right thing to do. Given the climate of opinion in Houston,=
 and where the company is in attempted recovery, this is probably in the be=
st interests of everybody.''=20
Mr. Lay hoped at first that he could avoid filing for bankruptcy when he en=
tered into merger talks with Dynegy, his Houston rival. But that deal fell =
apart, spawning more lawsuits and hard feelings, and leaving Enron with lit=
tle choice but to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On Dec. 3, the company la=
id off more than 4,000 workers and was vilified in the hometown where he wa=
s once thought to be a mayoral candidate.=20
There is no question that Enron employees did benefit over the years when t=
he stock price soared, as did Mr. Lay. He has collected more than $300 mill=
ion since 1989, mostly through exercising stock options.=20
In Texas, he was first known as a friend and supporter of former President =
George Bush. But when George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, Mr. Lay gai=
ned a national reputation as one of the ''pioneers,'' the top fund-raisers =
who gave more than $100,000 to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign. In all, En=
ron along with Mr. Lay have given more than $600,000 to Mr. Bush's politica=
l campaigns dating back to his first failed run for Congress in West Texas.=
=20
Enron did not limit its contributions to Mr. Bush. The company has made don=
ations to nearly two-thirds of the members of Congress and much of the Repu=
blican establishment in Texas.

Enron's Lay Resigns as Chairman, CEO --- Panel Appointed by Court Had Reque=
sted Change; Interim Chief Is Sought
By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Kenneth L. Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., the=
 company announced last night, less than 24 hours after the court-appointed=
 creditors committee requested his removal.=20
The beleaguered company and the creditors committee are now searching for a=
 chief restructuring officer to also serve as interim chief executive, the =
company said. The company has launched a separate search for a new chairman=
.
The committee, which consists of 15 Enron creditors, had contacted the comp=
any's lawyers at about 9 p.m. Tuesday to request Mr. Lay's resignation and =
the appointment of a restructuring officer to take over running the company=
, according to Thomas Roberts of Weil Gotshal & Manges, counsel to Enron. M=
r. Roberts said he relayed the request to Mr. Lay, who offered his resignat=
ion to Enron's board at a meeting late yesterday morning. Mr. Lay will rema=
in on Enron's board.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100%" on the reorganization, Mr. Lay said in a prepared=
 statement. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations =
that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficu=
lt to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders."=
=20
In recent weeks, Mr. Lay worked tirelessly to find some way to end the cris=
is that drove into bankruptcy the company he built. Beginning in 1985, Mr. =
Lay took a second-tier gas-pipeline company, formed through the merger of H=
ouston Natural Gas and InterNorth Inc., and forged it into the nation's big=
gest energy trader. Enron became a tireless proselytizer for deregulation a=
nd competitive markets, reflecting Mr. Lay's belief in open markets honed a=
s a Ph.D. economist at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a colle=
ge economics professor.=20
The company is already talking to a couple of people about the chief-execut=
ive position, and has drawn up a lengthier list of people to approach about=
 the chairman position, according to someone familiar with the process.=20
While a final decision about Mr. Lay's fate rested with Enron's board, the =
position of the creditors committee carries considerable weight in the bank=
ruptcy process. Under bankruptcy law, after a company files for Chapter 11 =
bankruptcy-court protection, as Enron did Dec. 2, the fiduciary responsibil=
ity of its board expands from shareholders to include all creditors.=20
Mr. Roberts said Mr. Lay had been considering resigning "off and on" since =
before Christmas.=20
Mr. Lay had stepped down as chief executive in January 2001, only to return=
 to the job after his successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned in =
August as the company's stock was falling. Mr. Lay also agreed to step down=
 if Dynegy Inc. had completed its proposed acquisition of Enron, which unra=
veled as Enron's problems mounted in November.=20
In the wake of damaging allegations about the destruction of Enron-related =
documents, and reports of Mr. Lay's sales of tens of millions of dollars of=
 Enron stock in the past year as the company's condition deteriorated, ther=
e was a growing sense on the creditors committee that he wasn't the best ma=
n to run the company as it tries to maximize recoveries to creditors, accor=
ding to people familiar with the committee's deliberations.=20
Many creditors are worried that Enron's assets may be worth far less than t=
hey initially had hoped, meaning creditors are likely to receive far less t=
han the billions of dollars they are owed.=20
In response to criticism, Mr. Lay has indicated he wasn't fully aware of th=
e details of the controversial partnerships whose disclosure led to major f=
inancial losses and, even worse, to a loss in investor confidence in Enron.=
 But Mr. Lay was present at board meetings where some of the partnerships w=
ere approved and where a waiver of the company's conflict-of-interest polic=
y was discussed to enable former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to r=
un them.=20
As the partnerships came under public scrutiny, Mr. Lay defended them in in=
terviews, saying the transactions were fully vetted and approved by the boa=
rd and had been done to benefit Enron.=20
Given controversy swirling around Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives, i=
t is hardly surprising that creditors would question his future.=20
There is ample precedent for the forced departure of top executives of comp=
anies that have filed for bankruptcy. In November, Linda Wachner, longtime =
head of Warnaco Group Inc., was replaced as chief executive officer by a tu=
rnaround expert after she lost the support of creditors in bankruptcy proce=
edings.=20
If a company's board doesn't accede to the wishes of the creditors committe=
e, bankruptcy law gives creditors further leverage to force a company's han=
d.=20
Creditors can file a motion asking the court to appoint a trustee to run th=
e company, supplanting the top executive and the board. To gain such relief=
, creditors must prove gross mismanagement or fraud by current management.

Lay quits top post at Enron=20
Creditors asked for resignation=20

Jan. 24, 2002, 8:45AM
Ken Lay resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron=
 at the request of the committee representing the company's creditors.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts reorganizing the company and=
 preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay, 59, s=
aid in a statement released Wednesday night. "Unfortunately, with the multi=
ple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it=
 is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate on what is most importan=
t to Enron's stakeholders."=20
The committee representing creditors in Enron's bankruptcy told Lay Tuesday=
 night he had become a distraction and must step aside because of the many =
allegations being leveled at the company, a source close to Enron said Wedn=
esday night.=20
Lay, who will stay on the board of directors, oversaw the company's growth =
from a staid pipeline business into an energy powerhouse that dealt in natu=
ral gas, electricity and other commodities.=20
After a decline that began early this year, the company finally collapsed i=
n October amid charges it had improperly inflated revenues and concealed de=
bt by using questionable accounting techniques. Thousands of employees were=
 put out of jobs and still more lost their retirement savings.=20
Thomas A. Roberts, a corporate lawyer helping oversee Enron's reorganizatio=
n, said Lay had been considering stepping down since before Christmas.=20
Lay couldn't be reached for comment.=20
He is scheduled to testify Feb. 4 before the Senate Commerce Committee. Enr=
on spokesman Mark Palmer said he did not think Lay has changed plans to do =
so.=20
Palmer said he was unsure whether Lay would be receiving any severance.=20
The creditors committee apparently didn't object to Lay remaining on the bo=
ard of directors, who Palmer said had asked Lay to stay on to help with the=
 restructuring. Lawyers representing the creditors committee couldn't be re=
ached Wednesday night.=20
The board and creditors committee are in the process of selecting a "restru=
cturing specialist" to serve as acting chief executive officer. The board, =
itself the target of lawsuits, will soon select a new chairman.=20
Lay notified remaining Enron employees of his resignation in an e-mail sent=
 Wednesday night. He told them he was proud of what Enron and its employees=
 had accomplished over the years and praised them for the help they had giv=
en to other employees and their communities.=20
In Washington, U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, said Lay's announcement wa=
s "no great surprise when you consider the fact that he had lorded over a c=
ompany that collapsed as a result of what appears to be great mismanagement=
, if not fraud."=20
"I don't think he had any other choice but to step aside," he said, adding =
that he doesn't expect Enron to be resurrected.=20
"I've been highly skeptical of whether we would ever see Enron rise again,"=
 Bentsen said. "The chairman and CEO (Lay) ultimately has to take responsib=
ility for that."=20
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, said he is focused on finding =
out what happened at Enron.=20
"It's been a very hard time for too many Houstonians," he said. "This doesn=

Kenneth L. Lay resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Enron =
Corp., caught between unrelenting pressures from the energy company's credi=
tors and a circle of federal and congressional investigators pursuing the r=
easons for Enron's collapse late last year.=20
Lay, 59, who founded the Houston company in 1986 and presided over its surg=
ing growth as an energy trader in the late 1990s, submitted his resignation=
 around noon in a conference phone call with the company's board of directo=
rs. He will remain on the board.
His resignation, on the eve of two congressional hearings, had been sought =
by a committee of major creditors who hold veto power over Enron's Chapter =
11 bankruptcy reorganization. "You work for the creditors. The creditors wa=
nted someone else," said one Enron official.=20
Lay's departure came a day after FBI agents moved into Enron's headquarters=
 tower to investigate charges of widespread shredding of corporate document=
s after government investigations of Enron had begun. Agents said they foun=
d a trash can containing shredded material and sealed off the area. Documen=
t destruction at Enron and its outside auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, will=
 be a key focus of today's Capitol Hill hearings.=20
Yesterday, people familiar with an investigation into shredding of Enron-re=
lated documents at Andersen's Houston office said scores of employees were =
involved. Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committe=
e, said it was "many" people, not just a few. Others familiar with the situ=
ation say all those involved were on Enron's audit team in the Houston offi=
ce, or were technical employees directed by the Enron team.=20
A friend and major political backer of President Bush, Lay formed Enron by =
combining two natural gas pipeline companies and transformed it into a powe=
rful supplier of gas and electricity. In the 1990s it created a vast, compl=
ex energy and commodity trading operation marked by increasingly elaborate =
outside partnership structures that are a central focus of the Enron invest=
igations.=20
Lay is scheduled to make the first appearance by a senior Enron executive b=
efore congressional panels investigating his company's demise at a Senate h=
earing Feb. 4. He also is a lead defendant in lawsuits by Enron shareholder=
s and former employees. Their lawyers charge that Lay and other company exe=
cutives enriched themselves through sales of Enron stock while misleading i=
nvestors and employees about the company's rapidly deteriorating financial =
condition last year.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen, we need someone at th=
e helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company=
 and preserving value for our creditors and hardworking employees," Lay sai=
d in a statement.=20
After filing the largest bankruptcy petition in U.S. history Dec. 2, Enron =
is trying to sell assets, settle its debts and survive as an energy produce=
r and distributor. Although the company laid off about 4,500 employees from=
 its headquarters staff, it has about 19,000 employees worldwide at energy,=
 pipeline and water supply installations, the company said.=20
"It was becoming increasingly difficult for Ken to concentrate fully on wha=
t is most important to Enron's stakeholder" -- the bankruptcy reorganizatio=
n, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer.=20
"Ken had considered the possibility that he might want or need to step down=
 back before Christmas," said Enron's chief outside corporate lawyer, Thoma=
s A. Roberts of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. A representative of Enron's credito=
rs committee called Roberts on Tuesday to say that Lay should consider resi=
gning and after Roberts and Lay discussed it, Lay resigned.=20
Today's hearings are being conducted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Com=
mittee, which is looking into financial and regulatory issues surrounding E=
nron's collapse, and the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee, which is looking into alleged document destruction by Arth=
ur Andersen.=20
A White House spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said the resignation does not chang=
e the president's focus. "It is on the criminal investigation, which will c=
ontinue, and on the policy reviews to protect people's pensions," she said.=
=20
Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joseph I. Lieberman -- a pro-busine=
ss Democrat from Connecticut with an eye on his party's 2004 presidential n=
omination -- has summoned former Securities and Exchange Commission chairma=
n Arthur Levitt Jr. and other witnesses to testify about financial and regu=
latory issues.=20
Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, (R-La.) chairman of the House Energy and Commerce=
 Committee, said yesterday he had moved the investigatory hearing ahead of =
one planned by the full committee to examine Enron's financial activities a=
nd relationships because it was urgent "to get to the bottom of this."=20
"We cannot do our work if people are going to destroy documents," he said.=
=20
Andersen recently admitted that the company's audit team last October destr=
oyed thousands of documents and e-mails resulting from its audit of Enron a=
fter learning that the SEC was looking into Enron's accounting practices.=
=20
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs the subcommittee on oversight a=
nd investigations, said Andersen agreed late yesterday to provide a senior =
partner to answer questions about policies and procedures regarding documen=
ts. Andersen attorney Nancy Temple and Michael Odum, who was on the Anderse=
n team at Enron, will appear under subpoena.=20
Greenwood said they would be questioned about when they became aware that E=
nron or Andersen might face litigation or an SEC probe, and how this affect=
ed their handling of relevant documents.=20
David B. Duncan, who led Andersen's audit of Enron, has also been ordered t=
o appear. His attorneys have told the committee he probably will refuse to =
testify by invoking his right against self-incrimination. Duncan previously=
 spoke to committee investigators, but not under oath.=20
Lieberman has labeled the Enron story a "corporate scandal," and indicated =
he wants to use the hearings to explore the role of the SEC, the Department=
 of Energy and other oversight agencies.=20
Under Lay, Enron was a leading political advocate for natural gas and elect=
ricity deregulation, courting allies in Washington and state capitals with =
intensive lobbying and generous contributions. Enron made $1.9 million in p=
olitical contributions between 1999 and 2001, according to a campaign spend=
ing watchdog group, the majority of it to Republicans. Lay, other Enron exe=
cutives and the company itself contributed more than $220,000 to Bush's pre=
sidential campaign.=20
As Enron was unraveling last fall, Lay tried to win help from the Bush admi=
nistration, contacting Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Treasury Secr=
etary Paul H. O'Neill in October. The Cabinet officials said they turned do=
wn Lay's requests for assistance in holding off a pending downgrade of Enro=
n's credit rating -- a critical issue for the heavily indebted company.=20
Lieberman has avoided direct criticism of the White House's ties to Lay and=
 other Enron figures, saying he has seen no indication of illegal activity.=
 That caution, say political observers, reflects many Democrats' concerns a=
bout the risks of appearing overly partisan, especially if congressional in=
quiries turn up no evidence of White House wrongdoing.=20
The central question Lay faces now is what he knew about Enron's deteriorat=
ing financial condition last year. Lay and other top executives professed t=
hat the company's future was bright at a time when its foreign energy proje=
cts were losing money and a crucial Internet networking venture was failing=
.=20
In August, Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins warned Lay directly that th=
e company faced a threat of accounting scandals because of its use of outsi=
de partnerships and investment entities to conceal debts and exaggerate rev=
enue, she said. Enron asked another outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to i=
nvestigate the charges, but said nothing about Watkins's warning.=20
Two months later, Enron revealed the first of a worsening series of account=
ing violations and errors, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched =
an inquiry, and the company's final collapse began.=20
Thousands of Enron shareholders have lost retirement savings in Enron stock=
 and Lay has become a focus of their anger.=20
"I believe he cares very much for the jobs that have been lost and the pain=
 that's been done," Roberts said. "It's been extraordinarily difficult. He'=
s held up very well."=20
Like dozens of others in Congress serving on committees involved in the inv=
estigation, Lieberman has received political donations from accounting comp=
anies, including Andersen's political action committee. The New Democrat Ne=
twork, a campaign group he co-founded to support the election of centrist D=
emocrats, also has received $14,500 from the Andersen PAC and $15,000 from =
Enron's PAC since 1997, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, an independent mon=
itoring group.=20
As a Republican loyalist, Tauzin is expected to keep attention focused on t=
he corporate misdeeds of Enron and Andersen, and away from Enron's ties to =
the GOP. He has made clear he will not join Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)=
 in using the investigations to highlight the ties between President Bush, =
some of his top aides and Enron.=20
Waxman "is carrying on a very partisan fight and trying to make this into a=
 political deal," said Tauzin. "It isn't."=20
Over the years, campaign groups controlled by Tauzin have received large su=
ms from the accounting industry, including Andersen. But those who have fol=
lowed Tauzin's career say that won't necessarily affect how he proceeds.=20
Born in the tiny southern Louisiana town of Chackbay, he grew up in a popul=
ist political culture that often viewed big corporations with as much suspi=
cion as big government. He was elected to Congress in 1980 as a Democrat, a=
nd switched to the GOP in 1995.=20
On the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, Tauzin developed close conne=
ctions to the telecommunications, energy and accounting industries. In the =
mid-1990s, for example, he worked for securities litigation reform that lim=
ited lawsuits against accounting firms. In 2000, he battled against a propo=
sal by the SEC's Levitt for far-reaching reforms of the accounting industry=
 that would have prevented firms from maintaining lucrative consulting cont=
racts with companies they audit. Andersen had such contracts with Enron.=20
But the same year, Tauzin led an aggressive investigation of the role of Fo=
rd Motor Co. and Firestone in accidents involving Ford Explorer vehicles. T=
hat resulted in legislation strengthening tire safety rules.=20
"Friend or foe, our committee is going to go after anyone who has done some=
thing wrong," said Tauzin. "I'm not interested in the political friendships=
. We're going to treat everyone the same."=20
Tauzin's investigators were the first to arrive at Enron headquarters in Ho=
uston to gather documents. Among the items they found was the Watkins lette=
r warning Lay of accounting problems.=20
Tauzin said yesterday he would keep an open mind on whether it might be nec=
essary to institute some of the changes in the accounting industry that Lev=
itt proposed -- and he opposed -- in 2000.=20
"If the regulatory balance is wrong today, then we need to rebalance it," h=
e said.=20
Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.), both membe=
rs of the Banking Committee, said yesterday that they are drafting legislat=
ion that would prevent accounting firms from offering both audit and consul=
ting services to the same client. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) has said sh=
e will introduce similar legislation.=20

Loss booked as unit profit, memo claims=20
By MARY FLOOD and TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 24, 2002, 12:41AM
Enron reported a profit at its energy-services business last year by moving=
 the unit's huge losses onto the books of another corporate division, a for=
mer Enron employee says.=20
The allegations of questionable Enron accounting were made Aug. 28 by forme=
r Enron Energy Services employee Margaret Ceconi in a five-page memo to Cha=
irman Ken Lay and the board of directors slightly more than three weeks aft=
er she and others in her department were laid off.=20
Her allegations echo those made just a few days before by Sherron Smith Wat=
kins, Enron's director of corporate development, in a memo to Lay. But whil=
e Watkins criticized the accounting treatment of several peripheral off-the=
-books entities, Ceconi's e-mail zeroed in on a part of the company that ha=
d been ballyhooed as an important growth engine.=20
Ceconi, 41, now working at a Houston consulting firm, said she had been lur=
ed to Enron early in the year after spending four years at GE Capital in Da=
llas, where she was senior vice president, by promises of $800,000 to $1 mi=
llion in salary.=20
That, she said in her memo, was simply a "fraudulent" way to attract her an=
d others to Enron, and symptomatic of the widespread corporate dishonesty d=
isplayed in its accounting and other business practices.=20
"Lying was rewarded in the culture at Enron," she said. "Fraud is fraud. Bu=
t there was a kind of blind loyalty there."=20
At Enron Energy Services, or EES, actual losses of at least $500 million we=
re moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable, the memo=
 says.=20
Ceconi said the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company=
's highly profitable and well-established trading arm.=20
Mark Palmer, spokesman for Enron, would not discuss specifics in the memo, =
which he said was "obviously from a disgruntled employee."=20
Of the EES losses, he said, "these are serious allegations. They are the ki=
nd of allegations that should be made to government officials if she believ=
es that."=20
"Enron touted EES as deserving a premium value on Wall Street," said Carol =
Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research. She and other analys=
ts said that hidden EES losses not only would have been seen as a material =
disclosure by investors before Enron declared bankruptcy, they could still =
be relevant.=20
"If it comes out that earnings are compromised with funky accounting at EES=
 that could affect the (bankruptcy) reorganization plan as it is right now.=
" Coale said some EES contracts are still seen as viable assets.=20
Ceconi, who has a degree in accounting, said she had asked the Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission questions about the practices while still at the com=
pany and, after being laid off, informed the agency of actual problems.=20
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlin in Washington, D.C., said the agency cannot =
comment on whether it received a complaint or what was done.=20
Ceconi's e-mail is replete with the personal criticism of mid- and upper-le=
vel managers that might be expected from a disgruntled employee.=20
But her attorney, Demetrios Anaipakos, said she wrote it not out of anger b=
ut out of a sense of obligation to company management and federal regulator=
s.=20
"She had a good faith concern that Enron may have been violating various SE=
C rules and regulations and well as various accounting standards," Anaipako=
s said.=20
The e-mail is less specific about the accounting practices than Watkins' me=
mo, which also mentioned concern about "valuation issues" at EES, one of th=
ree surviving divisions at Enron.=20
Ceconi's says, "EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings. This is com=
mon knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But=
 it should be taken seriously."=20
Ceconi, who was vice president at a Houston bank before going to Dallas, sa=
id in the memo that it was to "everyone's amazement" that EES, despite its =
huge losses, reported a profit in the second quarter of 2001.=20
A fellow employee at EES, asking not to be identified, confirmed Wednesday =
that the people who worked there could not understand how EES could report =
a profit, and that there were constant rumors that losses were being hidden=
.=20
Ceconi's e-mail began, "One can only surmise that the removal of (Chief Exe=
cutive) Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrong=
doings of the various management teams at Enron. However, based on my exper=
ience at this company, I'm sure the board has only scratched the surface of=
 the impending problems that plague Enron at the moment. ... "=20
Noting problems in various Enron interests around the world, she said, "Obv=
iously the board has (its) hands full at the moment, ... Some would say the=
 house of cards (is) falling. You are potentially facing shareholder lawsui=
ts, employee lawsuits ... heat from the analysts and the newspapers."=20
EES was formed to help companies manage and reduce their energy costs. By s=
ecuring fixed prices through long-term contracts, EES helped customers main=
tain predictable supplies at stable costs. It also provided energy audits a=
nd helped companies improve their energy efficiency.=20
It made a breakthrough in 1997, when the Archdiocese of Chicago agreed to l=
et EES manage its energy needs by buying natural gas to heat 1,000 schools,=
 churches and other facilities.=20
The division didn't begin to report profits until late in 2000, but then re=
venues steadily improved. In the first quarter of 2001, it reported profits=
 of $40 million. In the second quarter, $60 million in profit was reported =
earned on more than $7 billion in contracts.=20
Ceconi said those profits were surprising given that many contracts had to =
be renegotiated to Enron's disadvantage. Many of the assumptions made by En=
ron when structuring the deals did not pan out, she said, causing losses fo=
r Enron on the first day of the contracts.=20
In its bankruptcy filing, EES lists $2.5 billion in assets, mainly its cont=
racts with companies and organizations, and $2.1 billion in debts. The two =
largest unsecured creditors are Enron subsidiaries -- Risk Management & Tra=
ding Corp., which is owed more than $126 million; and Enron North America, =
owed $107 million.=20
Bala Dharan, accounting professor at Rice University, said it is possible C=
econi could be right and the losses were moved, legally, into another entit=
y.=20
"But," he added, "if investors were misled as they tried to make a section =
of the business look profitable when it wasn't, that could cause great conc=
ern."=20

Accounting for Enron: Congress Probes Shredding by Andersen --- Executives =
Are Subpoenaed To Testify Before Panel In House in Enron Case
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Tom Hamburger and Jeanne Cummings in=
 Washington and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp.'s chief auditor at Arthur Andersen LLP warned the=
 energy-trading giant against putting "misleading" information in a news re=
lease about third-quarter earnings last October, according to a memo that t=
he auditor wrote for his files.=20
But David Duncan's concerns were ignored, according to the memo, one of two=
 on the subject obtained by investigators for the House Energy and Commerce=
 Committee, which opens hearings on Enron and Andersen today.
The first memo of Mr. Duncan, who has since been fired, is dated the day be=
fore Enron's earnings announcement on Oct. 16. He writes that Enron's repre=
sentation "could potentially be misunderstood by investors."=20
Specifically, he warned that Enron's claim of $1.01 billion of "nonrecurrin=
g" charges falsely allowed the company to tell investors that it was "on tr=
ack" to meet strong earnings growth in 2002.=20
In an e-mail response to concerns raised by Mr. Duncan, a Chicago lawyer fo=
r Andersen, Nancy Temple, appeared to ignore the crux of his misgivings abo=
ut Enron's actions and, instead, suggested he make changes to his memo. Amo=
ng other things, she recommended that he delete her name from the memo sinc=
e it "increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to av=
oid."=20
Both the auditor and lawyer will appear today before a House Energy and Com=
merce subcommittee. The hearing was initially set to discuss document destr=
uction at Andersen, but aides to committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, a Louisia=
na Republican, said they expect that the newly obtained memos about the Enr=
on news release between Mr. Duncan and Ms. Temple will spark unanticipated =
questions.=20
The lawmaker who called the hearing, Oversight and Investigations Subcommit=
tee Chairman James Greenwood (R., Pa.), said 80 Andersen employees were ins=
tructed to destroy documents related to the auditor's work for Enron. He sa=
id he planned to ask Ms. Temple whether she was aware of document destructi=
on while visiting Houston in late October, a time that shredding was going =
on.=20
Meanwhile, Army Secretary Thomas E. White, a former Enron executive, disclo=
sed that he had spoken with former Enron colleagues on 30 occasions in the =
past seven months. He said he met with Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whal=
ley on Oct. 4, weeks before the company began seeking government help to wa=
rd off bankruptcy. All of the contacts were "personal in nature" and involv=
ed conversations about "the general financial condition of Enron," he said,=
 but no one asked him to intercede on the corporation's behalf.=20
Three Andersen executives have been subpoenaed to testify about the matter =
today before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, one of several =
congressional panels looking into the collapse of the Houston energy-tradin=
g concern.=20
Mr. Duncan will refuse to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment righ=
ts against potential self-incrimination, his lawyer said. The subcommittee =
plans to ask Mr. Duncan a single question as a formality and then excuse hi=
m, said one person familiar with the negotiations with House officials.=20
Once Mr. Duncan is dispatched, the star witness is likely to be Ms. Temple.=
 Mr. Duncan has cited an Oct. 12 e-mail reminder from her of the firm's doc=
ument-disposal-and-retention policy in explaining his actions. Rep. Greenwo=
od said she will be questioned about that e-mail as well as reports that sh=
e visited the Houston branch of Andersen in late October, after a Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission investigation of Enron had been announced.=20
Andersen Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino managed to avoid the emba=
rrassing spectacle of being subpoenaed to testify against his will, thanks =
to some late-night negotiations between his representatives and the House E=
nergy and Commerce Committee staff. Mr. Berardino's representatives agreed =
that he would testify in the near future and to send the company's managing=
 director of professional standards, Dorsey Baskin Jr., in his stead at the=
 hearing today.=20
The Senate Government Affairs Committee also opens its hearings on Enron to=
day with a much broader inquiry into systemic explanations for Enron's fail=
ure. Former SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt is expected to discuss his unsuc=
cessful efforts to ban accounting firms from auditing companies with which =
they have consulting contracts. Andersen had lucrative consulting contracts=
 with Enron while auditing the company's books, a common practice in the in=
dustry, and Enron's accounting practices are at the center of investigation=
s into its collapse.=20
The disclosures from Army Secretary White came in a letter responding to qu=
estions from Democratic Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California, a chief adminis=
tration antagonist on Enron issues.=20
"Since joining the administration, no one has asked that I intercede with a=
nyone, in any way, for the benefit of Enron Corp. Further, I have not done =
so," Mr. White wrote to Mr. Waxman. He said his contacts with former collea=
gues were congratulatory in nature in June, after he took his new post, and=
 became sympathetic later as Enron's situation deteriorated in the fall.=20
Mr. White said he had two discussions about Enron's collapse with Defense S=
ecretary Donald Rumsfeld in early November and with Secretary of State Coli=
n Powell on Dec. 12. Both of those conversations were focused primarily on =
the concern of Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Powell about "my personal well-being. M=
y response in both cases was that I had suffered significant personal losse=
s, but that I would persevere," Mr. White said.=20
Mr. White offered limited details of his own significant financial losses i=
n Enron's collapse. Though he didn't say exactly how much he lost, Mr. Whit=
e said he was still in the process of divesting when Enron went into its do=
wnward spiral. Stock that was selling for $50 a share when Mr. White began =
selling in June was valued at $12.85 on Oct. 30, the date of his last sale,=
 of 86,709 shares. Mr. White also said the company has stopped paying him h=
is retirement benefits.=20
The army secretary reports one conversation with Kenneth Lay, on Sept. 10, =
that Mr. White said he initiated in order to wish Mr. Lay well in his new p=
ost as Enron's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lay resigned from his posts las=
t night.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
WIDE EFFORT SEEN IN SHREDDING DATA ON ENRON'S AUDITS
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 -- Scores of people who worked at Arthur Andersen's Hou=
ston office were involved in the destruction of documents related to the En=
ron Corporation, the chairman of one of the Congressional subcommittees tha=
t will begin hearings Thursday on Enron's collapse said today.=20
The chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania=
, head of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said invest=
igators for the subcommittee had determined that document shredding was wid=
espread and that up to 80 people had received orders to destroy papers. He =
said it called into question Andersen's attempts to blame rogue employees f=
or the episode.
The hearings on Thursday will be Congress's first public exploration into t=
he Enron collapse, the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Am=
erican history.=20
Tonight, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, announced hi=
s resignation, saying the many investigations into the company's collapse w=
ould require too much of his attention.=20
Last week, Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, fired the lead p=
artner on the Enron account, David B. Duncan, saying he orchestrated widesp=
read document destruction shortly after learning of a government investigat=
ion into Enron's finances.=20
But Mr. Greenwood expressed skepticism about that account. ''Do you believe=
 that 80 Andersen employees were directed by Mr. Duncan to violate an expre=
ss provision of policy by Andersen in the face of yet another investigation=
, and none of them picked up the phone and called their superiors and said,=
 'This doesn't seem right'?'' he asked. ''The question we need to get to is=
, Were there instructions from above.''=20
Other people close to the investigation said they doubted that the number o=
f Andersen employees was as high as Mr. Greenwood's estimate, but they said=
 it was a much larger group than the company had suggested. Mr. Duncan is e=
xpected to appear under subpoena at the energy and commerce subcommittee he=
aring, but he plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrim=
ination, his lawyer said today. Mr. Duncan, will ''rely on his Constitution=
al right not to testify'' unless he is given immunity, his lawyer, Robert G=
iuffra, told the committee in a letter today.=20
Also today, Congressional investigators made public a memo Mr. Duncan wrote=
 last October saying he expressed concerns about the way in which Enron was=
 about to disclose huge losses from controversial dealings that investigato=
rs believed played a significant role in the company's collapse. The disclo=
sure, he said, was misleading to investors and possibly illegal.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron disclosed that it lost $618 million during the third quar=
ter and that it would have to reduce its net worth by $1.2 billion, partly =
because of dealings with investment partnerships that had been headed by An=
drew S. Fastow, who was then the company's chief financial officer. At the =
time, the company said the losses were the result of one-time losses, leavi=
ng the impression that the company could weather the bad quarterly results.=
=20
But two days earlier, Mr. Duncan warned the company's chief accounting offi=
cer, Rick Causey, that the way the company planned to disclose the informat=
ion might be ''misconstrued or misunderstood by investors,'' according to a=
 memo Mr. Duncan wrote to his files on Oct. 15 that was made available to C=
ongressional investigators. However, the press release Enron issued the nex=
t day was ''essentially the original presentation,'' Mr. Duncan wrote.=20
Mr. Duncan said in his memo that he had warned Mr. Causey that the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission initiates enforcement actions against companies =
that issue financial information that is ''materially misleading.'' He said=
 the company should rewrite its earnings report and bring in lawyers to ass=
ure that its statements were not false.=20
One week later, officials in Andersen's Houston office began to shred Enron=
-related documents on a massive scale, even though Enron had just disclosed=
 that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation int=
o its finances. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan last week, saying he had ordered =
the destruction of the Enron papers.=20
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, characterized Mr. Duncan's memo as =
routine and said it reflected internal debates about accounting issues that=
 occur between auditors and corporate executives. He added: ''It looks like=
 that with the exception of some inappropriate phrasing, Mr. Duncan was doi=
ng what he was supposed to.''=20
Tonight, an Andersen official repeated the firm's assertion that Mr. Duncan=
's actions, aided by other partners in the Houston office who were demoted =
or placed on leave last week, had not been sanctioned.=20
''The one glaring fact here is that David Duncan, with full knowledge of an=
 S.E.C. investigation, initiated a massive document destruction campaign,''=
 official said.=20
The hearings that begin on Thursday, which will eventually involve 10 diffe=
rent committees, could lead to changes in pension, tax, securities and acco=
unting laws, though many experts are skeptical how far lawmakers will go. P=
ast efforts to tighten laws in these areas, particularly auditing standards=
, have been beaten back by industry lobbying.=20
The fall of Enron has touched off a scramble in the capital to assign blame=
 and avoid the taint of the company's prodigious political donations.=20
Some Democrats in Congress see the Enron case as a windfall that could dent=
 President Bush's lofty public approval ratings. But many Democrats are als=
o vulnerable because the company spread its largess so widely and the accou=
nting and regulatory practices that led to Enron's collapse took place unde=
r Democratic and Republican administrations.=20
In the House, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee will cross-examine three=
 senior Arthur Andersen officials about why the firm destroyed Enron docume=
nts after learning about an S.E.C. investigation into the company's finance=
s.=20
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will examine whether govern=
ment policies failed and what new legislation is needed. The first witness =
will be Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman whose efforts to tighten =
auditing standards two years ago were derailed by opposition from Congress.=
=20
Separately, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democr=
at on the House Judiciary Committee, formally asked the Justice Department =
to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron, arguing the case ''repre=
sents one of the largest corporate frauds in the nation's history'' and cit=
ing the large campaign donations Enron has provided to President Bush over =
the years and the large number of senior administration officials who worke=
d for or invested in the company.=20
A Justice Department official said that he had not seen Mr. Conyers's lette=
r and that officials were still proceeding with their criminal investigatio=
n.=20
Also today, the Senate Finance Committee asked Enron to turn over tax retur=
ns for the past 16 years, in a letter sent by the committee chairman, Max B=
aucus, Democrat of Montana, and the ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley=
 of Iowa. Their request follows the disclosure in The New York Times last w=
eek that Enron used almost 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and othe=
r techniques to pay no income taxes in four of the last five years.=20
In an interview, Mr. Greenwood said Mr. Duncan had sought immunity for his =
testimony but had been rebuffed. Justice Department officials are worried t=
hat grants of immunity made by Congress might hamper their criminal investi=
gation of Enron and Andersen.=20
Investigators had asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, to=
 appear, but Mr. Berardino said he would be willing to attend on a later da=
te. Instead, Dorsey Baskin, a senior technical expert at Andersen, will tes=
tify. Two other Andersen officials -- Michael C. Odom, a partner in Houston=
, and Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer in Chicago -- are scheduled to testi=
fy.=20
While the House subcommittee hearing will focus on Andersen's document dest=
ruction, attention will turn later to the reasons for Enron's flawed accoun=
ting. In Mr. Duncan's memo, the auditor says Andersen had expressed serious=
 reservations about Enron's accounting, particularly the company's descript=
ion of large losses as ''nonrecurring,'' or one-time, charges.=20
Andersen had advised Enron that its use of the term ''could potentially be =
misunderstood by investors,'' Mr. Duncan's memo states. ''We pointed out th=
at such items are, more often than not, included in normal operating earnin=
gs in'' financial statements that are put together using generally accepted=
 accounting practices.=20
The next day -- the same day Enron disclosed the earnings press release tha=
t Mr. Duncan objected to -- Ms. Temple, who had been involved in discussing=
 the matter with Mr. Duncan, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Duncan and other=
s at the firm suggesting that language be deleted from the memo ''that migh=
t suggest we have concluded the release is misleading.''=20
A copy of the message showed that Ms. Temple appeared to be worried about p=
otential litigation on Enron's finances and she sought to remove her name f=
rom the list of people who received the document: ''If my name is mentioned=
 it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoi=
d.''=20
Ms. Temple's lawyer did not return a telephone call for comment. Mr. Leonar=
d, the Andersen spokesman, said Ms. Temple was simply worried about waiving=
 attorney-client privilege. Her reference to not concluding that the press =
release is misleading reflects her understanding that auditors ''don't have=
 a right or responsibility to pass judgment on press releases,'' only forma=
l financial statements, he added.=20
Mr. Duncan, 42, has told investigators that he was only destroying document=
s in keeping with an Oct. 12 e-mail message from Ms. Temple that emphasized=
 that they follow a policy requiring some documents be destroyed. Mr. Dunca=
n has told investigators he stopped shredding after Ms. Temple ordered it h=
alted Nov. 9.=20
While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employee=
s in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are=
 skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after =
Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.=20
Mr. Greenwood said that in interviews with committee investigators, Mr. Dun=
can stated that on at least two occasions before Oct. 12, Ms. Temple asked =
him, ''How are you on compliance with the document-retention on Enron?''=20
''Did she really mean that,'' Mr. Greenwood asked, ''or did she mean, 'How =
are you doing on getting rid of the documents?'''

WASHINGTON -- A fired executive with Enron Corp.'s accounting firm, Anderse=
n, warned the energy trading company that some of its public statements mig=
ht mislead investors, a memo obtained Wednesday shows.=20
As Enron was preparing to make the first public disclosure of its financial=
 problems, David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who oversaw the Enron acco=
unt, advised Enron that language in its news release "could be misconstrued=
 or misunderstood by investors," according to an Oct. 15 memo written by Du=
ncan.
Duncan is expected to be called to testify today at the first congressional=
 hearing to examine why Andersen destroyed thousands of documents related t=
o the Enron account. Andersen, claiming Duncan acted against orders in shre=
dding documents, fired him last week.=20
Duncan has contended that Andersen executives in Chicago were aware of Enro=
n's problems and that he was singled out as a scapegoat.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a $1.2-billion charge against shareholder equity=
. In his memo a day earlier, which he prepared for his files and copied to =
Andersen attorney Nancy Temple, Duncan said he raised objections to Enron's=
 characterization of some of the charges as "non-recurring" in a company ne=
ws release. He noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been c=
racking down on companies that improperly used the term.=20
Temple wrote back and suggested that Duncan delete her name from the memo d=
ue to a concern that the reference to Andersen's legal department might be =
viewed as a waiver of attorney-client privilege.=20
"If my name is mentioned, it increases the chances that I might be a witnes=
s, which I prefer to avoid," Temple wrote on Oct. 16, according to a copy o=
f her e-mail.=20
Duncan, who was fired by Andersen for allegedly orchestrating the destructi=
on, has pointed to an "unusual" Oct. 12 e-mail from Temple, reminding emplo=
yees to abide by the company's policy for deleting old files.=20
Sources close to the Enron investigation say the new memos show that Anders=
en was concerned in mid-October about its own legal liability in the Enron =
scandal, including the possibility that Temple might later be called as a w=
itness.=20
But the company did not advise its workers to preserve Enron documents unti=
l Nov. 9, after it was subpoenaed by government investigators.=20
An Andersen spokesman called the memos standard and appropriate. He said Te=
mple didn't want a reference to her conversations with Duncan because they =
were covered by attorney-client privilege.=20
An attorney for Duncan declined to comment on the memo.=20
But in a contentious opening salvo to the government's burgeoning inquiry, =
Duncan plans to refuse to testify today before the House Energy and Commerc=
e Committee.=20
The public standoff between Duncan, who wanted immunity in exchange for his=
 testimony today, and the committee, which refused his request for a tempor=
ary postponement of his appearance, are the first examples of what Washingt=
on experts predict could be several months of finger-pointing and legal man=
euvering.=20
"He's flying from Houston to Washington to assert the 5th [Amendment] and l=
eave," said Duncan's attorney, Robert J. Giuffra Jr.=20
In a letter to the committee Wednesday, Giuffra expressed frustration that =
the committee would not allow Duncan to postpone his testimony in order to =
review two boxes of Andersen documents that were not provided to him until =
Tuesday.=20
He also noted that it was unusual to require a potential witness to appear =
before a congressional committee and be sworn in, merely to invoke his cons=
titutional right to refuse to testify. Duncan had offered to provide the co=
mmittee with a sworn statement invoking the 5th Amendment in lieu of appear=
ing at the televised hearing.=20
"Most of the time, these things are worked out," said Jack Blum, a Washingt=
on attorney and former Senate investigator. "But if the effect you want is =
drama, you bring them in to take the 5th."=20
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson noted that Duncan spent 4 1/2 hours talking=
 to committee investigators behind closed doors.=20
"All we're asking is that he provide the same information to the committee =
under oath."=20
The committee also planned to subpoena Andersen Chief Executive Joseph F. B=
erardino but reportedly has agreed to allow an Andersen partner, Dorsey Bas=
kin, to come in Berardino's place.=20
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (=
D-Conn.) chairs, is also holding hearings today, focusing primarily on issu=
es related to the SEC, pensions, investor confidence, derivatives trading a=
nd the energy market. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt is the primary witn=

Enron Audit Fee Raises Some Brows
JERRY HIRSCH
TIMES STAFF WRITER

01/23/2002
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

The fee Enron Corp. paid the Andersen accounting firm to audit its books wa=
s one of the richest in corporate America, a fee that reflects the complexi=
ty, and possibly the risk, inherent in the job.=20
Enron paid Andersen $25 million for the year 2000 audit, a figure higher th=
an all but one of the companies in the Dow Jones industrials that reported =
their audit fees. The average charge among the blue chips was just $9 milli=
on, according to a review of such fees by The Times.
It also was large compared with the fees other energy companies paid their =
accountants, even Andersen. In a review of fees listed in Securities and Ex=
change Commission filings, The Times found that audit contracts averaged $3=
 million at nine large energy companies, including Andersen clients Mirant =
Corp., UtiliCorp United Inc., Dynegy Inc. and Calpine Corp.=20
Andersen's fee was a red flag to some experts and critics who say it could =
have clouded the company's judgment as it examined Enron's tangled financia=
l structure. The high fee no doubt reflected the difficulty of the audit, b=
ut it also may have hinted that Enron's finances contained unknown risks. I=
ndeed, Andersen executives debated internally whether the audit and other f=
ees would be perceived as a breach of the firm's independence.=20
An Andersen spokesman defended the fee, saying it reflected the size and co=
mplexity of Enron.=20
"This was a very sophisticated business," Andersen spokesman David Tabolt s=
aid. "The fee is set by the scope of the audit and the kind of people that =
have to be brought in to do the work. There are a whole lot of factors that=
 go into it."=20
Tabolt said the audit fee was in line with those of Enron's peers--the top =
10 companies in the Fortune 500. But even by that standard, the fee was lar=
ge.=20
The nine other companies at the top of that list paid an average of $14.5 m=
illion for their audits. Only Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financia=
l services company, paid more than Enron: $26.1 million.=20
Even if Enron were looked at as a financial services company, the fee it pa=
id was unusual. The Times examined the fees of seven large financial servic=
es companies--including Citigroup, American International Group, Goldman Sa=
chs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.--and found that the average audit =
charge was $15.5 million.=20
Several accounting professors and industry insiders said the high fees coul=
d be an indicator of the complicated nature of the Enron audit or the perce=
ived risk of the account.=20
"The relationship between a client and its auditors is a complicated thing =
because auditors get paid by the client but are supposed to be independent,=
" said Rick Antle, an accounting professor at the Yale School of Management=
.=20
"If you tell your client 'no' too many times, you don't have a client. But =
if you go along with everything they suggest, you could end up in jail," sa=
id Antle, who added that there is insufficient information yet to determine=
 whether the high fees Andersen collected influenced its judgment.=20
However, critics of the accounting industry say the fees Enron paid Anderse=
n--including an additional $27 million for consulting work--and the scandal=
 arising from the audit highlight problems that include the independence of=
 auditors and how the business is marketed and sold.=20
They argue that the fee clouded the minds of auditors, who were loath to en=
danger Andersen's contract by forcing Enron to adhere to stricter financial=
 standards.=20
The audit--and its failure to more fully disclose internal conflicts of int=
erest of Enron executives, billions of dollars in hidden debt and hundreds =
of millions of dollars in losses--is now the subject of multiple federal in=
vestigations.=20
Even top Andersen executives debated the propriety of the fees it was colle=
cting from Enron--which, including the consulting work, reached $1 million =
a week.=20
In a meeting almost a year ago, a group of the firm's top partners on the E=
nron engagement and at Andersen headquarters in Chicago discussed "whether =
there would be a perceived independence issue solely considering our level =
of fees," according to a Feb. 6 internal e-mail summarizing the meeting.=20
The partners estimated that the combined take on the Enron audit and consul=
ting contracts could reach $100 million annually. Ultimately the partners d=
ecided that they were not troubled by such a figure "as long as the nature =
of the services was not an issue."=20
The amount a firm charges for accounting services can be a warning sign for=
 audit problems, said Mark Cheffers, who operates the AccountingMalpractice=
.com Web site.=20
Certainly, the Enron fee was large enough to have the potential to color th=
e judgment of the firm's staff, Cheffers said.=20
But there is equal danger at the other end of the scale, where low audit fe=
es are designed to gain an accounting firm entry to a large company so it c=
an sell a host of profitable consulting and other services, Cheffers said.=
=20
Companies only last year began disclosing what they paid auditors, and ther=
e is not enough information yet to interpret what differences in fees mean,=
 said Lawrence Revsine, a Northwestern University accounting professor.=20
"We can't say that when there is a $25-million audit versus a $15-million a=
udit, something rotten is afoot here, but we will be able to as more inform=
ation about audit fees comes out now and it is studied," he said.=20
Revsine said researchers will look at how differences in a company's number=
 of locations, employees, complexity of transactions and other factors can =
affect an audit.=20
Audits are intended to provide independent verification that a company is g=
iving investors an accurate picture of its finances and that it is followin=
g consistent and generally accepted accounting rules and standards.=20
Enron's downfall, caused in part by the accounting treatment of a series of=
 partnerships and ventures affiliated with the Houston energy trader, has t=
hrown thousands of employees out of work and has cost the company's pension=
ers and investors billions of dollars in stock value losses.=20
Yet it would be a mistake to assume that all audited financial statements g=
o through the same type of scrubbing and are comparable, said Ira Solomon, =
who heads the accounting department at the University of Illinois.=20
For example, two identical companies with the same level of sales and cost =
structures could have different profit figures based upon the way they cons=
truct their financial statements. The cost of inventory can be calculated b=
y two methods that yield different results in the short term. Each approach=
 is an accepted practice, and each produces a different profit figure, Solo=
mon said.=20
J. Terry Strange, vice chairman, assurance and advisory services, for accou=
nting firm KPMG, which audits Citigroup, said it makes sense that financial=
 services companies pay higher audit fees than other companies.=20
"The size of the fee is directly related to the size, and more importantly,=
 the complexity of the enterprise being audited," Strange said. "Financial =
services companies are, generally speaking, the most complicated businesses=
. The reason they are complicated is that they are in the financial risk bu=
siness.=20
"So risk enters into [calculating an audit fee]--the nature of risk that th=
e enterprise takes and the amount of work that must be done to become comfo=
rtable that the auditor understands and agrees with the accounting and beli=
eves that the enterprise has controls in place to manage the risk they are =
taking," he said.=20
By those standards, it would make sense that Enron would be an expensive au=
dit. The company in many ways operated as a financial services business, de=
veloping new trading mechanisms and markets for everything from energy to t=
elecommunications services--in the process inventing transactions that were=
 new to the business world.=20
With that came high risks.=20
"Clearly this was a very high-risk client. They were doing things in an ind=
ustry that had never been done before," said Randolph Beatty, dean of USC's=
 Leventhal School of Accounting.=20
But Andersen spokesman Tabolt said the company does not build a "risk premi=
um" into its audit fees.=20
Each of the five largest accounting firms conducts the audits of 2,000 to 3=
,000 publicly traded companies in the United States, according to the Publi=
c Accounting Report, an industry newsletter. They so dominate the business =
that the No. 6 firm in the country, BDO Seidman, has only 325 SEC-reporting=
 clients.=20
Although companies occasionally change auditors for such reasons as fees or=
 arguments or service issues, most companies stay with the same auditor for=
 years, occasionally putting their contracts out to bid.=20
Certain firms specialize in industries. Andersen, which audits only two of =
the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, has a large=
 energy business practice. PricewaterhouseCoopers specializes in large comp=
anies and audits 14 of the Dow 30.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: GAUGING THE ASSETS
Plaintiffs Ask: Just How Deep Are the Pockets At Andersen?
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The growing stack of lawsuits against Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron'=
s financial statements, raises the question of just how much could the firm=
 really afford to pay out.=20
In the latest suit, filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Houston, E=
nron employees argue that the accounting firm helped hide Enron's true fina=
ncial condition and contributed to losses of more than $1.3 billion from th=
eir retirement funds.
Federal and Congressional investigators, along with legions of plaintiffs' =
lawyers, are engaged in a fierce and competitive search for evidence of wro=
ngdoing at the accounting firm in its dealings with Enron, the Houston ener=
gy trader now in bankruptcy court. Andersen, after all, could conceivably s=
atisfy at least some of Enron's creditors.=20
It is not easy to determine how much Andersen is worth or how much it could=
 pay to satisfy the various lawsuits if it loses or chooses to settle. But =
claims of more than $1 billion, as identified in yesterday's suit, could co=
me dangerously close to wiping out the firm, said independent analysts who =
track the industry.=20
In public statements about the impact of Enron's collapse Joseph F. Berardi=
no, Andersen's chief executive, has emphasized that the firm's clients are =
standing by it and that its employees are trying to focus on the firm's wor=
k. ''We are meeting with our clients every day,'' Mr. Berardino said on ''M=
eet the Press'' on Sunday. ''Our clients know what we really stand for, and=
 our clients are standing by us because we do great work.''=20
Like the other Big Five accounting firms, Andersen is a private partnership=
 and does not have to disclose much information about its financial conditi=
on.=20
''They like to be under the radar screen,'' said Arthur W. Bowman, editor o=
f Bowman's Accounting Report.=20
Some general information has been amassed by accounting industry analysts a=
nd lawyers who have been involved in litigation against the Big Five firms.=
=20
Andersen's first line of defense is its insurance. While that amount is a c=
losely guarded secret -- plaintiffs' lawyers would dearly love to know how =
much coverage an accounting firm has so that they could settle lawsuits for=
 the full amount of the policy -- some of the firm's peers described, in ge=
neral terms, what that insurance looks like.=20
Big accounting firms generally have an outside insurance policy of $100 mil=
lion to $300 million. That policy would come with a sizable deductible, too=
 -- probably $50 million to $100 million. Above that, some firms self-insur=
e, for example by setting up ''captive'' offshore subsidiaries that sell in=
surance back to the parent firm. (Setting up such a company offshore confer=
s certain benefits on the subsidiary, like a smaller required capital inves=
tment by the parent.)=20
Until June 1998, the Big Five firms pooled insurance funds, so that a big i=
nsurance payout by one firm could affect another. That system is no longer =
in effect and would not be invoked in any Enron-related lawsuits because th=
ey have all been filed well after 1998, said executives at a big firm.=20
Next would come the firm's capital, a figure very difficult to determine. P=
artnership capital is the result of payments made by the a ners. Consulting=
 partners may be compensated differently from auditing partners, as are dif=
ferent partners in different cities. But when an auditor is first promoted =
to partner, he must pay a portion of his compensation into the firm, essent=
ially buying a stake in the company. That first payment could amount to nea=
rly all of his compensation, probably $150,000 to $250,000 a year. In later=
 years, those partners would probably plow a smaller portion of their compe=
nsation back into the firm to cover operating expenses.=20
The firm's capital base, consisting of assets, like furniture, computers an=
d offices, and cash, might total $1.5 billion to $2 billion, said accountan=
ts familiar with the Big Five, but plaintiffs' lawyers said that liquidatin=
g the firm would be difficult. The firm could also draw on lines of credit =
from lenders for some unknown amount, while it rebuilt capital. Some analys=
ts said, however, that partners were more likely to choose to disband than =
to try to rebuild a depleted capital base with loans or their own money.=20
The firm could raise money by selling off business lines, said Melvyn I. We=
iss, whose law firm, Milberg Weiss Hynes Bershad & Lerach, is one of severa=
l that have filed suits against Enron executives and Andersen. ''Maybe they=
 can sell the firm, or pieces of it,'' he said.=20
Because Andersen is a limited liability partnership, it is unlikely that an=
y plaintiff could collect from a partner's personal assets, unless that par=
tner was directly involved in wrongdoing that led to the firm's liability. =
For example, partners intimately involved in the Enron account could concei=
vably be found personally liable in a shareholder lawsuit, lawyers said.=20
''It's unclear where the chain of liability would end,'' said David J. McCa=
be, a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York. ''But clearly the par=
tner who was responsible for supervision'' would be at risk, he said.=20
Of course, Andersen's ability to survive depends on how it fares in lawsuit=
s as well as how its business does. It is too early to tell whether clients=
 are jumping to some of the firm's rivals, though some other big firms say =
that they have picked up a smattering of Andersen clients.=20
The other risk to the firm is a loss of personnel as the Enron scandal drag=
s on. While many headhunters said they had not yet seen a flurry of resumes=
, Dean McMann, chief executive of the Ransford Group, which advises account=
ing firms, said he had received more than 1,000 e-mail messages and phone c=
alls from Andersen employees curious about the job market for them.=20
''The only reason you want to know what's happening in the market is you wa=
nt to be in the market,'' Mr. McMann said. ''It's not a very good market ri=
ght now.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OFFICE
Morale and Occupancy Are Low At the Headquarters in Houston
By DAVID BARBOZA

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- Inside the glass-sheathed 50-story Enron headquarters h=
ere, the televisions that once carried news and financial channels in the e=
levators have been turned off. ''ETV is under construction,'' the monitors =
now read.=20
''They don't want to make people more nervous than they are already,'' expl=
ained one former executive who has visited the building since he was laid o=
ff in December after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. ''It's ve=
ry, very grim.''
This is the new face of the Enron Corporation, once the world's biggest ene=
rgy trader but now a skeleton of its old self. Not long ago, 7,000 people w=
orked for the company in downtown Houston. Now only about 4,000 of the fait=
hful are left. Entire units have been decimated; whole floors are practical=
ly deserted.=20
For weeks after the filing, Keith Couch had the 27th floor virtually to him=
self. People would stop by and notice the lone figure tapping away at a key=
board. They would laugh, giggle and point at the rows of empty desks that s=
uggested a neutron bomb had been set off.=20
''It's been dead here for a while,'' said Mr. Couch, 34, who works in the i=
nformation technology group at Enron and has since moved to a more populate=
d floor. ''It's not like being in a funeral, but it's quiet -- real quiet,'=
' he said. ''The place I used to work isn't here anymore.''=20
These days, Enron is being carved up; its accounting is being scrutinized b=
y litigants, and its corridors are even being prowled by F.B.I. agents, pho=
tographing documents and hoping to prevent important information from reach=
ing the shredding machines.=20
Two days after a former employee gave lawyers a box full of shredded financ=
ial documents, the kind of papers the company warned people not to destroy,=
 both Enron and the F.B.I have stepped up security. The 19th and 20th floor=
s, which once housed the accounting offices and even some employees from Ar=
thur Andersen working on internal auditing, are now under guard. Stairway a=
ccess was sealed on Tuesday.=20
This is the humbled face of the new Enron, beleaguered, embattled and under=
 siege. Legions of class-action lawyers are in town meeting at the Four Sea=
sons Hotel, drafting new strategies on how to pull valuable financial docum=
ents out of the building. And government investigators of all types are als=
o here, combing through the financial ruins of a company that rose to No. 7=
 on the Fortune 500 list, albeit because of revenue that some now say was i=
nflated.=20
The media hordes come and go, often straddling all corners around 1400 Smit=
h Street, where a giant ''E,'' tipped on its side as a corporate emblem, se=
nds a dual message about a company that once defied gravity and now relucta=
ntly succumbs to it.=20
''People are nervous about being there,'' said a former executive who has k=
ept in touch with friends and colleagues inside the building. ''They still =
feel guilty about being there.''=20
This was once the home of the old- economy company that went new economy --=
 a dot-com energy company that acted like a Wall Street trading house and b=
oldly told competitors they were ''dinosaurs'' and Enron was going to eat t=
heir lunch.=20
Today, Enron cannot afford the new $200 million 40-story corporate tower un=
der construction across the street. It was supposed to relieve the congesti=
on in the main headquarters tower . Now, the company is moving employees ov=
er from 3 Allen Center, a nearby tower where it has long housed other worke=
rs.=20
''It definitely feels empty,'' said one worker who asked not to be named. '=
'You feel a lot of things are missing. And morale is kind of low.''=20
Enron recently sold off its profitable energy and power trading group to UB=
S in exchange for promises of about a third of the pretax profits. Soon Enr=
on will also lose the natural gas pipeline that Dynegy is to get after the =
failed merger between the companies.=20
Away from its headquarters, many companies acquired by Enron along the way =
are trying to conduct business as usual. But it isn't easy. Portland Genera=
l Electric, a utility that serves northern Oregon, has not been forced to l=
ay off any of its 2,700 employees. But with the Enron stock price in the ba=
sement, so are many employees' retirement hopes.=20
''I've been climbing poles and doing line work since 1966,'' said Roy Rinar=
d, 54, whose 401(k) plan once was worth as much as $472,000. ''Now I'm sitt=
ing here with basically $12,000 to show for it.''=20
Mr. Rinard said the uncertainty hanging over the utility's future made it h=
ard to focus on work. ''Everyone is concerned about the direction we're goi=
ng, whether we're going to be broken apart and separated or remain an intac=
t utility,'' he said.=20
The broadband unit, which was supposed to offer high-speed telecommunicatio=
ns services, came unglued even before Enron's Chapter 11 filing. Nine month=
s ago, it employed about 1,000 people. Now, there is virtually no one in th=
e unit. The trading floor for another unit, Enron Global Markets, is idle -=
- a room of computers but no heads.=20
The average passer-by might not notice anything unusual from outside the En=
ron headquarters, but inside the building seems less cramped. This afternoo=
n, a little coffee shop on the ground floor, which used to be crowded at 4 =
p.m. with chattering and deal-making employees, had just two patrons.=20
''The elevators used to be so crowded,'' said Jeff Snyder, 24, a former emp=
loyee who has gone back into the building recently. ''Now you get one and y=
ou ride by yourself.''=20
One can see a pleasant but more stoic look on the faces of Enron people.=20
Many remember that just months ago there was an energy about the place. The=
re was the fast pace, the giddiness of riding with a company whose stock we=
nt to the moon in 1999 and 2000.=20
A giant banner hanging in the Enron lobby had proclaimed, ''From the World'=
s Leading Energy Company to the World's Leading Company!'' After Sept. 11, =
it was replaced by an American flag; and that was probably a good thing bec=
ause by now it would serve only as a daily reminder of how grossly overconf=
ident the company once was.=20
Down in the lobby, where security guards carefully keep unwelcome visitors =
at bay, an electrified ''E'' inside the lobby still twirls, and the ticker =
showing Enron's stock price is still aglow. But today, the price of Enron's=
 stock, which has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, scrolled =
across at 34 cents a share, down 9 cents.=20
The new Enron is filled with people moving into what is now its lone buildi=
ng to fill the gaps. On many floors, there is no receptionist and there are=
 empty cubicles.=20
Of course, Enron still has three major natural gas pipelines, it still owns=
 Portland General Electric (though it is being sold), and it still has Enro=
n Wind and Enron Energy Services, which delivers energy to commercial and i=
ndustrial companies.=20
But the legal department was chopped, and so were human resources, accounti=
ng, tax and corporate services. And fewer people are on hand to field news =
media calls.=20
''We just moved; we got smaller,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. ''=
We had 27; now we have 7.''=20
More than 100 Arthur Andersen people have departed, some before and some af=
ter Enron said this month that it would fire the company as its auditor.=20
To lighten up the place, Elicia de la Cruz had a baby shower in the payroll=
 department today. Coming out of the building this afternoon, her friend Pa=
uline Sanchez said the shower had brought some smiles.=20
''It was a nice change,'' she said.=20
Still, life goes on. The credit union is open, and so is a small supermarke=
t where workers can get fresh deli meats. The health club was closed for a =
while but is now open again, though the $10 monthly membership fee has been=
 increased to $25.=20
Representatives of the news media are eager to get into 1400 Smith Street. =
Some chase Enron employees to their cars. Not long ago, a photographer paid=
 an Enron employee to smuggle in a camera to photograph the place. Security=
 seized the camera.=20
The people who are photographing, though, are agents from the F.B.I., who t=
oday were on the 19th and 20th floors. ''It's kind of weird,'' one Enron em=
ployee said. ''They say we're exhibit No. 102.''=20
The company used to give regular video updates on the building under constr=
uction next door, even with skits by the ''building guy.''=20
''The joke was,'' one employee said, ''that the building guy would be repla=
ced by the bankruptcy guy.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CRITICS
Sharpton, in Houston, Calls Attention to the Workers
By MICHAEL BRICK

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- The Rev. Al Sharpton pulled up to RJ's Rib Joint this a=
fternoon to meet with local ministers, a state representative, an N.A.A.C.P=
. official and a victim of the Enron collapse.=20
Local television cameramen were waiting under the veranda. The three palm t=
rees looked a little out of place.
''I'm here because I'm very concerned about the employees and the investors=
,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''As the investigation goes forward, somebody needs =
to step forward and call on the government to bail out the victims.''=20
Then the cameras turned on Mary Behn, the Enron victim. The local ministers=
 shepherded her inside to a private dining room to prepare for a full-blown=
 news conference. Just about everyone but Mr. Sharpton tried the ribs. Mr. =
Sharpton stuck to the chicken. A couple dining in the main room did not ini=
tially recognize him as he passed by, they said, because he had lost so muc=
h weight.=20
The Enron debacle has made Houston the center of a certain kind of temporal=
 universe, and Mr. Sharpton has recognized an unusual opportunity for his b=
rand of social criticism.=20
So has the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who said in a telephone interview that he=
 would arrive in Houston Thursday night and conduct several meetings with f=
ired workers under the auspices of his Operation PUSH organization.=20
Mr. Jackson said he would remain here through Friday, in hopes of meeting w=
ith Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive. ''I think one thing that Ken L=
ay and President Bush should agree on is that these workers need to be made=
 whole,'' he said.=20
There has been talk of the two ministers jostling for pre-eminence on issue=
s of social justice; all that Mr. Jackson's local representative, William-P=
aul Michael, would say on that score about Mr. Sharpton's visit was, ''it's=
 interesting that he is here just before reverend's here.''=20
So Mr. Sharpton has a one-day head start on Mr. Jackson.=20
After lunch, Mr. Sharpton escorted Ms. Behn before the cameras to tell her =
story. She worked at Enron for 15 years. She is a single parent with a chil=
d in college. Her stock is worthless and she has no income.=20
''We want to be able to start our lives over again,'' she said. ''We thank =
Mr. Sharpton for allowing himself to be present to help.''=20
And Mr. Sharpton had one last point to make.=20
''The laryngitis that the leading Democrats have had on this issue to me is=
 frightening,'' he said. Democrats and Republicans alike plan numerous hear=
ings into Enron's collapse, with one scheduled Thursday in each house of Co=
ngress.=20
Mr. Sharpton and local ministers plan to bring other former Enron employees=
 and stockholders to a meeting next week and then to Washington, but for no=
w they have just Ms. Behn. Mr. Sharpton said that because everyone was focu=
sed on the investigation, the workers' troubles were being overlooked. Many=
 of these workers do at least have savings and job prospects.=20
Still, said Michael P. Williams, the pastor of the Joy Tabernacle here and =
one of the ministers who met with Mr. Sharpton, ''people define themselves =
by what they do -- when you stop being that, after 15 years, after 20 years=
, that's a big blow.''=20
Back in the private meeting room, as everyone was finishing sides of potato=
 salad (Mr. Sharpton opted for the baked potato), the Rev. James W. E. Dixo=
n said that former Enron workers in his church were asking for advice about=
 their careers and their assets.=20
Mr. Sharpton said the workers deserved remuneration because regulation fail=
ed. And he sees his own opportunity here, too.=20
''As I explore running for president,'' he said, ''it is interesting that n=
one of the other candidates have been here.''=20
Told that Mr. Jackson will be here Thursday, he said: ''Maybe. But he isn't=
 running for president.''

Jan. 23, 2002, 11:55PM
The government failed to protect investors from the downfall of Enron and t=
herefore should find money to help those who lost their savings in the corp=
oration's collapse, the Rev. Al Sharpton said Wednesday.=20
"Somebody must stand up" for those people, Sharpton said at a news conferen=
ce on the steps outside Enron. "There must be a commitment by the governmen=
t to bail them out."=20
If the government can afford to bail out airlines and other struggling corp=
orations, he said, "they can certainly find money for victims who would not=
 have been victimized if the government had protected them."=20
The Rev. James Dixon, president of the Texas chapter of the National Action=
 Network, and Larry Green, district director for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson L=
ee, D-Houston, also attended.=20
Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said he came to Houston=
 after talking with Dixon about the effect of Enron's collapse.=20
"The ripple effect in the community is huge," said Dixon, of Houston's Comm=
unity of Faith Baptist Church. He noted scores of families in his and other=
 churches who have suffered critical financial wounds in the wake of Enron'=
s collapse.=20
Green said Jackson Lee was in Washington Wednesday, introducing legislation=
 to ensure a disaster like Enron's collapse will never happen again.=20
Sharpton and Dixon have scheduled a town hall meeting for 7 p.m. Wednesday =
at Community of Faith Baptist Church, 1024 Pinemont.=20

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Taking Stock of Enron

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The first two of at least eight Congressional hearings on Enron kick off to=
day, an embarrassment of political riches. We're as curious as anybody to l=
earn what was going on behind Enron's accounting kimono, but in the meantim=
e we've been taking a peek ourselves at other parts of the company's anatom=
y.=20
In particular, we've looked into the alleged problems with Enron's pension =
plan, the source of much hot populist rage. What we've learned is that, at =
least in this part of the Enron debacle, the reality isn't nearly as awful =
as some of the headlines. Consider some of the facts:
-- Enron's pension plans followed standard practices of most big, publicly =
traded firms. Enron offered several arrangements -- from employee stock-opt=
ion plans to defined benefits -- but the one that has everybody outraged is=
 its 401(k).=20
Enron's employees could set aside up to 15% of their pretax salary in a 401=
(k), up to the IRS limit of $10,500 last year; they could put the cash into=
 one of 20 different investment vehicles, including mutual funds and a brok=
erage account. Workers controlled this money in their own self-directed acc=
ounts and were free to switch among investments or even cash out (with a ta=
x penalty).=20
Enron had about 24,000 workers world-wide before bankruptcy and about half =
of them participated in the 401(k). So we're talking about 11,000 employees=
 and a plan with about $1 billion in total assets, of which from $500 milli=
on to $600 million was invested in Enron stock.=20
-- Enron also matched up to half of these worker contributions, up to 6% of=
 base pay. But it matched in Enron stock, and employees were required to ho=
ld this matched stock until age 50. That limitation has come in for critici=
sm, but keep in mind the stock was free. Some politicians want to stop comp=
anies from matching in stock, but the danger is that they then won't match =
at all.=20
This arrangement is also fairly typical of big plans. About half match with=
 company stock and half with cash. General Electric's plan offers a cash ma=
tch, for instance, but about three-quarters of its workers use that money t=
o buy company stock.=20
-- Contrary to the headlines, Enron employees were not forced to watch help=
lessly as the value of their stock cratered, trapped by a malicious "lockdo=
wn."=20
A lockdown, more properly a "transaction suspension period," occurs when co=
mpanies change record keepers. Transactions are barred for a time so the ne=
w record keeper can verify account accuracy and make a reconciliation. Lock=
downs can last anywhere from a few days to two months, depending on the siz=
e of the plan, its complexity and the sophistication of the record keepers.=
 Last year, 24,000 private investment plans changed record keepers.=20
Most important, Enron notified employees of the coming lockdown several tim=
es -- first by mail and then by four separate e-mails. Enron shares were st=
ill trading in the $30 range at this time, when workers had ample opportuni=
ty to sell. The lockdown itself started Oct. 26 and ended Nov. 13, so worke=
rs were locked out for only 11 stock-trading days. And during that time Enr=
on's stock fell from $15.40 to $9.30, a rather small decline for a stock th=
at had already lost almost 70% of its value during 2001.=20
-- 401(k) plans do not promote dangerously undiversified portfolios. Divers=
ification is an important financial tool, permitting investors to reduce ri=
sk without reducing expected returns. In long-term financial planning, it m=
akes excellent sense to hold a portfolio that is diversified across a range=
 of assets.=20
But diversification is also a highly individual thing. Strategies depend mo=
stly on age; a person nearing retirement should hold fewer risky assets tha=
n one starting a career. But after adjusting for age, all assets should be =
considered together. For example, a person who is heavily invested in real =
estate might want to achieve balance by a single-minded approach in other v=
ehicles, like ginning up her 401(k) for equities.=20
That doesn't mean holding 100% of equities in company stock is a great idea=
. But then again if the rest of an investor's equity portion is well-divers=
ified, such a concentration isn't crazy. In hindsight, a 100% concentration=
 in Microsoft made a lot of sense and lot of millionaires. A 100% concentra=
tion in Enron also made sense for a while; from January 1998 to January 200=
1, Enron's shares increased fivefold.=20
-- Enron's 401(k) experience does not indicate that the plan is fiendishly =
flawed and government must step in to correct it. If workers knew Enron's t=
rue condition, they would no doubt have declined to invest in company stock=
 in their self-directed accounts. The problem is that they didn't know the =
true condition of Enron, but then neither did the credit rating agencies, v=
arious federal overseers, stock analysts, auditors and (possibly) even much=
 of its senior management. This was a failure in truth-telling and truth-fe=
rreting out and it was system wide.=20
All of which means that while the Enron pension story is tragic, it's more =
about specific corporate blunders and wrongdoing than it is about flaws in =
pension law or in 401(k)s. It's certainly no excuse for Congress to lobotom=
ize a private pension system that has given millions of Americans a comfort=
able retirement.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: RETURNS UNDER SCRUTINY
Senate Finance Panel Wants Tax Information From Enron
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The Senate Finance Committee yesterday asked Enron to disclose its corporat=
e income tax returns.=20
In a letter to the chief financial officer of Enron, Senator Max Baucus, De=
mocrat of Montana, who is chairman of the committee, and Senator Charles E.=
 Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican, said ''it is critical that the p=
ublic and the Congress have a more informed understanding of the activities=
 and transactions related to Enron's tax returns and pension programs.''
The New York Times reported last week that Enron paid no taxes on its profi=
ts in four of the last five years and was eligible for $382 million of refu=
nds. Enron created 881 partnerships in the Cayman Islands and other tax hav=
ens, most of which also have strict bank secrecy laws, actions the Finance =
Committee plans to examine in hearings that may begin as soon as March.=20
Vance Mayer, an Enron spokesman, had no comment.=20
Several leading tax lawyers said they saw no benefit to Enron in making its=
 tax returns public.=20
Mortimer Caplin, the Kennedy administration's tax commissioner, said, ''I w=
ould try to resist them as much as I could if I was representing Enron.''=
=20
Six other Washington tax lawyers, some of whom represent Enron or its credi=
tors, agreed. ''Disclosure would just lead to more questions, and that won'=
t help Enron,'' said one of the lawyers, who insisted on anonymity.=20
Federal law allows the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means C=
ommittee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to inspect any tax return, but=
 requires that they do so in closed session. The committees are not allowed=
 to disclose what they glean from tax returns, and for that reason, some co=
mmittee tax experts refuse to inspect actual returns. Disclosure of informa=
tion on the returns is a felony.=20
The letter from the two senators took note of their committee's authority t=
o inspect the returns in closed session. They said their request was a cour=
tesy ''to allow Enron an opportunity to provide the public a better underst=
anding of the events at Enron.''=20
Mr. Baucus, in an interview, said that he hoped Enron would decide ''to wor=
k on a solid constructive basis with the committee.''=20
''This is not a witch hunt,'' Senator Baucus said. ''I want to get the fact=
s and work with the company if they want to work with us.''=20
He said that if a closed-door review of the income tax returns showed that =
Enron had complied with all tax laws, he would then focus on changing those=
 laws so that corporations could not eliminate income taxes through the use=
 of partnerships in tax havens.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: POLITICAL MEMO
In Personal Anecdote, Some See New Distance Where Others See New Strategy
By RICHARD L. BERKE

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 -- To listen to President Bush, it was almost as if an =
epiphany involving his mother-in-law drove him to turn on the Enron Corpora=
tion, his most generous political benefactor. In assailing Enron on a trip =
Tuesday to Belle, W.Va., Mr. Bush said, ''My own mother-in-law'' lost all o=
f her investment when the company's stock collapsed.=20
But people close to Mr. Bush said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, served as=
 a convenient device for him to distance himself from the Enron debacle and=
 to appear more empathetic to its investors and employees than to the wealt=
hy business executives who escaped the Enron collapse with flush bank accou=
nts.
White House officials insisted that there was no change of emphasis -- or h=
eart -- and noted that Mr. Bush's newly disparaging comments about Enron, a=
nd his mother-in-law's experience, came in response to reporters' questions=
.=20
''This was definitely not a predetermined strategy shift of any sort,'' sai=
d Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''It's the same thing h=
e's been saying in private meetings and conversations with staff for the pa=
st month.''=20
Yet other advisers to Mr. Bush said the president had recently discussed wi=
th Karen P. Hughes, his counselor, and a tight circle of aides, that he nee=
ded to move more aggressively -- and in a much more public way -- to distan=
ce the White House from Enron and its chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay.=20
They said Mr. Bush was in part responding to many of his friends in Texas w=
here, in the words of one adviser, ''This has really put a gash in the fabr=
ic of the community.'' More pragmatically, they said polling for the Republ=
ican Party has shown that Mr. Bush's relationship to energy companies is on=
e of his biggest vulnerabilities.=20
In addition, they said, the White House did not want to end up too much on =
the defensive, as often happened when controversies swirled around Presiden=
t Bill Clinton. Already, Congressional Republicans appeared to be moving ah=
ead of Mr. Bush by announcing that they were returning their Enron donation=
s -- while the president was still expressing remorse over the collapse.=20
''It changed the terms of the debate to Bush's family being a victim,'' Sco=
tt Reed, a Republican strategist, said of Mr. Bush's remarks, ''and for the=
 first time it gives the Republicans the high ground on the Enron mess. I w=
as with a lot of Democrats at lunch today, and they saw it as a turning poi=
nt.''=20
An outside adviser to Mr. Bush said, ''They don't want Bush to appear to be=
 aloof and focused only on the big financial problems of Enron.''=20
Other Republicans were more skeptical, suggesting that Mr. Bush's hasty ret=
reat from his friendship with Mr. Lay -- and his fresh outrage over Enron -=
- was transparent.=20
A longtime Bush adviser said: ''He doesn't necessarily turn on people but h=
e cuts them off. This is cut and run.'' He added, ''It was a little gratuit=
ous invoking his mother-in-law.''=20
Yet by mentioning his mother-in-law, Mr. Bartlett said, the president under=
scores that he is sympathetic to the personal and financial havoc brought o=
n by Enron's collapse.=20
''It shows that he does understand that the typical investor and the everyd=
ay employees of Enron were really hurt by this,'' he said.=20
Specifically, Mr. Bush told reporters on Tuesday: ''What I'm outraged about=
 is that shareholders and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron. =
My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anything =
now. If she had known all the facts, I don't know what her decision would h=
ave been made, but she didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareholders=
 didn't know all the facts.''=20
Still, it can be treacherous for presidents, or would-be presidents, to try=
 to personalize problems of ordinary Americans to their own lives. Al Gore'=
s citing of the price of his mother-in-law's arthritis medicine backfired. =
(He said she paid nearly three times as much for it as the same medicine us=
ed by his ailing dog, Shiloh.) And the audience burst into laughter at a pr=
esidential debate when President Jimmy Carter said he chatted about nuclear=
 weaponry with his daughter, Amy.=20
''This is very dangerous for the president,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a Dem=
ocratic pollster. ''I don't know that the president can attack Enron and be=
 plausible or authentic. It will not take away the close relationships betw=
een Enron and Arthur Andersen and the administration. It will look like hyp=
ocrisy.''=20
Asserting that Mr. Bush did not suddenly bring up the anecdote about his mo=
ther-in-law, Mr. Bartlett said he first heard the president mention it at a=
 private meeting of the White House economic team on Jan. 10. He also said =
that had the response been orchestrated, there would have been no need for =
Ms. Hughes to call him at the White House from West Virginia to seek more d=
etails about Ms. Welch's $8,000 Enron investment.=20
''When Karen called me from the road, she said, 'Can you get the details on=
 the Enron stock?' '' Mr. Bartlett said. ''We didn't have the details. It's=
 not something we had all in the can. We had to call the accountant.'' (In =
fact, after gleaning new details, White House officials ended up correcting=
 Mr. Bush on the timing of his mother-in-law's investment.)=20
Beyond the political imperatives, White House advisers said Mr. Bush has be=
en affected by the concerns expressed by many of his closest friends in the=
 energy business.=20
''He's hearing from all kinds of people in Texas on this thing,'' said a cl=
ose friend of Mr. Bush. ''You can't be in the Houston community without see=
ing the devastation, and those stories are getting out.''=20
Some advisers to Mr. Bush said he did not act sooner to denounce Enron beca=
use he and his aides were inundated with questions about ties between the a=
dministration and Enron officials.=20
To reinforce Mr. Bush's determination to side with the stockholders and Enr=
on employees, Mr. Reed said the president's mother-in-law should join inves=
tors who are suing Enron.=20
''The logical next step for the White House is to have the mother-in-law jo=
in this class-action suit,'' Mr. Reed said. ''That's the way to cement this=
 baby.''

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- The Labor Department is reviewing whether the Enron Cor=
poration acted properly when it told its employees they could not sell Enro=
n shares in their retirement accounts at a time when the shares' value was =
evaporating, agency officials said today.=20
Specifically, investigators are reviewing the actions of everyone who was r=
esponsible for administering the company's 401(k) retirement savings progra=
m.
Enron employees who were laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy la=
st month say in a class- action lawsuit that their rights were violated by =
a ''lockdown'' that prevented them from selling their shares after the comp=
any announced a third-quarter loss of $638 million, causing the stock to tu=
mble.=20
Ann L. Combs, the assistant secretary of labor in charge of the Pension and=
 Welfare Benefits Administration, which oversees and enforces federal laws =
governing employee pensions and health plans, said that 20,795 Enron employ=
ees held $2.1 billion in the company's 401(k) plan at the end of the year 2=
000, 63 percent of which was in Enron stock.=20
At that time, 7,600 people held another $1 billion worth of Enron stock as =
part of the employee stock ownership plan, Ms. Combs said, and 20,000 peopl=
e were enrolled in a defined-benefit pension plan, with assets of $270 mill=
ion that are federally guaranteed and not involved in the bankruptcy. Some =
employees could have belonged to more than one program.=20
''This investigation will take time,'' Ms. Combs said today. ''It involves =
collecting tens of thousands of documents, interviewing people, and trying =
to make sure we've nailed down all the facts.''=20
The secretary of labor, Elaine L. Chao, said her agency had begun investiga=
ting Enron two weeks before it filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, a=
nd she vowed today to do what she could to protect workers ''who have seen =
their retirement savings evaporate.''=20
Speaking at a briefing in Washington, linked by telephone to reporters acro=
ss the nation, Ms. Chao said she was working with Donald Evans, the commerc=
e secretary, and Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasury, to recomme=
nd to President Bush changes in the laws that are intended to protect worke=
r benefits.=20
Her agency is looking into the possibility of civil and criminal violations=
 at Enron, she said.=20
Enron maintains that it sent letters to all employees on Oct. 4 -- 12 days =
before the third-quarter loss was announced -- saying accounts would be fro=
zen starting Oct. 29 while the administration of the plan was switched to a=
 new company. Enron says the change was planned for months and lasted only =
10 days, a period in which the stock fell $3.83.=20
But e-mail messages released by Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer in Washington wh=
o represents some employees, include a Sept. 27 message to all employees sa=
ying that the lockdown would begin on Oct. 19 and last about a month. Mr. G=
ottesdiener has said that the e-mail message misled employees so that they =
did not sell shares in a week in which the stock fell $10.65. Enron shares,=
 which were above $90 in August 2000, are now worth less than 50 cents.=20
Ms. Combs said such freezes ''are very common'' when plans change recordkee=
pers. But those responsible are required to protect the participants and be=
neficiaries, she said.

WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's probe into the Enron debacle has focus=
ed on a period when participants in the company's 401(k) retirement plan we=
re barred from selling their Enron stock, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said =
Wednesday.=20
It is important, Chao said, that the government "protect Enron workers who =
have seen their retirement benefits evaporate."=20
Employees, ex-employees and retirees were unable to sell some of their Enro=
n shares for 10 days in late October and early November, at a time when the=
 stock price was nosediving.=20
The regulators' task will be to determine whether the company's decisions w=
hen handling the 401(k) plan were prudent and reasonable.=20
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer declined to comment on the department's investi=
gation, except to note that the company first notified the plan participant=
s in early October, 3 1/2 weeks before the "blackout" period.=20
Labor Department officials began looking into the company's collapse on Nov=
. 16, when regulators first became concerned Enron might be headed to bankr=
uptcy.=20
Labor officials would not say Wednesday when they expect to complete the pr=
obe, although Ann Combs, the assistant secretary for the Pension and Welfar=
e Benefits Administration noted: "This investigation will take some time."=
=20
Plan participants were blocked from selling their shares because Enron had =
hired a new administrator to handle the record-keeping for the retirement s=
avings plan.=20
The period -- also called a lockdown -- was supposed to facilitate a smooth=
 transition when Chicago-based Northern Trust Co. turned over records to th=
e new administrator, Lincolnshire, Ill.-based Hewitt Associates.=20
"It was a transition that was in the works for months," Meyer said.=20
Lockdowns are not uncommon when companies change plan administrators, Labor=
 officials said Wednesday.=20
On Oct. 4, 2001, Enron officials told employees the lockdown period would b=
egin on Sunday, Oct. 28, and continue until Nov. 20. But with the stock pri=
ce falling, Enron employees started pressing management to alter its plans.=
=20
In an e-mail to employees on Oct. 25, the company's benefits department not=
ed: "We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July. We und=
erstand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as=
 short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the plan=
 in total and your account in particular."=20
Company officials were able to cut short the transition period, although ma=
ny participants complained they received no notice that the blackout period=
 had been abbreviated.=20
Enron contributed stock amounting to 50 percent of the contributions each e=
mployee made to the plan, up to 6 percent of salary. Under the company's 40=
1(k) rules, only those employees aged 50 and over could sell those matching=
 shares.=20
During the lockdown period, no Enron stock in the 401(k) plan could be sold=
, even stock employees had bought on their own.=20
Some employees have complained they had their entire life savings invested =
in Enron stock and lost everything when the energy and trading giant tumble=
d into bankruptcy court.=20
At the end of 2000, nearly 21,000 current and former Enron employees partic=
ipated in the company's 401(k), the Labor Department said. About 63 percent=
 of the $1.6 billion worth of assets in the plan at that time were invested=
 in Enron stock, the vast majority of which were non-matching shares employ=
ees had purchased on their own.=20
Enron also offered two other retirement plans, a more traditional, defined-=
benefits pension plan and an employee stock-ownership plan.=20
At the end of 2000, about 20,000 current and former employees participated =
in the pension plan, with assets of about $270 million, none of it invested=
 in Enron shares.=20
About 7,650 were enrolled in the stock-ownership plan. At the end of 2000, =
their shares were worth about $1 billion.=20
Federal regulations require that companies offering traditional, defined-be=
nefit plans invest those funds in a diversified portfolio. No more than 10 =
percent of a plan's funds can be invested in a particular stock.=20
Congress, however, specifically excluded 401(k) employee contribution plans=
 from those rules. In the wake of the Enron debacle, lawmakers now are cons=
idering whether to force employees to diversify their 401(k) portfolios as =
well.=20
Also on Tuesday, a group of Enron employees filed suit in federal court in =
Houston accusing a slate of Enron executives, as well as the accounting fir=
m Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, of racketeering.=20
By conspiring to hide Enron's true financial position, the suit alleges, th=
e Enron executives and Andersen caused employees to lose their retirement f=
unds.=20
A group of four Enron employees first filed suit last fall. On Tuesday, ano=
ther 96 employees added their names to that complaint and raised the racket=
eering allegations for the first time.=20
The employees are hoping to have their case certified as a class action.=20
Steve Berman, an attorney representing the employees, said the workers coul=
d not sue Enron itself, since the corporation has already sought protection=
 from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.=20
Among those named in the suit are Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who resigned Wedn=
esday, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andre=
w Fastow. The suit also names David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the =
Enron account.=20
Meyer declined to comment on the suit. A spokesman for Andersen declined im=
mediate comment.=20
A hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 25.=20

WASHINGTON -- Until recently, the flood of millions of working people into =
the stock market, principally through their retirement accounts, was hailed=
 as evidence that Americans at all economic levels can make it on their own=
.=20
Then Enron Corp. collapsed, throwing thousands out of work and destroying t=
he retirement nest eggs of thousands more. While investigators search for c=
lues of foul play, Washington is rushing in with legislative fixes--includi=
ng proposals to limit how much company stock can go into retirement account=
s.
For many, it is too late. The collapse of Enron's retirement arrangements i=
s only the latest in a series of similar financial fiascoes during the last=
 decade. But hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans continue=
 to shoulder the same kinds of risk borne by Enron workers before their sav=
ings evaporated.=20
"We're fooling ourselves if we think Enron is a scandal that doesn't have a=
nything to do with the rest of us," said Norman P. Stein, a member of the L=
abor Department's employee retirement advisory council and a University of =
Alabama law professor. "What happened to Enron workers could happen to you.=
"=20
The reason is a sea change in how Americans make financial provisions for t=
heir old age. Working people have turned the stock market into their retire=
ment system, and themselves, rather than their corporate employers, into re=
tirement money managers.=20
Individuals are now responsible for making the basic investment decisions f=
or half the nation's non-Social Security retirement savings, rather than ha=
ving those decisions made the old-fashioned way--by employers who promise b=
enefits no matter what.=20
That is up from a little more than one-third in the early 1990s. Individual=
s, together with big institutions, have pumped more than two-thirds of the =
nation's $10 trillion-plus in public and private retirement savings into st=
ocks.=20
So when the stock market takes off, as it did in the late 1990s, so does Am=
erica's retirement system. And when it tumbles, as it has in the last two y=
ears, so do retirement savings.=20
"We have a system that has succeeded in amassing a formidable pool of capit=
al and providing retirement benefits to millions of people," said J. Mark I=
wry, who as benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department until last yea=
r was one of the most powerful regulators of the retirement system in Washi=
ngton.=20
"On the other hand, the self-direction of investments has shifted the risk =
of retirement investment from employers to employees, and many workers have=
 ended up assuming imprudent amounts of it."=20
They often have done so without even knowing what they did.=20
Retirees Look Back at Costly Errors=20
Bill Quinlin certainly didn't.=20
The 65-year-old Robstown, Texas, resident retired from Enron several years =
ago, after nearly three decades as a gas pipeline operator, to care for his=
 dying mother. He had nearly all his retirement savings, save a small pensi=
on and Social Security, in 25,000 shares of Enron stock.=20
When the stock was at its height at better than $80 a share and Quinlin was=
 a paper millionaire, a friend suggested he sell some of his holdings.=20
But Quinlin said he could not bring himself to do it, largely because the p=
lace was being run by Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, who resign=
ed late Wednesday.=20
Lay had saved a utility where Quinlin once worked. And the executive had co=
me down every year or so while Quinlin was at the Corpus Christi pump stati=
on to take the men out for barbecue.=20
"I thought that guy walked on water," Quinlin said recently of Lay. "Why, i=
f he walked in here this minute, I'd probably sit right down and talk to hi=
m." Quinlin's shares have gone from being worth about $2 million to a coupl=
e of thousand.=20
Roger Boyce said he didn't understand the risks he was shouldering either, =
even though he is sophisticated in financial matters.=20
The 67-year-old Minneapolis-area resident retired from Enron in March 2000 =
after almost two decades as a benefits executive and another decade as a sa=
fety and security manager.=20
Boyce said he was well aware that the world of retirement savings was chang=
ing when Enron stopped offering old-fashioned pensions in the late 1980s an=
d replaced them with plans such as 401(k) accounts, to which it contributed=
 fixed amounts of stock, but made no promise of what benefits employees cou=
ld expect when they retired.=20
"I knew I had to manage these accounts, and I was aware the best protection=
 was diversification" out of Enron stock and into other stocks and mutual f=
unds, he said.=20
But Boyce ended up pumping about two-thirds of his retirement savings into =
Enron because of the company's rapidly rising stock. In any case, he reason=
ed, with the company in so many lines of business it represented a diversif=
ied investment all on its own. Even if one business line failed, another wo=
uld take its place.=20
"I know a normal person's question is: 'How stupid could you be?' " But it =
was difficult to resist, he said.=20
Like Quinlin, Boyce saw his Enron stock tumble almost $2 million in value. =
He and his wife, Marilyn, have been forced to scrap the idea of setting up =
trusts for their six grandchildren.=20
"It's very tough to swallow," he said.=20
It used to be that employees relied for retirement income on pensions in wh=
ich employers managed the funds, promised retirees a "defined benefit" and =
kept excess profits or losses to themselves. The shift to 401(k)s, IRAs and=
 employee stock ownership plans--in which employee contributions are define=
d but benefits are left to market forces--is usually portrayed as part of a=
 titanic struggle between an old, dying, paternalistic, industrial order an=
d a new, freedom-filled, entrepreneurial economy. And, in part, it has been=
 just that.=20
"When we first tried to sell the idea of the 401(k) to Bethlehem Steel in 1=
981, they said, 'You don't understand; it's part of our culture to take car=
e of our people,' " recounted Ted Benna, a Bellefonte, Pa., consultant who =
is widely considered the "father of the 401(k)."=20
"That paternalistic attitude has been blown away" by new technology, global=
ization and Reaganite politics, he said.=20
The only problem with the old-versus-new portrayal is that it overlooks two=
 crucial facts. The first, as even Benna will concede, is that 401(k)s and =
similar accounts were not originally intended to replace traditional pensio=
ns and grew in a piecemeal fashion. The second is that it was government ta=
x subsidies, as much as market forces and individual choice, that produced =
the new accounts. According to a variety of regulators and lawmakers, that =
gives Washington a big responsibility for making sure they are run well.=20
"Society has a lot riding on people's retirement savings," said Sen. Barbar=
a Boxer (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored legislation to restrict the proportion=
 of company stock such as Enron's in retirement accounts. "We're paying for=
 them with big tax breaks."=20
Indeed, the tax break for pensions and retirement savings is the very bigge=
st that Washington offers, topping such giants as the mortgage interest ded=
uction and the employer tax exclusion for employee health insurance, and am=
ounting to about $100 billion a year.=20
"Uncle Sam is the largest single investor in the retirement system and has =
a legitimate interest in how it works," said Iwry, the former Treasury offi=
cial.=20
Only it didn't work in the case of Enron. And, according to critics, it cou=
ld fail in the same way at some of the nation's other big companies.=20
In the investment world and at the casino, putting most of your chips on on=
e color--or most of your money in one stock--is a gamble.=20
Before the fall, fully 60% of the money in Enron's 401(k) plan was in Enron=
 stock. But that hardly qualified the company for the top slot when it come=
s to packing retirement plans with company stock.=20
At consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, the portion of P&G stock in the u=
nusually generous retirement plans exceeds 90%, according to D.C. Plan Inve=
sting, a financial newsletter. At Coca-Cola and General Electric, it is abo=
ut 80%. At McDonald's and Home Depot, it is just below 75%.=20
"The single-largest source of excessive risk for employees in retirement pl=
ans is undue concentration in employer stock," Iwry said.=20
Investment Industry Balks at Reform Efforts=20
Most congressional proposals for what to do about the problem run along one=
 of two lines: imposing limits on the amount of company stock allowed in pl=
ans or encouraging more investor education. Key critics, including 401(k) i=
nventor Benna, say that neither will work. In the case of stock limits, eve=
n some of the authors concede the measure falls far short of what is needed=
.=20
Boxer and Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) want to impose a 20% cap on company sto=
ck and reduce the tax break that companies would get when they contributed =
stock instead of cash. A similar House bill would reduce the cap to 10%.=20
Both proposals have met with howls of protest from the investment industry,=
 which argues that individuals should have the right to invest their money =
as they see fit.=20
Boxer is well acquainted with the argument; many of the same objections wer=
e raised when the California Democrat tried to win similar restrictions aft=
er floor retailer ColorTile Inc. went bankrupt five years ago, wiping out e=
mployees' 401(k) savings. Her measure was eventually so watered down it mad=
e almost no difference.=20
By contrast, the investment industry enthusiastically supports a bill by Re=
p. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) that would encourage companies and 401(k) provi=
ders such as mutual fund groups to offer education and financial advice by =
limiting their liability if their advice turns out to be bad.=20
Boehner acknowledged that his measure could pave the way for conflicts of i=
nterest such as mutual funds advising employees to buy the fund's products.=
 But he said the danger could be limited by requiring that the conflicts be=
 disclosed. He asserted that there were no parallels with Enron and others =
encouraging workers to invest in the companies' own stock.=20
"The lesson of Enron is diversify, diversify, diversify," Boehner said. "Wh=
at we've got to do is get that across to people by giving them broader know=
ledge and access to advice." Critics say the Boehner bill is an invitation =
for trouble.=20
Old-fashioned "defined benefit" plans follow diversification rules that go =
beyond company stock and a requirement that retirement savings be converted=
 to an annuity, or fixed annual payment, when people retire to ensure that =
they don't outlive their own finances and end up in poverty.=20
To date, no lawmakers, even sharp critics, have publicly proposed giving th=
e same kind of protections to 401(k)s and the "defined contribution" world.=
=20
The reason is clear: Such restrictions would fly in the face of the individ=
ual choice that has made 401(k)s so popular.=20
But there are signs that some people are beginning to move in that directio=
n.=20
Corzine, for example, said last week that the cap he and Boxer are proposin=
g for company stock should be extended to all assets in 401(k) plans so tha=
t individuals could not put more than 20% of their retirement savings in an=
y one investment. Benna is pushing a plan to give companies new protections=
 against employee lawsuits over retirement accounts if firms agree to effec=
tively direct employees' investment options to a few prearranged diversifie=
d portfolios.=20
"Nobody likes to say it, but people who don't know the difference between s=
tocks and bonds are being asked to pick particular ones," said Stein, the A=
labama law professor. "People are being given too many decisions to make."=
=20
During the late 1990s when the stock market was climbing 20% and 30% a year=
, such views would have been dismissed out of hand. But with stocks stumbli=
ng, the country under assault and polls showing Americans increasingly conc=
erned about "personal security," some believe there is a chance for change.

Heard on the Street
How to Predict The Next Fiasco In Accounting And Bail Early

So you're not a Wall Street analyst or professional short seller. Still, yo=
u do have some tools at hand for avoiding being caught in a stock that suff=
ers an accounting blowup.=20
While the highly publicized accounting problems at collapsed energy-trading=
 firm Enron are just the latest in a series of corporate accounting scandal=
s, there are numerous warning signs that skeptical investors use to protect=
 their money, and some are straightforward enough for individual investors =
to follow.
"After Enron, investors realize they have to question every financial state=
ment they get," says Murray Stahl, director of research at Horizon Research=
, a New York investment-research firm. If nothing else, the Enron debacle "=
will make the issue of accounting very important in the future."=20
Short sellers -- bearish investors who try to profit from a stock's decline=
 by selling borrowed shares in hopes of replacing them with shares bought l=
ater at a lower price -- see no shortage of occasions where their hard-nose=
d approach to financial analysis will come in handy. Thanks to factors such=
 as stock incentives for executives and auditors collecting fees for consul=
ting, "accounting now is worse that it ever has been," says Marc Cohodes, a=
 partner at Rocker Partners, a New York hedge fund.=20
Here are some red flags that such professional investors watch out for to g=
uard against potential trouble down the road:=20

Invoices Increasing, Sales Slipping: If a company's accounts receivables ar=
e growing faster than sales, that signals some concerns about the quality o=
f the sales. Among other things, swelling accounts receivable could indicat=
e "channel stuffing," or overselling to distributors to pad short-term fina=
ncial results.=20
Similarly, if inventories are growing faster than sales, that could signal =
a company isn't able to sell inventory as quickly as originally believed. D=
epending on the type of inventory, there might be the added risk of the inv=
entory becoming obsolete, resulting in write-downs.=20
In 1998, Sunbeam, a maker of household consumer products, restated earnings=
 downward for six previous quarters. The company, which had seen a surge in=
 accounts receivable, acknowledged that the original revenue had been prema=
turely booked, and it cited a variety of other accounting moves that were n=
ecessary to restate. Sunbeam had inflated sales of such things as barbecue =
grills by offering retailers low prices and easy cancellation terms, promis=
ing, say, to hold the grills in Sunbeam's warehouses for later delivery.=20
Dubbed a "massive financial fraud" by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n, the company filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February 2001.=20

Concentrate on Cash: The cash-flow statement tracks all the changes that af=
fect a company's cash position, be it cash flowing in from debt and stock o=
fferings, or cash flowing out in the form of dividends. It can also serve a=
s an indicator of potential chicanery inside a company's accounting.=20
A telltale sign of trouble is negative cash flow from operations while the =
company's so-called Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation a=
nd amortization) is positive. Short sellers note that in such a case, a com=
pany could be using accounting gimmickry to make its business look healthie=
r than it really is. If operating cash flow is negative, in reality the com=
pany is consuming cash rather than generating it, as its Ebitda figure woul=
d suggest.=20

Risky Returns: At the end of the day, what makes a stock move is its return=
 on capital -- how much profit a company generates off the assets it employ=
s, such as its cash, inventories and property, plants and equipment.=20
Most financial statements break apart a company's operations to show invest=
ors which segments generated which portion of sales and profits. By isolati=
ng individual segment returns, says one short-selling analyst, investors ca=
n determine where earnings are coming from and whether they seem fishy. A f=
ew simple calculations can reveal a lot.=20
Consider Mirant, an energy peer of Enron. As part of its balance sheet, the=
 Atlanta company shows assets and liabilities "from risk management activit=
ies," both current and noncurrent. Subtract the liabilities from the assets=
, the analyst notes, and Mirant has $80 million of equity in that business.=
 As part of the footnote attached to those balance-sheet items, Mirant note=
d that it generated essentially $221 million off those assets during the th=
ird quarter.=20
That kind of stunning return, about 275%, is hard for any company to sustai=
n, raising questions about the likelihood that such strong performance can =
be maintained indefinitely. The same analysis shows the other segments had =
far more humble returns. A Mirant financial expert wasn't available to comm=
ent.=20

It's All Relative: Often, a company's financial statements will include a "=
related-party transactions" section, pointing to dealings with its own offi=
cers or related companies. Maybe the company has loaned money to its office=
rs to buy company stock, or cash to an affiliate to buy products from the c=
ompany.=20
Either way, investors should be aware of the potential pitfalls. Some short=
 sellers say these dealings can signal that a company thinks of corporate c=
ash as belonging to management and not the shareholders, and thus is more f=
reewheeling with it than a more conservative company is. Enron may be a cas=
e in point; its downward spiral into bankruptcy-court protection started as=
 investors focused on nettlesome related-party transactions involving the t=
hen-chief financial officer.=20

Recurring Nonrecurring Charges: Another red flag, according to Nathaniel Gu=
ild, a partner at Short Alert, a research firm in Charlotte, N.C., is the p=
ractice of repeatedly labeling restructuring and other charges as "nonrecur=
ring," "one-time" or "unusual," when they aren't truly one-off expenses. Be=
cause most analysts ignore such charges in their earnings models, this can =
create a cloud of smoke that obscures the company's true earnings power. "Y=
ou can write off anything, in any fashion," Mr. Guild maintains. "There is =
very little regulation in that area."=20

Consult the Consulting Fees: The case of Enron also has focused the spotlig=
ht on the issue of auditor independence. Thanks to new rules introduced by =
the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies now are required to discl=
ose how much they pay their auditors not just for auditing, but for nonaudi=
ting work as well. The question investors should ask themselves, says Rocke=
r Partners' Mr. Cohodes, is how independent an auditing firm can be that is=
 getting paid as much or more for consulting services as it is for auditing=
. "It is a huge conflict," he contends. In the Enron example, the company i=
n 2000 paid Arthur Andersen $25 million in audit fees and $27 million for n=
onaudit work, including consulting.=20

Army Secretary Thomas E. White, the highest-ranking Bush administration off=
icial to come from Enron Corp., has told colleagues in the administration t=
hat he suffered "significant personal losses" as he sold his Enron stock to=
 comply with his government ethics agreement, according to a letter release=
d yesterday.=20
The Jan. 22 letter, which White wrote in response to a query by Rep. Henry =
A. Waxman (D-Calif.), was released by Waxman's office.
In the letter, White listed sales of 405,710 shares of stock between June 1=
3 and Oct. 30 at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a share. Though the sale=
s yielded $12.1 million, he said he told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell=
 and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that he "had suffered significant=
 personal losses, but . . . would persevere."=20
Among administration officials, White had by far the largest holdings in En=
ron stock and stock options. The financial disclosure form he filed last sp=
ring revealed that he held $25 million to $50 million in stock and a simila=
r amount in options at that time. Bush senior adviser Karl Rove and Charlot=
te Beers, undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, reported the next h=
ighest holdings: $100,000 to $250,000. The government requires disclosure o=
nly within broad ranges.=20
White took office May 31. According to an agreement he signed and filed wit=
h the Office of Government Ethics, he pledged to divest himself of his Enro=
n stock and options within 90 days.=20
In an interview yesterday, he said that he had sought and received an exten=
sion, which expired Nov. 20, and that he has sold all his Enron stock. In h=
is letter to Waxman, he said he had renounced his options.=20
White spent 11 years as an Enron official, leaving last spring as vice chai=
rman of Enron Energy Services. His salary, according to his disclosure form=
, was $5.5 million a year. He also reported that, at the time he filed his =
disclosure, he owned a condo in Aspen, Colo., worth $5 million to $25 milli=
on and a similarly valued condo in Naples, Fla. According to property recor=
ds, he currently owns a waterfront penthouse in Georgetown that he bought f=
or $5.5 million last June.=20
When White left Enron, he received a $1 million severance payment and $13 m=
illion in payment for stock appreciation rights, also known as "phantom sto=
ck."=20
"We appreciate Secretary White providing the information," said Waxman, ran=
king minority member of the House Government Reform Committee. "We intend t=
o review it.=20
In his letter, White also said that he had had "brief" conversations with P=
owell on Dec. 12 and with Rumsfeld on Nov. 10. Both men were concerned only=
 with the impact Enron's bankruptcy would have on his "personal well-being,=
" he said.=20
White also said that he had had 29 phone conversations or meetings with Enr=

In an interview yesterday, White said that he thought Enron's collapse was =
a tragedy. "I worked there for 11 years, and I have a good many dear friend=

Accounting for Enron: Bush's Plan to Name Accounting Veterans To SEC Raises=
 Some Eyebrows in Congress
By Scot J. Paltrow
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

President Bush's plan for a Securities and Exchange Commission dominated --=
 for the first time ever -- by commissioners with close ties to the account=
ing industry is raising concerns in Congress in the wake of Enron Corp.'s c=
ollapse.=20
The accounting failures that helped precipitate the collapse have made refo=
rm of accounting-industry oversight the biggest issue immediately facing th=
e SEC.
But if the president's previously announced plans are fully carried out, th=
ree of the five SEC commissioners will be individuals with close profession=
al ties to Big 5 accounting firms. Yesterday, the president made a recess a=
ppointment of two commissioners, including Cynthia A. Glassman, a principal=
 at Ernst & Young LLP. His nomination in December of Paul Atkins, a lawyer =
and partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, to a seat on the commission is still=
 pending in the Senate. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, who took office last year=
, until then was an attorney for all the Big 5 firms as well as the industr=
y's main trade association, the American Institute of Public Accountants.=
=20
Even without the eventual approval of Mr. Atkins, Mr. Pitt and Ms. Glassman=
 together will make a majority for the time being, as there are two vacanci=
es remaining on the commission. The only other sitting commissioner is Isaa=
c Hunt, a holdover from the Clinton administration, who became Mr. Bush's s=
econd recess appointee yesterday.=20
The recess appointment, made while Congress isn't in session, enabled the p=
resident to bypass the usual process of Senate approval. Ms. Glassman will =
be able to serve until the end of this year. The move drew swift condemnati=
on from Democrats in the House and Senate, even though the White House soug=
ht to blunt criticism by pairing the move with the recess reappointment of =
Mr. Hunt, a Democrat.=20
People close to the Senate Banking Committee say the Atkins nomination is i=
ncreasingly likely to face close scrutiny and potential opposition because =
of his ties to the industry.=20
A spokesman for Sen. Jon Corzine (D., N.J.), former co-Chief Executive of G=
oldman Sachs and a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs =
Committee that will vote on the Atkins nomination, said the senator faulted=
 the administration for bypassing the hearing process for Ms. Glassman's ap=
pointment. He said Sen. Corzine "has concerns about putting on the board th=
is concentration of people who have the same background, especially since t=
he chairman himself was a lawyer representing the accounting industry."=20
The timing of the president's choices is putting the White House in an unco=
mfortable position as new disclosures have been made almost daily about aud=
its of Enron by Arthur Andersen LLP and shortcomings in accounting regulati=
on. Anne Womack, White House press secretary, said the president is going a=
head with his choices and denied that he has any desire to pack the commiss=
ion with industry partisans.=20
Ms. Womack said [Ms.] Glassman "has an extensive background as an economist=
" and with the Federal Reserve Board, in addition to her five years most re=
cently with Ernst & Young. Mr. Atkins "has experience with accounting firm =
but also has served on SEC before," she said, and Mr. Pitt, she continued, =
"brings a legal background. Put these things together and you represent all=
 the relevant disciplines that come before and are affected by SEC."=20
The White House said it made the recess appointments because the large numb=
er of vacancies on the commission made it imperative to get a commissioner =
in place at least temporarily.=20
But several prominent experts on the SEC said the president's moves are sur=
prising in view of the Enron developments. Alan R. Bromberg, professor of s=
ecurities law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas said, "It's very q=
uestionable in my mind," adding "It looks me like life is going to be a lot=
 easier for accountants with this commission."=20
Ms. Glassman and Mr. Atkins weren't available for comment. An Ernst & Young=
 spokesman said the firm played no role in suggesting Ms. Glassman's nomina=
tion to the White House, adding, "She's not going there to represent us in =
any way."

Accounting for Enron: Insurance Companies Cut Sales Of Once-Plentiful Suret=
y Bonds
By Christopher Oster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A8
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A combination of a weak economy, Enron Corp.'s problems and significant los=
ses from the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes have led the insurance industry to =
sharply reduce sales of once-plentiful and cheap surety bonds. Rates on man=
y of the bonds they still do sell have soared 50% to 1,000%, analysts said.=
=20
Surety bonds are issued by insurers to companies that want to guarantee per=
formance or payment in a business transaction, to assure the companies' bus=
iness partners that the concerns will complete the transactions. Without th=
at assurance, some business grinds to a halt.
The insurance industry's unwillingness to issue surety bonds is hitting har=
dest those businesses that themselves are being hit by the recession. A pri=
me example is Kmart Corp., which cited its inability to secure such bonds a=
t a reasonable price as a factor leading to its decision to file this week =
for bankruptcy-court protection. Kmart used surety bonds to guarantee the p=
ayment of claims under its workers' compensation insurance program, as well=
 as other liabilities that the company self-insured against.=20
But insurers are less willing to provide surety bonds to these companies fo=
r such purposes because of the heightened risk, in a sluggish economy, that=
 the companies will need to draw on them.=20
"When you go into a recession, companies are going to go into default," sai=
d Don Watson, managing director at Standard & Poor's insurance ratings grou=
p. Mr. Watson expects companies with deteriorating credit quality to have a=
n increasingly hard time obtaining surety bonds, which many consider vital =
to continuing business.=20
The property-casualty insurance industry is unwilling to extend itself beca=
use it is sitting atop claims from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that are =
expected to top $40 billion, or about one-fourth of the capital base of com=
mercial property-casualty insurers. A company's capital base is particularl=
y important in the surety-bond business because regulators require large am=
ounts of capital to back such bonds.=20
On top of this, the bankruptcy-court filing by energy-trading firm Enron la=
te last year could lead to potentially large payouts on surety bonds that w=
ere in place to guarantee the supply of oil and natural gas by Enron to var=
ious parties. Several insurers have announced exposure to Enron losses, inc=
luding Chubb Corp., which said it has $220 million of such exposure.=20
In a recent report, insurance broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd. said insura=
nce companies are "more likely to allocate capital to property-casualty lin=
es of business that present the prospect for higher returns" than do surety=
 bonds. The report notes that the availability of surety bonds for self-ins=
urance and other types of financial guarantees "will be severely curtailed,=
 if written in the market at all." In the past year alone, the number of su=
rety reinsurers has dropped to 12 from 16. Several primary surety-bond writ=
ers have exited the business.=20
Like nearly all lines of property-casualty insurance, surety-bond prices fe=
ll in the 1990s as insurers competed fiercely for premium dollars. Underwri=
ting became lax because in some cases claims might not be paid for years an=
d insurers assumed they could turn a profit by investing the premiums in th=
e soaring stock market.=20
"The business had gotten very cheap," said Mark Reagan, chief executive of =
the construction practice of broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd. Underwriting=
 manuals suggest premiums of $20 per $1,000. But "companies were getting bo=
nds for $1.25 for $1,000 of coverage."=20
The most obvious impact will be on the construction industry. Contractors b=
uy surety bonds to ensure the completion of their work. "It's going to furt=
her limit or inhibit commercial property development, which will be a furth=
er drag on the economy," said S&P's Mr. Watson.

Accounting for Enron: Pension Funds, Not Lawyers, Drive Holder Suits
By Richard B. Schmitt
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A8
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lawyers for Enron Corp. shareholders marched into a Houston court with grea=
t show this week with a box full of shredded documents carted out of Enron =
headquarters by an ex-employee.=20
The disclosure made good theater, but it also reflects a little-noticed cha=
nge in the world of shareholder litigation. Such suits were once driven by =
lawyers who raced to the courthouse to be first to file so they could contr=
ol the case and collect the biggest fees. Now, the suits are being driven b=
y pension funds, like the one administered by the Regents of the University=
 of California that hopes to become the lead plaintiff in the Enron shareho=
lder case.
As a condition of hiring their lawyers, the Regents required that Milberg W=
eiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach commit dozens of lawyers, investigators and for=
ensic accountants, among others, to the case. "They demanded a level of att=
ention that is unprecedented," said Darren Robbins, a Milberg Weiss partner=
 in San Diego.=20
The result: Milberg Weiss, a firm that was once widely criticized by busine=
ss groups for doing little work on behalf of shareholders, has done 100 int=
erviews with potential witnesses and hired dozens of professionals to pore =
over evidence it has collected -- all before a judge even decides whether t=
he firm's client will be named lead plaintiff and it will get the job of le=
ad lawyer.=20
Ironically, all this has come about because of a 1995 law aimed at putting =
the likes of Milberg Weiss on a short leash. Previously, under class-action=
 rules, practically any investor who lost money in a stock could be a plain=
tiff. The result was a system that some companies viewed as legalized extor=
tion, where they settled even nuisance claims to avoid the costs of litigat=
ion. The law changed the game by boosting the needed proof in such cases an=
d by giving investors with the largest losses first crack at controlling th=
em.=20
Now, the lawyers are having to be salesmen, courting new business, with glo=
ssy presentations at institutional-investor conferences and competing in be=
auty contests staged by the investors to pick lawyers. "They are in hot pur=
suit of these clients," said Richard Koppes, former general counsel of the =
California Public Employees' Retirement System and currently a lawyer in th=
e Sacramento, Calif., office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. "It is a new ma=
rket for them, and they recognize that."=20
Shareholder litigation was new terrain for the California Regents, which de=
spite managing $54 billion in pension assets, had never headed up a big sec=
urities-fraud action before. That changed when it lost nearly $145 million =
investing in Enron.=20
The two sides hooked up after the university treasurer heard a presentation=
 by Milberg Weiss partner William Lerach at an invitation-only investor con=
ference. Officials invited Mr. Lerach to make a pitch for the Enron suit at=
 a private meeting last month. Several other firms also made unsolicited bi=
ds for the work. "The university came to believe that Milberg Weiss had the=
 resources and the will to make a substantial rather than a symbolic recove=
ry," said Lloyd Lee, a lawyer for the university in Oakland.=20
Some class-action specialists say the involvement of large investors will m=
ake it more difficult for defendants like officers and directors of Enron t=
o resolve cases. "Plaintiffs' lawyers used to settle pretty quickly," said =
Tracy Nichols, a partner with Holland & Knight in Miami. "Now, they have an=
 institutional client looking over their shoulders, saying, `How hard are y=
ou going to push for me?"'

HOUSTON -- Dynegy Inc.'s fourth-quarter net income fell 27%, hurt by exposu=
re of its energy trading operations to fallen rival Enron Corp., as well as=
 acquisition-related costs including its aborted acquisition of Enron late =
last year.=20
Dynegy posted net income of $77 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with=
 $106 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results were depressed by a $78 million pretax charge stemming from ene=
rgy trading deals with Enron, which filed for bankruptcy-court protection i=
n December. In addition, Dynegy took a $10 million pretax charge for costs =
related to its canceled $9 billion acquisition of Enron. Restructuring at D=
ynegy's Illinois Power Co. unit resulted in a $15 million pretax charge, wh=
ile merger-related costs from the February 2000 acquisition of Illinova Cor=
p. also came to $15 million. A special dividend associated with stock issue=
d to ChevronTexaco Corp. in November cost $3 million.=20
Revenue dropped 13% to $8.74 billion from $10 billion.=20
Still, Dynegy said the quarter benefited from strong earnings from its whol=
esale energy network segment, led by increases in North American gas volume=
 and total power sold. The company noted, however, that its liquids and tra=
nsmission and distribution segments were hurt by mild weather and the econo=
my.=20
After excluding nonrecurring items, Dynegy said its earnings amounted to 41=
 cents a share -- in line with analysts' expectations as reported by Thomso=
n Financial/First Call. "The results illustrate how the company's diverse e=
nergy delivery network is capable of generating solid earnings even in the =
most turbulent market environment," said UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello.=
=20
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Dynegy rose $1.25, =
or 5.4%, to $24.55.=20
For the full year, net income rose 29% to $648 million, or $1.90 a share, u=
p from $501 million, or $1.48 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 43% to =
$42.24 billion from $29.45 billion.=20
Dynegy said it has begun a previously announced capital-restructuring plan =

affirmed its lowered 2002 earnings estimate of $2.26 a share and estimated =

Congress Fought Changes to Accounting Rules Over Past Decade
By Michael Schroeder and Greg Hitt
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- As Congress opens a slew of hearings about Enron Corp.'s coll=
apse, outraged lawmakers who are pointing fingers about bad accounting migh=
t well beware of fingers pointing right back.=20
House and Senate interrogators are questioning how the energy-trading compa=
ny's financial mess could escape auditors' detection. But they shoulder som=
e of the blame: Congress, including some of Enron's most vocal critics ther=
e, routinely opposed significant new accounting rules over the past decade.
Lynn Turner, head of Colorado State University's Center for Quality Financi=
al Reporting and a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission, cites several attempts to improve accounting standards throughou=
t the 1990s that Congress fought. One effort, in particular, would have str=
engthened the authority of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an ind=
ependent rule-making body.=20
The standards board has come under blistering attacks each time from compan=
ies who press Congress not to require new accounting disclosures. "Pressure=
s from some members of Congress have unfortunately led to compromises that =
I don't believe were always in the interest of investors," Mr. Turner says.=
=20
Some prominent past critics of the standards board are playing a different =
tune. Beyond zeroing in on Enron's own longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LL=
P, Congress intends to explore whether to toughen requirements for how comp=
anies are audited and what information must be disclosed to investors.=20
Consider Rep. Richard Baker, the Louisiana Republican who chairs a House su=
bcommittee on capital markets, securities and government-sponsored enterpri=
ses. At a hearing last month, Mr. Baker asked an SEC official whether "we n=
eed better disclosure or accounting standards that give investors the real =
picture?" And later, expressing dismay about Enron's misleading disclosures=
, he asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, if authorities nee=
d to impose penalties for improper disclosure "so severe that it ain't wort=
h the risk?"=20
Yet Mr. Baker was a strong opponent of a standards board proposal, that rec=
ently was approved, that requires companies to better disclose their use of=
 derivatives; those are investments pegged to the underlying value of asset=
s, such as commodities or currencies. The standard board's new rules seek t=
o ensure that corporate financial statements accurately reflect those risks=
.=20
Mr. Baker called hearings about the proposal after banking regulators and i=
ndustry groups objected that the standards board hadn't adequately consider=
ed earnings volatility that the derivatives disclosure might cause for comp=
anies -- particularly banks, the biggest users of derivatives.=20
When the standards board pressed ahead, Mr. Baker introduced a bill to allo=
w public companies to object to proposed accounting principles in federal c=
ourt. He described his proposal "as a legislative remedy to a flaw in the p=
rivate sector process for developing financial accounting standards."=20
Though the Baker bill was unsuccessful, the pressure from Congress led the =
standards board to issue new, less stringent disclosure standards, which ha=
ve recently taken effect. "Rep. Baker plans to address existing accounting =
problems," Rep. Baker's spokesman, Michael DiResto, said yesterday.=20
The SEC, which oversees the standards board, also has frequently been caugh=
t in a cross-fire from Congress, which it has complained makes it harder to=
 impose needed regulations. The derivatives proposal, for instance, sparked=
 a row about the independence of the standard board's standard-setting proc=
ess -- and in particular about whether the SEC and former SEC Chairman Arth=
ur Levitt improperly pushed the proposal forward.=20
Sen. Phil Gramm, the lead Republican and former chairman of the Senate Bank=
ing Committee and a frequent critic of the standards board and the SEC, acc=
used Mr. Levitt of telling business representatives not to testify before C=
ongress on the derivatives issue. A Senate official later retracted his all=
egation. Mr. Gramm, a Texas Republican and the Senate's second-largest reci=
pient of Enron political contributions, has said he will skip any Enron-rel=
ated hearings; his wife was on Enron's auditing board.=20
In a 1997 speech, Mr. Levitt said he found the attacks on the standards boa=
rd's process and its proposals "alarming." He added, "Critics are focusing =
too much on lobbying the decision-making process and not enough on thoughtf=
ul, substantive input into that process."=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Gover=
nmental Affairs Committee, opens a hearing today into Enron's collapse. Amo=
ng the questions he says he is probing: "Why did Enron's auditors allow the=
 company to overstate its profits for four years by over a half a billion d=
ollars, using what now appear to be very questionable accounting practices?=
"=20
But Mr. Lieberman, the former Democratic vice-presidential nominee and a 20=
04 presidential prospect, is a longtime critic of the accounting board, and=
 he has rallied opposition to its proposed rules more than once. Recently, =
he challenged one to overhaul the accounting for corporate mergers and acqu=
isitions, an issue of importance to the high-tech industry. In the fall of =
2000, amid the tight presidential race, Mr. Lieberman joined with a biparti=
san group of 13 senators in a letter urging the standards board to postpone=
 consideration of the changes until Congress reconvened in 2001.=20
The letter, among other things, claimed the accounting changes "will make m=
ergers and acquisitions very difficult for high-technology companies." In t=
he House, California Reps. Christopher Cox, a Republican, and Calvin Dooley=
, a Democrat, introduced a bill for a one-year moratorium on the standards =
board proposal.=20
The proposal called for new disclosures on mergers and acquisitions. Compan=
ies cried foul, complaining the change would reduce their earnings. Under p=
ressure from Congress, the standards board backed off, but still required n=
ew accounting that gives investors more information about the true initial =
costs of acquisitions and how to track the investment over time.=20
Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein said such activity by the senator stemmed =
from concern that government bureaucracy was out of touch with the real-wor=
ld impact of its proposal. "They are not democratically elected or accounta=
ble," he says. "In extreme circumstances, it's incumbent on Congress to ste=
p in."=20
Similarly in 1994, Sen. Lieberman was a leading figure in a bipartisan grou=
p of legislators who opposed a proposed change in accounting for stock opti=
ons. The change would have required that a company's current earnings refle=
ct the value of future stock options. Blocking the change was a big priorit=
y of the high-tech community in Silicon Valley, where growth-oriented firms=
 had made a regular practice of conferring stock options on executives and =
employees in lieu of direct compensation.=20
With the technology industry growing in clout along with its campaign donat=
ions for both political parties, the industry's concerns were well-received=
 on Capitol Hill. The Senate voted 88-9 for a Lieberman resolution urging t=
he accounting board to back off. It did.=20
"This was not just Joe Lieberman and a couple other folks out on a lark," s=
ays Mr. Gerstein, the spokesman. The senator "felt a compelling need to int=
ervene," he adds, given the potential impact of the proposal on an importan=
t sector of the economy.=20
The accounting board has had its defenders in Congress, such as Michigan De=
mocrats John Dingell in the House and Carl Levin in the Senate. Mr. Levin i=
n 1994 resisted the congressional efforts to influence the accounting board=
 rule on stock options, and argued that the Lieberman resolution "would put=
 the Senate on the record as opposing honest accounting."=20
Now Mr. Levin is paired with Mr. Lieberman at the Governmental Affairs Comm=
ittee, working to probe Enron's collapse.

Crazy busy, huh? Won't take but a sec. Ever hear of E-mail-management softw=

in the world it happens to be, even if it is sitting on disks in a vault at=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mission impossible? Naw, the E-mai=

is created, Omniva encrypts it before sending and retains the key, which ca=
n be set to expire automatically after a certain number of days. When a rec=
ipient opens a message, the E-mail software checks with Omniva to make sure=
 that the key hasn't expired. When the message is "deleted," it is the key =
that is deleted, which renders the messages permanently unreadable. Here's =
how Omniva's Dave Marvit puts it: "We're empowering people to have conversa=

sted, too?=20
Here's the beauty part: It's perfectly legal. Companies can delete all E-ma=
il--without first archiving--as long as it's done as a matter of routine an=
d before being the subject of a particular criminal or civil investigation.=
 That's why attorneys who specialize in "risk management" tell their client=

about the panicky throw-everything-overboard document purging at Arthur And=
ersen last October; I'm talking about the corporate policies that mandate r=
egular cleaning out of E-mail boxes, every 30, 60, or 90 days, at millions =
of corporate offices. That E-mail may prove to be critically important mont=
hs, perhaps years, later when investigations into malfeasance are initiated=
. The law should require that all internal communications be preserved perm=
anently for later retrieval.=20
When the SEC was founded in 1934, business was conducted on paper, which is=
 cumbersome and expensive to handle, copy, and store. Given the technology =
of the day, it was natural that the SEC required that publicly traded compa=
nies submit mere summaries of financial performance, not the full corpus of=
 memos and correspondence. But technology has advanced, business now takes =
place in an electronic medium, and most communication consists of text that=
 takes up infinitesimal storage space. The cost of preserving millions of r=
ecords is now negligible. Using tape backup, the cost of storing 400,000 E-=
mail messages is about $1. And using a concept called single-instance stora=
ge, the costs of archiving an entire firm's correspondence shrinks still mo=
re dramatically because only the original full-text copy and a list of the =
recipients are stored, not the 1,000 identical copies floating around the c=
ompany.=20
Existing commercial software can automatically preserve in a centralized ar=
chive all the mail purged from individual boxes, but companies need the SEC=
 to make its preservation a matter of law, not choice.=20
It may be too late for us Enron victims, but let's modernize our oversight =
of publicly traded companies so that future malefactors will have reason to=
 pause, knowing that the documentary record of their actions cannot after t=
he fact be erased.

To an uncanny degree, Andy Fastow mirrors the growth of Enron Corp. As the =
Houston-based energy giant rocketed to fame as a supernova of the "new econ=
omy," Fastow, its chief financial wizard, soared upward with it, crafting t=
he complex partnership deals that in a short 10 years turned a sleepy pipel=
ine outfit into the seventh-largest corporation in America. Now, with Enron=
 in flames, having erased$67 billion in the largest bankruptcy in history, =
Fastow, a onetime Master of the Universe, is the most wanted man in corpora=
te finance, the target of untold lawsuits and unchecked rage.=20
Like the junk bond and savings and loan debacles before it, the Enron colla=
pse is fast becoming a signature scandal. Its impact is felt in thousands o=
f layoffs, the implosion of retirement savings, and possible criminal charg=
es for massive accounting and securities fraud. Last week's developments al=
one were the stuff of corporate fiction: An Enron executive warned Chairman=
 Kenneth Lay months ago of her worries about the partnerships Enron used to=
 keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off its books. Enron's auditi=
ng firm, Arthur Andersen, fired its lead auditor when it was learned that A=
ndersen destroyed documents after an investigation had begun. Then Enron fi=
red Andersen. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, until rec=
ently stroking the accounting industry, proposed a new oversight body. Busi=
ness leaders speculated openly about whether Andersen would survive.
Through it all, the man everybody wanted to talk to was Fastow, a 40-year-o=
ld, trombone-playing M.B.A. who made at least $30 million from the Enron pa=
rtnerships while small investors lost their shirts. Fastow, who remains rel=
atively secluded in his expensive Houston home, has frustrated investigator=
s by balking at an SEC subpoena and dancing a fandango with congressional i=
nvestigators. The seclusion ritual appears to be of a piece with Fastow's y=
ears with Enron. In his spacious top-floor office, surrounded by original, =
expensive art, Fastow has maintained an extraordinarily low profile over th=
e years, granting few interviews, a virtual unknown even to many Enron empl=
oyees.=20
Yet, while some Enron officials say Fastow chafed at Enron's corporate swag=
ger, he was, in many ways, a product of it. Many at Enron thought the compa=
ny and its executives could do no wrong, and, some colleagues believe, so d=
id Fastow. It was in part because he was presumed a financial genius that t=
he board approved his machinations without adequate questioning. "He was a =
master politician; the board loved him," says a former employee. Others who=
 did challenge him landed on his enemies list, objects of his occasionally =
volatile temper. In the company's annual "rank and yank" performance review=
s, in which the employees who scored lowest were fired, Fastow shone. But s=
ome former colleagues say he also used the reviews to reward allies and tak=
e revenge on those who crossed him.=20
Hyperventilating. Fastow was hired at Enron to drum up oil and gas deals, b=
ut his bosses quickly realized his talent for packaging the financing for n=
ew deals and restructuring other deals already on the books. Despite his ti=
tle, Fastow never really played the CFO role at Enron. Typically, chief fin=
ancial officers are a company's main envoy to Wall Street, walking a fine l=
ine between husbanding the firm's finances and hand-holding big players lik=
e analysts and institutional shareholders so important to setting the stock=
 price. But Fastow developed surprisingly little presence on the Street. "O=
rdinarily, the CFO is hyperventilating and pontificating at analyst confere=
nces," says John Olson, an analyst for Sanders Morris Harris. "[Fastow's] r=
ole was sitting in the backroom coming up with those partnerships."=20
The details of those partnerships, which played a pivotal role in Enron's u=
ndoing, are truly complex. But the bottom line is this: In their pure form,=
 such partnerships are helpful in arranging financing or attracting investo=
rs for a particular project, and they can minimize taxes. In Enron's case, =
they became a vehicle for keeping huge amounts of corporate debt off the bo=
oks Enron presented to the world. That was important because too much debt =
makes borrowing more expensive. For Enron, that would mean lower profits, a=
nd as a Wall Street darling, that would not do.=20
The problems with the partnerships, according to attorneys now suing the co=
mpany, are that in creating them, Enron would contribute company stock or o=
ther assets, which would essentially be used to secure big loans. It's not =
supposed to go both ways; the assets can't serve dual roles as reserves for=
 the partnership and collateral for a loan. Critics also point to a conflic=
t of interest. Fastow was part of the partnerships but also an executive of=
 Enron. As the partnerships did business with the company, Fastow's loyalti=
es were inherently torn. Moreover, Enron guaranteed profits for the entitie=
s. If the targets were missed, Enron would make up the difference, typicall=
y through issuance of new stock. That would put more stock in circulation, =
potentially depressing the price.=20
Mutants. By the time Enron filed for bankruptcy, the company listed more th=
an 3,500 partnerships, often with complex links to other entities or unknow=
n parties. "They just mutated into something virtually unrecognizable," say=
s Olson. "Investors didn't know if they were investing in widgets or in an =
Indonesian coffee plantation." As early as 1997, some executives were chall=
enging Fastow, only to see their criticisms pushed aside. "I said, `I don't=
 care if Arthur Andersen has passed off on this or if the board of director=
s has approved it. It does not pass the smell test,' " said one former Enro=
n employee. "That was not a politically astute thing of me to say." At a co=
mpany meeting last October, Vice President Jim Schwieger pressed Lay about =
the partnerships; Lay responded by ending the meeting. Later that day, Fast=
ow approached Schwieger, shook his hand, and offered to sit down and answer=
 any questions. The next day, Schwieger says, Fastow was gone.=20
Enron itself seems to be positioning Fastow as the fall guy, suggesting tha=
t the partnerships were Fastow creations that he failed to explain thorough=
ly. But U.S. News has learned that Fastow, who is represented by high-profi=
le attorney David Boies, is beginning to push a two-tiered defense. Althoug=
h Fastow declined to comment, his allies argue that the partnerships were c=
reated with the support and backing of Enron. Thomas Bilek, a Houston attor=
ney who represents investors, said that Enron employees say Fastow has docu=
ments establishing the involvement of other company executives in the finan=
cial house of cards.=20
Fastow is also likely to contend that the problem with the partnerships lie=
s not in their creation but in how they were accounted for. A source close =
to Fastow argues that his responsibilities were limited to acquiring capita=
l from outside investors and that he had no authority over accounting for t=
hem. That responsibility, Fastow maintains, fell to Richard Causey, Enron's=
 chief accounting officer. Yet several former employees said Fastow created=
 the partnerships precisely so they could be accounted for off the books. A=
 lawyer for Causey said his client did nothing wrong.=20
"A sound plan." Fastow was hardly the rogue operator Enron paints him to be=
, other officials say. One former executive recalls that sign-offs from the=
 legal department to the accounting department were required on the deals. =
"It wasn't just an automatic," the employee says. Others say Fastow made no=
 secret of his activities. Michael Klein, a friend and independent oil and =
gas producer, says Fastow discussed partnerships with him. "He told me it w=
as a sound business plan that was approved and encouraged by Enron," Klein =
recalls. Even Enron's law firm, given a limited mission to examine some of =
the transactions, reports that company executives blessed the deals at the =
center of the controversy, known as the LJM partnerships. Says one employee=
 who worked in the finance group: "Andy never pulled the trigger on the fin=
al decision at LJM." That, the employee says, required former CEO Jeffrey S=
killing's approval.=20
Fastow created his new financial order in Houston after leaving the shadow =
of the old. The middle of three brothers, he spent his early childhood on L=
ong Island before moving to New Providence, N.J., a middle-class suburb of =
New York. In high school, Fastow displayed a progressive flair while servin=
g his senior year as student representative to the state board of education=
, proposing that teaching of contraception be made mandatory in public scho=
ols.=20
Regular newspaper reading as a child helped develop his interest in finance=
. He went to Tufts University for a degree in Chinese and economics. There,=
 he met his wife-to-be, Lea Weingarten, from a prominent Houston family. Gr=
aduate business school was at Northwestern University outside Chicago, wher=
e he concentrated on finance. Not long ago, Fastow was a proud son of each =
institution, someone to be mined for generous alumni donations. By last wee=
k, the schools were reluctant to provide any information on him.=20
While attending business school at night, Fastow worked at Chicago-based Co=
ntinental Bank Corp., one of the nation's biggest banking companies. At the=
 bank, he found ways to morph existing assets into new sources of cash, ski=
lls he would put to use at Enron.=20
The father of two young sons, he is a onetime pilot and a decent tennis pla=
yer, coaches youth sports, and has been a patron of contemporary arts, even=
 donating pieces for display at a trendy Houston gallery. Property records =
show he bought a 68-acre spread in Vermont in 1998, and he is now building =
an 11,500-square-foot home in one of Houston's finest neighborhoods. Fastow=
 has also contributed to charity, forming his own private foundation. Unlik=
e Lay, Fastow has been temperate politically, with only $3,200 in donations=
 to President Bush and a Texas congressional candidate topping his list.=20
Through his ordeal, Fastow has had devoted supporters. "This is a man of in=
tegrity and honesty," says Ned Rifkin, a friend who until recently was dire=
ctor of the Menil Collection, the museum to which Fastow lent his art. "I j=
ust pray this isn't damaging to their family." Rabbi Shaul Osadchey, who of=
ficiated at Fastow's wedding, calls Fastow a mensch, the Yiddish term for a=
 man of good character and sound values.=20
But many investors hurt by the company's collapse have been clamoring to ma=
ke Fastow pay. "Fastow broke a trust," says Enron veteran Maritta Mullet, w=
ho says the company's collapse cost her $500,000. In a way, he already is p=
aying. One of the charities Fastow has supported, a Houston center that hel=
ps the homeless, is now seeing former Enron employees apply for help with t=
heir rent.

Washington has been all atwitter about the possibility that the Enron colla=
pse will cause a political scandal for the Bush administration. We are remi=
nded over and over that Enron generated more political contributions for Ge=
orge W. Bush than any other company, and the subtext of many of the news st=
ories is that the Bush administration must have done Enron some favors in r=
eturn. But there is no evidence that it did. By trying to fit Enron into th=
e familiar scandal template, the media are missing larger, more important l=
essons.=20
There is no dispute that Enron officials contacted Treasury Secretary Paul =
O'Neill, Treasury Under Secretary Paul Fisher, and Commerce Secretary Donal=
d Evans seeking help as Enron stock plunged. Former Clinton Treasury Secret=
ary Robert Rubin, now a top executive of Citigroup, which loaned Enron $800=
 million, asked Fisher whether he should call the bond-rating companies to =
question their downgrade of Enron's credit.
The response in each case was the same: No. Nor did Enron get what it wante=
d in public policy. The biggest change Enron sought--limits on carbon emiss=
ions, so that it could make money running emissions-trading markets--was fi=
rmly opposed by the administration. Editorial writers are already busy cluc=
king that the Enron case shows the need for campaign finance reform. It sho=
ws just the opposite: With this administration, at least, campaign contribu=
tions bought nothing--not even access: O'Neill, Fisher, and Evans would hav=
e taken the calls of top officials of the nation's No. 7 company even if it=
 hadn't given hefty campaign contributions.=20
Broken laws? Democrats with presidential ambitions like Connecticut Sen. Jo=
seph Lieberman are still talking about digging for evidence showing that th=
e administration did something for Enron. Other Democrats, including Califo=
rnia Rep. Henry Waxman, complain that the Bush administration didn't do eno=
ugh for Enron shareholders. A more sensible approach is being taken by a Mi=
chigan Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin. His investigation is focusing on whether =
Enron and its auditors broke the law and whether laws or accounting standar=
ds should be changed to protect investors and make markets work properly.=
=20
The Bush administration's refusal to intervene on Enron's behalf, like its =
refusal to intervene massively in Argentina's economic crisis, is an exampl=
e of how its policies differ from those of the Clinton administration. In 1=
995, Rubin put together a $52 billion loan guarantee package for Mexico, wi=
thout support from Congress. In 1998, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,=
 supported by the Clinton Treasury Department, provided $3.6 billion to bai=
l out Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund. Both bailouts seemed to w=
ork well: Mexico's economy and Long-Term Capital recovered. Creditors who m=
ight have gotten nothing did well.=20
But such bailouts create what economists call moral hazard: If creditors be=
lieve they're going to be bailed out, they will extend credit profligately,=
 which will lead to more bankruptcies and financial crises. The Mexico bail=
out may have contributed to the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, and the L=
ong-Term Capital bailout may have contributed to the Enron bankruptcy. The =
Bush administration's actions--or inactions--on Enron and Argentina will re=
duce moral hazard and make lenders and investors think twice about where th=
ey put their money.=20
Of course, the facts in Mexico and Argentina, Long-Term Capital and Enron a=
re not precisely the same, and you can construct an intellectually defensib=
le position for both administrations' actions. Even so, they seem to reflec=
t a difference in temperament between the two parties. When a Democrat as i=
ntelligent as Henry Waxman suggests that the government somehow should have=
 acted to protect the share price of a single company, one must suspect tha=
t his temperament, not his intellect, is speaking.=20
For Democrats are temperamentally inclined to believe that government shoul=
d act to help people who are hurting, while Republicans are more inclined t=
o let markets take their course. The Clinton administration actively promot=
ed foreign investments by U.S. companies, including Enron, after it contrib=
uted to Democrats. The Bush administration seems less inclined to do so. Th=
e media are chortling that the Enron collapse will hurt Bush by showing how=
 cozy he is with big business. But an administration disinclined to interve=
ne in the marketplace is likely to be less popular among beleaguered CEOs a=
nd less affected by campaign contributions than one that is always eager to=
 help.

Congress's Enron Challenge

CONGRESS BEGINS grappling with Enron today. The Senate Governmental Affairs=
 Committee will hear testimony from regulatory experts; a House subcommitte=
e will hear about the shredding of documents by Arthur Andersen, Enron's au=
ditor. It is hard to overstate the importance of these and other hearings t=
hat Congress will convene over the next few weeks. The scandal gets steadil=
y murkier, with news of document destruction at Enron compounding the impre=
ssion that some people at the company had no respect for legality. Moreover=
, the scandal spotlights a complex list of regulatory failures, ranging fro=
m weak oversight of auditors to inadequate pension safeguards to the comple=
te lack of federal supervision for many of the derivative financial instrum=
ents traded by non-bank companies.=20
The need for leadership from Congress is especially strong, because the exp=
ert agencies that might usually be out in front are dithering. Harvey Pitt,=
 the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shows little incli=
nation to strengthen oversight of auditors; indeed, his weak gesture on thi=
s issue last week has prompted all five members of the respected Public Ove=
rsight Board to resign in protest. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission=
, which ought to monitor the swaps and other "over-the-counter" derivatives=
 traded by non-bank firms much as financial regulators currently inspect th=
e books of banks, shows no inclination to press for this authority. Both co=
mmissions are plagued by vacancies as well as leaders who seem reluctant to=
 act. Somebody needs to push them.
The Senate is starting off on the right foot by hearing from Arthur Levitt,=
 the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Lynn Tu=
rner, the SEC's former chief accountant. Messrs Levitt and Turner are both =
rightly outraged by the lax state of audit regulation. Auditors who sign of=
f on fraudulent financial statements are seldom punished properly for the s=
erious damage that they cause to ordinary people's savings. And despite a s=
tring of audit failures, the profession has repeatedly fought off attempts =
by Mr. Levitt and other reformers to toughen oversight -- not least by dona=
ting generously to members of Congress, who in turn have opposed tough regu=
lation. In the wake of Enron, this needs to change. The Senate should liste=
n carefully to its first witnesses today and frame reform accordingly.=20
Enron's failure poses one central question. If this company issued make-bel=
ieve accounts, why should anyone believe that dozens of other companies are=
n't practicing the same deception? Unless Congress can close the regulatory=
 loopholes that permitted Enron's fall, there will be more corporate implos=
ions. Millions of innocent savers will get hurt. And the nation's vaunted c=
apital markets will forfeit the public trust that allows them to function.

All Enron Cards on the Table

Talk cards with any good poker player and the discussion will soon turn to =
"tells": the unintended signals other players give that reveal whether they=
 hold good hands or bad.=20
Last week, the Bush administration gave its clearest "tell" yet that it doe=
sn't like its Enron hand. In response to my inquiries about contacts betwee=
n administration officials and Enron executives, a senior White House offic=
ial warned: "Waxman risks transforming himself into the Dan Burton of the D=
emocrats."
This unusual jab wasn't meant as friendly career advice. Republican White H=
ouses rarely throw gratuitous insults at senior Republican members of Congr=
ess like Mr. Burton, the chairman of the Government Reform Committee. To ma=
ke sure the message wasn't lost, the White House press secretary later call=
ed my efforts a "partisan waste of taxpayer money."=20
These blunt personal attacks signal a high level of White House anxiety: It=
s strategy is to discredit me and make other Democrats nervous about invest=
igating Enron's influence on White House policies.=20
What's especially odd is that these attacks are coming even though I've bee=
n careful not to make any accusations about the president, the vice preside=
nt or any of their staff. Having seen the mistakes of Republican investigat=
ions into the Clinton administration at close range, I have no interest in =
repeating the pattern of accuse first and investigate later. A better way i=
s to ask for relevant information before reaching conclusions.=20
For the past two months my staff has been conducting a broad inquiry into E=
nron's collapse. We've been trying to learn how thousands of American famil=
ies were robbed of their financial security. As a minority member of the Ho=
use, I can't call hearings or issue subpoenas, but a Web tip line has been =
surprisingly helpful in identifying parts of the puzzle.=20
What offends the White House are the questions I have been asking about Enr=
on's contacts with administration officials. While the investigation into E=
nron shouldn't be driven by politics, no area -- including Enron's politica=
l activities -- should be off limits.=20
The Bush administration wants to wall off its relationship with Enron from =
congressional inquiry. In essence, it argues that the president has a const=
itutional right to block investigation into the influence of special intere=
sts on White House policy. The administration has even rebuffed the efforts=
 of the General Accounting Office to learn what actions Enron requested fro=
m the vice president's energy task force, forcing GAO to consider the unpre=
cedented step of suing the White House.=20
Some facts are coming to light nonetheless. Enron was the administration's =
biggest campaign contributor. The company's lobbyists met secretly and repe=
atedly with the vice president's energy task force. The final energy plan c=
ontained 17 provisions that Enron wanted.=20
Last April, Enron CEO Ken Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney, urging h=
im to oppose price relief in the California energy crisis. The next day, th=
e vice president called the Los Angeles Times and argued against price caps=
. Two months later, the vice president raised Enron's concerns about the Da=
bhol power plant with a senior official from India.=20
Lay weighed in with the White House director of personnel about appointment=
s to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The president later nominate=
d candidates apparently supported by Lay. Lay also called Office of Managem=
ent and Budget Director Mitch Daniels to lobby for the repeal of the corpor=
ate minimum tax. The administration subsequently endorsed the House-passed =
stimulus bill, which repealed the tax and gave Enron a $254 million windfal=
l.=20
Because all the facts are not yet in, congressional Democrats have carefull=
y refrained from alleging that the White House took specific actions becaus=
e of Enron's lobbying. But the White House is wrong to hide behind this rea=
sonable restraint as a justification for resisting congressional inquiries =
about Enron's extraordinary access.=20
It's also appropriate to ask the administration questions about its reactio=
n to Enron's collapse. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and others made the =
right call in not bailing Enron out. But had Secretary O'Neill initiated an=
 expedited investigation into the conduct of Enron executives, he could hav=
e discovered in October that they had cashed out $1 billion in stock and th=
at Enron employees were in a 401(k) "lock-down." Even then, it might have b=
een difficult for the administration to take steps to mitigate the harm to =
Enron employees and other victims, but no one even tried.=20
It's time for the administration to draw a new hand. It should begin with c=
omplete disclosure of all the Cheney energy task force records. Just as imp=
ortant is a full accounting of all administration contacts with Enron repre=
sentatives. Nothing else will resolve legitimate questions that deserve exp=
lanation -- or fulfill the new approach that George W. Bush promised to bri=
ng to Washington.=20

On the basis of "things are seldom what they seem," especially in matters r=
elating to Enron, you should know that CEO Kenneth L. Lay is not from the L=
one Star State. He may sound like the quintessential high-handed, high-flyi=
ng Texan, given to overwhelming people and brooking no opposition. But the =
man who purchased everyone who might stand in his way was born and educated=
 in Missouri and did not hit Houston until 1970, when he took a PhD in econ=
omics at the University of Houston.=20
Texan Robert Strauss, who has known Lay casually for many years, says he "d=
oesn't fit the caricature of the self-promoting tycoon" -- the kind who usu=
ally does what he did: "He's quiet and well-mannered, with an air of refine=
ment about him. And I find it strange I should say this, because I am incen=
sed at what he did."
Since he rocked the world's financial markets with the biggest bankruptcy i=
n history, Lay has been in one of his many mansions. We can't expect to see=
 him here until Feb. 4, when he appears before a Senate Commerce subcommitt=
ee chaired by Byron Dorgan.=20
He made monkeys of his monitors all the way: the Washington regulators, the=
 Wall Street analysts, the congressional watchdogs, the Manhattan investmen=
t bankers, and the auditors, Arthur Andersen, who served Enron in the dual =
capacity of consultants and accountants, and whose legerdemain relieved the=
 company of the tedium of paying taxes.=20
The high-finance scene today looks like a beach where there's been an oil s=
pill and creatures stumble out of the water, their wings plastered to them =
by the slick. No one has a plausible explanation for why they were still te=
lling the public to buy, buy, buy when Enron was sinking fast. Newspaper an=

 when he told them, in the face of other warnings, that all would be well.=
=20
Even Houston, proud, polluted capital of the oil "bidness," is a little ash=
amed. The town wears the Enron brand. The whole U.S. attorney's office had =
to bow out of the fraud case of the century because all were involved with =
Enron in one way or another. The FBI has taken over the job of interrupting=
 the shredding parties at the stricken headquarters. It wouldn't have known=
 about them except for a woman named Maureen Castenada, a former employee. =
There are no good guys yet in Enron, only good women: Ms. Castenada and She=
rron Watkins, who told Lay that "legal is not right."=20
After a week of dodging queries about his former pal and benefactor -- Kenn=
eth Lay was President Bush's number one contributor -- the president wheele=

capitalism gone mad and the serene balance of the market place torn up by a=
 rogue company. They are aware, though, that some of their cherished projec=
ts have been endangered: parts of the president's economic stimulus bill, w=
hich, according to the Congressional Research Service, would have awarded E=
nron $254 million in "corporate alternative minimum tax credits" -- a gift =
few members of Congress, even those blessed with the bipartisan benefaction=
s of Kenneth L. Lay, would be inclined to give.=20
As for the Democrats, they have been handed a backdrop for the congressiona=
l campaign that they hardly know what to do with. They have been given a pe=
erless chance to show the truth of what they have always said about the Rep=
ublicans -- that they favor government of the corporations, by the corporat=
ions and for the corporations. They have scheduled 10 congressional hearing=
s, which is obviously too many. They might try to whittle the number down b=
y excluding members who received Lay bounty, such as Sen. Joe Lieberman. Th=
ey could blow it.=20
Presidential strategist Karl Rove suggested at the Republican National Comm=
ittee meeting that he understood the dimensions of the problem, by suggesti=
ng that GOP candidates could run on the coattails of the commander in chief=
. Democrats cried foul. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt howled "shame=
," a strident response to what was really only politics -- Democrats didn't=
 hesitate to run on Bill Clinton's golden economic record, did they? And if=
 George W. Bush can't talk about the war for fear of offending Democrats, w=
e've entered new realms of political correctness.=20
For Democrats to wail that they have supported the war -- they have not dar=
ed to open their mouths without praise for the president's prowess -- sound=
s self-righteous and self-pitying. They could spend their time better by fi=
guring out how to use the present the gods have handed them -- and what to =
ask Ken Lay when they finally see him.

If nothing else, Enron's difficulties have not only given us a lesson in Ec=
onomics 101, but they also have told us how Washington operates.=20
All the people in the Enron mess have played their roles -- from the execut=
ives in the company and their accounting firm to the lawyers who served the=
m so well. But none of them could accomplish what they did without the Wash=
ington lobbyists. They are the ones who protect companies from a government=
 that cannot be trusted.
Lobbyists are just like you and me, and they put on their golf shoes one fo=
ot at a time.=20
You have to be qualified to be a lobbyist. Many, but not all, are recruited=
 from Congress. They have decided they are fed up with politics and want to=
 make some big money for a change, or have lost an election and are not fit=
 to do anything else.=20
Lobbyists are very friendly people. They call lawmakers and administration =
officials by their first names: "Ted," "Terry," "George." Theirs is the onl=
y profession, except for the FBI, that makes house calls.=20
The job of the lobbyist is to stop a law that will hurt his clients and lob=
by for a bill that will make everyone rich.=20
This is an example of how it works: The Hidden Valley Gas and Energy Co. ha=
s ex-senator Glad Handle on its payroll to lobby for the company in Washing=
ton. Glad Handle is a Republican, and he replaced ex-congressman Taylor Blu=
ewhistle, a Democrat, who was fired after Al Gore lost the election.=20
Glad moves among the Capitol, the White House and any agency that can affec=
t Hidden Valley business.=20
Let's say Congress wants to pass a law forbidding Hidden Valley to deliver =
natural gas and smoke cigarettes at the same time.=20
What Congress doesn't know is that Hidden Valley owns a cigarette company a=
s well as a gas company. Banning smoking near a gas plant will seriously hu=
rt its tobacco business.=20
Glad invites Sen. Carl Fiddle to the Burning Tree country club. Fiddle is i=
n charge of the Smoking and Energy Committee. He is greeted warmly by Handl=
e, who says, "Remember when we filibustered an equal rights bill together?"=
=20
They play 18 holes, and then Glad asks Fiddle, "How's the election campaign=
 going?"=20
"We could use $100,000 in soft money to buy sweat shirts for our volunteers=
."=20
Glad takes out his checkbook and says, "Why didn't you say that before?"=20
Sen. Fiddle replies: "You're a lobbyist, so we hated to ask you for somethi=
ng. If we take your money, what can we do for you?"=20
"Nothing much. If you want to hold up the Anti-Smoking Gas Bill in committe=
e, that would be fun."=20
"It's done."=20
"What about getting the oil rights to West Point?" Glad asks.=20
"I know the person at EPA you should ask for."=20
Glad says, "Can I buy you a beer?"=20
"You know, Glad, that's against Senate rules."=20

In 1999 I briefly served on Enron's advisory board. I ended that connection=

I also disclosed that past relationship the very first time I mentioned Enr=

Enron paid members of its advisory board $50,000 for attendance and present=

Oblivious to a Strong Smell

01/24/2002
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

Energy giant Enron's conduct has been so egregious that even President Bush=
, a personal friend of just- resigned company Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, has =
finally felt compelled to denounce the corporation's alleged defrauding of =
employees and outside investors. If politicians are starting to return dona=
tions from Enron to assure the electorate that Congress isn't bought and pa=
id for, then drastic measures surely need to be taken to reassure investors=
 as well.=20
Unfortunately, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt is t=
aking exactly the opposite course. The giant Andersen accounting company is=
 under intense scrutiny for its auditing in the Enron debacle. Instead of p=
ushing for reform, however, Pitt is dismissing the need for it, claiming "t=
here is nothing rotten with the accounting industry."
Pitt has called for creating an oversight board. The five-member board curr=
ently responsible for ethics oversight has resigned, and its head, Charles =
Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, has denounced Pitt's proposals =
as too friendly to the industry that is supposed to be monitored. The new o=
versight board would apparently be largely controlled by the industry's Ame=
rican Institute of Certified Public Accountants.=20
Pitt, as the head regulator of financial markets, has come up with some coz=
y proposals that are astonishing. But they are less so considering that Pit=
t, a lawyer, had as clients the five biggest U.S. accounting firms, includi=
ng Andersen, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accounta=
nts. Unless he changes course, he will be unable to restore investor confid=
ence that fair and open audits are taking place.=20
Despite Pitt's claims, there is a lot that is rotten in the accounting indu=
stry. It appears that Andersen did not just wink at Enron's end run around =
the law; Andersen may have abetted it. Though Andersen is reported to have =
shredded paperwork, memos have surfaced showing that auditors were aware of=
 Enron's enormous manipulation of its reported earnings, which were really =
losses, and did nothing to expose it. On the contrary, because auditors can=
 also be consultants to the companies they are supposed to monitor, the inc=
entive is for them not to blow the whistle. Andersen, for example, received=
 $27 million from Enron for consulting work.=20
Congress needs to pass a law that would create an oversight board that woul=
d have enough power to police the industry effectively. It also needs to ma=
ke it illegal for auditors to work in any capacity for corporations other t=
han auditing. That would help end the smell from the accounting industry th=
at Pitt is pretending doesn't exist.

This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE for January 23. Sitting in for Lou Dobbs, Kathl=
een Hays.=20
KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ANCHOR, LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE: Good evening, here are th=
e latest developments in the Enron scandal. Enron today postponed a meeting=
 with employees because of what the company called a media frenzy. The SEC`=
s accounting oversight board, all five members, quit. And David Duncan, the=
 fired Andersen auditor, wants immunity before he tells Congress what he kn=
ows about document shredding. Tim O`Brien is in Washington tonight with mor=
e.=20
Tim, what can you tell us on the latest developments?=20
TIM O`BRIEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, the developments are breaking out a=
ll over. Amid reports that Enron was continuing to destroy documents as lat=
e as last week, a federal judge in Houston conducted a hearing. As we speak=
, he is about to rule on to best protect those documents.=20
Lawyers for investors and former employees are urging they be placed in cus=
tody of a court-appointed trustee. Again, we are expecting a ruling within =
minutes. Meanwhile, there were other developments on a number of other fron=
ts today.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
(voice-over): Enron employees were supposed to get a briefing today about t=
heir future with the company, but it was canceled. CEO Kenneth Lay, explain=
ing to employees in an e-mail, we don`t want to subject you to the media fr=
enzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we have decided to po=
stpone it.=20
Employees were told the meetings would be rescheduled for another time. On =
the political front, questions linger about Enron`s possible influence on t=
he president`s energy program. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, joined t=
he chorus of Democrats calling on Dick Cheney, who chaired the president`s =
energy task force, to explain his meetings with Enron executives.=20
SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MAJORITY LEADER: I think we all have to be very fo=
rthcoming here and I think it`s important in this case that the vice presid=
ent, like everybody else, provide the information required.=20
O`BRIEN: To date, there has been no evidence that anyone in the administrat=
ion acted improperly in the Enron collapse. In fact, some of Enron`s most i=
mportant beneficiaries have also lost money. Texas Senator Phil Gramm and h=
is wife, Dr. Wendy Gramm, say they lost around $686,000 in the Enron demise=
. Enron had showered the senator, a champion of deregulation, with campaign=
 contributions. And Dr. Gramm, an economist, serves on Enron`s board of dir=
ectors. Her deferred compensation was lost when Enron declared bankruptcy.=
=20
And finally, reverberations from last week`s recommendation by Harvey Pitt,=
 the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a new regulato=
ry agency to oversee the accounting profession.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
That didn`t sit well with the public oversight board, a five-member commiss=
ion that already oversees ethics and disciplinary issues. All five members =
have resigned, saying Pitt`s new agency would render their work irrelevant.=
 Pitt has now written back, urging the members to reconsider, saying his pr=
oposals would in fact strengthen the oversight board, not weaken it -- Kath=
leen.=20
HAYS: Tim, in regards to Harvey Pitt`s role in proposing a new kind of over=
sight board, is there any talk in Washington that maybe Mr. Pitt has been t=
oo close to some of the big players, the big 5 accounting firms are his cli=
ents, the AICPA, the association of accountants, one of his clients, what`s=
 the talk down there on that?=20
O`BRIEN: Well not only those, also he represented Arthur Andersen when he w=
as in private practice before joining the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Some Democrats say that`s a conflict of interest and he should recuse hi=
mself. Legally it really isn`t, because you can`t identify the views expres=
sed by a lawyer on behalf of a client with the lawyer himself.=20
Harvey Pitt is the first to say he has another client now, it is the United=
 States America and there is no conflict. However, he has indicated that he=
 will step back from the investigation. The SEC ordered the investigation, =
he`s in charge of the SEC but he is not going to participate in the probe.=
=20
HAYS: OK, Tim, thanks for the report.=20
Starting tomorrow, Congress gets down and dirty on the Enron scandal. Sever=
al committees begin their investigations into the biggest corporate collaps=
e ever. Allan Chernoff reports on the battle for witnesses before a subcomm=
ittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A behind-the-scenes strug=
gle between David Duncan, the fired Andersen Partner, who oversaw the Enron=
 audit and the subcommittee on oversight and investigation.=20
Subcommittee chair, James Greenwood:=20
REP. JAMES GREENWOOD (R), PENNSYLVANIA: We subpoenaed him. He still doesn`t=
 want to come. He wants immunity. We are not going to grant him immunity. H=
e wants to take the 5th, and we are telling him to come in tomorrow. If you=
 want to take the 5th Amendment that`s your constitution right, but do it a=
t the hearing, and if you don`t do it we reserve the right to cite you for =
contempt of Congress.=20
CHERNOFF: A source close to Duncan says he will appear and simply will invo=
ke the 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination.=20
His attorney had argued to the subcommittee that "Mr. Duncan has not yet ha=
d access to all the documents necessary for him to prepare for a formal hea=
ring."=20
REP. BILLY TAUZIN (R), LOUISIANA: I think he needs to be there to explain w=
hy he was willing to give us 4.5 hours of testimony and wouldn`t go public =
with the same testimony. But, he has his rights, and we`ll respect his righ=
ts.=20
CHERNOFF: According to Andersen it was Duncan who ordered employees at the =
Houston office to shred and delete Enron-related documents. Duncan has told=
 congressional investigators he was only following company orders, in the f=
orm of a memo reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retent=
ion policy, written by Andersen attorney Nancy Temple. She will testify.=20
Of particular interest to the subcommittee, an October 23 Andersen e-mail a=
ddressed to David Duncan and other executives discussing a conference call =
agenda which included the SEC, legal representation, and response to SEC.=
=20
Andersen says Duncan had directed the document disposal at a meeting on Oct=
ober 23. Andersen`s chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who testified before=
 Congress in December, fought off the subcommittee`s request. Instead, the =
Chicago headquarters is sending executive Dorsey Baskin, who oversees the f=
irm`s policy on audit and work papers.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
A demoted Andersen executive Michael Odom also is scheduled to testify befo=
re the subcommittee. Now, on the Senate side, Senator Lieberman`s Governmen=
tal Affairs Committee will be looking into the question of what Washington =
might have done to protect investors and businesses from the Enron fallout =

HAYS: Thanks Allan. I`m sure you are going to be a very busy man tomorrow.=

***
With Congress back in session, economic stimulus, the recession and Enron a=
re shaping up as the biggest items on the congressional agenda. Jonathan Ka=
rl joins us with more from Capitol Hill. Hi, Jon.=20
JONATHAN KARL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Kathleen. And Congress is picking up=
 right where it left off last year, the question of economic stimulus, what=
 they can do to get the economy going.=20
Right now the Republicans as we speak are over in the Capitol building, mee=
ting, on the Senate side, trying to think about how to respond to Senator T=
om Daschle`s latest gamut.=20
Daschle has put on the table a possible proposal on economic stimulus that =
boils down to this: He says Democrats would give up much of the spending th=
at was in the Democratic stimulus plan last year, in exchange for the Repub=
licans giving up many of the tax cuts they had in their proposal.=20
What you are left with, basically, is this: Extend unemployment benefits, a=
lso rebate checks for low-income taxpayers who did not get tax rebate check=
s last year, and the third item would be some modest tax breaks to encourag=
e companies to invest in new equipment. Making the case for that, Daschle c=
ame out today and used a new verb, perhaps a new addition to the English la=
nguage. The verb is "to "Enron." He was criticizing the Republicans, talkin=
g about deficits, and then he used the verb "to Enron."=20
This is what he had to say.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DASCHLE: I don`t want to Enron the people of the United States. I don`t wan=
t to see them holding the bag at the end of the day just like Enron employe=
es have held the bag. I don`t want to destroy their Social Security system.=
 I don`t want to destroy their Medicare system. I don`t want to destroy the=
ir ultimate ability to look with confidence at their retirement.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KARL: So, you see a sign that while the Democrats are saying they don`t wan=
t to politicize the upcoming Enron hearings, clearly Democrats see the pote=
ntial to try to talk about Republican economics as a kind of Enronomics, wh=
ich is another term we have heard used by Democrats up here on Capitol Hill=
.=20
And also, Kathleen, at the top of the show, you heard Tim O`Brien talk abou=
t how Senator Phil Gramm`s wife, Wendy Gramm who is on the Enron board, los=
t some 600,000 in her 401(k) when the Enron stock went south.=20
Well, another little bit of news on Senator Gramm. Senator Gramm tells CNN =
that he will recuse himself from all matters directly related to the invest=
igation of Enron here in Congress. Gramm is saying that he will continue to=
 talk about issues related to Enron, such as pension reform and changes in =
the rules that govern accounting companies. But he will recuse himself in a=
nything directly related to the investigation of Enron given that his wife,=
 Wendy Gramm, is on their board -- Kathleen.=20
HAYS: Thanks for the report, John, and for the new verb "Enron." Jonathan K=
arl on Capitol Hill.=20
Still to come tonight, we`ll tell you why your safe deposit box may not be =
as safe as you think it is, and why it may not be insured.=20
The nation`s mayors are concerned with keeping our cities safe. We`ll tell =
you how homeland security chief Tom Ridge plans to help.=20
And Boeing`s profits are down. The year ahead looks bleak. And yet the comp=
any`s CEO is optimistic. He`ll tell us why.=20
ANNOUNCER: Next, Kathleen talks with Phil Condit, CEO of Boeing.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
HAYS: The accounting industry`s reputation has been devastated by the Enron=
 scandal. The SEC has proposed a new panel to police the industry, that dec=
ision has been applauded by the American Institute of Certified Public Acco=
untants. The group`s president and CEO, Barry Melancon, joins us now. Welco=
me.=20
BARRY MELANCON, PRES. & CEO, CPAS: Hi, Kathleen.=20
HAYS: I think it`s interesting that Charles Boucher who was head of the pub=
lic oversight board that resigned in protest today, says there`s plenty of =
oversight. What has been lacking in overseeing the accounting industry is t=
he power to discipline. The power to demand records. What do you think of h=
is statement?=20
MELANCON: Well, in actuality what Chairman Pitt is proposed is a process wh=
ere discipline is addressed, Kathleen. And in fact moves from the oversight=
 to public participation. And obviously public participation is a higher or=
der of participation than public oversight, and so the activities that Chai=
rman Pitt proposed is moving us to new area which a majority of non-auditor=
s, people who are not in the profession would actually be involved in the d=
ecision-making process over discipline and quality control.=20
HAYS: But in fact the public oversight board was not comprised of people in=
 the accounting profession. And let me come back to that question, is there=
 something that Mr. Pitt has proposed that is going to put teeth in this ne=
w oversight board? So again, you`d think it would be very important to be a=
ble to demand to see certain records and have the threat of some kind of pu=
nishment from this board hanging over auditors if they don`t do their job.=
=20
MELANCON: Well, what Chairman Pitt has proposed is a process by which a dis=
ciplinary board -- or in monitoring quality control. If someone was found t=
o be deficient in the quality they were doing, they would actually lose the=
 rights to be able to audit public companies, that`s pretty significant tee=
th. HAYS: What about the basic conflict of interest, this --also this does =
not seem to be addressed by Mr. Pitt`s proposal, at least not so far. Many =
of the large accounting firms do audits of companies, they also have anothe=
r part that has consulting contracts where they advise the very managers th=
at the other part of the firm is auditing. Is that problem going to be addr=
essed by Harvey Pitt`s proposal?=20
MELANCON: Well, in actuality, former Chairman Arthur Levitt adopted a rule =
at the end of his term that addressed that issue very directly. It outlawed=
 or made by rule the inability to do certain services, it`s severely limite=
d other services and it created a total aspect of transparency and disclosu=
re if services were performed outside of the audit. But I might add, that`s=
 sort of an easy issue to address from the standpoint it sounds good. But e=
ven if we had an outright ban, which is a very complicated point, this is v=
ery complicated issue, Enron, and that outright ban itself would not preven=
t the reoccurrence of Enron. HAYS: But it might prevent a conflict of inter=
est in these firms. This is an issue that most every kind of accounting pro=
fessor seems to bring up when they`re asked about it.=20
MELANCON: In actuality there are over 300,000 CPAs in this country, and I t=
hink if you talk to small business people, business managers, they turn to =
their CPA`s for things other than just audits. And it`s just part of the pr=
ofession for over a hundred years. And it`s been a critical element in the =
profession being part of the fiber, if you will, of the success of the Amer=
ican economy. Doing things like taxes, doing things like general advisory o=
n whether someone should lease or buy, financial services are all part of w=
hat CPAs, men and women throughout this country who are doing things every =
day, and yet those same men and women do a very good job of drawing the lin=
e and in fact are drawing the line today. HAYS: Thank you very much, Barry =
Melancon for joining us.=20
MELANCON: Thank you.=20

HAYS: Today, a federal judge in Houston held a hearing on whether to impoun=
d documents from Enron regarding the company`s collapse. The hearing follow=
ed allegations that documents were being shredded by Enron employees as rec=
ently as last week.=20
Tim O`Brien has the latest on today`s hearing. Hi, Tim.=20
O`BRIEN: Kind of a non-decision, Kathleen. Federal judge Melinda Harmon say=
s she wants to let the lawyers work out the details of any solution. And th=
e lawyers for the plaintiffs, representing investors and former employees, =
are said to be very close to agreement with the lawyers for Arthur Andersen=
.=20
The plan now is to allow the plaintiff`s lawyers and their experts total ac=
cess to all records which are being kept in four secure locations: Houston,=
 San Francisco, Chicago and New York. Attorneys for Andersen have already p=
romised, of course, no more documents would be shredded, no computer files =
deleted.=20
The plaintiff`s lawyers will have all the ordinary rights of discovery if t=
hey don`t get what they want or have any suspicions documents are being wit=
hheld or destroyed. Their remedy would be to go back to court.=20

And that is MONEYLINE for this Wednesday evening. Thanks so much for joinin=
g us. I`m Kathleen Hays in for Lou Dobbs. Good night from New York. WOLF BL=

Poor Kenny Boy=20
Will Durst - WorkingForChange.com
01.23.02 - SAN FRANCISCO -- Poor Kenneth Lay. Just this time last year he w=
as riding higher than bacteria on a gnat inside the ear of a giraffe with a=
 hyperactive pituitary. And now the powers that be are starting to pile on =
like he was a secret member of the Taliban's high command and they discover=
ed his black turban on a shelf in the closet behind the gay porn tapes.=20
This is all because Enron reportedly put a few employees' retirement in a b=
it of jeopardy, and Kenny Boy, as our hero President is wont to call him, m=
ight have sold a couple of shares of Enron stock while the company was expe=
riencing their minor financial setback.=20
It turns out there is an extremely logical and reasonable explanation for t=
his "suspicious" behavior. Mr. Lay was not trying to ditch his stockholders=
 and employees, but merely trying to raise some quick cash. To put it in th=
e simplest of terms, for the "layman": he used his millions of dollars in E=
nron stock to repay loans made to him by the company and then he would take=
 out more loans to repay money he owed on his other investments. That's all=
.=20
Of course Mr. Lay was concerned about Enron's health, that's why on Septemb=
er 26 he used an online chat to urge employees to buy Enron shares because =
the stock was "an incredible bargain" which it was. It's an even better bar=
gain now. Huge bargain as a matter of fact.=20
You know what, I think people are just jealous. And indignant. And pissed. =
And outraged. And bitter. And angry. Just because Enron didn't pay any inco=
me taxes four out of the last five years, although whose fault was that? Th=
e shred happy accounting firm of Arthur Anderson, that's who. And weren't t=
hey fired last week? Of course they were. By who? Enron. See, problem disco=
vered, action taken.=20
Of course, nobody cares what happens to Mr. Lay. Who's wringing their hands=
 over the fact this persecuted American has had to stay liquid by selling m=
ost of the properties he owns and pays taxes on all over this great nation =
of ours? No one. We're talking 3 out of the 4 homes he owned in Aspen, Colo=
rado. Now this beleaguered CEO only has one destination to stay while skiin=
g. How is one supposed to entertain when the help is staying in the same 12=
 bedroom manse as the guests?=20
The only consolation is though his name will be dragged through mud by a ve=
ngeful media, the man himself is destined to receive justice. It is very do=
ubtful any of the ten Congressional investigating committees will be able t=
o form a quorum for even considering an indictment. After all, 250 out of 5=
35 members of Congress received campaign contributions from Enron and that =
doesn't include the Attorney General's office, which has recused itself. As=
 a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure everyone in DC except for Monica Lewinsk=
y has recused themselves from this investigation. Perhaps Mr. Lay will take=
 some solace from the price an old Enron ethics manual being sold on Ebay r=
ight now for over $250 whose seller advertises it as being in mint conditio=
n. Hopefully Mr. Lay has a couple of cases of old manuals laying around the=
 garage. I doubt if any of them were ever used.=20
