For an instant take on how 2001 treated investors, all you had to do was fl=
ick on your TV. Gone were the frenetic performance-touting spots of years p=
ast. In their place: dour Schwab ads in which founder Charles admonishes a =
mock town meeting of gray-clad investors, "You have to take the ups with th=
e downs."=20
Signs of new stock market sobriety were everywhere this year: CNBC viewersh=
ip tumbled, ten rate cuts by Greenspan & Co. still couldn't stave off a rec=
ession, and highly paid analysts were not only stripped of celebrity status=
 but also sued by investors (Mary Meeker) or humbled into accepting buyout =
packages (Henry Blodget). By early December the Nasdaq was down 17% for the=
 year, the Dow had fallen 6%, and the S&P was off by 12%.
Then again, "there are so many scenarios you could have written that would =
have been so much worse," points out Roy Weitz, editor of FundAlarm.com. In=
 fact, since the unprecedented four-day market shutdown and subsequent slid=
e after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow has rebounded 13%. Given the year we'=
ve had--what with events like the Enron implosion, the Bass brothers' massi=
ve margin call, and the uproar over a giant diaphragm in Denver (read on fo=
r an explanation)- -it's entirely possible that the last few weeks of 2001 =
will bring even more surprises. Let's hope at least some of them are happy =
ones.=20
S&P 500 standout: J.C. Penney led the pack for most of 2001 but late in the=
 year was eclipsed by Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for Microsoft's Xb=
ox, among other things. The company got an extra boost when it inherited En=
ron's spot on the S&P 500 and index fund managers raced to buy the stock. G=
ain for the year: 225%.=20
S&P 500 laggard: Lending can be a risky business, especially if your niche =
is hawking credit cards to people with spotty credit histories just as the =
economy heads into a tailspin. Such was the fate of Providian Financial, wh=
ich lost a full 95% of its value amid a spectacular run of credit card defa=
ults.=20
Best way to cash out: Selling your stake in a company you built is never ea=
sy, but if you're Tom Bailey, the company is Janus, and you have a "look ba=
ck" provision in your contract allowing you to unload your shares at the 20=
00 price, which reaps $603 million--well, it tugs at the heartstrings a lit=
tle less.=20
Worst way to cash out: Margin calls are always ugly, but rarely quite as bi=
g--or as publicized--as the late-September fiasco in which longtime Disney =
shareholders Sid and Lee Bass (and their dad, Perry) were forced to sell 13=
5 million shares for around $2 billion. It gets worse: Their shares fetched=
 only $15 each in a private deal; Disney stock now trades for $22.=20
Best fund: In a year marked by--at best--middling performances, the small-c=
ap Schroder Ultra gained a stellar 62% by keeping lots of cash on hand (aro=
und 40%), using put options, and shorting stocks (like a hedge fund). The o=
nly drawback? The fund is closed to new investors.=20
Best reason to manage your own money: Fund manager James McCall of the Merr=
ill Lynch Focus Twenty. Merrill waged a bitter legal battle to lure the the=
n-hot momentum manager from Pilgrim Baxter two years ago. It's no doubt reg=
retting that decision now: McCall got his walking papers in November after =
the Focus fund, which held tech, telecom, and Enron, lost 70%.=20
Worst reason to manage your own money: You may be a step ahead of McCall, b=
ut hanging on to your day job is probably a good idea, judging from the per=
formance of so-called market-participation funds. At the IPS iFund, where s=
hareholders nominate stock picks on a Website, collective wisdom precipitat=
ed a 37% decline for the year. The StockJungle.com Community Intelligence F=
und, for its part, was put out of its misery in August after losing about 3=
6%.=20
Most awkward PR flub: When Denver fund company Invesco agreed to pay $120 m=
illion over 20 years to slap its name on the Broncos stadium, it was no dou=
bt angling for good press. So when a Denver Post columnist wrote that Inves=
co's own employees had dubbed it the "Diaphragm," it had to hurt. Invesco t=
hreatened to sue but let up when it discovered that some staffers really di=
d think the stadium bore a striking likeness to a gigantic birth-control de=
vice.=20
Hottest IPO: Let's just say 2001 wasn't exactly an ideal year to take your =
company public. September, in fact, had the distinction of being the first =
month since 1975 in which there were no IPOs whatsoever. Yet there were a f=
ew success stories, including the best performer (from the date the company=
 went public to present): a Mountain View, Calif., company called Verisity,=
 which makes software to detect flaws in electronic systems. Since its Marc=
h IPO, the stock has doubled.=20
Should've stayed private: Bringing up the rear in the IPO brigade was Seatt=
le sandwich maker Briazz: Rattled working people shunned its pricey gourmet=
 sandwiches, and investors lost their appetite as well- -the stock is down =
88% since the IPO in May.=20
Nastiest boardroom battle: The acrimonious drama had more twists, turns, an=
d 1980s-style backbiting than an episode of Dallas, but in the end Computer=
 Associates founder and chairman Charles Wang triumphed over Texas investor=
 Sam Wyly (who proposed a rival slate of directors, charging that Computer =
Associates had floundered under Wang's stewardship).=20
Biggest boardroom upset: Lone shareholder Guy Adams got so fed up with Lone=
 Star Steakhouse management that he ran against CEO Jamie Coulter for his b=
oard seat. Unbelievably, he won--by a reported 2.3 million votes.=20
Most embarrassing Enron call: There was lots of competition here: bad calls=
, late calls, and gutless calls by analysts (not to mention the conference =
call in which CEO Jeffrey Skilling labeled one money manager an a--hole), b=
ut special distinction goes to Ron Barone of UBS Warburg, who lowered his r=
ating on the stock from a strong buy to a hold--on Nov. 28, just days befor=
e Enron declared bankruptcy. Uh, thanks.=20
Best makeover: The urge to merge raged this year as fund companies attempte=
d to save face by folding hideous specialty funds into slightly less hideou=
s tech funds. Strong Internet was merged into the Strong Technology 100 fun=
d, and Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies was bled into the Merrill Lynch Gl=
obal Technology fund. But proving yet again that it really is what's on the=
 inside that counts, the Strong fund has so far lost 39%, and the Merrill f=
und is down 42%.=20
Greatest career gamble: With a middling investing record on his resume, Jam=
es Oberweis, dairy magnate and founder of the eponymous asset-management fi=
rm, announced he would vie for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Perhaps in l=
ight of the markets' turbulence, anything looks easier than facing the Nasd=
aq.=20
Best prediction for 2002: Finally, we wondered what investors could look fo=
rward to next year. Fund watchdog Weitz predicts that mutual fund marketing=
 gurus are already dreaming up a spate of "new reality" funds filled with d=
efense and biotech stocks. Not the most tasteful proposition, perhaps, but =
given this year's exploits, probably not far off the mark. Let's just hope =
it doesn't land them in the loser's circle next year.=20

Dear Santa,=20
I can't believe it's that time of year again. I hope this letter finds you =
in the best of health. I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that w=
e've been very, very good this time around, so this is going to be a rather=
 long list. Grab something wet, pull up a Barcalounger, and pay attention.
At the outset, let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached =
you at all. I figure you have security up the wazoo, what with all the wack=
os sending stuff through the snail mail. That whole drill has to make your =
job a lot tougher. Be patient, Santa, and don't cut corners. Don't get comp=
lacent. There's more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out=
 of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you. But don't worry ab=
out this letter, of course! If there's any white powder on the envelope, it=
 came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle =
for your upcoming visit!=20
Anyhow, this year it's clear that many, many people are a lot more needy th=
an I am, so in the spirit of the season I'm gonna ask for their presents fi=
rst.=20
I should start, I guess, with the poor folks at Andersen, the accounting an=
d consulting firm. Boy, Santa, do those guys need some new calculators! Ple=
ase get a whole bunch for them. They approved the books for the fellows ove=
r at Enron, whose earnings didn't turn out to really be what they said they=
 were at first. Then they had to restate them. Was their collective face re=
d! I'm sure if the Andersen people had better equipment, they wouldn't have=
 screwed up like that with Enron, or with all the other corporations they s=
eemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty =
consulting fees.=20
While we're at it, I suppose we can't ignore the senior management that use=
d to run Enron either. What a bunch of boneheads! But this is the holiday t=
ime of year, Santa, the season of forgiveness and giving, so why not make t=
heir executive homes your first stop? They need a lot, Santa. To start with=
, they're gonna want, like, thousands of hours of legal time from expensive=
 firms, so give them that. And why not throw in a couple of files they can =
bake into cakes for later on?=20
On your way out of town, forget about toys and games and stuff like that an=
d just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee, =
particularly the fired ones, and of course the older ones who thought they =
were going to have something to retire on. And as for the financial planner=
s who allowed employees' 401(k)s to hold solely the company's stock, I supp=
ose you should bring very special presents for them too...I can't think of =
what, though...How about we let the Enron work force figure that one out?=
=20
There are so many business executives to think about this year too. Most of=
 them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter=
. That would be a huge surprise, and you know how much executives like plea=
sant surprises!=20
Bill Gates? You don't need to bring anything for him, Santa. He has just ab=
out everything, you know, and what he doesn't have, he can certainly take o=
ver and repackage as part of his operating system. But I guess you should t=
ry to make sure that there's an Xbox under every American child's tree this=
 year, and a couple of games too, particularly the one where those buff gir=
ls in tiny Spandex outfits throw each other around. Just knowing he was mak=
ing so many children happy would bring a seasonal smile to Bill's Microface=
.=20
Oh. Make a very special trip to Carly Fiorina too. She's the woman who runs=
 Hewlett-Packard, you know. She worked so hard this year and had so much ag=
gravation, Santa, so...could you please make Walter Hewlett go away? He's t=
he son of the founder, and he's being a real party pooper! He thinks that t=
he merger is bad for a lot of stupid reasons...like something about how it =
will draw the company away from its core competencies in printing and focus=
 it on the low-margin computer-manufacturing side of the business, but when=
 you get right down to it, he's simply being a bummer, that's all. Please, =
Santa. Bring Carly her merger. She's staked her whole reputation--and her b=
onus next year--on the outcome, and, you know, any CEO who is willing to ri=
sk compensation on something must want it really, really bad.=20
While you're at it, please bring John Chambers, the head of Cisco, a good s=
tock price right away. The poor fellow has six million options riding on it=
. Four million of them are underwater, but more recently the company gave h=
im two million more at a strike price of $18.50, and they should be worth s=
omething, don't you think? If you don't, Mr. Chambers will really feel that=
 $268,131 he gave up in salary to show he knows that corporations should pa=
y for performance and nothing less.=20
Gee, this is getting kind of long, and I haven't even gotten to myself yet!=
 So, just briefly, bring Alan Greenspan something nice but healthy, Santa--=
very, very healthy, no cigars or liquor. Vitamins! Yeah! And let's see...oh=
, yes, bring the Internet some genuine advertising revenue, will you? It co=
uld really use it. And don't forget to leave the folks over at the New York=
 Times business section some Prozac. Or Viagra, maybe. Anything to cheer th=
em up.=20
For myself, now...well, I guess I have just about everything a man could wa=
nt, so I'll just mention a few of the things I could do without. Bring me n=
o cutbacks in my stocking, Santa, for me or my friends, and no smallpox, an=
d no anthrax, and no particular reasons to travel anywhere by plane, at lea=
st for a while. And most of all please do not bring a suitcase with a nucle=
ar weapon in it for anybody I know, and even the people I don't. Other than=
 that, I could always use a new car. Anything will do, as long as the top g=
oes down. And a phone even tinier than the one I have, to show I'm getting =
more powerful. And hey, keep this global warming going on. It's great!=20
Now get busy, my man! You're gonna need plenty of time before takeoff this =
year, you know, to interview all the reindeer twice after conducting extens=
ive background checks on all of them, especially Rudolph, whose nose always=
 looked a little red to me, and to X-ray all those packages, no matter how =
small they might be, while making sure nothing has been placed in the bagga=
ge compartments underneath your sleigh by the grinches who want to steal a =
whole lot more than Christmas. Fly safe, Santa! We need you more than ever =
this year!=20
Oh--and while you're over Iraq, if you happen to spot a suspicious factory =
or laboratory of any sort, don't forget to pop a nice little present down i=
ts chimney, from--and for--all of us.=20
Feliz Navidad, baby!=20

Features/The Credit Watchers
The Geeks Who Rule The World ; There's a reason Moody's and S&P have been d=
oing so well. Their customers can't say no.

On Nov. 28, when Standard & Poor's and then Moody's downgraded Enron's debt=
 below the all-important status "investment grade," the company's bankruptc=
y became a foregone conclusion. The downgrades confirmed that Enron would n=
o longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital=
 markets, and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt.=
=20
But the one-two credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron. They wer=
e also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever- increasing power of th=
e agencies themselves. A much-coveted triple-A rating (the highest grade) i=
s the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine. It makes every aspect of doing=
 business easier, from raising money to convincing customers that operation=
s are solid. In contrast, an S&P or Moody's downgrade is a fearsome event t=
hat can dramatically increase a company's cost of capital, perhaps even des=
troy its ability to raise money. As one critic put it decades ago, they ret=
ain an "almost biblical authority."
That's because the rating agencies--private, for-profit companies that are =
privy to insider information--have come to play a quasi- regulatory role in=
 the market. Many big investors, from pension funds to insur-ance companies=
 to money market funds, are prohibited from owning more than a set amount o=
f lower-rated debt, for instance.=20
But while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies' power, it also bri=
ngs some long-simmering criticism--think back to 1975, when the agencies fa=
iled to downgrade New York City's debt until the city's fiscal crisis was o=
bvious--to a frothy boil. Critics say that the credit czars, for all their =
inside access, didn't identify this borrower's woes any earlier than the re=
st of us did--and they didn't downgrade the debt even after the severity of=
 the problems was well known. Indeed, prior to the downgrades, Enron's debt=
 was trading at around 50 cents on the dollar, a sign that the market had a=
lready dismissed the company's investment-grade status as farce. "The ratin=
g agencies are always late," grouses one portfolio manager.=20
Of course, neither John Rutherfurd, the CEO of Moody's, nor Leo O'Neill, S&=
P's president, see things that way. "We communicated our view [that Enron's=
 rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy] clearly and frequently," s=
ays O'Neill. Adds Rutherford: "We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we=
 delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed."=
=20
How can the same entities be all-powerful and strangely after-the- fact at =
the same time? That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in today's capit=
al markets. The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight t=
heir opinions carry make their judgments critical--but also complicated. Th=
e agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course =
of events. That's because a downgrade can become a self-fulfilling prophecy=
: If the rating agencies act too rashly, they could be accused of causing a=
 bankruptcy. Yet if they deliberate too long, they'll simply be stating wha=
t everyone already knows--especially since today, unlike in the '70s, there=
 is an army of outside fixed-income analysts that both challenge the rating=
 agencies' judgments and profit from anticipating their actions.=20
True, this debate rarely reaches Enron-esque proportions. And it's worth em=
phasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies' purvi=
ews. They analyze almost every fixed-income instrument out there, from the =
debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from, say, the Miss=
issippi tobacco settlement. Their power, in fact, is very much entwined wit=
h that omnipresence. Moody's alone claims that it rates more than $30 trill=
ion of the world's debt from over 100 countries, 4,200 corporations, and 68=
,000 public finance obligations.=20
What's more, the agencies appear, in the wide lens of history, to be fairly=
 accurate in their judgments: As both O'Neill and Rutherfurd note, it's rar=
e that investment- grade credits go kaput. Both agencies have statistics sh=
owing that less than 1% of bonds rated A- or better default over a five-yea=
r period. In addition, around 85% of the credits in the domestic A class st=
ill hold the rating at year- end, implying stability in higher-rated bonds.=
=20
But by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of sta=
bility. And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interestin=
g time--for Moody's especially. Until recently the actual businesses of Moo=
dy's and S&P were hidden away inside much larger companies. S&P is still bu=
ried within McGraw-Hill. But in October 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun Moody's=
 out as a separate company. For the first time ever, outsiders can perform =
a credit check on a rating agency.=20
Combing through Moody's financials makes one thing perfectly clear: Credit =
rating is a fabulous business. Since its spinoff, Moody's stock has climbed=
--yes, climbed--some 40%, giving Moody's the same market value as Bear Stea=
rns. This year the rating agency is expected to generate about $770 million=
 in revenues (less than a tenth of Bear's revenues) and an astounding $382 =
million in operating income. And Moody's does this with just 1,600 employee=
s. Perhaps it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is =
the company's largest shareholder, owning just about 15% of the stock. Henr=
y Berghoef of Harris Associates, another large Moody's holder, says that th=
e biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the c=
ompany's immense free cash flow. Rutherfurd himself, a scholarly, white-hai=
red 62-year-old, has few complaints. "It's a big thrill," he says.=20
Indeed, what's not to like? For one thing, Moody's potential customers almo=
st can't say no. As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report, "=
In many cases, a Moody's rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to=
 market with a new issue of fixed-income securities." Like an investment ba=
nk, Moody's is a big beneficiary of the long-term growth in the capital mar=
kets--without even having to risk its own capital. Kevin Gruneich, an analy=
st at Bear Stearns, calculates that over the past 20 years Moody's revenue =
and profits grew at compound annual rates of 16% and 15%, respectively--a g=
rowth trend he terms "incredible." (Rutherfurd adds that in the past 20 yea=
rs, profits have fallen only once, in 1994.) In recent years Moody's has st=
abilized its revenue still further, basically creating an annuity stream by=
 instituting what it calls "relationship pricing." Instead of hiring Moody'=
s on a transactional basis, some of its customers now pay an annual fee; in=
 return, Moody's rates every bond issue they do. "Relationship pricing" now=
 accounts for 36% of Moody's revenues.=20
Both Moody's and S&P have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with i=
nnovations in the capital markets. Witness the explosion of a new type of d=
ebt known as "structured finance"--a bond, for instance, backed by the cash=
 flow from residential mortgages. Here the rating is everything: It measure=
s the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the=
 yield that must be paid to attract investors. "The rating agencies play an=
 integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace," says Kevin Rigb=
y, head of Deutsche Bank's rating advisory business, which helps Deutsche's=
 clients argue their cases to the rating agencies. (In yet another indicati=
on of the agencies' power, many of the major investment banks have entire d=
epartments that do this.) Structured finance is now Moody's largest busines=
s, accounting for one-third of its revenues, up from almost nothing in the =
late 1980s.=20
As Moody's pushes aggressively into new markets, it has expanded its power =
base as well. Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe, which currentl=
y accounts for about 20% of the company's sales. He notes happily that ther=
e are about 1,500 unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion =
euros. "Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should pro=
pel growth in ratings for the next decade," he says, quickly adding, "But w=
e love banks too." Indeed. Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervis=
ion proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks' capital adeq=
uacy. (The proposal seems to be on hold for now.)=20
This is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagine=
d when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in 1909. In the=
 beginning it was all very simple: Investors paid for Moody's research, whi=
ch helped disseminate important information to the market. Some two decades=
 later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the=
 values of their investment portfolios. Then, in the second half of the cen=
tury, the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities=
 insurance companies, pension plans, broker-dealers, and money market funds=
 could own. Both Moody's and S&P resisted those developments for a number o=
f reasons--but they didn't say no. "I don't think that ratings should be us=
ed to determine investment policy," O'Neill maintains today; Moody's has wr=
itten a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory polic=
y.=20
Another substantial change occurred around 1970. Prior to that time Moody's=
 and S&P had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions. Given th=
e growing volume of work, however, those economics no longer made sense. So=
 first Moody's and then S&P began to charge issuers instead. There's a cons=
tant worry that this poses a conflict of interest. But unlike equity analys=
ts, the credit analysts don't have to worry about buying business with favo=
rable ratings. Companies simply don't have a lot of choice.=20
The most controversial development came in 1975 when the SEC, worried that =
fly-by-night rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market, initiated a m=
outhful of a designation, the "nationally recognized statistical rating org=
anization," or NSRSO. To comply with various SEC regulations, a company's r=
ating had to come from an NSRSO- -essentially, Moody's, S&P, or Fitch, a sm=
aller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac. The design=
ation has become the subject of intense debate. "The SEC has enveloped [the=
 agencies] in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challen=
ging them," says Lawrence White, an economics professor at NYU. "There they=
 are, a 2 1/2-firm industry, sitting pretty." But no one has a better idea.=
 Says Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at The=
len Reid & Priest: "It's a very uncomfortable situation, but it's impractic=
al to take out what is already there."=20
There have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have- -Moody'=
s in particular. In the early 1990s allegations began to swirl that Moody's=
 bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited (and negative=
) ratings to those that declined the offer. One Colorado school district su=
ed the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale, cla=
iming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate, resulti=
ng in a net loss of $769,000. The court ruled that Moody's ratings were opi=
nions, not facts--and therefore the company was protected under the First A=
mendment.=20
But that hardly settles the broader issue: In the capital markets the ratin=
gs can function as facts even if they aren't. That's because of the numerou=
s regulations that are built around them. The Continental Divide is between=
 investment-grade securities and non- investment-grade securities, because =
many investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, are permitted t=
o own only a certain quantity of lower-quality bonds. And many money market=
 funds are allowed to have just 5% of their assets in commercial paper that=
 doesn't carry a top rating. So when Moody's and S&P downgraded Ford Motor'=
s debt in October, Gary Zeltzer, head of investment-grade fixed income at J=
.W. Seligman, had no choice but to sell. (While Ford's debt sold off on the=
 downgrade, it now trades at a better price than it did before.)=20
And that brings us back to the Enron question: How much should credit ratin=
gs anticipate the verdict of the stock market? O'Neill insists that his fir=
m cannot afford to rush to judgment; it doesn't bother him at all, he says,=
 if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies: "The market=
 tends to be much more near-term focused. We need to be diligent and make s=
ure we do our work." Richard Waugh, an analyst at the Principal Financial G=
roup, agrees. "What [the agencies] do moves markets and affects the flow of=
 capital. So they have to make very sure that they're right, and they lean =
over backward to accomplish that."=20
But Moody's Rutherfurd has a different point of view. "If a credit is deter=
iorating, we want to be the first to spot it," he says. He jumps up to an e=
asel, looking very professorial, to talk about the "Merton model"--basicall=
y, a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings. I=
n his view, that's important, because the equity market is forward-looking,=
 whereas accounting data are reflective of the past. "We think we're way ah=
ead of S&P in doing this," he boasts. Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle a=
t the recent criticism. "I hate the word 'optimal,' " he says. "But we do t=
he best we can, and we think it's pretty good."=20
That "pretty good" is likely to be as good as it gets--barring a few more E=
nron-caliber events, the credit-rating system isn't likely to change. As Fi=
rst Union analyst Asa Graves says of Moody's, "They would have to really sh=
oot themselves in the foot to lose serious market position."=20

"Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People who rai=
se questions are people who have not gone through it in detail. We have exp=
licit answers, but people want to throw rocks at us."=20
So said Enron's then-CEO, Jeff Skilling, in an interview I had with him las=
t February. At the time--less than ten months ago, let's recall--Enron's ma=
rket capitalization was around $60 billion, just a shade below its all-time=
 high, and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble=
. I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enro=
n's valuation, and I'd called with what I considered fairly standard querie=
s in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statemen=
ts. The response from Enron was anything but standard. Skilling quickly bec=
ame frustrated, said that the line of inquiry was "unethical," and hung up =
the phone. A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and off=
ered to come to FORTUNE's New York City office with then-CFO Andy Fastow an=
d investor-relations head Mark Koenig. "We want to make sure we've answered=
 your questions completely and accurately," he said.
Now, in the wake of Enron's stunning collapse, it looks as if the company's=
 critics didn't throw enough rocks. The world is clamoring for those "expli=
cit answers," but Skilling, long gone from Enron-- and avoiding the press o=
n the advice of his lawyers--is in no position to provide them. As for "com=
pletely and accurately," many would argue that the men running Enron never =
understood either concept. "One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods=
," says Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who is calling for a congressional =
investigation. "What we're looking at here is an example of superbly comple=
x financial reports. They didn't have to lie. All they had to do was to obf=
uscate it with sheer complexity--although they probably lied too."=20
Until recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business =
or financial statements were complicated; its attitude, expressed with bare=
ly concealed disdain, was that anyone who couldn't understand its business =
just didn't "get it." Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company we=
re content to go along. Bulls, including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, =
admitted that they had to take the company's word on its numbers--but it wa=
sn't a problem, you see, because Enron delivered what the Street most cared=
 about: smoothly growing earnings. Of course, now that it's clear that thos=
e earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's busin=
ess was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ke=
n Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title=
 from Skilling last summer). Which leads to a basic question: Why were so m=
any people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood?=

Of course, since the Enron collapse, there are other basic questions as wel=

 swirling around the business community and in Enron's hometown of Houston:=
 Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place, =
is someone going to jail?=20
A CULTURE OF ARROGANCE=20
If you believe the old saying that "those whom the gods would destroy they =
first make proud," perhaps this saga isn't so surprising. "Arrogant" is the=
 word everyone uses to describe Enron. It was an attitude epitomized by the=
 banner in Enron's lobby: THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY. There was the compan=
y's powerful belief that older, stodgier competitors had no chance against =
the sleek, modern Enron juggernaut. "These big companies will topple over f=
rom their own weight," Skilling said last year, referring to old-economy be=
hemoths like Exxon Mobil. A few years ago at a conference of utility execut=
ives, "Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch," recall=
s Southern Co. executive Dwight Evans. ("People find that amusing today," a=
dds Evans.) Or how about Skilling's insistence last winter that the company=
's stock--then about $80 a share--should sell for $126 a share? Jim Alexand=
er, the former CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, which was spun off in=
 1994, once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities. "The co=
mmon theme is hubris, an overweening pride, which led people to believe the=
y can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger."=20
To be sure, for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arroga=
nt about. The company, which Ken Lay helped create in 1985 from the merger =
of two gas pipelines, really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and elect=
ricity. It really did build new markets for the trading of, say, weather fu=
tures. For six years running, it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNE's =
Most Admired Companies. Led by Skilling, who had joined the company in 1990=
 from consulting firm McKinsey (he succeeded Lay as CEO in February 2001), =
Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anyt=
hing, from electrons to advertising space. By the end of the decade, Enron,=
 which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines, generated m=
ore than 80% of its earnings from a vaguer business known as "wholesale ene=
rgy operations and services." From 1998 to 2000, Enron's revenues shot from=
 $31 billion to more than $100 billion, making it the seventh-largest compa=
ny on the FORTUNE 500. And in early 2000, just as broadband was becoming a =
buzzword worth billions in market value, Enron announced plans to trade tha=
t too.=20
But that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance. Greed was=
 evident, even in the early days. "More than anywhere else, they talked abo=
ut how much money we would make," says someone who worked for Skilling. Com=
pensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather th=
an generating profits for shareholders. For instance, in Enron's energy ser=
vices division, which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli =
Lilly, executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that=
 relied on internal estimates. As a result, says one former executive, ther=
e was pressure to, in effect, inflate the value of the contracts--even thou=
gh it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated.=20
Because Enron believed it was leading a revolution, it encouraged flouting =
the rules. There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to ex=
ecutives' personal lives--rumors of sexual high jinks in the executive rank=
s ran rampant. Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness, both ext=
ernal and internal. Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of =
forced rankings for employees, in which those rated in the bottom 20% would=
 leave the company. Thus, employees attempted to crush not just outsiders b=
ut each other. "Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individ=
ual parts," says an executive at a competing energy firm. Enron traders, he=
 adds, were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to th=
em might use information off their screen to trade against them. And becaus=
e delivering bad news had career-wrecking potential, problems got papered o=
ver--especially, says one former employee, in the trading operation. "Peopl=
e perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes. It was astoundi=
ng to me."=20
TRADING SECRETS=20
"We're not a trading company," said Fastow during that February visit. "We =
are not in the business of making money by speculating." He also pointed ou=
t that over the past five years, Enron had reported 20 straight quarters of=
 increasing income. "There's not a trading company in the world that has th=
at kind of consistency," he said. "That's the check at the end of the day."=
=20
In fact, it's next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees w=
ith Fastow's contention. "They were not an energy company that used trading=
 as a part of their strategy, but a company that traded for trading's sake,=
" says Austin Ramzy, research director of Principal Capital Income Investor=
s. "Enron is dominated by pure trading," says one competitor. Indeed, Enron=
 had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies, especially in =
longer-term contracts, in which there is far less liquidity. "Enron swung f=
or the fences," says another trader. And it's no secret that among non- inv=
estment banks, Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in compl=
ex financial instruments such as credit derivatives. Because Enron didn't h=
ave as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that wo=
rld, it had to offer better prices to get business. "Funky" is a word that =
is used to describe its trades.=20
But there's an obvious explanation for why Enron didn't want to disclose th=
e extent to which it was a trading company. For Enron, it was all about the=
 price of the stock, and trading companies, with their inherently volatile =
earnings, simply aren't rewarded with rich valuations. Look at Goldman Sach=
s: One of the best trading outfits in the world, its stock rarely sells for=
 more than 20 times earnings, vs. the 70 or so multiple that Enron shares c=
ommanded at their peak. You'll never hear Goldman's management predicting t=
he precise amount it will earn next year--yet Enron's management predicted =
earnings practically to the penny. The odd mismatch between what Enron's ma=
nagement said and what others say isn't just an academic debate. The questi=
on goes to the heart of Enron's valuation, which was based on its ability t=
o generate predictable earnings.=20
Why didn't that disconnect seem to matter? Because like Enron's management,=
 investors cared only about the stock price too. And as long as Enron poste=
d the earnings it promised (and talked up big ideas like broadband), the st=
ock price was supposed to keep on rising- -as, indeed, it did for a while. =
Institutions like Janus, Fidelity, and Alliance Capital piled in. Of course=
, earnings growth isn't the entire explanation for Wall Street's attitude. =
There were also the enormous investment-banking fees Enron generated. Nor w=
as asking questions easy. Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they do=
n't understand something. And Skilling was notoriously short with those who=
 didn't immediately concur with the Enron world-view. "If you didn't act li=
ke a light bulb came on pretty quick, Skilling would dismiss you," says one=
 portfolio manager. "They had Wall Street beaten into submission," he adds.=
=20
WHERE ARE THE PROFITS?=20
Although it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn agai=
nst Enron, it's not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor=
 had no clothes. In early 2001, Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a =
highly regarded firm that specializes in short- selling, said publicly what=
 now seems obvious: No one could explain how Enron actually made money. Cha=
nos also pointed out that while Enron's business seemed to resemble nothing=
 so much as a hedge fund-- "a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline=
," in the memorable words of Doug Millett, Kynikos' chief operating officer=
--it simply didn't make very much money. Enron's operating margin had plung=
ed from around 5% in early 2000 to under 2% by early 2001, and its return o=
n invested capital hovered at 7%--a figure that does not include Enron's of=
f-balance-sheet debt, which, as we now know, was substantial. "I wouldn't p=
ut my money in a hedge fund earning a 7% return," scoffed Chanos, who also =
pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shares--hardly the behav=
ior of someone who believed his $80 stock was really worth $126.=20
Not only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable, but its cash flow from operat=
ions seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings. Because much =
of Enron's business was booked on a "mark to market" basis, in which a comp=
any estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations =
through the income statement, reported earnings didn't correspond to the ac=
tual cash coming in the door. That isn't necessarily bad--as long as the ca=
sh shows up at some point. But over time Enron's operations seemed to consu=
me a lot of cash; on-balance-sheet debt climbed from $3.5 billion in 1996 t=
o $13 billion at last report.=20
Skilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enron's low returns. The "=
distorting factor," in Fastow's words, was Enron's huge investments in inte=
rnational pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil. Skilling told=
 analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming old-line assets as =
quickly as it could and that the returns in Enron's newer businesses were m=
uch, much higher. It's undeniable that Enron did make a number of big, bad =
bets on overseas projects--in fact, India and Brazil are two good examples.=
 But in truth, no one on the outside (and few people inside Enron) can inde=
pendently measure how profitable--or more to the point, how consistently pr=
ofitable--Enron's trading operations really were. A former employee says th=
at Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the=
 trading business generated, instead pointing to reported earnings, just as=
 Fastow did. By the late 1990s much of Enron's asset portfolio had been lum=
ped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes. Chanos noted tha=
t Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue. In =
addition, Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included r=
esults from those investments in the figures it reported.=20
Chanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnersh=
ips. In poring over Enron documents, he took note of an odd and opaque ment=
ion of transactions that Enron and other "Entities" had done with a "Relate=
d Party" that was run by "a senior officer of Enron." Not only was it impos=
sible to understand what that meant, but it also raised a conflict-of-inter=
est issue, given that an Enron senior executive--CFO Fastow, as it turns ou=
t--ran the "Related Party" entities. These, we now know, refer to the LJM p=
artnerships.=20
When it came to the "Related Party" transactions, Enron didn't even pretend=
 to be willing to answer questions. Back in February, Fastow (who at the ti=
me didn't admit his involvement) said that the details were "confidential" =
because Enron "didn't want information to get into the market." Then he exp=
lained that the partnerships were used for "unbundling and reassembling" th=
e various components of a contract. "We strip out price risk, we strip out =
interest rate risk, we strip out all the risks," he said. "What's left may =
not be something that we want." The obvious question is, Why would anyone e=
lse want whatever was left either? But perhaps that didn't matter, because =
the partnerships were supported with Enron stock--which, you remember, wasn=
't supposed to decline in value.=20
SKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL=20
By mid-August enough questions had been raised about Enron's credibility th=
at the stock had begun falling; it had dropped from $80 at the beginning of=
 the year to the low 40s. And then came what should have been the clearest =
signal yet of serious problems: Jeff Skilling's shocking announcement that =
he was leaving the company. Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason f=
or his departure, Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was rel=
ated to possible problems with the company. Now, however, there are those w=
ho speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc o=
n the partnerships--and cause their exposure. "He saw what was coming, and =
he didn't have the emotional fortitude to deal with it," says a former empl=
oyee.=20
What's astonishing is that even in the face of this dramatic--and largely i=
nexplicable--event, people were still willing to take Enron at its word. Ke=
n Lay, who stepped back into his former role as CEO, retained immense credi=
bility on Wall Street and with Enron's older employees, who gave him a stan=
ding ovation at a meeting announcing his return. He said there were no "acc=
ounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, and people bel=
ieved him. Lay promised to restore Enron's credibility by improving its dis=
closure practices, which he finally admitted had been less than adequate.=
=20
Did Lay have any idea of what he was talking about? Or was he as clueless a=
s Enron's shareholders? Most people believe the latter. But even when Lay c=
learly did know an important piece of information, he seemed to be more inc=
lined to bury it, Enron-style, than to divulge it. After all, Enron's now i=
nfamous Oct. 16 press release--the one that really marked the beginning of =
the end, in which it announced a $618 million loss but failed to mention th=
at it had written down shareholders' equity by a stunning $1.2 billion--wen=
t out under Lay's watch. And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the s=
ubsequent conference call: that Moody's was considering a downgrade of Enro=
n's debt. (Although Skilling said last February that Enron's off-balance- s=
heet debt was "non-recourse" to Enron, it turns out that that wasn't quite =
true either. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of Enron's =
on-balance-sheet debt below investment grade, Enron could be forced to repa=
y it.)=20
Indeed, facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism, Enron seemed to =
retreat further and further from Lay's promises of full disclosure. The rat=
her vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in sharehold=
ers' equity was the "early termination" of the LJM partnerships. That was f=
ar from enough to satisfy investors, especially as the Wall Street Journal =
began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships, incl=
uding the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs.=
 As recently as Oct. 23, Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash, that t=
he business was "performing very well," and that Fastow was a standup guy w=
ho was being unnecessarily smeared. The very next day Enron announced that =
Fastow would take a leave of absence.=20
We now know, of course, that Enron's dealings with its various related part=
ies had a huge impact on the earnings it reported. On Nov. 8, an eye-poppin=
g document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the pas=
t 4 3/4 years because "three unconsolidated entities should have been conso=
lidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounti=
ng principles." The restatement reduced earnings by almost $600 million, or=
 about 15%, and contained a warning that Enron could still find "additional=
 or different information."=20
And sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected trans=
actions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more=
 questions than answers. The speculation is that the partnerships were used=
 to even out Enron's earnings. Which leads to another set of questions: If =
Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean, would the comp=
any have survived? Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the re=
al story would have been even more scandalous?=20
THE LAST GASP=20
On the surface, the facts that led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing are =
quite straightforward. For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy (which had lo=
ng prided itself on being the anti-Enron) would bail out its flailing rival=
 by injecting it with an immediate $1.5 billion in cash, secured by an opti=
on on Enron's key pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and then purchasing all o=
f Enron for roughly $10 billion (not including debt). But by Nov. 28 the de=
al had fallen apart. On that day Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's debt =
below investment grade, triggering the immediate repayment of almost $4 bil=
lion in off-balance-sheet debt--which Enron couldn't pay.=20
But even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists. Both compan=
ies are suing each other: Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated th=
e deal, "consistently took advantage of Enron's precarious state to further=
 its own business goals," and as a result has no right to Enron's Northern =
Natural pipeline. Dynegy calls Enron's suit "one more example of Enron's fa=
ilure to take responsibility for its demise." No one can predict how the su=
its will pan out, but one irony is clear: Enron, that new-economy superstar=
, is battling to hang on to its very old-economy pipeline.=20
To hear Dynegy tell it, a central rationale for abandoning the deal was wha=
t might be called the mystery of the missing cash. General counsel Ken Rand=
olph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some $3 billion in cash--but a=
n Enron filing revealed just over $1 billion. "We went back to Enron and we=
 asked, 'Where did the cash go? Where did the cash go?' " says CEO Chuck Wa=
tson. "Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to =
believe," speculates Randolph. Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep =
secrets to the last. Enron's lack of cash was revealed to the world in a fi=
ling on the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19. Watson says he got the document o=
nly a few hours earlier--but that Lay had a copy on Friday. "I was not happ=
y," says Watson. "It's not good form to surprise your partner."=20
Sagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courts--and Enron's is no exc=
eption. Given that credit-rating agency Fitch estimates that even senior un=
secured-debt holders will get only 20% to 40% of their money back, the batt=
les among Enron's various creditors are likely to be fierce. Nor has Enron =
itself conceded yet. The company's biggest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase and C=
itigroup, have extended $1.5 billion of "debtor in possession" financing to=
 Enron, which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while. A=
nd Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its =
trading business.=20
In the meantime, the courts will also be trying to answer a key question: W=
ho should pay? Enron's Chapter 11 filing automatically freezes all suits ag=
ainst the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved. But while Enron =
may seek the same protection for its executives, lawyers predict that the a=
ttempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of s=
uits. Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executi=
ves like Skilling and Fastow. But such cases require proof of "knowing, wil=
lful, intentional misconduct," says well-known defense attorney Ira Sorkin.=
 And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil =
case: proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the ev=
idence. That's a high bar, especially since Enron executives will probably =
claim that they had Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, approving their every=
 move. With Enron in bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen is now the deepest availab=
le pocket, and the shareholder suits are already piling up.=20
In any conversation about Enron, the comparison with Long-Term Capital Mana=
gement invariably crops up. In some ways, it looks as if the cost of the En=
ron debacle is far less than that of LTCM--far less than anyone would have =
thought possible, in fact (see next story). But in other ways the cost is f=
ar greater. Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who =
counted on management, the board, and the auditors to protect them. That's =
why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga, "It disgusts me, and i=
t frightens me." And that's why, regardless of how the litigation plays out=
, it feels as though a crime has been committed.=20

Features/The Recovery
Will The Economy Get Well Soon? ; The Fed has been slashing rates with a ve=
ngeance, but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery.

(Copyright 2001)=20

When it comes to recessions, economists believe in a simple rule of thumb: =
Pump money and credit into an ailing economy, and before long you have a re=
covery. The bigger the injection, the stronger the rebound. So between Alan=
 Greenspan's yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the government's=
 latest stimulus package, totaling $75 billion, we should get one mind-blow=
ing recovery, right? After all, the last time we pumped so much money into =
the economy was in the early 1960s, and things turned out pretty groovy bac=
k then.=20
Unfortunately, it may not be so simple this time. Eight months into this re=
cession, consumers are still buying big-ticket items like cars and homes. W=
hile that has kept the economy from totally tanking, it leaves little pent-=
up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery. So it's all up to corporate Am=
erica--which, you'll recall, got us into this mess in the first place. As M=
ark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, puts it, "The difference between=
 a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investme=
nt."
And on that score, there's cause for concern, if not outright agita. Most w=
orrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporat=
e lending. If that continues, the recovery may not be right around the corn=
er, as many economists are now predicting- -or if it is, it won't feel like=
 much of one. Here's what's going on.=20
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, many banks have turned hypercautio=
us. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the =
most comprehensive picture of banks' willingness to lend, 51% of domestic b=
anks restricted their lending in October, up from 40% in August. Foreign ba=
nks became just as wary, and the tougher credit conditions are affecting fi=
rms of all sizes across the country. "We've become more conservative in our=
 lending," admits George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank & Trust in=
 Atlanta. "We're turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago."=
=20
Banks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too. Accor=
ding to the same Fed survey, more than half of domestic banks in October ra=
ised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans. At the same time, a g=
rowing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and colla=
teral requirements on large and medium-sized companies. All this took place=
 even as the Fed was slashing short-term interest rates to stimulate busine=
ss investment. Indeed, as we'll see later, what should be one of the best t=
imes ever to borrow money isn't turning out that way at all for most compan=
ies. There's one notable exception--large, well-known firms have taken adva=
ntage of a bonanza in the corporate bond market--yet here, too, that borrow=
ing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper, for exam=
ple, has dried up.=20
So what's making banks so jittery? Blame Osama. Jay Sidhu, CEO of Sovereign=
 Bank in Pennsylvania, says Sept. 11 introduced a lot more uncertainty for =
corporate earnings, leading banks to worry about the quality of loans. "Sud=
denly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that, and it=
 made us more cautious," he explains. "I think the majority of banks reacte=
d in the same way." Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the ec=
onomy before he's willing to lend freely. In particular, he's closely watch=
ing consumer confidence, employment, and investment in technology for signs=
 of a sustained rebound.=20
Once Sidhu becomes less squeamish, other bankers probably won't be far behi=
nd. "Bankers are herdlike in their behavior," says Zandi. "They've trained =
in the same way, go to the same conferences, and talk to one another, so wh=
en one bank makes a change, the others follow." The trouble is, even when b=
anks become more optimistic, there's a lag effect before easier credit bene=
fits the economy. Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can ta=
ke at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of c=
redit to when firms spend the funds.=20
So how bad could it get? Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve=
--the early 1990s. Although it's hard to remember anything negative happeni=
ng at all during the 1990s nirvana, we did experience a full-blown credit c=
runch at the start of the decade. That's the reason the recovery from the 1=
990-91 recession felt so lackluster. In fact, the media dubbed it the "jobl=
ess recovery" because firms simply couldn't get the funds they needed from =
banks to expand operations and hire more staff. At the time, remember, bank=
s were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust. Happily=
, that's not the case today. "Right now we don't have anything like the rea=
l estate crisis of the late '80s," says Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's ch=
ief U.S. economist. "It's not about a problem with capital but with confide=
nce." Still, another corporate collapse a la Enron, and banks might find th=
eir capital base isn't as strong as they thought. That's one of the things =
about economic slumps. Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight.=20
While we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession, it's clear =
we won't return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the '90=
s anytime soon. The main reason is that the conditions for business investm=
ent aren't nearly as ideal as they were in the 1990s. As the recovery got u=
nder way back then, Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit, whi=
ch brought long-term interest rates down steadily. Today we face the opposi=
te situation. The surplus has vanished, and the prospect of mounting defici=
ts is fast becoming reality. That's one reason long-term interest rates hav=
e hardly budged this year although official short- term rates plunged from =

Enron Fallout: Wide, But Not Deep ; Enron's collapse has hurt big American =
banks. But not as much as a default by Argentina would.

In a bland suburban office park 30 minutes north of Atlanta, life after Enr=
on is taking shape. It's a show of creative destruction that would make phi=
losopher Joseph Schumpeter proud. Only a few months ago, the Intercontinent=
al Exchange (ICE) was battling Enron for a slice of the online energy marke=
t. Now ICE and its CEO, Jeff Sprecher, are struggling to handle a flood of =
new business, as former Enron clients search for other ways to trade electr=
icity and natural gas. Sprecher has airlifted in servers from around the co=
untry; his tech team is working 24/7 to accommodate trading volume of $2.5 =
billion a day--a 100% increase in two weeks. ICE's volumes climbed steadily=
 all through November, as Enron's customers ebbed away. But now, says Sprec=
her, "by any measure, our business is going through the roof. Enron opened =
the door, and I walked through."=20
ICE's success at profiting from Enron's failure illustrates just how quickl=
y the market has moved to absorb the demise of America's seventh-largest co=
rporation. It's not that people aren't hurting: Thousands of Enron workers =
are unemployed, and investors face billions of dollars in losses. Still, no=
t a single light flickered after Enron's implosion, which had almost no imp=
act on volatile energy prices. "It's like a great ship going down--there's =
a big splash, but the sea quickly fills in," says John Rowe, co-CEO of Exel=
on, the nation's ninth-largest utility. "The short-term effect is really no=
t that substantial."
Among energy companies that traded with Enron, potential losses range from =
$100 million for Duke to $80 million for Mirant and $75 million for Dynegy.=
 Among banks, J.P. Morgan Chase recently announced that it had $500 million=
 in unsecured loan and derivative exposure to Enron; analysts say Citigroup=
 could face a similar loss. Those numbers sound large, but they're unlikely=
 to cause more than a crimp in earnings. "The fallout is a mile wide and an=
 inch deep," says Jim Hanbury, a bank analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasse=
rstein. "One of the very good things about being a big company is that when=
 bad things happen, it doesn't kill you." Indeed, the potential default of =
Argentina--a story pushed off the front pages by Enron--could actually pose=
 a more serious threat to America's money-center banks.=20
Large banks are further cushioned from Enron's failure because of the way l=
oans are syndicated. "Literally thousands of institutions get a piece," say=
s Hanbury--from smaller banks and Wall Street firms to insurance companies =
and hedge funds. That dilutes the impact of any one failure. Goldman Sachs'=
 Richard Strauss says Enron's collapse could trim Citigroup's earnings by f=
ive cents a share, but he still expects Citi to earn $3.25 a share in 2002.=
 He predicts J.P. Morgan will take a slightly bigger hit--15 cents a share-=
-equivalent to a 4% reduction in earnings next year. Strauss is similarly s=
anguine about the impact on Wall Street. "Wall Street has had time to react=
, so I think the exposure of major firms is pretty minimal," he says. "Unli=
ke Long-Term Capital's collapse or Russia's failure in 1998, people had a c=
hance to unwind their trading positions this time."=20
The fallout is likely to be felt most keenly within the energy industry its=
elf, especially among companies that, like Enron, had moved aggressively to=
 profit from trading and marketing electricity and natural gas. On Wall Str=
eet and in the boardrooms of energy towns like Houston and Atlanta, there's=
 a fierce debate over whether Enron's flaws were unique. The major survivin=
g energy traders-- including American Electric Power, Duke, Dynegy, Mirant,=
 and Reliant- -argue that unlike Enron, they possess major physical assets =
like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in=
 trading.=20
Ironically, just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowes=
s; today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of =
hard assets. "Our business model is fundamentally different from Enron's," =
says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. "We don't do nearly the volume of tr=
ading Enron did, and we also produce power and control natural gas. Enron h=
ad gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial servic=
es company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas." E=
ven so, Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors. For starters, says CSF=
B analyst Curt Launer, Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow fr=
om marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditiona=
l utilities. In addition, Enron is suing Dynegy for $10 billion as a result=
 of the failed merger. Although the suit has little chance of succeeding, a=
ny adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegy's stock price down=
. On the other hand, says Launer, Dynegy's shares have more upside potentia=
l if and when the energy sector comes back into favor.=20
Mirant's CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his =
company and Enron. "We have $22 billion in assets and 15,000 megawatts of g=
enerating power across the country," he says. "One wall of our trading floo=
r shows the status of every plant, and almost all our trading is driven by =
our own assets. So if I sell power forward six months or a year, I can prod=
uce it if I need to." In addition, says Hill, Mirant's internal controls ba=
r traders from putting more than $75 million of capital at risk each day. T=
hat's a small fraction of Mirant's shareholder equity, currently $4.7 billi=
on, or its annual profits, projected to be nearly $700 million in 2001. "At=
 the end of every day, the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how =
much capital is at risk," Hill says.=20
Still, executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to=
 tell investors just how their businesses work. Last month Mirant CEO Marce=
 Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York th=
rough each line of Mirant's balance sheet. "This isn't a topic that would h=
ave been included in an analysts' meeting in the past, but there's going to=
 be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understa=
nd how we make money," says Fuller. Duke Energy's group president of energy=
 services, Harvey Padewer, agrees: "We've been very open with the Street. N=
o one ever considered Duke a black box."=20
It will be a while before energy trading companies--even those with substan=
tial assets--regain the trust they had before the Enron debacle. Fuller say=
s that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas=
 for former Enron clients, getting fresh capital to build new power plants =
or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago. That has ca=
used Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments. "T=
here's still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there," admits=
 Fuller. "Larger, sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant, Dyneg=
y, and Reliant will do just fine. But the capital markets think if Enron ca=

Fearless reporting has taken senior writer Pattie Sellers to many strange b=

arisma, Failure, Power. (In fact, that's usually how it works; Pattie walks=

Bond guys have more fun. At least they did this year. Despite the stock mar=

the boring bond guys rich enough to do stuff formerly reserved for the IPO =
underwriting crowd--like spending an average worker's annual wages on a nig=

What's incredible, despite all the ink that's been spilled on the spectacul=
ar fall of Enron, is how much is still unclear. What did founder Ken Lay kn=

Power Player; Chuck Watson built Dynegy at blinding speed but was overshado=
wed by Enron. Now he's got the spotlight to himself.
Neil Weinberg and Daniel Fisher

Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.=20

On a cool day in Houston early last month, Dynegy chief Charles Watson anno=
unced the boldest deal of his career. In 15 years he had built the natural-=
gas producer into a powerhouse, but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigg=
er hometown rival, Enron Corp., and its chairman, the silver-tongued Kennet=
h Lay. Lay's swagger personified the freewheeling energy-trading markets, a=
nd Enron dominated the action, but now the titan was reeling from allegatio=
ns of dirty self-dealing, a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investig=
ation. Valued at $70 billion only months before, Enron was teetering on the=
 brink of collapse.=20
So Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival, at an especially sweet =
price: just $9 billion in Dynegy stock. Watson was sure the skeptics on Enr=
on were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rock-so=
lid money machine. Its revenue grew 57% in the third quarter to $47 billion=
--more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of 2000. For =
a fire-sale price, he boasted, Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a =
$200 billion-a-year giant with $90 billion in assets. The supercharged firm=
 would handle as much as one-quarter of U.S. energy trading. After operatin=
g in obscurity for years, Dynegy suddenly would become the second-largest c=
orporation in America in sales--"a world-class energy merchant by anyone's =
definition," Watson proclaimed.
Two weeks later Watson's triumph ended in epic failure. He scuttled his dre=
am deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelat=
ions at Enron. The big rival's market cap had continued to plunge, falling =
to a level so low--less than $270 million--as to make Watson look like a su=
cker for ever offering $9 billion. Enron clearly was headed for Chapter 11,=
 or even liquidation. The merger was off, and the recriminations and lawsui=
ts were just beginning.=20
"I was very disappointed," Watson says in characteristic, laconic understat=
ement. He also was furious: Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading in=
vestors, and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet again--so says Wat=
son--and laying the blame on Dynegy. "I just hope the other side doesn't th=
ink all this spinning, which got them into trouble to begin with, is going =
to get them out of it," he fumes.=20
In the fallout, Enron struggles to stay alive, and Watson can count his ble=
ssings. In retreating, he has dodged Enron's $12 billion in debt, the dark =
cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities & Exchange Commi=
ssion, the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabiliti=
es so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight. I=
nstead, Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy. He took it over in=
 1985 with a $600 investment and a 10% stake for himself, building it into =
a firm with a $10 billion market value (as of Nov. 30). With 5% now he's wo=
rth half a billion.=20
Watson vows to make Dynegy even bigger, even better, and an undisputed lead=
er in a gun-shy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its onc=
e-dominant progenitor, Enron. Dynegy says it can grow at least 20% next yea=
r, to $35 billion in revenue.=20
The death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson. Some of Enron's bu=
siness and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm; if he get=
s his way in court Watson will also get Enron's valuable pipeline system, N=
orthern Natural Gas, in return for the $1.5 billion he poured into Enron in=
 the course of the merger plans. The negative: litigation. Enron is threate=
ning to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger, and Enron's creditors are=
 sure to pile on at some point.=20
Even without swallowing the bigger Enron, Dynegy is a leading processor of =
natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipel=
ine in North America. Its power plants generate 19,000 megawatts of electri=
city, enough for a city of 8 million. In the commodity derivatives markets,=
 where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices, Dynegy is a top trade=
r in natural gas, power, coal, emission credits and weather derivatives. Bu=
t these volatile trading businesses, which contributed 80% of Enron's alleg=
ed earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere, ar=
e merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy, contributing only 20% of earnings.=
=20
And Watson may yet have a multibillion-dollar merger in his future. Big riv=
als such as American Electric Power, Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dyne=
gy in some markets, making them attractive partners. He expresses keen inte=
rest in doing more deals, having made nine acquisitions since 1995, which h=
as kept Dynegy's top line growing a hefty 45% a year. Last year its stock j=
umped 218%, the second-best performance in the S&P 500. Even on the day Wat=
son bailed out of buying Enron, he inked a $600 million purchase of another=
 outfit, BG Storage. He's a gambler whose winning streak might not have end=
ed.=20
Enron and Dynegy were born the same year--1985--but took very different pat=
hs. Ken Lay started out with $10 billion in revenues from the merger of two=
 energy companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Then he won fame and=
 accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheeler-d=
ealer, doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks: creating a highly liqui=
d, over-the-counter market for all kinds of contracts. In the process, he s=
lapped Enron's name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of=
 Dick Cheney and George W. Bush.=20
Chuck Watson started out with far less. Dynegy began life under the unpromi=
sing name of the U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a marketing arm jointly ow=
ned by six pipeline companies, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump. N=
or was Watson some headhunter's superstar: He began his career as a lowly t=
rainee at Conoco. Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues, Watson's aw-shucks=
 manner kept him out of the public eye; he frequently says he'd rather let =
his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself. Flashy, no, but competitiv=
e, hell yes: He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recove=
ring from an Achilles tendon injury recently, he borrowed an oversize golf =
shoe to fit it over his sore, swollen foot rather than miss combat in 18 ho=
les.=20
Always scrappy and still athletic at 51, Watson was born in Great Lakes, Il=
l., one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks=
. The family moved around a lot and Watson attended 22 schools in nine stat=
es. Sports let him fit in quickly. He was driving for a college basketball =
scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high sc=
hool senior in Ft. Smith, Ark. On graduating from Oklahoma State in 1972, h=
e took a job with Conoco in Ponca City, Okla. so he could stay close to his=
 college sweetheart, Kim, who now has been married to him for 28 years. The=
 summer job turned full-time, and in the next 12 years Watson worked his wa=
y up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director.=20
It was 1984, natural gas was on the verge of revolution, and Watson wanted =
to be in the vanguard. "A lot of people in this business were scared by der=
egulation," he recalls. "I was excited by the opportunities." Opportunity a=
rrived in the form of the slapped-together U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse.=
=20
Watson first turned down the job. It looked unworkable. The pipeline compan=
ies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their ow=
n pipelines; how would he push them aside? His suitors kept wooing him, off=
ering a sizable raise, and finally Watson relented, with one condition: "Do=
n't pay me a salary--give me 10% of the company." He got both, the equity i=
nitially taking the form of phantom stock--in effect, a long-term option.=
=20
On Watson's first day on the job, only 6 of the 60 employees borrowed from =
the parent firms showed up. He told the no-shows not to come back. Later th=
at year he bought out the 10% stakes from the pipelines for $100 each and t=
hen he got Akin Gump to sell, leaving Morgan as sole shareholder. His visio=
n was clear from day one. Hundreds of brokers were jumping in, many armed w=
ith just a phone and a Rolodex. Competing with them was a losing game. Supp=
liers and buyers would eventually get each other's phone numbers, and one d=
ay the fat middleman spreads that Watson's shop relied on would evaporate. =
Then what?=20
With the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes =
for gas storage, Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver i=
t when and where customers wanted, holding it for them when they didn't nee=
d it and serving it up when demand surged. This meant Watson would assume t=
he risk of holding gas that might tumble in price; but any trader could han=
dle that risk with some artful hedges.=20
The startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived, turning a sale a=
 week and celebrating each with a round of cigars. Watson nixed the cigars =
and started turning multiple sales a day. He worked his contacts and had st=
aff cold-calling corporate gas users to drum up business.=20
By 1989 Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for $16 million. The=
 buyers were three energy companies (British Gas, Nova and Chevron) and emp=
loyees. Morgan was happy with its tidy profit. Had it held on, its stake wo=
uld be worth $10 billion.=20
Meanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas tradin=
g. Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile s=
pot prices. Lay began writing long-term contracts to buy or sell gas at fix=
ed prices. Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline. Eventual=
ly the raw trading of these contracts--rather than delivering on them--beca=
me Enron's mainstay.=20
In the mid-1990s electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path. Watson wa=
nted in but needed currency. So in 1995 he bought Trident, a publicly held =
ethylene producer; the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the c=
apital markets. The following fall, Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell =
the oil giant's entire North American gas output, the first such exclusive =
marketing deal. It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along. The gas=
 producer receives market prices at its wells. Watson takes ownership, tran=
sports, stores and delivers the energy at a markup. He compares the approac=
h to that of grain trader Cargill.=20
Business was booming, but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing pl=
ants and electric power plants. The problem was in raising the cash. Dynegy=
 had a public currency, but 88% was now in the hands of employees and three=
 institutions. There wasn't enough of a float to attract institutional shar=
eholders. So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in 1997=
 with a blunt message: "We have a problem. It's in this room. Two of you ha=
ve to go. I don't care which." Then he walked out. Nova and British Gas exi=
ted. The company's float went to 60% overnight. The next year Watson change=
d Natural Gas Clearinghouse's name to Dynegy, excising an "r" to dodge a pr=
eexisting British claim. Then he used his stock to make his boldest push ye=
t into power. Illinova, an Illinois generating firm, was nearly insolvent. =
Watson bought it for a pittance.=20
Enron was having a field day with deregulation, too. Instead of buying elec=
tricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut, it began carv=
ing output into pieces, much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury =
strips. Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the=
 power it would need on a hot summer afternoon. An aluminum smelter would p=
ay half as much but suffer some interruptions.=20
As Enron's confidence grew, its trades got more exotic, involving derivativ=
es on pulp, metals, pollution and the weather. In late 1999 the firm shifte=
d much of its business to EnronOnline, basking in the dot-com craze. The si=
te soon was handling $3 billion in trades daily. Revenues in 2000 doubled t=
o $101 billion. Reported earnings before interest and taxes hit $2.3 billio=
n. At a January 2001 analyst meeting, company execs suggested Enron's price=
 of $80 a share was inadequate, notwithstanding that it was 46 times earnin=
gs. The shares should have been going for $126, said President Jeffrey Skil=
ling.=20
By then Enron and Dynegy had gone separate ways. Enron was selling assets, =
earning 80% of its profits from trading and 20% from energy. At Dynegy the =
ratios were reversed. In February Lay handed the top job to Skilling, chief=
 advocate of Enron's asset-lite strategy. Lay became elder statesman.=20
Skilling epitomized Enron's hubris. He had once said of a rival, "If Thomas=
 Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. he'd find noth=
ing has changed." Of Enron: "We're on the side of angels. People want open,=
 competitive markets .... It's the American way." To goose earnings, Skilli=
ng set up outside partnerships. They, in turn, issued Enron-backed bonds an=
d used the proceeds to buy power plants, fiber optics and other assets from=
 Enron. Then Enron plowed the cash into its trading business while the debt=
--and losses--moved off its books.=20
The questions started getting prickly when Enron's stock price fell in the =
spring. Its business of trading fiber-optic capacity, with revenues of more=
 than $300 million in 2000, lost $137 million in the first half of 2001 as =
sales plunged. In mid-August Skilling abruptly quit. Speculation was that s=
omething was seriously amiss. Then on Oct. 16 Enron set a $1 billion third-=
quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer A=
ndrew Fastow, plus a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity due to "a=
ccounting errors." Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding =
Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force i=
t to immediately repay $3.9 billion in debt, pushing it into bankruptcy.=20
On Oct. 25, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom was invited to lunch by Stan=
ley Horton, chief of Enron's pipeline group. Horton--without first telling =
Ken Lay of his plans--told Bergstrom that Enron was in deep trouble and tha=
t a merger with Dynegy was the best way out. But it had to happen fast.=20
Enron's desperate plea in hand, Bergstrom called Watson, who was outside an=
 operating room in St. Louis where his mother was having heart surgery. "I =
was intrigued and honored they had come to us," Watson recalls. He set one =
demand: Ken Lay had to call him personally. Lay called him the next day, an=
d on Saturday morning Watson and Lay chewed over a deal in Lay's kitchen. W=
atson offered a deal with no premium over Enron's depressed price. Lay acce=
pted and said he would step aside.=20
Dynegy was an obvious mate. The firms are right across the street from each=
 other, and many employees have worked at both. Their traders live in the s=
ame neighborhoods--the Young Turks in West University and the superstars in=
 River Oaks. They send their kids to ritzy St. John's School. "The press lo=
ves the rivalry between Enron and Dynegy, but on a lot of issues, we're on =
the same page," Bergstrom says.=20
For Dynegy, Enron's crunch was sweet revenge. Dynegy execs chafed at the th=
e dowdy image they were accorded despite fast growth and a soaring stock. L=
ay put Enron's name on Houston's new baseball stadium. Watson bragged about=
 his small p.r. staff. A media search yields 91,000 mentions of Enron in fi=
ve years--six times as many as for Dynegy.=20
For all their folksiness, Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for y=
ears. Off the record, they questioned Enron's assertions it held "balanced =
books" of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival=
 was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices.=20
Investment bankers came in to do the paperwork. Dynegy merger chief Hugh Ta=
rpley, an alum of Notre Dame, coined the de rigeur code names: Dynegy was t=
he heroic Rockne; Enron, fittingly, was the Gipper--the dying football play=
er. Watson, meanwhile, was hosting a week-long pro-am golf tournament for 3=
00 clients, one of his first forays into big-time promotion. Some events he=
 couldn't miss, like a round of golf with Tiger Woods. When guests asked wh=
ere he was, underlings made excuses. On the last day of the tournament, som=
eone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing busine=
ss shoes, a clue that he was headed for merger talks; he feigned forgetfuln=
ess.=20
Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty, meanwhile, was poring over Enron's fin=
ancials and feeling fine. "We got a lot of comfort that the core business w=
as operating well and capable of generating great cash flow," Doty recalls.=
 But ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, scrutinized the deal and aske=
d--why not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress =
sale? In the end Chevron put $1.5 billion into Dynegy, which used it to buy=
 100% of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Norther=
n Natural Gas pipeline. That, along with $1 billion more at the merger's cl=
ose, was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed.=20
Watson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday, Nov. 9, reserving the rig=
ht to call off the deal if Enron's liabilities rose, or profits fell, below=
 certain levels. His hole card: a clause stating Dynegy's $1.5 billion inve=
stment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was abor=
ted. "There was a lot we didn't know," he admits, "but we thought we'd adeq=
uately protected our shareholders." Dynegy's stock had a quick 28% run-up o=
n news of the bid.=20
If Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris, Watson should ge=
t a mention, too. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject $500 mi=
llion or more in equity capital into Enron. Watson, confident that Enron's =
hemorrhaging was over, brushed aside the offer.=20
The euphoria faded fast. On Nov. 19 Enron filed quarterly financials that h=
eld two bombshells. Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put =
Enron on the hook to repay $690 million to a partnership in just a week--so=
mething Enron had never warned Dynegy about. What's more, Enron had $1 bill=
ion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have.=20
Watson was stunned. Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks befo=
re, but none of this was disclosed (Enron has disputed this). Watson says t=
hat Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public a=
nd that only then did he know his deal was in trouble. What else had Enron =
failed to disclose? Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to $4 an=
d lower. On Nov. 28 three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status. =
That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal. Lay was cordial.=20
The niceties ended there. Dynegy issued a press release staking its claim t=
o Northern Natural Gas and accusing Enron of misrepresentation. Enron's chi=
ef financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, disputed that claim and said Dynegy =
saw the financials in advance, hinting Dynegy may owe Enron a $350 million =
breakup fee. Bunk, says Watson: "It's real cute for Jeff to say we got an a=
dvance copy when it was 110 pages we received just three hours in advance."=
=20
Even if Dynegy's biggest deal slipped through Watson's fingers there is a b=
ig world of opportunities in energy. In Europe, Dynegy has a growing presen=
ce and can play the same games it did in the U.S. as the energy industry th=
ere deregulates.=20
Back at home, Watson confronts months of legal wrangling and a long struggl=
e to reclaim legitimacy for the energy-trading business. The recent chaos i=
n California and the collapse of Enron will make further deregulation--and =
Dynegy's stock--a tough sale.=20

AFTERSHOCKS IN EUROPE Enron's collapse will hit many markets
By David Fairlamb in Paris

Enron Corp. may be based in Houston, but its spectacular collapse has had a=
lmost as big an impact in Europe as in the U.S. The energy trader's bankrup=
tcy has sent European banks, investors, electricity consumers, and champion=
s of Europewide energy deregulation reeling. And it's not just the energy m=
arkets that have been thrown into confusion. Enron was active in a number o=
f other European sectors, including metals and pulp and paper trading. It e=
ven owns a windmill manufacturer in Germany. ``This was a global company wh=
ose collapse will be felt right around the world,'' says Alessandro Profumo=
, CEO of UniCredito Italiano.=20
Profumo should know. Over the last year, the Milan bank loaned Enron an est=
imated $20 million. All told, European banks have admitted to lending Enron=
 and its subsidiaries more than $2 billion. In addition, analysts calculate=
, there is up to a billion dollars further exposure in the form of derivati=
ves and trading contracts.
The European bank reported to have the largest loan exposure to Enron--betw=
een $500 million and $800 million--is Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS executive=
s aren't talking, but their stock has taken a big hit. Other banks with siz=
able Enron loan exposure include Britain's Abbey National, France's Credit =
Lyonnais, and the Netherlands' ABN Amro (table). ``Enron isn't on the same =
scale as the Long-Term Credit Management collapse [in 1998],'' says Peter L=
uxton, global economic adviser to Standard & Poor's Corp., ``but it still h=
as a huge effect.''=20
In recent days, the scale of that financial damage has become clearer. The =
result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europe's eco=
nomy softens. Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to=
 40 basis points between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. Adding to the pressure is the =
fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized. ``We =
didn't know Enron, but lent on the back of its credit rating,'' says Profum=
o. As Enron sank, he adds, ``the first question I asked my colleagues was: =
`What is the value of a rating?''' Just a few months ago, the parent compan=
y had an AA rating from the main agencies. It's now rated as junk.=20
Banks aren't the only ones affected. Enron stock and bonds were widely held=
 by European mutual funds and insurers. The lucky ones offloaded their stak=
es as the extent of the company's problems started to come out. ``I knew I =
had to get out in August, when they canceled a meeting with me at the last =
minute--after I'd arrived in Houston,'' says a fund manager at a private Ge=
rman bank. He quickly dumped $50 million of Enron stock. Insurers that stil=
l held big blocks of Enron shares when it collapsed include Germany's Allia=
nz, France's AXA, and Holland's Aegon. Analysts estimate Aegon's exposure a=
t $200 million.=20
Meanwhile, Europe's spot and futures markets for electricity are in chaos. =
Enron was a big electricity supplier and trader in Europe, at the height of=
 its activity accounting for up to 20% of volume traded on the energy excha=
nges. Most energy and power companies already had wound down their exposure=
 to Enron by the time its collapse became imminent. But the scale of the co=
mpany's problems and the speed with which it collapsed have unsettled many =
traders. Not surprisingly, the price of energy futures is on the way up. Be=
cause Enron's aggressive pricing had helped bring down tariffs, businesses =
and domestic consumers will have to pay more for their energy this winter. =
Prices will probably rise fastest--up to 2.5%--in Britain's deregulated mar=
ket, say analysts. Enron was a particularly large player there, producing e=
lectricity and delivering it to 2.2 million retail consumers and thousands =
of companies.=20
Even more than in the U.S., Enron's woes are likely to increase resistance =
to energy deregulation. Although Germany and Britain have almost wholly lib=
eralized their markets, progress elsewhere, especially France, has been slo=
w. Opponents of reform will use the Enron debacle to hold up the process. `=
`They're going to make a real meal out of this in Paris,'' says a European =
Commission official in Brussels. This American bankruptcy is Europe's heada=
che.

Cover Story
THE FALL OF ENRON How ex-CEO Jeff Skilling's strategy grew so complex that =
even his boss couldn't get a handle on it
By Wendy Zellner and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas with Emily Thornto=
n, Peter Coy, Heather Timmons, Louis Lavelle, and David Henry in New York, =
and bureau reports

12/17/2001
BusinessWeek=20

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)=20

To former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, there were two kinds of people in =
the world: those who got it and those who didn't. ``It'' was Enron's comple=
x strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and risk-man=
agement business built essentially on assets owned by others. Vertically in=
tegrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp., whose balance sheet was rich with=
 oil reserves, gas stations, and other assets, were dinosaurs to a contempt=
uous Skilling. ``In the old days, people worked for the assets,'' Skilling =
mused in an interview last January. ``We've turned it around--what we've sa=
id is the assets work for the people.''=20
But who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now? As Enron Corp. struggles to salva=
ge something from the nation's largest bankruptcy case, filed on Dec. 2, it=
's clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble ``asset light'' =
market maker that Skilling proclaimed. And the financial maneuvering and of=
f-balance-sheet partnerships that he and ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew =
S. Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water compan=
ies from Enron's debt-heavy balance sheet helped spark the company's implos=
ion. ``Jeff's theory was assets were bad, intellectual capital was good,'' =
says one former senior executive. Employees readily embraced the rhetoric, =
the executive says, but they ``didn't understand how it was funded.''
Neither did many others. Bankers, stock analysts, auditors, and Enron's own=
 board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading gia=
nt. Enron's bankruptcy filings show $13.1 billion in debt for the parent co=
mpany and an additional $18.1 billion for affiliates. But that doesn't incl=
ude at least $20 billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet. Ken=
neth L. Lay, 59, who had nurtured Skilling, 48, as his successor, sparked t=
he first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct. 16 conference call with =
analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock $1.2 =
billion off shareholder equity. Lay, who had been out of day-to-day managem=
ent for years, was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worke=
d or why anyone shouldn't assume the worst--that they were set up to hide E=
nron's problems, inflate earnings, and personally benefit the executives wh=
o managed some of them.=20
That uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enron's best hope for a rescue: its de=
al to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival, Dynegy Inc. Now Enron=
 is frantically seeking a rock-solid banking partner to help maintain some =
shred of its once-mighty trading empire. Already, 4,000 Enron workers in Ho=
uston have lost their jobs. And hundreds of creditors, from banks to teleco=
ms to construction companies, are trying to recover part of the billions th=
ey're owed.=20
From the beginning, Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of=
 a traditional energy company. When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two=
 pipeline companies in 1985, he understood that deregulation of the busines=
s would offer vast new opportunities. To exploit them, he turned to Skillin=
g, then a McKinsey & Co. consultant. Skilling was the chief nuts-and-bolts-=
operator from 1997 until his departure last summer, and the architect of an=
 increasingly byzantine financial structure. After he abruptly quit in Augu=
st, citing personal reasons, and his right-hand financier Fastow was ousted=
 Oct. 24, there was no one left to explain it.=20
Much of the blame for Enron's collapse has focused on the partnerships, but=
 the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprise=
s. According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron, it was al=
ready on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments, including o=
verseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distri=
butor in Brazil. ``You make enough billion-dollar mistakes, and they add up=
,'' says one source close to Enron's top executives. In June, Standard & Po=
or's analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming internatio=
nal assets were of growing concern. But S&P, which like BusinessWeek is a u=
nit of The McGraw-Hill companies, ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings,=
 based on Enron's apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps.=
=20
Behind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy bu=
siness was thriving. It was still growing rapidly, but margins were inevita=
bly coming down as the market matured. ``Once that growth slowed, any weakn=
ess would start becoming more apparent,'' says Standard & Poor's Corp. dire=
ctor Todd A. Shipman. ``They were not the best at watching their cost.'' In=
deed, the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading busin=
ess apparently didn't apply to other parts of the company.=20
Skilling's answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enro=
n's innovative techniques into new arenas, everything from broadband to met=
als, steel, and even advertising time and space. Skilling knew he had to fi=
nd a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international probl=
ems without killing the company's critical investment-grade credit rating. =
Without a clever solution, trading partners would flee, or the cost of doin=
g deals would become insurmountable. ``HE'S HEARTBROKEN.'' No one ever disp=
uted that Skilling was clever. The Pittsburgh-born son of a sales manager f=
or an Illinois valve company, he took over as production director at a star=
tup Aurora (Ill.) TV station at age 13 when an older staffer quit and he wa=
s the only one who knew how to operate the equipment. Skilling landed a ful=
l-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study e=
ngineering, but quickly changed to business. After graduation, he went to w=
ork for a Houston bank. The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harv=
ard Business School. Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep =
strict risk controls on Enron's trading business. He once told BusinessWeek=
 that ``I've never not been successful in business or work, ever.'' Skillin=
g now declines to comment, but his brother Tom, a Chicago TV weatherman, sa=
ys of him: ``He's heartbroken over what's going on there.... We were not ra=
ised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion.''=20
Enron's ``intellectual capital'' was Skilling's pride and joy. He recruited=
 more than 250 newly minted MBAs each year from the nation's top business s=
chools. Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and mo=
del the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations. A f=
orced ranking system weeded out the poor performers. ``It was as competitiv=
e internally as it was externally,'' says one former executive.=20
It was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance =
wizard, Fastow, to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire. =
Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University, Fastow was recruited to Enron=
 in 1990 from Continental Bank, where he worked on leveraged buyouts. Artic=
ulate, handsome, and mature beyond his years, he became Enron's CFO at age =
36. In October, 1999, he earned CFO Magazine's CFO Excellence Award for Cap=
ital Structure Management. An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine: ``W=
e didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is=
 no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think =
in new ways.''=20
But Skilling's fondness for the buttoned-down Fastow was not widely shared.=
 Many colleagues considered him a prickly, even vindictive man, prone to at=
tacking those he didn't like in Enron's group performance reviews. Fastow, =
through his attorney, declined to comment for this story. When he formed an=
d took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October, th=
e conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues=
' distaste for him. Enron admits Fastow earned more than $30 million from t=
he partnerships. The Enron CFO wasn't any more popular on Wall Street, wher=
e investment bankers bristled at the finance group's ``we're smarter than y=
ou guys'' attitude. Indeed, that came back to haunt Enron when it needed ca=
pital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis. ``It's the sort of organiza=
tion about which people said, `Screw them. We don't really owe them anythin=
g,''' says one investment banker.=20
While LJM--and Fastow's direct personal involvement and enrichment--shocked=
 many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Sk=
illing and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to =
fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the =
balance sheet. Keeping the debt off Enron's books depended on a steady or r=
ising stock price and an investment- grade credit rating. ``They were put t=
ogether with good intentions to offset some risk,'' says S&P analyst Ron M.=
 Barone. ``It's conceivable that it got away from them.``=20
Did it ever. The off-balance-sheet structures grew increasingly complex and=
 risky, according to insiders and others who have studied the deals. Some, =
with names like Osprey, Whitewing, and Marlin, were revealed in Enron's fin=
ancial filings and even rated by the big credit-rating agencies. But almost=
 no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers=
 might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder =
equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come=
 due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron.=
 Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essenti=
ally dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell bel=
ow a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--on=
ce unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be cov=
ered by Enron. At the same time, the value of the assets in many of these p=
artnerships was dropping, making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt=
. HIGH HOPES. Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets=
 after becoming chief operating officer in 1997, but the efforts were arduo=
us and time-consuming. Even as tech stocks melted down, Skilling was determ=
ined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the result=
ing price-to-earnings multiple of almost 60 that they helped create for Enr=
on's stock. At its peak in August, 2000, about a third of the stock's $90 p=
rice was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading, exec=
utives estimate.=20
That rapidly rising stock price--up 55% in '99 and 87% in 2000--gave Skilli=
ng and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their off-balance-sh=
eet deals. They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their exp=
ansion efforts. ``It was like crack,'' says a company insider. Trouble is, =
Enron's stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this =
year. By April, its price had fallen to about 55. And its far-flung operati=
onal troubles were taking their own toll. In its much-hyped broadband busin=
ess, for instance, a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to f=
ind creditworthy counterparties for trading. And after spending some $1.2 b=
illion to build and operate a fiber-optic network, Enron found itself with =
an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating. Even last year, company exe=
cutives could see the need to cut back an operation that had 1,700 employee=
s and a cash burn rate of $700 million a year. ``SOMETHING TO PROVE.'' And =
the international problems weren't going away. Enron's 65% stake in the $3 =
billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest=
 customer, which refused to pay for electricity. Some Indian politicians ha=
ve despised the deal for years, claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enro=
n executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power.=20
Enron's ill-fated 1998 investment in the water-services business was anothe=
r drag on earnings. Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a `=
`consolation prize'' for Rebecca P. Mark, the hard-charging Enron executive=
 who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world.=
 With Skilling having won out as Lay's clear heir apparent, top executives =
wanted to move her out of the way, say former insiders. A narrowly split bo=
ard approved the Wessex deal, which formed the core of Azurix Corp., to be =
run by Mark. But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the=
 rates the utility could charge. Meanwhile, Mark piled on more high-priced =
water assets. ``Once [Skilling] put her there, he let her go wild,'' says a=
 former executive. ``And she's going to go wild because she has something t=
o prove.'' Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into=
 political obstacles. She declined to comment for this story.=20
But if Azurix was a prime example of Enron's sketchy investment strategy, i=
t also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with fin=
ancial alchemy. To set up the company, Enron formed a partnership called th=
e Atlantic Water Trust, in which it held a 50% stake. That kept Wessex off =
Enron's balance sheet. Enron's partner in the joint venture was Marlin Wate=
r Trust, which consisted of institutional investors. To help attract them, =
Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary. But if =
Enron's credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below =
a certain point, Enron could be on the hook for the partnership's $915 mill=
ion in debt.=20
The end for Enron came when its murky finances and less-than-forthright dis=
closures spooked investors and Dynegy. The clincher came when Dynegy's bank=
ers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enron's about-t=
o-be-released 10Q--only to discover two pages of damning new numbers when t=
he quarterly statement was made publicly available. Debt coming due in the =
fourth quarter had leapt from under $1 billion to $2.8 billion. Even worse,=
 cash on hand--to which Dynegy had recently contributed $1.5 billion--shrun=
k from $3 billion to $1.2 billion. Dynegy ``had a two-hour meeting with the=
 new treasurer of Enron, who had been in that seat for two weeks,'' said a =
source close to the deal. ``He had no clue where the numbers came from.'' R=
ESPECT FOR ASSETS. Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling em=
ployees. ``Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the stree=
t, they would scratch out his eyes,'' says a former executive. One of Fasto=
w's lawyers, David B. Gerger, says his client has been the subject of death=
 threats and anti-Semitic tirades in Internet chat rooms. ``Naturally peopl=
e look for scapegoats, but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr. Fastow,'' say=
s Gerger.=20
He confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation:=
 David Boies's firm, which represented the Justice Dept. in its suit agains=
t Microsoft Corp. On Dec. 5, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach filed a s=
uit against Fastow, Skilling, and 27 other Enron executives, saying they il=
legally made more than $1 billion off stock sales before Enron tanked. And =
a source at the Securities & Exchange Commission says four U.S. Attorney Of=
fices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and =
its officers.=20
Would the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron, even without Skilling's and=
 Fastow's fancy financing? Credit analysts still argue that the debt would =
have been manageable, absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enron's=
 trading business and access to the capital markets. But even they have a n=
ew respect for old-fashioned, high-quality assets. ``When things get really=
 tough, hard assets are the kind you can depend upon,'' says S&P's Shipman.=
 That's something Enron's whiz-kid financiers failed to appreciate.

ENRON: LET US COUNT THE CULPRITS

12/17/2001
BusinessWeek=20

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)=20

Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy is a disaster of epic proportions by any measure--=
the height from which it fell, the speed with which it has unraveled, and t=
he pain it has inflicted on investors, employees, and creditors. Virtually =
all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial melt=
down failed. Unless remedied, this could undermine public trust, the capita=
l markets, and the nation's entire equity culture. Even now, no one really =
knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role=
 ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of off-balan=
ce-sheet operations. A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transpar=
ency prevented any realistic assessment of the company's financial risk. No=
thing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to p=
olice accounting standards. Wall Street, mutual funds, and the business pre=
ss would also do well to rethink why each, in its own way, celebrated what =
is now revealed to be an arrogant, duplicitous company managed in a dangero=
us manner (page 30).=20
What is increasingly clear is that Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consul=
tant and Harvard Business School grad, tried to craft Enron as a new kind o=
f virtual trading giant, operating outside the scrutiny of investors and re=
gulators. Enron's numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy, tucked aw=
ay off the balance sheet. They were used to shift debt and assets off the b=
ooks while inflating earnings. The chief financial officer ran and partly o=
wned two partnerships, a clear conflict of interest. Enron leveraged itself=
 without a reality check by any outsider. ASLEEP. Hardly anyone inside the =
company was urging caution, certainly not chairman Ken Lay. The independent=
 auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep. Given Enr=
on's arcane financial engineering, the committee probably relied on Arthur =
Andersen, the auditor, for information. But Andersen didn't blow any whistl=
es. No surprise there. It made more money selling consulting services to En=
ron last year than it did auditing the company. Criticizing Enron's books m=
ight have jeopardized consulting work. Similar conflicts of interest stoppe=
d Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron. Even as Enron slid t=
oward bankruptcy, ``buy'' recommendations were being issued by analysts who=
se firms were doing investment-banking business with the company, or were h=
oping to.
Did anyone really know what was going on inside Enron? The rating agencies,=
 Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, presumably had better acce=
ss than average investors, but neither downgraded Enron's credit rating to =
below investment grade until the bitter end. The rating agencies argue that=
 had they downgraded Enron sooner, they would have simply pushed the compan=
y into bankruptcy earlier. Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have on=
e basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron=
's complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so.=
=20
The business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Sk=
illing's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anythin=
g and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome o=
f a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much mo=
re aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance she=
et maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the mo=
re tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not =
only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of th=
eir retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error=
, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company preve=
nted them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only =
watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particu=
larly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk. Enron =
broke that rule, as have other companies.=20
Enron's tale is a clarifying event. It reveals key weaknesses in the financ=
ial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st cen=
tury. If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest i=
n stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth, the market must =
be able to correctly value companies. This requires making financial data r=
eadily available and easily comprehensible.=20
To restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounti=
ng disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management=
, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest wi=
thin auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV =
who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the hone=
st watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they wi=
ll wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear t=
hat current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed =
Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure.=20
Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice=
 in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are =
in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversificati=
on puts too many people at risk.=20
In the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that fai=
led in its primary business mission: to manage risk. Had the Federal Reserv=
e and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in =
recent months, Enron's collapse could have posed a deep threat to the finan=
cial markets. It's past time to fix the system.

Digging Into the Deal That Broke Enron; Behind the web of mysterious partne=

Enron corp. used to talk about becoming the world's biggest company. Instea=
d, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy l=
ast week. The company, which used complexity to its advantage on the way up=
, became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down. A NEWSWEEK=
 examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was =
an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated En=
ron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its =
books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that to=
uched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy.=20
Enron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been =
jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downto=
wn Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price =
and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got =
to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site h=
ealth club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing =
in Enron stock.
But when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fi=
re people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her=
 entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to ca=
ll their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next da=
y. Very classy. "I was crying, a lot of people were crying," says Peters, 5=
1. "It reminded me of a mass funeral."=20
The company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash i=
n preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers=
 and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until =
a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying =
Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., b=
ut the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in Ne=
w York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to li=
ne up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the =
place operating. Normally, you make DIP arrangements before you file.=20
It would be lots of fun to give you Washington's take on all this, Enron be=
ing famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party. But =
we'll leave that for another day, because the juicy stuff probably won't sh=
ow up until the Democrats get in gear. Hearings in the Republican-controlle=
d House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analy=
sts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's polit=
ical relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron'=
s final days.=20
Although some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen,=
 Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) wi=
ll have to fork over big bucks. Andersen's big problem stems from a company=
 called JEDI--as in "Star Wars"--that Enron now says should have been on it=
s books since 1997. Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years=
. The other deal, involving a company called Raptor, caused the net-worth d=
isappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin.=20
JEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments. It was a partnership =
between Enron and the California state-employees' pension fund, known as Ca=
l-pers. The Force was with Enron, which invested the money--$250 million ea=
ch from itself and Calpers--in power plants, energy stocks and such, making=
 more than 20 percent a year. Pretty neat. In late 1997, Calpers was willin=
g to invest $500 million in a new partnership, JEDI 2. But it wanted to fir=
st cash in its JEDI 1 chips, worth $383 million. Instead of just liquidatin=
g JEDI, Enron got cute. (I'm not sure why. Enron declined to comment.) It w=
ent looking for an outsider to fork over $383 million and take Calpers's pl=
ace. Enter something called Chewco Investments--as in Chewbacca of "Star Wa=
rs" fame. Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed =
outsiders. (Who they are and how much they made is a mystery, because Chewc=
o is a private entity.) Chewco's investors didn't have a spare $383 million=
. So Enron lent Chewco $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan that=
 Chewco took out elsewhere. Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake a=
nd essentially all of Chewco's. That being the case, it's a mystery why And=
ersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books. Accounting experts who have looked=
 at this transaction, which Enron disclosed last month, just shake their he=
ads. Andersen has refused to comment, saying it's too early to reach conclu=
sions. Enron has restated its earnings dating back to 1997 because it says =
JEDI should have been on its books since then. Guess what? The restated pro=
fits are far lower than the original ones.=20
Now, to the deals that sank Enron. As in JEDI, Enron won't comment. These t=
ransactions involve four companies called Raptor. It looks like the Raptors=
 were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks=
 it owned without actually selling them. The major holdings were Rhythms Ne=
t Connections, a now bankrupt start-up telecom company, and NewPower Holdin=
gs, which competes with established power companies for customers. At their=
 height, Enron's stake in these companies totaled about $2 billion. Friday'=
s value: about $40 million. Enron won't say why it didn't just sell the sto=
ck and take its profits. The most logical explanation is tax avoidance.=20
Now, the key to Enron's undoing. The company committed to put $1.2 billion =
of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy. It didn't p=
romise a fixed number of shares--it promised $1.2 billion worth, regardless=
 of the share price. A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about h=
edging risks. In return for that commitment, the Raptors gave Enron $1.2 bi=
llion of promissory notes. Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset.=
 When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes, its net worth =
rises. Hence, Enron marked up its net worth by $1.2 billion.=20
But as the stock prices of Rhythms, NewPower and Enron all sank, Enron face=
d having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares. So Enron paid $35 mil=
lion to the Raptors' outside investors--yet another mysterious partnership-=
-and liquidated the Raptors. That eliminated the notes, which eliminated th=
e aforementioned $1.2 billion from Enron's net worth. That set off the now =
famous October run on Enron's credit, which ultimately led to bankruptcy. N=
ow, far too late, Enron says it shouldn't have counted the notes as assets.=
=20
The bottom line: numbers matter. So does truth. Enron was too clever by hal=
f. And that's a good way to end up looking stupid.=20
