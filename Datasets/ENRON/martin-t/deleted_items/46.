Enron Board Learned Of Executive's Concerns In Oct -Atty
By Jason Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of directors didn't l=
earn until October that an Enron executive had serious concerns that accoun=
ting improprieties could bring down the company, according to an attorney f=
or the board, although word of those concerns had spread throughout the com=
pany by early September.
The executive, Sherron Watkins, raised her concerns with Chairman and Chief=
 Executive Ken Lay in August. But they weren't shared with board members be=
sides Lay until it was too late to do anything, said attorney Neil Egglesto=
n, who represents Enron's board in federal investigations of the company.=
=20
"The first they remember hearing of this issue is in early October in conne=
ction with the Vinson & Elkins review," Eggleston said.=20
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's outside law firm, conducted a review of Watkins' c=
oncerns at Lay's request. The firm submitted its findings in a report dated=
 Oct. 15, concluding that the company's handling of its off-balance-sheet p=
artnerships was proper but could be portrayed in a way that could be damagi=
ng to Enron.=20
Enron's board is named in a number of civil and class action lawsuits assoc=
iated with the company's collapse. The audit committee had reviewed some of=
 the off-balance sheet partnerships now at the center of federal investigat=
ions, and the full board voted twice to suspend Enron's code of ethics to a=
llow former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships even =
as he served as an officer for Enron.=20
Robert Jaedicke, the chairman of the board's audit committee, became aware =
of Watkins' concerns a few days before the committee met on Oct. 8, Egglest=
on said. Vinson & Elkins advised others on the committee at the meeting, an=
d the rest of the board was informed a couple of days before the firm relea=
sed its report.=20
The text of the Vinson & Elkins report supports that chain of events. Rober=
t Bennett, an attorney representing Enron in federal investigations of the =
company, wasn't sure when management first notified the board, but deferred=
 to Eggleston's account.=20

Board Committee Established Later=20

On Oct. 31, after news of losses related to transactions with partnerships =
run by Enron executives had set off the energy company's spiral into bankru=
ptcy court, Enron established a special board committee to look into the tr=
ansactions. William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, was=
 named to head the committee.=20
Watkins' concerns about accounting practices related to the off-balance she=
et partnerships were already known in August by the company's general couns=
el, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen and the company's top management.=20
Watkins detailed her concerns in a letter to Lay on Aug. 15. She met with L=
ay on Aug. 22 to discuss the letter, in which she specifically cautioned La=
y against using Vinson & Elkins to look into the matter "due to conflict."=
=20
By September, lower-level employees at the company were also aware.=20
"I heard in September, maybe the first week in September, for the first tim=
e that someone accused Enron of shady practices," said Inderpal Singh, a ma=
nager of finance who works for Enron global markets in the finance and stru=
cturing department. "Everybody in my division started talking about it, and=
 we were worried because we all thought everything was OK at Enron."=20
Philip Hilder, Watkins attorney, said his client tried in September and Oct=
ober to contact other people in Enron, including the board of directors, to=
 warn them about accounting improprieties, because she wasn't satisfied wit=
h the steps Lay was taking to ensure Enron's financial health.=20
"Yes, she did write additional letters to others at Enron about her concern=
s after she met with Mr. Lay," Hilder said in an interview Sunday.=20
Eggleston said Monday that board members don't recall having received a pho=
ne call, fax or email from Watkins.=20
"But then again, if the board received a call from Sherron Watkins, they wo=
uldn't necessarily know who she is," Eggleston added.=20

Other Letters=20

Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which=
 released Watkins' Aug. 15 letter last week, said late Tuesday that the com=
mittee is aware of additional written warnings sent by Watkins to others at=
 the company following her contacts with Lay.=20
"I can't say specifically who she sent them to at Enron, but we're in the p=
rocess of reviewing them and at some point we intend to discuss them with h=
er," Johnson said.=20
One Enron executive said Watkins appeared to be on a "mission," warning "ev=
eryone she came in contact with" about the partnerships and questionable ac=
counting practices she believed would ruin the company.=20
One of the letters Watkins wrote was sent to Enron Chief Financial Officer =
Jeff McMahon on Oct. 16, the day Enron released third-quarter earnings that=
 showed a $618 million loss due in part to transactions with off-balance sh=
eet partnerships run by the company's executives, Hilder said.=20
Watkins, 42, who currently earns $165,000 a year as a vice president of com=
munications at Enron, wrote that her "worst nightmare" had come true, refer=
ring to the scenario she had described in her much-publicized August letter=
 to Lay, Hilder said.=20
Watkins, who has done work for four off-balance sheet partnerships includin=
g JEDI, Cash, Cactus I and Caribou, was upset that Enron officers made only=
 scant reference to the partnerships in the earnings announcement and faile=
d to explain adequately the reasons behind the writeoffs, Hilder said.=20
McMahon didn't return a call seeking comment.=20
Richard Watkins, Sherron Watkins' husband, said his wife called him Oct. 16=
 after the earnings report to express her concerns.=20
"She was disappointed and frustrated no one listened to her," Richard Watki=
ns said in an interview.=20
Sherron Watkins met with Lay again at the end of October, at which time Lay=
 told her a special board committee would be formed to look into her allega=
tions, Hilder said.=20
Bennett confirmed the meeting.=20
According to Richard Watkins, when Enron said in early November that it was=
 restating four years' worth of earnings, his wife told him: "I'm going to =
have to look for another job. This company is going to go bankrupt."=20

Enron's Board Ignored Signs of Losses, Dorgan Says
2002-01-23 14:46 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s board failed to act w=
hen it knew partnerships that were used to hide debt and unprofitable inves=
tments were leading to losses that shareholders would eventually absorb, Se=
nator Byron Dorgan said.
     ``It seems to me they had some warnings, and probably even considered =
those warnings and must have discarded them,'' Dorgan, who is leading an in=
vestigation into Enron's bankruptcy, said in an interview. ``I'm very surpr=
ised.''
     The Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, led by Dorgan, a North Dakota Democ=
rat, has received transcripts and minutes of meetings that show Enron's boa=
rd discussed the roles played by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fast=
ow and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling in setting and running Enro=
n's partnerships.
     Those partnerships had losses that forced Enron to restate $586 millio=
n in income since 1996. That led lenders to cut off credit, impairing the c=
ompany's main business, trading electricity and natural gas. Shareholders l=
ost $26 billion in market value and $850 million in pension funds vanished.
     Dorgan, who will chair a hearing Feb. 4, said his panel received 41 bo=
xes of documents from Enron. Chairman Kenneth Lay has agreed to testify. Fa=
stow, who Enron ousted Oct. 24, and Skilling, who resigned Aug. 14, haven't=
 responded to requests they testify, Dorgan said.

Information Needed

     The committee is still seeking some documents Enron hasn't supplied, i=
ncluding details about who invested in the partnerships and evidence of the=
 board's approval, Dorgan said. He said he didn't have any independent info=
rmation about document shredding at Enron that may have happened as recentl=
y as two weeks ago.
     ``One would expect what has happened here probably includes some viola=
tion of law,'' Dorgan said. ``At this point we don't know enough.''
     Dorgan plans several hearings that will investigate possible conflicts=
 of interest in the accounting and investment banking industries that were =
highlighted by the Enron bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. Nine othe=
r House and Senate committees are examining other aspects of Enron's failur=
e.
     Auditor Arthur Andersen LLP's acceptance of Enron's accounting has ren=
ewed interest in passing laws preventing auditors from consulting and accou=
nting for the same client.
     ``It's likely we'll want to evaluate some legislative changes,'' said =
Dorgan, who served as North Dakota's tax commissioner from 1966 until 1980.

Pensions, Analysts and Partnerships

     Dorgan said he saw good chances for legislation to restrict 401(k) ret=
irement plans from being heavily invested in one stock. He said rules shoul=
d also be changed to remove conflicts of interest in large investment banki=
ng firms that may have caused stock analysts to rate Enron a ``buy'' or bet=
ter until shares collapsed.
       The Senate Commerce Committee asked Enron in a Jan. 8 letter for a f=
ull accounting of all affiliated partnerships the company formed. The partn=
erships, set up throughout the 1990s, hid
debt and investment losses and created buyers for power plants. Some of the=
m were capitalized only with Enron stock, according to a letter an Enron ex=
ecutive sent Lay in August.
     ``The construct of those partnerships played a significant role in the=
 destruction of this company,'' Dorgan said.
     The role of the board of directors in Enron's downfall has received ne=
w scrutiny since the disclosure last week that an internal probe by the law=
 firm of Vinson & Elkins last October said the board's audit committee revi=
ewed some partnerships.
     The directors approved the partnerships and they suspended the company=
 ethics code to allow partnerships to be created, the report says. The law =
firm said it didn't uncover any wrongdoing.

Conflict of Interest

     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett repeated earlier claims that many of the d=
etails of the questionable transactions weren't shared with the board.
     ``What will become clear if the good senator is prepared to wait for t=
he completion of his investigation is that a tremendous amount of informati=
on was not known by members of the board,'' Bennett said. ``Why are we havi=
ng hearings if conclusions have already been reached?''
     Citing transcripts, Dorgan disagreed.  ``They clearly talked about the=
 conflict of interest,'' he said. ``They actually had some discussions abou=
t what Fastow was doing and what Skilling was
learning.''
     Under one arrangement, controlled by Fastow, Enron avoided $550 millio=
n in losses through a partnership called Raptor, according to the letter se=
nt to Lay. Raptor agreed to pay Enron if the energy trader's investment por=
tfolio of Internet and energy shares fell. If those shares rose, Raptor boo=
ked the gain and paid the income to Enron. Raptor's only asset was the prom=
ise that Enron would issue enough shares to pay back the partnership for wh=
atever it had paid to cover stock losses.

`What Was Their Risk'

     In another case, Enron used stock to set up a partnership that sold $1=
.2 billion in bonds and paid Enron $800 million for 14 power plants. Enron =
booked the money as net income.
     ``We need to get information on who invested in the partnerships, what=
 are the names, what were their investment stakes, what were their returns,=
 what was their risk,'' Dorgan
said.
     Besides Lay and Skilling, directors named in lawsuits include Wendy Le=
e Gramm, a professor at George Mason University and wife of U.S. Senator Ph=
il Gramm; Norman P. Blake Jr., the chief executive officer of Comdisco Inc.=
; Robert A. Belfer, former chairman of Belco Oil & Gas Corp.; Ronnie Chan C=
hichung, chairman of Grand Hotel Holdings Ltd.; John H. Duncan, former pres=
ident of Gulf & Western Industries Inc.; Charles Lemaistre, former chancell=
or of the University of Texas system; and Robert Jaedicke, a Stanford Unive=
rsity professor Emeritus.
     Those directors allowed Fastow to ``profit handsomely'' from managing =
two partnerships known as LJM, receiving his salary and $30 million in comm=
issions for overseeing them, Dorgan said.
     According to Dorgan, the transcripts show directors didn't know how mu=
ch Fastow was being paid. ``It looks like they were surprised at the kind o=
f compensation he received when they
discovered later,'' he said.
     The board also oversaw Enron's transformation from a pipeline operator=
 into a trader dependent on income from derivatives transactions that were =
hard for investors to understand, Dorgan said.
     ``Part of the fallout of this could very well be an interest in some c=
oncern about regulation of hedge funds and derivatives,'' Dorgan said.

Enron Board Protected From Lawsuits, Experts Say
2002-01-23 14:50 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s directors enjoy legal p=
rotection that may make it difficult for investors to sue them successfully=
, legal experts say.
     The directors are named as defendants in 40 investor lawsuits claiming=
 the company concealed losses that led to Enron's bankruptcy. The company a=
nd its officials also are targets of government criminal and civil investig=
ations.
     ``All it takes is a pencil to sue a board of directors,'' said Larry H=
amermesh, a corporate law professor at Widener University.  ``Making a case=
 against directors is a lot harder.''
     Federal and state laws hold boards responsible for only the most serio=
us fraud and misrepresentation, experts say. They are designed to shield di=
rectors from legal liability to make service on the board more attractive.
     U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan said transcripts of Enron board meetings sho=
w that directors discussed conflicts of interest and
the roles of senior executives in partnerships used to shield the company's=
 debt. The transcripts show they ignored warnings about
the company's problems, said Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat leading a Sena=
te Commerce Committee investigation.
     W. Neil Eggleston, attorney for Enron's outside directors, declined to=
 comment on the suits against his clients. He said none
has been asked to testify before any congressional committee investigating =
Enron. Robert S. Bennett, who represents board members who also are corpora=
te officers, wasn't available for comment, his office said.
     Eggleston said a ``motion to dismiss'' for lack of grounds to sue is t=
ypically the first step a lawyer for directors will take when a corporate b=
oard is sued. ``In this suit, it is hard to say what will happen,'' he said=
.

Liability Insurance

     The Enron board and officers have liability insurance with the St. Pau=
l Companies and the Associated Electric & Gas Insurance
Services Ltd. ``We can't discuss the terms of the policy,'' said Pat Hirigo=
yen, a spokesman for St. Paul. St. Paul said its policies provide Enron off=
icers and directors with $19 million in coverage.
     The AEGIS policy provides $35 million in coverage for legal fees and r=
elated expenses, according to the policy filed in the
bankruptcy documents.
     Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, said the company provides insuranc=
e for the legal costs of directors and executives. He
declined to comment on liability coverage.
     Elson said most policies don't pay off if the directors are successful=
ly sued for fraud but may cover reckless behavior.
     Enron, once the largest energy trader and the nation's seventh largest=
 company, filed for bankruptcy in December after reporting its earnings ove=
r five years were inflated by $586 million. The company admitted it hid muc=
h of its debt in off-the- books partnerships.

`Poor Judgment'

     ``Just having poor judgment or being sloppy isn't enough'' for a succe=
ssful suit against the directors, said Charles Elson,
director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delawa=
re. ``If it was easy to sue directors, it would be hard
to get anyone to sit on a board.''
     Elson said shareholders, to be successful, must show directors were ``=
reckless or fraudulent.''
     Still, the board approved the partnerships and, according to a report =
by Enron's counsel, Vinson & Elkins, suspended the
company ethics code to let former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow cre=
ate partnerships between himself and Enron.
     ``The board determined that Mr. Fastow's participation in the partners=
hips would not adversely affect the interest of Enron,''
the company said in a securities filing in November.
     Seven of 12 outside board members received consulting fees or business=
 deals from Enron, and four board members sold stock while Enron was issuin=
g inaccurate financial statements.

Material Disclosure

     ``This may make a securities action a little easier,'' Elson said. ``F=
or it raises the question of whether the board failed to
make a material disclosure it should have.''
     Two corporate officers, Kenneth Lay, the chairman and founder of Enron=
, and Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive officer before he
resigned in August, also sat on the board.
     Besides Lay, Enron directors named in some of the lawsuits include Wen=
dy Lee Gramm, a professor at George Mason University and wife of U.S. Senat=
or Phil Gramm; Norman P. Blake Jr., the chief executive officer of Comdisco=
 Inc.; Enron Vice Chairman Mark A. Frevert; Robert A. Belfer, former chairm=
an of Belco Oil & Gas Corp.; Ronnie Chan Chichung, chairman of Grand Hotel =
Holdings Ltd.; John H. Duncan, former president of Gulf & Western Industrie=
s Inc.; Charles LeMaistre, former chancellor of the University of Texas sys=
tem; and Robert Jaedicke, a former Stanford University accounting professor=
.

Former Directors

     In addition to Skilling, former directors named in the suits include R=
ichard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer; Enron
General Counsel James Vinson Derrick Jr.; former Enron Vice Chairman J. Cli=
fford Baxter; Joe H. Foy, retired senior partner at
the Bracewell & Patterson law firm; Ken L. Harrison, former chairman of Enr=
on's Portland General Electric Co. unit; and former
Enron Chairman Joseph W. Sutton.
     Federal securities laws say directors may be liable if they fail to re=
sponsibly disclose all information, their behavior widely departs from acce=
pted standards or as ``controlling individuals'' of the corporation.
     Dorgan said in an interview that the transcripts of board meetings tha=
t his committee has obtained demonstrates that
directors ``had some warnings, and probably even considered those warnings =
and must have discarded them.''
     Most state laws hold board members responsible for overseeing a compan=
y and making timely disclosures of information. They also have to offer acc=
urate information in their recommendations to stockholders.
     Hamermesh said that board members would be liable if they intentionall=
y failed to disclose information to stockholders on an
issue up for a vote. ``This doesn't seem to be the case with Enron,'' he sa=
id.

Self-Dealing

     Evidence of self-dealing by directors, taking official actions that be=
nefit them personally, would also be grounds for a successful suit. Board m=
embers also may be legally accountable if they demonstrated bad faith, expe=
rts said.
     Both those tests impose standards of proof that are hard to meet, Elso=
n said. ``It can't just be a bad decision or bad
behavior,'' he said. ``It has to be really, really bad.''
     Still, he said, evidence of conflicts of interest and insider trading =
would aid any claim of self-dealing.
     Eli Gottesdiner, a lawyer for Enron employees who lost their retiremen=
t savings in the company 401(k) stock plan, said board
members would be listed as defendants in his clients' suit.
     ``We believe that there is evidence suggesting that the board aided an=
d abetted others in breaching their fiduciary responsibility,'' he said.

An Easier Case

     Elson said the directors may be able to withstand attack by saying man=
agement misinformed the board. ``Now if management was telling them the sky=
 was red, and they accepted that, it wouldn't work,'' he said.
     That principle may make it easier to win a case against corporate offi=
cers who serve on the board. They ``have much deeper
liability than the outside members because of their information advantage,'=
' Elson said.
     Enron board members have refused to comment on the company's collapse =
and didn't return calls regarding their liability.
     Jaedicke, chairman of the board's audit committee, declined to comment=
 on legal issues. ``I'm sorry. I can't discuss anything,'' he said from his=
 home in Bozeman, Montana.

You can smell the fish sticks from lunch in Sherron Watkins' 60- year-old h=
ouse near downtown Houston, see the framed pictures of the family vacation =
and the baby in bunny ears and even one of her country-crooning second cous=
in, Lyle Lovett. Things have been so hectic, Watkins apologizes, that the C=
hristmas ornaments haven't been put away yet. The daughter of two educators=
, Watkins grew up in nearby Tomball, where she worked the cash register at =
the family grocery store and began saving her money. By 1982, she'd picked =
up two accounting degrees in Austin and quickly found a job with Arthur And=
ersen. She eventually landed a job with Enron, Houston's red-hot energy tra=
ding firm, rising in eight years to vice president for corporate developmen=
t. Her quick ascent surprised no one, says her husband Rick: "She always ha=
d a flair for numbers."=20
That flair led Watkins last summer to conclude there was something rotten a=
t Enron. The numbers didn't add up. A pair of letters that she wrote to Cha=
irman Kenneth Lay exposed top officials--perhaps including Lay himself--who=
 for months had been trying to hide a mountain of debt, and started a chain=
 reaction of events that brought down the company. Watkins' letters, along =
with thousands of other documents, are now in the hands of congressional an=
d criminal investigators who are probing how Enron, its pet-rock auditors a=
t Andersen and a host of other supporting actors allowed the country's seve=
nth largest company to suddenly go bankrupt in December. "I am incredibly n=
ervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Watkins wrot=
e of Enron's financial health. "I have heard one manager-level employee fro=
m the principal investments group say, 'I know it would be devastating to a=
ll of us, but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'"
Maybe you can only glimpse the soul of a company when it breaks open right =
before your eyes. But we know now, thanks to Watkins, that Enron hid billio=
ns of dollars in debts and operating losses inside private partnerships and=
 dizzyingly complex accounting schemes that were intended to pump up the bu=
zz about the company and support its inflated stock price. We also learned =
last week that executives at Andersen, the accounting giant that enabled En=
ron's every move, fretted about the arrangement but saw the chance to doubl=
e their fees if they just kept their heads down. And now that the party's o=
ver and the damage control is in full swing from Houston to Chicago to Wash=
ington, just about everyone who helped create this mess is busy pointing fi=
ngers, scapegoating the other guys, firing the lower- downs and diming out =
the higher-ups. Last week what was once envisioned as a new kind of company=
 resembled little more than a circular firing squad of executives, accounta=
nts, consultants and lawyers, all fighting to stay in business or, at least=
, out of jail.=20
As these characters tell their self-serving stories, the fall of Enron is t=
he most revealing sort of failure. It is a failure of the old-fashioned ide=
a that auditors, directors and stock analysts are supposed to put the inter=
ests of shareholders above their own thirst for fees. It is a failure of go=
vernment: having greased nearly every campaigner's palm in Washington, Enro=
n worked overtime to keep the regulators from looking too closely at a bala=
nce sheet gone bad. And it is a failure of character, especially inside Enr=
on, where managers who knew something was badly wrong did not say anything =
publicly until the subpoenas began to arrive.=20
About the only thing that didn't fail was Sherron Watkins' flair for number=
s. In the sad tale of Enron's collapse, Watkins is the closest thing to a h=
ero in sight. When she goes out for coffee, strangers stop to give her "att=
agirls" and ask for her autograph. She still goes to work each day at the c=
ompany's headquarters in downtown Houston, where the tilted logo out front =
has yielded Enron a new nickname: the Crooked E.=20
Normally when public companies flame out in scandal, top executives can be =
seen running from headquarters mumbling that they are shocked to learn that=
 there was gambling going on in the casino. But there's not much of that he=
re. Enron and Andersen officials hardly deny the dubious deals, the 881 off=
shore tax havens or the stupid accounting tricks. That's partly because nob=
ody can be sure that those dodges were inherently illegal. Many companies m=
aintain similar arrangements, usually intended to avoid taxes--a benefit of=
 interest to Enron too. Enron avoided paying federal income tax for four ou=
t of the last five years and instead received millions of dollars in federa=
l-tax refunds.=20
For now, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and federal agents probing=
 Enron's fall are skipping over the accounting schemes and other questionab=
le business practices--including a bizarre sex angle: a scheme to offer por=
nography via the Internet. The investigators instead have zeroed in on what=
 officials from Enron and Andersen did and did not do once they realized th=
at the debts were mounting, that the stock price was falling and that the l=
ast people to learn of the looming reckoning were going to be millions of E=
nron shareholders. Watkins' two letters provide the road map for their inqu=
iry.=20
It took Watkins weeks to work up the nerve to write her first letter to Lay=
. She had been working for chief financial officer Andrew Fastow last summe=
r, looking for assets to sell as Enron ran into financial trouble while tra=
nsforming itself into a company that traded energy, water, weather derivati=
ves and anything else it could turn into a commodity. Watkins wanted to hel=
p, but everywhere she looked she ran into off-the-books arrangements that n=
o one could explain or seemed to want to investigate. She knew that others =
who had pressed then CEO Jeffrey Skilling about the investments had run int=
o trouble. One of her friends, then company treasurer Jeff McMahon, had bee=
n transferred when he "complained mightily" to Skilling about the "veil of =
secrecy" surrounding the outside deals.=20
Watkins learned Enron was losing money on two equity investments: network-e=
quipment supplier Avici lost 98% of its value, and another, New Power, an e=
nergy retailer that had Ken Lay on the board, dropped more than 80%. Becaus=
e both firms were backed by Enron stock, Watkins knew their downfall was dr=
agging down Enron too. None of that was being reflected in the company's pu=
blic filings, as far as she could tell. As her lawyer Philip Hilder explain=
s, "The numbers just didn't add up."=20
Already known as outspoken, Watkins didn't want to approach Skilling direct=
ly for fear of losing her job, Hilder says. "She thought it would be fruitl=
ess while he was there." When Skilling suddenly quit on Aug. 14, Lay called=
 an all-employees meeting two days later and asked for comments from worker=
s beforehand. That's when Watkins finally sat down to write a one-page anon=
ymous letter on her computer at work. She dropped it in the box at headquar=
ters the next day.=20
The letter laid out what many executives knew but no one had the courage to=
 say. Watkins homed in on two sets of transactions called Condor and Raptor=
 (Enron had a penchant for names inspired by Jurassic Park and Star Wars) a=
nd argued that the accounting treatment was unsound, if not dishonest. Enro=
n had booked huge profits from these entities while its stock price soared =
in 2000, despite the fact that neither Condor nor Raptor had any hard asset=
s. But now that Enron's price was dropping, the company had to note these d=
evaluations or pour more money into the companies when cash was short. "It =
sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a relat=
ed company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.=
"=20
But what gave the brief letter its power was its overwhelming sense of doom=
. "Skilling is resigning now for 'personal reasons' but I would think he wa=
sn't having fun, looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and=
 would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years."=20
At the Aug. 16 companywide meeting, Lay invited anyone troubled by Skilling=
's departure to meet with him. Four days later Watkins called a friend at A=
ndersen and asked for advice. On Aug. 21 the friend drafted a memo detailin=
g Watkins' concerns for Andersen auditors on the Enron account. Meanwhile, =
Watkins went to Lay seeking a meeting. The next day she met with the chairm=
an.=20
The session was businesslike, and Lay seemed genuinely concerned. Watkins b=
rought along a six-page letter detailing her worries, and Lay promised to h=
ave a team of lawyers review the controversial deals. But he decided to use=
 Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, despite Watkins' unease about a conflic=
t of interest. Vinson & Elkins had been paid for work on Condor and Raptor =
transactions. But Lay went ahead with the review--whose scope he kept stric=
tly limited.=20
By then, Lay was in the middle of a personal stock sell-off. On Aug. 20 he =
exercised options to buy 25,000 shares at $20.78 a share. The next day he e=
xercised an additional 68,000 shares at $21.56. On both days, the stock clo=
sed around $36, which meant Lay netted nearly $1.5 million before taxes. He=
 continued to be a huge booster for the stock for another month. As late as=
 Sept. 26, Lay would try to reassure Enron employees that "our financial li=
quidity has never been stronger." But as the stock fell last fall, company =
employees were told that they would be unable to move any assets held in En=
ron stock into other securities in their 401(k) plan while the company swit=
ched plan administrators.=20
The end was near. On Oct. 15 Vinson & Elkins issued a nine-page report stat=
ing that Andersen approved of the Condor and Raptor deals and that Enron ha=
d done nothing wrong. On Oct. 16 the company announced a $618 million third=
-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Oct. 3=
1 the SEC opened a formal inquiry into Enron. Last week, a Vinson & Elkins =
spokesman said the law firm was "not in a position to talk about our engage=
ment with Enron or any other client."=20
Enron too said as little as possible last week as the company tried to reor=
ganize itself and as Lay and other top executives tried to fend off lawsuit=
s filed by angry employees and other investors. The law makes it extremely =
difficult to confiscate the personal assets of corporate officers in punish=
ment for actions on behalf of the company, but if there were ever a chairma=
n who courted that fate, it is Lay. Last week he put three properties in As=
pen up for sale, for $16 million, and huddled with his lawyers in preparati=
on for congressional hearings next month. Few in business have ever fallen =
so far so fast: the man who once could raise Cabinet officials with a singl=
e telephone call and rated the only one-on-one meeting with the Vice Presid=
ent on energy policy last year can't show his face in Houston for fear of r=
eprisals.=20
While Enron suffered in silence last week, Andersen was tripping over its o=
wn attempts at damage control. Andersen has the most to gain by coming clea=
n because if it doesn't, it stands to lose a lot of business. So with help =
from an army of just-hired p.r. agents, the Chicago company worked overtime=
 to show that in its work for Enron, it was merely trying to serve a secret=
ive and aggressive client who was pushing the envelope on accounting rules =
that aren't very clear anyway. Last week, two days after TIME reported that=
 Andersen ordered the destruction of documents in October, the company sent=
 CEO Joe Berardino out in public to strike a contrite tone. Andersen placed=
 three auditors in its Houston office on leave and took out full-page ads i=
n the newspapers promising to "deal with these issues, candidly and directl=
y... Without question, this is the most difficult and challenging episode i=
n our firm's history."=20
And it abruptly fired David Duncan, who managed the Enron account in Housto=
n, saying he had "without any consultation with others in the firm" organiz=
ed the destruction of documents as Enron's losses mounted in October. Seeki=
ng to put as much distance as possible between the home office and a waywar=
d Houston branch, the company pointed out that all shredding had ceased onc=
e the SEC issued a subpoena in the Enron matter. As a former Andersen partn=
er in Chicago told TIME, "The issue of document deletion is entirely depend=
ent on when the organization was aware that there might be a liability issu=
e. Liability begins once there is knowledge."=20
Which explains why things got worse--much worse--for Andersen a few days la=
ter, when it was revealed that officials at the company's headquarters in C=
hicago had discussed the questionable Enron accounting very early in the ga=
me--in a conference call last Feb. 5. Enron was no longer a problem that An=
dersen's Houston office had kept to itself.=20
Nor were the top Andersen officials worrying about the actions of some low-=
level, rogue Enron trader back on Feb. 5. What concerned the auditors that =
morning was how to account for losses piling up in an off-the-books partner=
ship between the company and a firm called LJM. The manager of LJM was none=
 other than Enron's chief financial officer, Fastow. Putting aside the Texa=
s-size conflict of interest for Fastow--whose day job involved vouching for=
 Enron's financial health--Andersen knew that Enron's debts to LJM were ris=
ing to a level that required public disclosure no matter who was in charge.=
 Such a disclosure would have sent Enron's stock into a dive. But no disclo=
sure was made in the company's next quarterly report. Why not? One memo of =
the Feb. 5 conference call noted that Enron "often is creating industries a=
nd markets and transactions for which there are no specific rules."=20
And yet Andersen's understanding of Enron's strange business practices was =
extensive enough that Andersen executives, during the same conference call,=
 contemplated dropping Enron as a client. That would have been a kick in th=
e teeth for the auditing firm: Enron was paying Andersen some $50 million a=
 year in auditing and "consulting" fees--and officials said in the conferen=
ce call that they envisioned billings doubling in the coming years. Ultimat=
ely, Andersen decided to stick with Enron because, according to an e-mail r=
ecord of the call, "we had the appropriate people and processes in place to=
 serve Enron and manage our engagement risks." That engagement ended late l=
ast week when, in a largely symbolic move, Enron fired Andersen instead.=20
In Washington, of course, the politicians weren't just firing Enron and And=
ersen; they were plucking them from their Rolodexes and sending back their =
gifts. Lawmakers of both parties--led by those in close contests this Novem=
ber--scrambled to give back hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign co=
ntributions Enron employees had sprinkled across the political landscape la=
st year. Just for good measure, lawmakers have launched seven separate Enro=
n probes.=20
The Republican White House, which received the vast majority of the Enron m=
oney, struck an unbothered pose, relieved that neither Treasury Secretary P=
aul O'Neill nor Commerce Secretary Don Evans had lifted a finger when Enron=
 came calling for help last fall. Still, the Bush team made one tiny bow to=
 the explosive potential of the Enron scandal, hinting for the first time t=
hat it might fork over the details of Vice President Cheney's closed-door m=
eetings with energy- industry officials last spring if a congressional comm=
ittee requested them. Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett predicted that those pape=
rs, if released, would provide no evidence of a smoking quid pro quo betwee=
n the Administration and Enron. "News flash," dry-quipped Bartlett. "We wan=
t to increase domestic natural-gas production. Tell me what Democrat doesn'=
t."=20
If anyone was having trouble making Enron go away, it was Harvey Pitt, a la=
wyer who represented the Big Five accounting firms before Bush named him to=
 chair the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. Until the Enron sc=
andal broke, Pitt had waved away demands for stronger regulation of corpora=
te accounting and auditing. There were calls from lawmakers for Pitt to rec=
use himself from the SEC probe of Enron, but Pitt refused--after a fashion,=
 anyway--saying that such a step would hurt the agency's standing. He added=
, however, that director of enforcement Stephen Cutler would run the probe =
anyway. Bush last month named two other accounting executives to empty seat=
s on the SEC: Paul Atkins, a partner with Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and Cynt=
hia Glassman of Ernst & Young.=20
These rookies, like Pitt, face a rough season. "There could be other Enron-=
like situations out there," says Arthur Levitt, the activist former SEC cha=
irman. "Financial legerdemain from seduced audit committees, compromised ac=
countants and inadequate standards could certainly crop up again at other U=
.S. companies." At the moment, the public's best protection against that so=
rt of surprise is other brave whistle-blowers like Sherron Watkins.=20

AGGRESSIVE ACCOUNTING By capitalizing its web of complex partnerships with =
its own stock, Enron managed to make losses look like gains=20
THE STRATEGY When Enron wanted to invest in other companies' stocks--a comm=
onplace transaction for large corporations--it could have negotiated a fair=
 price with a competitor to raise capital to make the stock purchases. Inst=
ead, it created thousands of complex partnerships, including two called Con=
dor and Raptor, to allow the transactions to be treated as gains rather tha=
n liabilities on Enron's books. According to Enron vice president Sherron W=
atkins' August memo, here's how these partnerships worked:=20
THE TACTIC In order to sell its own assets at the price it wanted, Enron le=
nt Condor $800 million in Enron stock, which Condor then used to buy the as=
sets. Enron listed the transaction as a cash gain.=20
Enron lent the Raptor partnership more than $550 million in stock so Raptor=
 could invest in entities like the New Power Co. and Avici. Enron listed th=
e Raptor loan as an asset. As guarantor of its own loan, Enron promised to =
issue more stock if Raptor defaulted. The tactic worked as long as stock pr=
ices rose.=20
THE COMPLICATION Instead of rising, Raptor's stock holdings plummeted in va=
lue. Whistle-blower Watkins warned in her memo that to offset Raptor's sign=
ificant losses--Avici's stock dropped 98%, from $178 million to $5 million,=
 and the New Power Co. shares dropped from $40 to $6--Enron would have to i=
ssue even more stock to keep Raptor afloat.=20
THE WRITE-DOWN As of last week, these transactions were not accounted for o=
n Enron's books. What this means is that Enron may have to restate its earn=
ings yet again, posting even bigger losses.=20
Quote: Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting impr=
oprieties and valuation issues... --Excerpts from the letter Watkins sent t=
o Lay on Aug. 15, 2001 I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wa=
ve of accounting scandals... It sure looks to the layman on the street that=

Enron Energy Services had about 11,600 customers, mostly small business cus=

Enron Energy Services relied on the investment credit rating of Enron for i=

 its subsidiaries, including Enron Energy Services, filed for bankruptcy on=
 Dec. 2.=20
In a filing with the PUC last week, an EES attorney said the company has no=

Judge to consider lawyers' plan to investigate Arthur Andersen
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

01/23/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Lawyers for shareholders suing 29 current and former Enron C=
orp. executives and board members added finishing touches Wednesday to a pl=
an intended to bar the fallen energy giant's auditor from any further shred=
ding of documents related to its audits.=20
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon scheduled an afternoon hearing to consid=
er the plan.
Plaintiffs include Amalgamated Bank, the University of California Regents a=
nd pension funds for Florida, New York City, Georgia, Ohio and other states=
.=20
William Lerach, who represents Amalgamated, said lawyers want Harmon to all=
ow them to inspect Arthur Andersen's Enron-related documents and their stor=
age; eliminate any Andersen policies that would allow shredding of Enron do=
cuments after a certain amount of time; and allow them to take depositions =
from top Andersen personnel.=20
Meanwhile, former Enron employees who lost $1.3 billion in retirement funds=
 when the company collapsed late last year sued the Chicago-based auditor, =
Arthur Andersen LLP, and several current and former Enron executives, alleg=
ing that they violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring to hide Enro=
n's true financial condition.=20
Andersen's acknowledgment two weeks ago that its Houston office had destroy=
ed a significant but undetermined number of Enron-related documents prompte=
d the racketeering lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court.=20
"That kind of tipped the scale," said Seattle attorney Steve Berman. "Ander=
sen has admitted that it knew of serious accounting issues."=20
Neither Rusty Hardin, a Houston attorney representing Andersen, nor an Ande=
rsen spokesman immediately returned calls for comment Wednesday.=20
Hardin assured Judge Harmon Tuesday that Andersen's Enron-related documents=
 were under guard, and nothing more is being destroyed.=20
Berman also is suing Enron in a separate case on behalf of its employees. T=
hat lawsuit, like many of the more than 60 others filed across the country =
that name Enron as a defendant, is on hold as Enron works to emerge from ba=
nkruptcy. The company filed the largest Chapter 11 reorganization in histor=
y on Dec. 2 in New York.=20
Lerach's lawsuit names individuals rather than Enron Corp. as defendants, s=
o it can proceed despite the bankruptcy. The plaintiffs seek more than $1 b=
illion in proceeds executives and board members made by selling Enron stock=
 from October 1998 through November 2001.=20
Andersen is under a Texas judge's order prohibiting any further shredding o=
f Enron-related documents. Lerach's team wants Harmon to issue a similar or=
der to help them investigate its case.=20
Lerach also wants to take depositions from Enron chairman and chief executi=
ve Kenneth Lay and others regarding Andersen shredding. He said Harmon shou=
ld consider that issue later.=20
On Tuesday, Enron invited the FBI to investigate allegations from a former =
executive that employees shredded their own financial documents from Hallow=
een through as recently as last week. The executive, Maureen Raymond Castan=
eda, said she saw the shredding until she was laid off last week.=20
FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore declined comment on whether agents remained at =
Enron on Wednesday. Spokespeople for Enron and the Justice Department did n=

Enron suit cites racketeering charges
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 12:53 PM ET Jan. 23, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron employees are citing alleged violations of racket=
eering laws in a new lawsuit that blames company officers and fired auditor=
 Andersen for employees losing some $1.3 billion in retirement savings.
The litigation marks the first Enron-related class-action lawsuit, among do=
zens, to cite the Racketeering Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act. Ha=
gens Berman, a Seattle-based law firm, filed the suit in U.S. District Cour=
t in Houston on Tuesday.
An Andersen spokesperson did not immediately have a comment. Enron declined=
 to comment.=20
In addition to Andersen, the suit names Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, Jeffrey =
Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, Andrew Fastow, the former chief f=
inancial officer, the Northern Trust Co., and David Duncan, the former Enro=
n audit partner fired by Andersen last week.
The suit charges the parties with conspiring to hide Enron's true financial=
 status by "withholding critical information."
"Now that the facts of Andersen are coming to light, it shows that Andersen=
 was well aware of the accounting problems, and it was so bad that Andersen=
 was destroying documents," attorney Steve Berman said in an interview.=20
"We have a strong basis for suing Andersen for racketeering. There is a spe=
cific provision of RICO, which makes it a crime to embezzle or convert the =
asset of any employee welfare benefit plan, and we're alleging that Anderse=
n engaged in a conspiracy with Enron to do just that."
The suit also claims that Northern Trust and administrators of the Enron sa=
vings plan breached their fiduciary duty to company employees by locking do=
wn the retirement savings plan.
Judge Melinda Harmon, who's overseeing all the Enron-related lawsuits filed=
 in Houston, has scheduled a Feb. 25 hearing to come up with a case managem=
ent plan, Berman said.

Enron Employees Sue Andersen, Claiming Auditor Violated Racketeering Laws

Dow Jones Newswires=20
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. employees filed suit against Enron officials and the=
 energy trader's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, alleging violations of feder=
al racketeering laws by illegal manipulation of retirement funds.
Wednesday's action is the latest in a flurry of lawsuits related to the col=
lapse of Enron, but it is the first suit to charge Andersen with violations=
 under the Racketeering Influences and Corrupt Organizations law, known as =
the RICO Act.=20
The law firm Hagens Berman said in a news release that it filed the action =
on behalf of more than 100 named plaintiffs and seeks to represent an estim=
ated 21,000 Enron savings plans participants.=20
The suit claims Andersen and individual Enron officers conspired to hide En=
ron's true financial condition by withholding critical information, causing=
 employees to lose more than $1.3 billion from their retirement funds.=20
It also alleges David Duncan, Andersen's chief Enron auditor, repeatedly ce=
rtified financial statements he knew were false in an attempt to cover debt=
s and losses. Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay then knowingly used that fa=
lse information to promote the overvalued Enron stock to employees as "comp=
ensation," to secure their loyalty and to have stock holdings available to =
fend off any hostile takeovers, the suit contends.=20
The 1970 RICO law increases penalties against enterprises that carry out cr=
iminal acts that affect interstate commerce and prohibits any person from u=
sing the assets of an employee pension plan for personal gain.=20
The suit charges that Mr. Lay and several Enron officers violated RICO by c=
onspiring to defraud Enron employees by contributing worthless Enron stock =
to retirement plans as part of what the suit calls a "retirement plan consp=
iracy."=20
The suit also claims wrongdoing by Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS), a trustee o=
f the Enron retirement plan, as well as by retirement plan administrators.=
=20
Representatives from Andersen and Enron weren't immediately available for c=
omment.=20
Enron faces suits from shareholders as well as former employees over billio=
ns of dollars lost in the company's collapse, while the company's Chapter 1=
1 filing promises to be one of the largest and most complex bankruptcy case=
s in U.S. history.=20
In addition, eight congressional committees and three federal agencies are =
investigating various aspects of Enron and its collapse. The Justice Depart=
ment is leading a criminal investigation, the Department of Labor is probin=
g Enron's retirement plan and the Securities and Exchange Commission is loo=
king into the auditing practices of Andersen.=20
Also this week, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations set =
a hearing for Thursday on alleged shredding of thousands of company documen=
ts by Enron officials.=20
In late-morning trading, shares of Enron (ENRNQ) were down seven cents to 3=
6.5 cents on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board. Enron traded at more than=
 $90 a share a year ago on the New York Stock Exchange; the Big Board delis=
ted the stock earlier this month as a result of Enron's bankruptcy filing.=

On Capitol Hill, Members of Congress Taking Up Where They Left Off; Enron E=
mployees Scheduled Meeting Won't Happen Today
Leon Harris, Jonathan Karl, Ed Lavandera

 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

On Capitol Hill, members of Congress are taking up pretty much where they l=
eft off a month ago. Enron employees are looking to a scheduled meeting tod=
ay to ease their concerns about the company's future, but that meeting did =
not happen.=20
--excerpts only--
KARL: One big issue up here, perhaps the big issue, aside from the question=
 of the economy, is going to be Enron. The first Enron hearings kickoff tom=
orrow, Leon, one on the Senate side with Senator Joseph Lieberman, one over=
 on the House side with Representative Billy Tauzin, and what's interesting=
 here is that we also heard from Trent Lott who talked about the various --=
 here is Trent Lott, the Republican leader -- here is what Trent Lott had t=
o say.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MINORITY LEADER: I do think that the Congress has a=
 responsibility to ask questions and inquire about what happened here. Obvi=
ously, there were problems with business transactions. We need to know more=
 about what caused this problem, and why the employees were put in the posi=
tion that they were in, and do we need some sort of a legislation or reform=
 as a result of that?=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KARL: And Lott and the other Republican leaders in the Senate were also ask=
ed about the controversy regarding Vice President Dick Cheney and the infor=
mation regarding his energy task force. As you know, the Government Account=
ing Office is considering suing the White House to get information about wh=
o was consulting the vice president on the issue of energy policy. The vice=
 president, the White House has said that they do not want to turn that inf=
ormation to the GAO, but Trent Lott asked about this, said that he expects =
in the next few days that we will hear from the vice president, that he wil=
l have more to say on this issue, so that's something we will clearly be wa=
tching for, Leon.=20
HARRIS: Good deal. Thanks, Jon. Jon Karl on Capitol Hill.=20
We've got more on Enron right now, though, from ground zero of Enron. Emplo=
yees of that company are looking to a scheduled meeting today to ease their=
 concerns about the company's future. However, that meeting did not happen.=
=20
CNN's Ed Lavandera is covering Enron development. He joins us now live from=
 Houston. He's got the latest -- Ed.=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Leon, these company-wide meetings ar=
e not unusual at Enron over the course of the last several months. We repor=
ted about a meeting that happened in August when Ken Lay resumed the power =
as chairman of the company, and another one in September, where Ken Lay rec=
eived a rather terse reception from a lot of the employees, who started ask=
ing some very difficult questions and started expressing publicly their dis=
pleasure with the way the company was going. We had reported last Friday th=
at Enron executives, four Enron executives, were meeting with Enron employe=
es, the ones that are left working inside the budding, to meet at a hotel j=
ust across the street, where they would be able to answer questions of empl=
oyees. Ken Lay, was, we are told by sources, not going to be a part of that=
 meeting, but that four hiring executives were be going to be able to.=20
We obtained an e-mail that was sent out to employees in the last couple of =
hours, that said, "We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting. However,=
 we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surr=
ound such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it. We are currently maki=
ng arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building t=
o protect your privacy."=20
The e-mail goes onto say, that with all of the issues and the pending litig=
ation in the investigations that are happening right now, it would be very =
difficult for them, if not impossible, to answer some of the more specific =
and of course the more difficult questions that many of these employees sti=
ll have about the direction and future of their company. They say they woul=
d not be able to answer any of those e-mails, and that the meeting would be=
 focusing on the overview of Enron's organizational structure, and they're =
told to expect a memo on that shortly.=20
So a lot of movement here at Enron, and behind me, you might be able to see=
 as well, the Reverend Al Sharpton has just showed up, and he's back there =
talking to reporters as well, and that is the latest from here in Houston.=
=20
Leon, back to you.=20
HARRIS: Thanks, Ed. We will let you go back and listen and see what he has =
to say.=20
Ed Lavandera in Houston, we will check back with you later on.=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and its official creditors commi=
ttee asked a federal judge here to stop a class-action proceeding in Housto=
n that seeks to take control of the bankrupt company's financial books and =
records.
"I am very concerned that a court other than this bankruptcy court may deci=
de this matter," said Luc Despins of Milbank Tweed, which represents Enron'=
s creditors committee. "This goes directly to the issue of Your Honor's jur=
isdiction," he told the judge.=20
While having guidelines to preserve documents is important, these guideline=
s should be decided upon in the New York court, according to Despins. Judge=
 Arthur Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of N=
ew York is presiding over Enron's bankruptcy case.=20

In Houston, where Enron is headquartered, a shareholders' class-action laws=
uit led by Amalgamated Bank has been filed, seeking to freeze the proceeds =
of alleged insider trading by 29 Enron executives.=20
As part of these proceedings, some shareholders have filed a motion to prev=
ent Enron and auditor Arthur Andersen from destroying information related t=
o the distressed company's financial condition.=20
Three former Enron employees claimed that the company shredded documents we=
ll after federal investigators started a probe into alleged accounting irre=
gularities.=20
Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston postponed =
a ruling on the document-preservation motion.=20
At a bankruptcy court hearing in New York Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez told En=
ron and its creditor committee - both of whom participated in the proceedin=
gs via telephone - that he would talk to Judge Harmon about these parties' =
concerns.=20

Also Wednesday, the bankruptcy court declined to give nine insurers immedia=
te access to Enron's financial information.=20
Continental Casualty Co., National Fire Insurance Co. and others have quest=
ioned whether forward sales contracts guaranteed by $2 billion in Enron-rel=
ated surety bonds ever existed. The insurers believe that opening the bankr=
upt company's books will allow them to make this determination.=20
The insurers also want to know the relationships between J.P. Morgan Chase =
& Co. (JPM), one of Enron's largest lenders, and two Enron-related offshore=
 entities that participated in the forward contracts.=20
J.P. Morgan filed a lawsuit in a New York state court last month, after the=
 insurers declined to pay $1.1 billion owed under the surety bonds, includi=
ng about $965 million to J.P. Morgan. The lawsuit has been moved to the U.S=
. District Court for the Southern District of New York.=20
On Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez told Enron and its insurers that the request f=
or information is likely to be heard in the district court.=20
He delayed a decision on the insurers' motion, and scheduled another hearin=
g for Jan. 25. The judge also asked Enron to provide the insurers with the =
location of relevant documents and the names of witnesses by Feb. 1, in cas=
e this information is needed later.=20

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Senate committee asked Enron Corp. on Wednesday to auth=
orize release of its tax returns to give the public and Congress a "more in=
formed understanding" of the bankrupt energy trader's financial dealings.=
=20
The Senate Finance Committee is in the beginning stages of a probe into Enr=
on's possible use of tax shelters, its creation of more than 800 subsidiari=
es and the impact they may have had on the company's bottom line. The panel=
 is also looking into Enron's pension programs, including its 401(k) plan a=
nd employer stock ownership plan.
In a letter to Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon, Finance Commi=
ttee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., and the panel's senior Republican, Sen. =
Charles Grassley of Iowa, sought company authorization to make public Enron=
 tax records since 1985 - including those of its affiliated companies or pa=
rtnerships.=20
Although the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee alrea=
dy have access to the tax records, their release to the public is limited d=
ue to privacy laws. This could restrict any hearings or public comments on =
the company's tax situation.=20
"It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed under=
standing of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax returns =
and pension programs," the senators said in their letter.=20
Enron officials did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment=
. The company and Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that audited its boo=
ks, are already involved in numerous congressional investigations stemming =
from Enron's rapid financial downfall last year.=20
The Finance Committee has not yet scheduled any hearings, but a spokesman s=
aid they could occur within a matter of weeks. Committee investigators are =
planning to meet this week with the Internal Revenue Service to begin the p=
rocess of obtaining Enron tax records.=20
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal tax research organization, has estimate=
d that Enron paid no corporate income taxes in four of the past five years.=
 Enron paid $17 million in taxes in 1997 and got refunds totaling $381 mill=
ion in all other years between 1996 to 2000, according to the group's analy=

Enron Asked to Release Its Tax Records Dating Back to 1985
2002-01-23 16:04 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate Finance Committee asked =
Enron Corp. to publicly release all tax records for the company, its partne=
rships and affiliated companies.
     Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Senator C=
harles Grassley of Iowa, the committee's top Republican, made the request i=
n a letter to Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon. They asked McM=
ahon for permission to release tax information the committee has dating to =
Enron's creation in 1985.
     ``It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed=
 understanding of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax re=
turns and pension programs,'' Baucus and Grassley's letter said.
     The Finance Committee has authority to review tax returns of Enron. Ta=
xpayer confidentiality laws prevent it from releasing that information unle=
ss the company grants permission. An Enron spokesman wasn't immediately ava=
ilable for comment.
     The Finance Committee is investigating Enron pension losses and its us=
e of corporate tax shelters. Release of tax information would provide inves=
tigators and shareholders details about the company's financial health and =
underpinnings of its decline.
     Enron was once the largest U.S. energy trader until it filed for bankr=
uptcy last month. Shareholders and creditors lost $60 billion in the collap=
se of the Houston-based Enron.
     The Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax policy, is one of at =
least 10 congressional panels examining Enron's bankruptcy. The Senate Bank=
ing Committee today said it will hold a Feb. 26 hearing on accounting failu=
res in cases such as Enron's and proposals to improve oversight. Three form=
er Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountants and the former head=
 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board were asked to testify.
     Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland,=
 asked the investigative arm of Congress, the General Accounting Office, to=
 examine the numerous earnings restatements by companies such as Enron, Cen=
dant Corp. and Waste Management Inc.
     ``Frequent restatements of earnings go directly to the heart of our fi=
nancial system,'' Sarbanes said in a statement. ``Because by raising questi=
ons about the reliability of published financial statements, they threaten =
to undermine investors' confidence in
the way our securities markets operate.''
     He asked the GAO to examine all earnings restatements between 1997 and=
 2000, their affect on investors and recommendations for reform.
     The Senate Banking Committee previously announced a Feb. 12 hearing at=
 which it would listen to five former SEC chairmen discuss accounting issue=
s.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday so=
ught permission from Enron Corp. to release the collapsed company's tax ret=
urns to the public.=20
"It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed under=
standing of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax returns =
and pension programs," the panel said in a letter to Enron's chief financia=
l officer, Jeffrey McMahon.
The committee said it had the authority under the law to review Enron's con=
solidated tax returns as well as those of its affiliated companies and part=
nerships, and expects to exercise that authority.=20
But it said there were limitations on its ability to release the informatio=
n to the public without Enron's authorization.=20
"Therefore, we request that you please provide the Finance committee writte=
n authorization to release to the public information contained in Enron's f=
ederal consolidated tax returns or any tax information related to Enron's a=
ffiliated companies or partnerships that is not included in the consolidate=
d tax returns," said the letter, from the committee chairman, Montana Democ=
rat Sen. Max Baucus, and the ranking Republican on the panel, Charles Grass=
ley of Iowa.=20
"This would be for all time periods since the creation of Enron in 1985," i=
t added.=20
Last week, the head of a tax watchdog group said Enron had not paid U.S. in=
come taxes in four of five years through 2000, receiving tax refunds close =
to $400 million in the period.=20
Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed tax r=
esearch group, said he had analyzed Enron's financial reports for 1996 to 2=
000, the most recent year for which they were available.=20
The Senate Finance Committee is one of several panels on Capitol Hill looki=

Andersen CEO won't show=20
January 23, 2002: 2:29 p.m. ET
Fired Andersen auditor David Duncan wants immunity while CEO not subpoenaed=
.=20
NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Fired Andersen partner David Duncan wants immunity f=
rom prosecution or he will not testify at a Congressional hearing Thursday =
while the firm's CEO Joseph Berardino won't appear at the hearing and will =
send a replacement instead.
Berardino did not receive a subpoena to testify Thursday before the Subcomm=
ittee on Oversight and Investigation. Instead, Andersen executive Dorsey Ba=
skin, who is in charge of Andersen's document retention and disposal policy=
, will appear to explain the policy, Congressman James Greenwood (R-PA), wh=
o heads the subcommittee, told CNNfn.
The change came after the committee negotiated with the accounting firm.
Separately, former Andersen auditor Duncan is relying on his Fifth Amendmen=
t constitutional right to protect himself from self-incrimination as a reas=
on not to testify at the hearing.
"Mr. Duncan will testify on Jan. 24 if the Committee votes to grant him imm=
unity," attorney Robert Giuffra, who is representing Duncan, said in a lett=
er to the Subcommittee.
But Andersen's embattled in-house counsel Nancy Temple will appear at the h=
earing. Temple sent an Oct. 12 memo reminding Andersen's Houston office of =
the firm's document retention policy, which executives claim, caused staff =
to start shredding Enron documents.
Michael Odom, a partner at Andersen's Houston office who has been stripped =
of managerial responsibilities, will also be present. Both Temple and Odom =
have requested subpoenas which provides legal protection from employers whe=
n testifying.
Also Wednesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and Ranking Me=
mber Chuck Grassley asked Enron Corp. Wednesday to publicly disclose all co=
mpany tax records, including those related to Enron's affiliated companies =
or partnerships.

Auditor Refuses To Testify In Enron Hearing
Duncan Was Fired By Andersen For Destroying Documents
KPRC Channel 2, Houston
Posted: 11:49 p.m. EST January 22, 2002
Updated: 1:33 p.m. EST January 23, 2002
The former chief auditor at Andersen is refusing to tell a congressional pa=
nel what he knows about the destruction of Enron-related documents.=20
The lawyer for David Duncan, who was fired last week by accounting firm And=
ersen for supervising the shredding of documents related to the troubles of=
 the now-bankrupt energy-trading giant Enron Corp., told the House Commerce=
 Committee that Duncan will rely on his "constitutional right not to testif=
y" unless he's given immunity.=20
Congress can compel witnesses to show up, but it can't force them to answer=
 potentially incriminating questions without granting them immunity from cr=
iminal prosecution.=20
The House committee is holding a hearing Thursday, and Duncan wanted a dela=
y in order to prepare.=20
Andersen officials said last week that Duncan began destroying documents sh=
ortly after learning the government was asking Enron for accounting informa=
tion.=20
Duncan's lawyers say he did nothing wrong -- that he followed the instructi=
ons of an Andersen lawyer in handling documents.=20
Congressional investigators subpoenaed senior officials of Andersen, includ=
ing the Chief Executive Joseph Berardino, Duncan, attorney Nancy Temple and=
 Risk Manager Michael Odom in an effort to force their testimony Thursday.=
=20
Temple and Odom, while expressing willingness to testify, have raised conce=
rns about protecting confidential information relating to the investigation=
. The firm's chief executive had been interviewed over the weekend on telev=
ision.=20
Berardino voluntarily testified at the first congressional hearings on Enro=
n last month, defending Andersen's work for Enron but acknowledging that fi=
nancial reporting practices must change.=20
He said Andersen notified Enron's audit committee on Nov. 2 of "possible il=
legal acts within the company.'' Berardino did not mention the document shr=
edding. More recently, he said executives of the Chicago-based firm didn't =
learn of the destruction until shortly after New Year's.=20
Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said, "We have not received a subpoe=
na. We have told the committee that we would testify but the only question =
is when.''=20
News of the planned subpoenas came as FBI agents and federal prosecutors en=
tered Enron's Houston headquarters to investigate allegations that massive =
document destruction took place at the company starting after Thanksgiving =
and continuing until as recently as last week. According to a CNN report, F=
BI placed guards inside the Enron building to prevent any further shredding=
 of documents.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission started looking into Enron's account=
ing in mid-October, after the company reported a third-quarter loss of more=
 than $600 million. The SEC's inquiry eventually included demands for finan=
cial documents from Enron and Andersen.=20
Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.=20
New Appointee To SEC
As the controversy swirled, President George W. Bush used his recess appoin=
tment power Tuesday to put an official from another major accounting firm o=
n the SEC, bypassing the Senate approval process. Bush appointed Cynthia A.=
 Glassman, a principal at Ernst and Young, to fill a Republican vacancy on =
the five-member commission a day before Congress convened.=20
Bush also reappointed Isaac Hunt, a Democrat named to the SEC by former Pre=
sident Bill Clinton in 1996. Hunt's term recently expired.=20
The Energy and Commerce panel is one of two committees holding Enron hearin=
gs on Thursday. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is calling offici=
als from the SEC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodit=
y Futures Trading Commission to determine whether regulators missed signs o=
f trouble at Enron.=20
In another development Tuesday, Sen. Phil Gramm, one of Congress' biggest r=

USA: Former Andersen partner seeks to defer testimony.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The former Andersen partner who led the audi=
tor's work at Enron Corp. has advised lawmakers he will not testify at a he=
aring on Thursday unless his testimony is protected from use in court again=
st him.=20
David Duncan was subpoenaed late Tuesday by the House Energy and Commerce i=
nvestigations subcommittee to help shed light on Enron's rapid collapse las=
t year from an energy colossus to the biggest U.S. bankruptcy amid question=
able company bookkeeping.
But a lawyer for Duncan wrote the committee on Wednesday, saying it was pre=
mature to require Duncan to testify "at this hearing at this time."=20
Complaining that Duncan had just, on Tuesday, gotten access to documents fr=
om his own files at Andersen, the letter said Duncan would invoke his const=
itutional Fifth Amendment right not to testify on Jan. 24.=20
However, "Mr Duncan will testify on January 24 if the committee votes to gr=
ant him immunity...," said Robert Giuffra of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwe=

Giuffra said Duncan sought full disclosure of the truth and remained commit=

Duncan was fired earlier this month by Andersen, which alleged he had order=

 information on Enron's financial reporting.=20
Legal experts have said that immunity offered in exchange for congressional=
 testimony could play havoc with the Justice Department's criminal probe of=

ers are at sea. Here is a survival guide

Choice is good. We Americans consider it a measure of our freedom and a sou=
rce of our innovation and prosperity. Riches flow to the person who builds =
a better mousetrap--or computer mouse. Yet a grocery shopper blankly starin=
g at hundreds of varieties of toothpaste might reasonably conclude that the=
re can be too much of a good thing. Mark Lepper, a psychology professor at =
Stanford, and Sheena Iyengar, an associate professor of management at Colum=
bia, illustrated this point with a simple study. In a grocery store, they s=
et up tasting booths that offered either six or 24 types of jam. Shoppers f=
ound the wider selection more enticing: 60% who passed it stopped and taste=
d, while only 40% stopped at the booth with fewer flavors. Yet the wider se=
lection was confounding; just 3% who sampled there bought anything, while 3=
0% made a purchase at the other booth.=20
The tendency to feel overwhelmed and do nothing probably saves us money on =
jam. But it is becoming increasingly dangerous as society hands us more and=
 more responsibility for vital and complex decisions about our savings for =
college and retirement, our family's health care and the providers of utili=
ties ranging from electricity to cellular-phone service. Responsibility is =
always the price of freedom. But we are now responsible for so many decisio=
ns requiring so much homework that many of us feel helpless and paralyzed. =
The risks of inaction or unwise action are rising, even as many of the prof=
essionals on whom we would like to rely for guidance are proving untrustwor=
thy and even corrupt.
Then came Enron. What makes this case so scary is that the shady ethics and=
 the deception that suddenly bankrupted one of the world's most innovative =
companies have become pervasive--and much of it is legal. It's not unreason=
able to fear that the next Enron could be lurking in your 401(k) account or=
 paying your salary. If the corporate directors and auditors and stock anal=
ysts who were supposed to be looking out for the interests of shareholders =
at Enron could be bought off with consulting and underwriting fees, we know=
 they are probably being bought off elsewhere too. From 1998 to 2000, 397 p=
ublicly traded companies had to restate their financial results, and big fi=
rms like Sunbeam and Cendant have paid to settle shareholder suits alleging=
 fraud.=20
The social safety net for the unemployed is not the only thing that the gov=
ernment has loosened. It has also pulled back from the regulation of busine=
ss. That's a direction we have chosen through our own elections, and in man=
y ways it has served us well. But what we didn't anticipate was the degree =
to which lightly regulated companies would be able to corrupt the professio=
nals on whom we have relied to guide us through complex financial and medic=
al matters and to look out for our interests. We now know that we can't tru=
st stock analysts and financial planners, who often get paid more for selli=
ng us shaky stocks and mutual funds than for selling us solid ones.=20
For several months after Sept. 11, Americans have felt ourselves pulling to=
gether. But the Enron scandal has shown us or perhaps reminded us that when=
 money is involved, we are truly on our own.=20
Consider retirement. In 1985 the number of U.S. companies offering guarante=
ed pensions to their workers was 114,000. Only 38,000 did so in 2000. Filli=
ng the gap are 401(k) and other employer-sponsored plans that have introduc=
ed millions of Americans to the benefits of stock investing in the 1990s an=
d created many millionaires, at least on paper. But these savings plans don=
't guarantee anything. Future benefits depend on how wisely we invest--whic=
h looked pretty easy until the market turned south two years ago. Now we ar=
e learning how much we don't know about risk and diversification and how po=
orly equipped most of us are to choose among 8,282 U.S. mutual funds. The y=
earning for reliable advice is so widespread that a Charles Schwab commerci=
al shows a family doctor who makes a house call (remember those?) and winds=
 up giving investment advice. "Wouldn't it be nice," goes the ad slogan, "i=
f the person you trusted most was your financial adviser?"=20
Homeowners, meanwhile, must figure out whether they are better off with a t=
raditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a straight adjustable rate or a 3/1=
 hybrid. Parents must decide whether they should save for college in a Sect=
ion 529 plan (who on earth names these things?) or a Coverdell ESA. We all =
want Marcus Welby for our doctor, but he is not among the options offered b=
y our employer. Instead, we must choose among an HMO, a PPO or a POS. And i=
f we lose our jobs, we must learn to get insurance through COBRA. Read a 4-=
in. pile of paper, and call me in the morning.=20
We are accustomed to having our dinners (not to mention our HMO homework) i=
nterrupted by the peddlers of long-distance phone plans. But now they have =
been joined by folks pushing wireless service and, in more and more communi=
ties, by sellers of competing local phone service. As a result of the dereg=
ulation movement championed by Enron, some Americans must choose among comp=
eting electricity suppliers. If you pick the cheap one, does the power go o=
ut more often? Who knows? And to access the wonders of the high-speed Inter=
net, heads of household must choose among a cable-TV modem, a DSL phone lin=
e and a satellite link.=20
Having such choices should be a blessing. And we would probably see it that=
 way if we could somehow manage to schedule one gnarly piece of homework at=
 a time--or get some reliable help. What's the answer? Some call for more g=
overnment oversight. For now, responding to the anxiety in the air, Republi=
cans have set aside their plans for private investment accounts for Social =
Security. In the long run there is no turning back this age of self-determi=
nism. Sooner or later, your Social Security income will be partly a functio=
n of how well you choose stocks--and in many other areas too your choices w=
ill make or break you.=20
Some cope by focusing their research not on the best investments or health =
plan or broadband provider but on experts to guide them-- preferably friend=
s or colleagues, but failing that, professionals paid in a way that puts th=
em on your side, not serving someone else's agenda. The following articles =
examine three areas in which research is often the most daunting--investing=
, health care and wiring your home--and offer some helpful resources. So do=
 your homework. The choice is yours.

The little guy was let down by all of them--executives, board members, audi=
tors and stock analysts. They all failed to signal trouble at Enron before =
it collapsed, and their negligence (or worse) offers the single broadest ex=
ample of how workers and individual investors have been abandoned by so man=
y of the people they have relied on to look out for their interests in comp=
lex financial matters. Each of these groups of professionals had a conflict=
 of interest--a financial stake in keeping investor dollars flowing into En=
ron stock. And the erstwhile government and industry watchdogs over these p=
rofessionals face similar conflicts at other big companies.=20
As Enron's stock dropped from $80 to under $1 in less than a year, thousand=
s of employees saw their life savings wiped out in the company's 401(k) ret=
irement plan. They weren't the first to suffer that fate. Devastating stock=
 declines have hammered the 401(k) savings of workers at such companies as =
Lucent, Waste Management and Xerox. And other big plans are vulnerable. Coc=
a-Cola, for example, has 81% of its 401(k) assets in Coke stock. The venera=
ble beverage company is no Enron, yet Coke's slumping stock has been pinchi=
ng 401(k) participants for years, sliding 49% from its peak in July 1998. O=
ther firms that have more than 70% of plan assets tied up in company shares=
 include McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments.
Protecting the $1.8 trillion that 37 million Americans have in 401(k) plans=
 is suddenly a hot issue in Washington. Senators Barbara Boxer of Californi=
a and Jon Corzine of New Jersey propose forbidding plans to invest more tha=
n 20% in any one stock. In an opinion last month, the Labor Department made=
 clear that it won't hold firms liable for third-party advice they make ava=
ilable to 401(k) investors, which could encourage them to offer it, and a b=
ill from Representative John Boehner of Ohio would advance the ball by lega=
lly removing liability for specific asset allocation and other employer- sp=
onsored advice. President Bush ordered "a policy review to protect people's=
 pensions," which is vague but moving in the same direction. Calpers, the b=
ig public-employee pension fund in California, says it will press firms it =
invests in to reform their plans to encourage broad diversification.=20
Michael Sparno, a midlevel manager for Xerox, wishes such reforms had come =
a couple of years sooner. As the shares of his once mighty employer tumbled=
 in price from $60 to $10 in less than two years, his 401(k) account--rough=
ly 30% invested in Xerox stock--took a big hit. "I'm reviewing things now w=
ith a much more hands-on approach," he says. He is contributing less to the=
 401(k) and investing more in real estate and alternative tax-favored accou=
nts like a Roth IRA.=20
Yet Sparno and other 401(k) victims must accept some responsibility for the=
ir troubles. In most plans, the only stock you must hold are shares the com=
pany gives you as a matching contribution. Where retirement-fund disasters =
have occurred, employees have generally been found to own more company stoc=
k than necessary. That was the case at Enron, where management's do-no- wro=
ng hubris filtered down to employees, who rode their 401(k)s to huge paper =
gains between 1998 and 2001. Even as the stock began to slide, many believe=
d it would come back stronger than ever--or were too dumbfounded to sell.=
=20
None of this exonerates Enron management, which hid the depth of the firm's=
 financial problems and talked up the stock while top managers were selling=
 their personal stakes. The rank and file had an additional problem: the 40=
1(k) plan was in a lockdown--assets were frozen during an administrator cha=
nge--for part of the stock's collapse. "Not only are you on your own, but y=
ou have to watch your back," advises Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington attorne=
y who represents 401(k) participants at Enron.=20
What can you do? Start by telling your Congressman and Senators that you su=
pport efforts to lift restrictions on when you can sell company shares that=
 have been given to you and to place limits on how much employer stock can =
be stuffed into a 401(k) or other employer- sponsored plan. But the most im=
portant step is for you to take charge of your retirement account. First, m=
ake sure you're safely in a mix of diversified stock and bond mutual funds =
at all times, in case one of your investments drops suddenly or your plan i=
s locked down for several weeks.=20
Next, hold as little as possible of the stock of your employer, whose fortu=
nes already affect your job security and career advancement. Most big compa=
nies match part of each worker's 401(k) contributions in company stock, whi=
ch can't be shifted into other investments until you reach age 50. As soon =
as you hit that magic birthday, shift those holdings into diversified stock=
 and bond funds. If your employer gives you options to buy company stock, c=
ash them in periodically after the stock has made a strong move higher. You=
'll owe tax. But you can take what's left and diversify. And if you buy sto=
cks outside your 401(k) plan, avoid the shares of companies in the same ind=
ustry as your employer.=20
The Enron scandal has revealed that many auditors and accountants- -at that=
 company and elsewhere--are rubber-stamping stooges of management. It's com=
mon practice for accounting firms to collect consulting fees from companies=
 whose books they audit, often doubling their revenue from one client, as w=
as the case with Arthur Andersen and Enron. Any accountant who raises flags=
 in an audit puts his firm's consulting fees at risk. That's a clear confli=
ct of interest and should be outlawed. Short of that, publicly traded compa=
nies should be required to change auditors every few years. A new auditor w=
ould have a strong incentive to point out, and not get blamed for, any ques=
tionable work by his predecessor. Some have suggested that regulators stop =
requiring annual audits altogether. "An audited financial statement used to=
 mean something," sniffs Ed Cowart, a money manager at Eagle Asset Manageme=
nt. "Things have deteriorated to where auditor comments are meaningless."=
=20
Audits haven't slowed an epidemic of misstated corporate earnings reports. =
From 1990 to '97, an average of 49 companies a year had to restate their re=
sults. That number jumped to 91, 150 and 156 over the next three years, rep=
orts Financial Executives International, which studies accounting issues. I=
n each case, shareholders were deceived. The firms that restated earnings b=
etween 1997 and 2000 lost a collective $41 billion of market value the week=
 following their announcements. With the problem growing so broad, it might=
 be just as well to skip the independent audits, which have turned into sha=
m endorsements that mislead investors.=20
Until the system is reformed, what can an individual investor do? Watch for=
 independent analysis from agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Val=
ue Line. Look skeptically on any stock for which accounting issues have bee=
n raised. Tyco International has been the subject of accounting questions f=
or two years, during which the stock has gone nowhere. New questions flared=
 last week, and the stock tumbled 8%.=20
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors,=
 is worried that for all the clamor in Washington, not much will change. Th=
e Securities and Exchange Commission's proposal to set up an independent ov=
ersight board for the accounting industry is just another form of self-poli=
cing and won't be effective, she says. "Too many people have a real interes=
t in keeping things the way they are," she says, noting that many former la=
wmakers end up as corporate- board members while officials at the SEC are o=
ften accountants themselves or, like SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, former lawye=
rs for accountants.=20
Teslik is especially concerned about corporate-board reform, and would like=
 to see board members held personally liable for gross mismanagement. At a =
minimum, she wants greater disclosure of conflicts of interest. At Enron, f=
or example, directors were partners with management in various side investm=
ents or earned big fees as consultants. Employees and investors should look=
 out for such conflicts. "Almost uniformly, when companies go bad, there is=
 a pattern like this," Teslik says. "The company is trying to buy silence."=
=20
Another way investors can monitor a company is by listening in on analyst c=
onference calls, which are open to the public via the Internet. You will ge=
t a sense of the questions that management is dodging.=20
The conflicts of stock analysts at big brokerage firms have been well aired=
 since the dotcom collapse. Too many serve the investment bankers at their =
firms rather than investors. That was a big problem with Enron. The company=
 floated billions of dollars of debt and spent billions more gobbling up sm=
aller companies--all of it amounting to a fountain of fees for Wall Street =
firms that stayed in the company's good graces. Analysts, who often get pai=
d on the basis of the underwriting business they help secure rather than on=
 good stock picking, were under tremendous pressure not to ask tough questi=
ons and to maintain their buy rating.=20
This subject was probed in Congress last summer, and the brokerage industry=
 has responded with guidelines for ethical behavior. As a result, many firm=
s are disclosing more conflicts. So take a close look at research documents=
 to see whether an analyst has bought or sold any of the stock under review=
 or if the firm is or has been an underwriter of the company's stock or deb=
t. When in doubt, the wise investor should be skeptical about stocks touted=
 by brokers or other representatives of big firms like Merrill Lynch and J.=
P. Morgan Chase. Instead, seek independent information and advice from Stan=
dardandPoors.com, and from good financial websites like Morningstar.com and=
 Fool.com.=20
Financial conflicts are also common among experts who advise us closer to h=
ome. Ask Laura and Barry Marks, who lost their stationery store, Fine Lines=
, in Katonah, N.Y., after their insurance agent told them they couldn't get=
 flood insurance--and they were flooded. "We asked for a complete commercia=
l package to cover any type of inevitability, down to a letter falling off =
of our sign," Barry Marks says. But their insurer didn't offer flood insura=
nce; only Uncle Sam does. That means private insurers have no incentive to =
market it, which is why many agents are misinformed.=20
In recent years, insurance companies have found new ways to shift risk to p=
olicyholders. Fast disappearing is homeowner coverage that guarantees repla=
cement. Among the very largest underwriters, only Chubb still offers this o=
nce common policy. Others shift the risk of miscalculating a home's value t=
o the homeowner. But careful shoppers can still find replacement coverage a=
t smaller firms.=20
Your financial planner may be selling you poorly performing annuities and o=
ther products that earn him a fat commission. One solution: hire a fee-only=
 planner who agrees to be paid by no one but you. Similarly, the real estat=
e agent helping you buy a home may try to rush you into one that's not appr=
opriate just to get a deal done quickly. One solution: hire a buyer's agent=
 who works only for you. In these cases and others, you often have to pay a=
 little more on the front end to save on the back end. And you're wise to i=
nvest time researching the person who will guide you. That way you won't ha=
ve to research every new issue that arises in your financial life.=20

What $6 Million Can Buy

(Copyright 2002)

For argument's sake, let's concede the point that everyone in the White Hou=
se has been at such pains to make: No one in the Bush Administration lifted=
 a finger to save Enron from collapse. But that doesn't mean the $6 million=
 in campaign contributions the company and its executives gave to politicia=
ns over the past 12 years should be written off as a bad investment. For mo=
st of that time, Enron's Washington friends did pretty much whatever the co=
mpany wanted.=20
What Enron wanted most was to be left alone, free of both regulation and sc=
rutiny as it transformed itself from a dowdy natural- gas-pipeline company =
into a freewheeling energy-and-communications giant. In the early 1990s Enr=
on became a new kind of business, selling not just energy but exotic financ=
ial instruments such as energy futures and options. The company moved the h=
eart of its operations from the oil patch to the trading floor--largely fre=
e of regulatory baggage, thanks to allies such as Wendy Gramm. In 1993, as =
chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Gramm helped desi=
gn rules that exempted energy trades from government regulation. That meant=
 Enron could operate an online energy market that, unlike traditional stock=
 and commodity exchanges, did not have to disclose the price, volume or ter=
ms of the contracts it sold. Gramm left government that year and was given =
a lucrative spot on the Enron board. She is the wife of Texas Senator Phil =
Gramm, to whom the company has donated $97,000 since 1989.
There were also times Enron found a little government intervention came in =
handy. When India delayed approval of Enron's $3 billion power plant in Dab=
hol in 1996, Clinton White House counselor Mack McLarty instructed the U.S.=
 ambassador in New Delhi to monitor it and gave regular progress reports to=
 Enron chairman Ken Lay. (Four days before the project received its final O=
.K., Enron gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee.) And when En=
ron was trying to sell its interest in the Indian project, the New York Dai=
ly News reported, Vice President Dick Cheney raised the issue in a meeting =
last June with Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi. The White House says =
he was acting not at Enron's behest but on the need to protect $640 million=
 in federal money.=20
More often than not, Enron's interests and the agenda of George W. Bush hav=
e been happily congruent. Enron has given Bush more than $700,000 in contri=
butions over the years. Lay was disappointed last year when Bush backed awa=
y from a global-warming plan that would have been good for the natural-gas =
business, but Bush sided with the company in refusing to back price caps on=
 California energy, of which Enron was a major supplier. Larry Lindsey, Bus=
h's top economic adviser and a former Enron consultant, has battled on free=
-market grounds to preserve the kind of overseas tax shelters that hid Enro=
n's true financial condition for so long. And in August Lay's backing helpe=
d put his friend Patrick Wood at the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory =
Commission, replacing a chairman who had opposed Enron's deregulation timet=
able.=20
Enron also found plenty to like in the controversial White House energy pla=
n that Cheney produced last year: open access to electric- utility transmis=

The Enron Effect; As the accounting scandal spreads, regulators and politic=
ians are pounding the table for reform. But will anything really change?

It was like the surgeon general's accepting a public-health award named aft=
er Typhoid Mary. Here was Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, re=
nowned for rectitude, accepting the Enron Award for Distinguished Public Se=
rvice. This wasn't during Enron's glory days, when the company had a stock-=
market value in the tens of billions, but on Nov. 13. That was only a few d=
ays after Enron endured a public disgrace by admitting that it had filed fi=
ve years' worth of misleading financial reports. And it was three weeks aft=
er Greenspan had gotten a call from Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, who despera=
tely wanted Greenspan to intervene with credit-rating agencies to help the =
stricken company survive.=20
The ceremony had its awkward moments. Consider the answer Greenspan gave du=
ring a Q&A session to a student who asked how to succeed in this difficult =
job market. "The best chance you have of making a big success in this world=
," Greenspan said, "is to decide from square one that you're going to do it=
 ethically." Greenspan, through his spokesman, told NEWSWEEK that he hadn't=
 had Lay in mind when he gave that answer, a Freudian slip if there ever wa=
s one. What was Greenspan doing there in the first place? His press aide ex=
plained that he had committed a year earlier to former secretary of State J=
im Baker to accept the honor. The James A. Baker Institute of Public Affair=
s awards the prize, which is funded by Enron. (Baker had once been a consul=
tant to Enron, sponsoring its interests in Kuwait not long after the gulf w=
ar ended. But that's another story.) Greenspan turned down the $15,000 scul=
pture accompanying the prize--imagine that sitting in the Fed's lobby--and =
declined the $10,000 honorarium.
The Greenspan story may be the most startling example of how Enron managed =
to ensnare seemingly everybody and every company worth snaring. Now that we=
're in the all-Enron-all-the-time news cycle, we're getting answers to "Who=
 knew what when?" Revelations from last week: people at Arthur Andersen, En=
ron's outside accountant, were worried about the Enron numbers they were ce=
rtifying, but did nothing. Ken Lay got a prescient letter from a whistle-bl=
ower in August warning that "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode i=
n a wave of accounting scandals," but in September he was still telling emp=
loyees that the stock was "an incredible buy." (It's since fallen to almost=
 nothing.)=20
The focus is now shifting to the next obvious questions: what's being done =
to prevent another Enron? And will anything really change once attention mo=
ves on, as it inevitably will, to the next scandal? Harvey Pitt, the head o=
f the Securities and Exchange Commission, is proposing to set up a new over=
sight body to police the accounting profession. Business heavyweights want =
to beef up corporate-governance rules to force boards to pay more attention=
 to what managers are doing. Politicians are calling for rules to limit the=
 amount of company stock that people can hold in retirement accounts to pro=
tect workers from riches-to-rags stock plunges like the one that's turned s=
ome Enronites from paper millionaires into people having trouble paying foo=
d bills during their golden years.=20
But for all the table-pounding calls for change now, urgency has a tendency=
 to dissipate. There have been plenty of accounting scandals before--Sunbea=
m, Cendant, Waste Management, to name some recent fiascoes--but nothing see=
ms to have changed all that much in response to them. Corporate America and=
 the accounting profession have a remarkable ability to frustrate fundament=
al reform. Shortly before he came to the SEC, chairman Pitt, representing A=
rthur Andersen as his client, fought fiercely against tougher regulation of=
 accountants. His current proposal is far milder than the reforms he helped=
 defeat not long ago. Those would have made accountants accountable to fede=
ral regulators, not to a self-policing body, as Pitt proposes. And Sen. Jos=
eph Lieberman, who's holding hearings and demanding post-Enron reforms, led=
 the assault on the Financial Accounting Standards Board when it tried to c=
lose the most glaring loophole in the accounting system: letting companies =
hand out millions or billions of dollars' worth of stock options to employe=
es, but not counting that cost as a charge against profits.=20
While politicians and theoreticians struggle with the idea of reform, real =
and immediate solutions to particular problems tend to come from people lik=
e Enron whistle-blower Sherron Smith Watkins, who warned Lay about accounti=
ng problems. Watkins, 42, who recently became a mother for the first time, =
has a highly developed moral sense and was incredibly courageous. But even =
having the right person in the right place blowing the whistle about the ri=
ght thing won't change a place like Enron that didn't want to change.=20
As we now know, thanks to subpoenaed documents that have become public, Wat=
kins warned Ken Lay last August that the company had inflated its reported =
profits with suspect accounting. Watkins, besieged by interview requests, w=
ouldn't talk to us. But we can reconstruct her story with now public docume=
nts and with information from her lawyer, Phillip Hilder of Houston. Like m=
any of her fellow employees, Watkins, an Enron vice president, was worried =
on Aug. 14 when Enron's chief executive and resident numbers whiz, Jeffrey =
Skilling, abruptly resigned. Watkins, who has a master's degree in accounti=
ng and is a CPA, got a company-wide invitation Lay sent everyone to a meeti=
ng at the Houston Hyatt Regency on Aug. 16. The message also urged employee=
s to send him letters, anonymously if necessary, if they thought there was =
something he should know. Watkins dropped off an anonymous one-page letter =
before the meeting. Lay's speech inspired her. So she wrote a detailed six-=
page letter and gave it to Lay after meeting with him on Aug. 22. It's not =
clear how much Lay knew about Enron's financial shenanigans at the time--al=
though ignorance is no excuse for the chief executive officer.=20
"Ken Lay was professional and concerned, and he promised to investigate," l=
awyer Hilder said, adding that "the company has treated her in a profession=
al manner, and she is still employed there."=20
But what effect did her note have? Not much. As we see from other internal =
documents that have become public, Watkins's letter was turned over to Enro=
n's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, which investigated the charges. The =
firm dispatched a nine-page letter to Enron saying that Watkins's concerns =
did not, "in our judgment, warrant a further widespread investigation by in=
dependent counsel and auditors." The V&E letter hedged, though, by warning =
of public-relations and legal dangers if some of the deals Watkins warned a=
bout became public.=20
The V&E letter was dated Oct. 15. The very next day, Enron revealed that it=
 had lost more than $600 million in the third quarter. That touched off the=
 very meltdown that Watkins had feared.=20
Meanwhile, it turns out, Watkins had aired her concerns with a former Ander=
sen colleague at the Houston office, and asked him for a financial-sanity c=
heck before delivering her letter to Lay. (We know this from an internal An=
dersen memo that's become public.) But no one seems to have done more than =
to create a paper trail that showed their concern. Meanwhile, yet another d=
isclosed document shows that earlier last year, some Andersenians were cons=
idering having the firm drop Enron as a client because Enron's aggressive a=
ccounting was making them nervous. But Andersen kept the account, which bro=
ught in $52 million in 2000 and had the potential to rise much further, tha=
nks to Enron's voracious appetite for consulting services.=20
Andersen is under intense pressure for having certified Enron's bogus numbe=
rs. It's also being investigated for shredding Enron documents. And it fire=
d the head partner on the Enron account two days after he talked to federal=
 investigators. It sure looks like Enron and Andersen--each of which claims=
 to have fired the other--are trying to stick each other with the blame.=20
But even as one part of the federal government is investigating criminal ch=
arges against Andersen for document-shredding, among other things, the FBI =
is relying on Andersen's information-systems expertise. Last summer Anderse=
n undertook the job of reforming the FBI's record-keeping. That was after t=
he FBI admitted losing thousands of documents in the Timothy McVeigh case, =
which briefly delayed his execution. "This study, by a firm of Andersen's c=
aliber, will provide valuable information to enhance the institutional inte=
grity and performance of the FBI," Attorney General John Ashcroft said. And=
ersen's report is due soon.=20
The key to the Enron mess is that the company was allowed to give misleadin=
g financial information to the world for years. Those fictional figures, sh=
owing nicely rising profits, enabled Enron to become the nation's seventh l=
argest company, with $100 billion of annual revenues. Once accurate numbers=
 started coming out in October, thanks to pressure from stockholders, lende=
rs and the previously quiescent SEC, Enron was bankrupt in six weeks. The b=
ottom line: we have to change the rules to make companies deathly afraid of=
 producing dishonest numbers, and we have to make accountants mortally afra=
id of certifying them. Anything else is window dressing.=20

The Great Giveback; Enron's turned a capital pastime upside down: the Beltw=

By Howard Fineman With Eleanor Clift in Washington

The Jefferson is a tiny little hotel, with antiques in the lobby and pillow=
ed nooks in the bar. It's a venue for one of Washington's favorite sports: =
giving and getting campaign contributions. But last Friday Sen. Joe Lieberm=
an and his advisers met there for the opposite reason: to discuss whether h=
e should donate to charity the $13,500 he'd received over the years from En=
ron and its estranged accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. A star Democrat wit=
h his eye on the White House, Lieberman this week launches hearings on the =
Enron collapse and on the Bush crowd's ties to the company. Now the senator=
 is the target of the Republicans' one-word war cry: hypocrisy. "At one lev=
el, giving the money back would be a kind of showboating," he told NEWSWEEK=
. "On the other hand, it might be worth it to eliminate any question of a c=
onflict of interest."=20
Suddenly, giving away is all the rage, and it's not a matter of charity but=
 political survival. Post-Enron Washington is like post-Taliban Kabul: Ever=
yone is shocked, shocked at what was going on in the capital until the tank=
s rolled in, and now everyone is frantically shaving his donor lists. Senat=
ors who are pledging to give away donations--usually to Enron employee vict=
ims' funds--include Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Rodham Cli=
nton and John McCain. Their aim is to buy back the privilege of moral indig=
nation. "No bones about it," McCain told NEWSWEEK. "I'm tainted by it, too.=
"
There was no mea culpa or return-to-sender from President George W. Bush. H=
is aides insisted that they had neither been tainted nor guided by Enron, a=
nd there was no evidence that they had done anything illegal or even unseem=
ly. Still, White House insiders behaved like people with something to hide,=
 and the story was less about the substance of the contacts than their bela=
ted, grudging disclosure to the press.=20
The list was a lengthening one. On Jan. 11, a top administration aide denie=
d that Commerce Secretary Don Evans had told White House officials about En=
ron's shaky finances in October. In fact, Evans admitted Jan. 13, he had to=
ld chief of staff Andy Card. Last week it emerged that economic adviser Lar=
ry Lindsey, formerly a $50,000-a-year consultant to Enron, had conducted a =
study of the company's weak condition. Vice President Dick Cheney acknowled=
ged that he'd touted the cause of an Enron power-plant project supported by=
 Team Bush. Even so, the White House refused to release records of the Chen=
ey Energy Task Force, while insisting it contained no favors for Enron.=20
The White House remained secure in the knowledge that Enron had tried to li=
ne all pockets, not just those in Bush's trousers. Indeed, new evidence eme=
rged daily of the company's almost manic attempts at influence acquisition-=
-from its support of the Houston Olympic Committee to a $50,000 payment to =
Paul Krugman, The New York Times's economic columnist, who disclosed that h=
e'd been paid to serve on an Enron advisory board. Last summer, NEWSWEEK ha=
s learned, Enron paid one of Al Gore's closest allies, fund-raiser Johnny H=
ayes, to lobby Democratic National Committee Chair Terry McAuliffe. The aim=
: to indirectly pressure California Gov. Gray Davis into backing off his at=
tacks on Enron and other out-of-state energy companies. McAuliffe told Haye=
s to get lost. Enron later forked over $100,000 anyway--an apparent attempt=
 to show ties to both parties.=20
Democrats hoped to gain some traction for attacks on the GOP. "This will re=
mind people of where the Republicans' loyalties lie," said poll taker Harri=
son Hickman. Still, not all Democrats seemed eager to lead the charge (the =
most active Hill investigator seemed to be GOP Rep. Billy Tauzin). The real=
 beneficiaries--if any--may only be those who can claim the title of "outsi=
der."=20
The first step toward that sainted status, McCain argues, is to accept the =
Enron mess as proof of the need for campaign-finance reform. His allies in =
the House are two votes short of the 218 they need to force a vote. McCain =
recorded phone-bank calls aimed at swing districts, and his aides recently =
asked Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura to call two "undecideds" in the state. "=
Failure to pass this now will further lower respect for the two-party syste=
m," said McCain, who flirts with running for president as an independent. "=
We're piano players in the House of ill repute." The music may have stopped=
 for Enron, but the band is still playing in town.=20

The Last Word
'Events, Dear Boy, Events'; Enron is not--yet--much of a political scandal,=
 but has many facets awkward for Republicans
By George F. Will

When Harold Macmillan became Britain's prime minister, he was asked what wo=
uld determine his government's course. He replied with Edwardian languor: "=
Events, dear boy, events." As he well knew. An event--the 1956 Suez debacle=
--had catapulted him into 10 Downing Street. An event--the sex-and-spies Pr=
ofumo scandal--would grease the skids under him in 1963.=20
Pesky things, events. As usual, they are in the saddle, riding mankind. The=
y will shape this election year. The first shaping event has happened, in H=
ouston.
Enron's sudden collapse from overdoses of arrogance and villainy has become=
 the second most significant event--second only to September 11--since Geor=
ge W. Bush became president. It is just the sort of event that Republicans =
do not want to raise the curtain on in an election year. It is not like the=
 Credit Mobilier scandal (corrupt contracting in the construction of the Un=
ion Pacific Railroad, 1865-69) or the Teapot Dome scandal (fraudulent leasi=
ng of federal oil reserves), both of which involved malfeasance by people i=
n Washington. Enron is, in a way, worse.=20
Enron is a systemic failure, implicating the range of institutions, from ac=
counting firms to boards of directors, that are designed to justify broad p=
ublic confidence in the functioning of what is supposed to be a mature capi=
talist system--confidence that is increasingly indispensable, given the rap=
idly broadening demographics of stock ownership. (For example, in 1980 less=
 than 6 percent of Americans participated in mutual funds; today more than =
half do.) As an economic scandal--a scandal of behavior in the private sect=
or--it may be the worst in American history. But even though the Enron stor=
y is--so far--not much of a scandal involving the political class, it is ri=
ch in elements potentially awkward for Republicans.=20
It involves Texas. (Anti-Texan stereotyping is a kind of "profiling" that m=
any liberals approve.) It involves a (formerly) big corporation. It involve=
s the fifth (Arthur Andersen) and 12th (Enron) largest givers to the Bush c=
ampaign. It suggests an insufficiency of government regulation relative to =
the quantity of private-sector vice.=20
Enron's prosperity was a bubble produced by trickery and pricked by reality=
. Bush's stratospheric approval ratings, being the result of solid performa=
nce, will not suddenly collapse, but cannot continue. And judging by the th=
umping Republican losses in the two important elections in 2001--they lost =
the New Jersey and Virginia governorships by 14 and 5 points, respectively-=
-his popularity is not transferable. Granted, he did not campaign in either=
 state. But the reason he did not--the war--may inhibit his political campa=
igning this year.=20
In 2000, for the first time since 1952, Democrats failed to win either the =
White House, the House or the Senate. They now control the Senate. Can they=
 capture the House this November?=20
Democrats have gained seats in three consecutive elections. Their three-sea=
t gain in 1996 was not surprising: there was bound to be a corrective rebou=
nd from the 1994 cymbal-crash elections in which Democrats lost 53 seats, e=
nding 40 years of Democratic control of the House. Besides, it was a presid=
ential election year in which the Democratic incumbent coasted to a comfort=
able victory. The continuing rebound from 1994 also helps explain why Democ=
rats gained four seats in 1998--just the second time in 34 elections since =
the Civil War that the party holding the presidency gained House seats in m=
idterm elections. In 2000, Democrats gained one seat.=20
If Democrats gain seats in a fourth consecutive election, it will be only t=
he fourth time a party has done that in the 69 elections since the Civil Wa=
r. (Not since the Depression. Democrats gained in 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1912=
. Republicans gained in 1914, 1916, 1918 and 1920. Democrats gained in 1930=
, 1932, 1934 and 1936.) How likely are they to gain the six seats needed to=
 produce Speaker Dick Gephardt in 2003?=20
Charles Cook, one of the most acute political analysts, notes that Republic=
ans cannot count on benefiting from an impulse to rally around the commande=
r in chief's party during a midterm election. In the only such election dur=
ing World War I (1918, six days before the armistice), President Wilson's D=
emocratic Party lost six Senate seats and 19 House seats--and control of bo=
th houses. In the midterm election during World War II, in 1942, FDR's Demo=
crats lost 45 seats. In the two midterm elections after the escalation in V=
ietnam and before the negotiated de-escalation, Johnson's Democrats lost 47=
 seats in 1966 and Nixon's Republicans lost 12 in 1970.=20
In 1992, the first election after the last redistricting, there was tremend=
ous churning of the House membership: 65 representatives retired and 43 wer=
e defeated. But in 1992 the national mood regarding Congress was unusually =
dyspeptic--remember that year's scandal surrounding members' overdrafts fro=
m the House bank--and the term-limits movement was rapidly gaining strength=
. This year, only 24 House members (16 Republicans, eight Democrats) are re=
tiring, some from politics, others to run for senator or governor.=20
This year, redistricting, by both parties in the states they control, has b=
een, even more than usual, devoted to protecting incumbents. In most cases =
that has meant making safe seats even safer. As a result, says Cook, the nu=
mber of even potentially competitive races in 2002 has shrunk "enormously,"=
 to perhaps 50, of which perhaps only 24--a dozen now held by each party--w=
ill be hotly contested. Perhaps none of California's 53 races will be reall=
y competitive. So for Democrats to gain the six seats necessary for control=
 of the House, "they must win 18 of the 24 closest races, a 75 percent vict=
ory percentage." Cook notes that six is a small number out of 435, but 75 i=
s a very high percentage.=20
Election Day is more than twice as distant from today as September 11 is. W=
hich means there is ample time for the political climate to be conditioned =
by the unexpected. Remember the rule: There are knowns, unknowns and unknow=
n unknowns. The last include events, dear reader, events.=20

Judicial nominee to face questions about Enron contributions

Owen, a Republican, was the author of a unanimous Texas Supreme Court opini=
on in 1996 that settled a tax issue in Enron's favor. The opinion rejected =

Congress's Enron Hearings May Open Way to New Laws
2002-01-23 16:53 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Two congressional committees open h=
earings tomorrow into the collapse of Enron Corp. that may pave the way for=
 new rules affecting investors, accountants and energy traders.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Government Affa=
irs Committee are the first among at least 10 congressional panels to exami=
ne what led to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The probes will incl=
ude testimony on the destruction of documents at Enron and its auditor, Art=
hur Andersen LLP, and the role of executives, accountants, financial analys=
ts and regulators in the company's demise.
     ``It will begin to lay the groundwork,'' said Robert Litan, director o=
f economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``In order for legislation=
 to move forward, there has to be a case made that a fix is needed.''
     Houston-based Enron's bankruptcy on Dec. 2 wiped out $26 billion in ma=
rket value and cost the jobs of thousands of Enron employees, who also lost=
 about $850 million in their company- sponsored pension plans. The hearings=
 are a response to demands by lawmakers and shareholders to find out how th=
at happened.

Washington Sentiment

     President George W. Bush, who got financial backing for his political =
campaigns from Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, expressed the mood preced=
ing the hearings yesterday.
     ``What I'm outraged about is that shareholders and employees didn't kn=
ow all the facts about Enron,'' Bush said in disclosing that his mother-in-=
law, Jenna Welch, lost about $8,100 on her purchase of Enron stock.
     There were similar comments from members of Congress.
     ``What is abundantly apparent is that Enron rather outrageously hid tr=
ansactions of hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Rep. James Greenwood,=
 the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee hold=
ing tomorrow's hearing. ``They did it to make their profits look rosier.''
     Among those the panel wants to hear from tomorrow are Andersen Chief E=
xecutive Joseph Berardino and former Andersen partner David Duncan, who was=
 fired by the company over the destruction of documents relating to its aud=
it of Enron.
     Berardino wants to send an Andersen auditing expert to testify in his =
place. Duncan's lawyer, Robert Giuffra Jr., said his client will invoke his=
 Fifth Amendment right not to answer the committee's questions unless he's =
granted immunity from prosecution.

Potential Evidence

     Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, a Republican from Louisiana, said the=
 panel won't grant immunity without approval from the Justice Department, w=
hich is conducting a criminal investigation into the matter.
     Nancy Temple, an Andersen attorney whose memo on document destruction =
policies is at the center of one aspect of the investigation, and Mike Odom=
, the risk assessment officer for Andersen's Houston office, have agreed to=
 testify.
     Greenwood said his investigation initially would focus on Andersen to =
find out how much potential evidence was destroyed by the auditor between S=
eptember and November. Andersen admitted to purging the documents, mostly e=
-mails to and from Andersen executives.
     Duncan told investigators last week that when he destroyed the files h=
e was following the direction of an Oct. 12 memo from Temple on Andersen's =
document policy. The memo, which the committee released, included a note fr=
om Temple to Odom, whom investigators interviewed on Friday. Andersen has r=
elieved Odom and three other Houston-based partners of management responsib=
ilities.

Enron's Documents

     The shredding wasn't confined to Andersen. A former Enron executive to=
ld ABC News on Monday that she witnessed documents being destroyed as recen=
tly as two weeks ago, in defiance of the company's order in October to pres=
erve documents.
     ``The allegations of continued shredding of documents is a very seriou=
s matter and raises additional questions of obstruction of justice,'' said =
Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the commerce committee.
     Lawmakers have offered a few specific proposals and broad outlines of =
possible changes to laws and regulations. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschl=
e, a South Dakota Democrat, said one outcome of Enron hearings will be legi=
slation to keep accounting firms from acting as consultants to the companie=
s they audit.
     Andersen had such an arrangement with Enron. The firm has said it earn=
ed $52 million in fees from Enron last year, of which $27 million came from=
 non-audit work.

Changing the Law

     ``My personal view is that we ought not to allow a combination of cons=
ulting and accounting,'' Daschle said.
     Democratic Senators Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of=
 New Jersey say they will introduce a bill that would prohibit such relatio=
nships.
     The House commerce committee plans hearings next week on conflicts of =
interest between auditors and their clients, proposals to change accounting=
 rules and the workings of the energy trading market. Shareholders have acc=
used Enron, which at one point handled a quarter of the trading in natural =
gas and electricity, of hiding its liabilities in trades.
     Lawmakers also will question Wall Street analysts who kept ``strong bu=
y'' ratings on Enron until the company publicly disclosed the extent of its=
 troubles in November.
     Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the S=
enate Government Affairs panel, said he intends a months- long inquiry into=
 Enron starting with a look at how accountants, financial analysts and regu=
lators failed to issue warnings or prevent Enron's failure.

`Legislative Fix'

     Among those who'll be testifying are former Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. He has said he will tell the committee =
to support legislation to give the SEC more control over U.S. accounting st=
andards.
     ``The power to change it could come from the Congress, it could come f=
rom the SEC with a rulemaking, but I think this one calls for a legislative=
 fix,'' Levitt said last week.
     The committee also is examining the regulatory authority of the Federa=
l Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commissi=
on that governed Enron's energy production and trading businesses.
     The Senate committee will examine whether tighter regulations for trad=
itional pension plans should be applied to 401(K) retirement funds.

State GOP sends $15,000 Enron contribution to employees' fund

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's Republican State Committee has donated a $15=
,000 contribution from the Enron Corp. to a Houston-based fund created to a=
id employees of the failed energy giant, a party official said Wednesday.=
=20
"We thought it was the right thing to do - to stand by the families," said =
Patrick McCarthy, the state party's executive director, of the Enron donati=
on the state party had received on Oct. 12.
The state GOP's contribution last week to the Enron employees' fund was fir=
st reported Wednesday by the New York Post.=20
Also, an aide to Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednes=
day that the former federal housing secretary had donated a $1,000 Enron co=
ntribution to the employees' fund last week. He had received it on June 21.=
=20
Campaign financial filings with the state Board of Elections also show that=
 state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican,=
 received $1,000 from Enron in 1999 and that state Sen. James Wright, a Wat=
ertown Republican, got a $1,000 donation from the company in March of last =
year. Aides to both senators said Wednesday that those contributions would =
be donated to the employees' fund.=20
The political action committee of the Independent Power Producers of New Yo=
rk received a $2,000 Enron donation in May of last year, the records show.=
=20
Gavin Donohue, the IPP's executive director, said he would recommend to the=
 group's board of directors next week that the money be donated to the fund=
. He said he expected the board to agree.=20
"It is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it," Donohue said.=
=20
New York politicians have been joining others from across the country sendi=
ng donations from Enron or its top executives and their relatives to the em=
ployees' fund in recent days. Thousands of Enron employees were laid off in=
 the wake of the company's collapse last month.=20
Last week, Republican Gov. George Pataki donated to the fund an Aug. 1, $5,=
000 contribution from the wife of Enron chief Kenneth Lay. Pataki spokesman=
 Michael McKeon said Wednesday that the governor had also sent a $1,000 con=
tribution to the fund last week that his campaign committee had received fr=
om Enron in April of 2000.=20
Also last week, New York's two Democratic U.S. senators, Charles Schumer an=
d Hillary Rodham Clinton, sent $68,857 and $7,950, respectively, to the fun=
d stemming from Enron-connected donations they had received.=20
Cuomo's main rival for the Democratic nomination for governor, state Comptr=
oller H. Carl McCall, has not received any recent Enron-related contributio=
ns. The state's more than $112 billion public pension fund, of which McCall=
 is sole trustee, did lose about $58 million in the Enron collapse. That is=
 much less than Enron losses suffered by some other major state public pens=
ion funds.

ANNOUNCER: Tonight on LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE, we report on Enron`s collapse an=
d the unfolding scandal from the epicenter, Houston, Texas.=20
Jeff Bezos` promise to profit and he delivered. The man who runs Amazon.com=
 (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) tells us how his company discovered success =
the old-fashioned way.
Talk Magazine silenced after two and a half years. Editor Tina Brown tells =
us why what looked like success ended in failure.=20
And tensions in the Middle East rise. We report from Jerusalem. This is a s=
pecial edition of Lou Dobbs MONEYLINE for Tuesday, January 22nd LIVE FROM H=
OUSTON TEXAS, Lou Dobbs.=20
LOU DOBBS, CNNfn ANCHOR, LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE: Good evening everyone.=20
I`m sitting in front of Enron`s headquarters in Houston, Texas. Tonight thi=
s company`s troubles are continuing to mount. The FBI today entered the Enr=
on building, looking into charges that Enron employees have been shredding =
documents related to the phenomenal collapse of the company.=20
Tomorrow, a Federal judge will decide whether Enron has to turn over any an=
d all documents that pertain to its collapse, this after an Enron employee =
said Enron workers were shredding papers as late as last week, despite orde=
rs not to do so. Ed Lavandera has the story. Ed.=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, it`s been a rather revealing 24=
 hours in Houston, as late yesterday details started to emerge as attorneys=
 arrived here in Houston for a pre-trial hearing involving Enron, Andersen,=
 and several high profile investors who have invested heavily into Enron.=
=20
And when those attorneys arrived into town, we started hearing the details =
that these attorneys were alleging that they have four or five witnesses in=
side Enron, who say that since Thanksgiving they have seen shredding of doc=
uments inside the finance and accounting departments inside of Enron on the=
 19th and 20th floors. They say that this has happened steadily and lasted =
up until last week.=20
Now those details emerged when the first witness came through to attorneys.=
 They say that this woman, Marie Castanjera (ph) was working across the hal=
lway from these departments and witnessed this. She went home, used the scr=
aps of paper to pack up her boxes, and when she arrived at home, she notice=
d details on the scraps of paper, the names Raptor and Jedi on several of t=
he scraps of paper, and of course, those are the names that have become inf=
amous in this Enron collapse.=20
Those are the names of the partnerships that led to the company`s demise. E=
nron says that it is investigating this at the moment. They do acknowledge =
that since all of this came to light, that they have found one wastebasket =
inside the building that had shredded documents. Those papers have been tur=
ned over to Federal authorities.=20
Now it`s hard to put a lot of this into context because the only thing we`v=
e been able to see in the last 24 hours is one box of these little scraps o=
f papers, and of course, with everything so shredded, it is hard to put int=
o context as to what these documents were.=20
Attorneys for the Enron investors say they have no idea, quite frankly, wha=
t these papers are, but that it doesn`t matter. That indeed, they say these=
 papers were shredded well after Federal investigators launched their inves=
tigation, and all of these documents should have been subpoenaed, and there=
fore should not have been touched.=20
So, Enron executives putting out another memo to employees worldwide saying=
 that no documents should be shredded or touched in any way, as investigato=
rs across the country lead into this investigation. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Ed, the attorney for Enron, Robert Bennett, Bob Bennett today told m=
e that in point of fact it was he who contacted authorities as soon as they=
 learned of this allegation. Was there any reference today in the hearing a=
s to why the plaintiff`s attorneys did not immediately contact authorities?=
=20
LAVANDERA: Well it`s kind of interesting, Lou, because these attorneys are =
the same people who turned over the Sharon Watkins letter.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
LAVANDERA: One of the attorneys told me last night that they turned over th=
e Sharon Watkins letters to investigators, and they were as a matter of fac=
t that sometimes they wanted to use the publicity to their advantage, that =
their hope is that this will spur and convince other people, who still migh=
t be working inside of Enron, to come forward with more of these allegation=
s, if in fact more people have witnessed this document tampering. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Even in collapse, this contest is still all about money. Ed Lavander=
a, thank you very much.=20
Well charges of shredding documents are incendiary whether it is on Capitol=
 Hill or in the courts. It is not only the crime, the original crime that e=
xcites the interest of investigators, but shredding, the crime of covering =
it up. Tim O`Brien has the report from Washington.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
TIM O`BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It wasn`t the Watergate break-=
in that drove President Richard Nixon from office, as it was his efforts to=
 cover it up. A jury never convicted former White House aide, Oliver North,=
 of the massive arms-for-hostage deal he orchestrated, but rather for shred=
ding documents and obstructing Congress. It wasn`t Bill Clinton`s relations=
hip with Monica Lewinsky that led to his impeachment, as much as it was his=
 lying under oath about it. History shows that it is not the underlying off=
ense that causes trouble, as often as it is efforts to cover it up.=20
David Duncan, the Arthur Andersen auditor who headed up the Enron audit, ha=
s not admitted ordering thousands of Enron-related documents destroyed on O=
ctober 23rd, the day after the SEC launched an inquiry of Enron`s finances.=
=20
The company fired Duncan citing his bad judgment. Duncan says he followed t=
he advice of in-house counsel, but that may not help.=20
PROFESSOR JOHN COFFEE, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: If you either destroy yourself =
or persuade others to destroy, alter, mutilate any document with the intent=
 of making that document unavailable for use in that official proceeding, i=
t`s a Federal felony and there`s not much you can say by way of defense. It=
`s not easy to say, my lawyer told me to do this. That`s not a recognized d=
efense.=20
O`BRIEN: Arthur Andersen did have a policy of routinely shredding documents=
. "Accountants are like packrats," said CEO Joseph Berardino. "We save lots=
 of stuff that`s not relevant."=20
And company lawyer, Nancy Temple, did send a memo out in early October remi=
nding Duncan and other employees of that policy concluding, "it would helpf=
ul to make sure that we have complied with the policy."=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
O`BRIEN (on camera): House investigators have been questioning both Temple =
and Duncan, and Duncan is expected to be called as a witness before the Hou=
se Energy and Commerce Committee this Thursday. His lawyers disclosed tonig=
ht he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. Th=
at is, he`ll speak but only if granted immunity, assurances that nothing he=
 says will be used against him in court. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Tim, thank you very much. Tim O`Brien from Washington. Well, as a ma=
tter of fact President Bush has now been added to the list of people who ar=
e very angry at Enron. One of the President`s own family members, it turns =
out, lost money in the collapse of Enron stock.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My own mother-in-law bought=
 stock last summer and it`s not worth anything now. If she`d have known all=
 the facts, I don`t know what her decision would have been, but she didn`t =
know all the facts, and a lot of shareholders didn`t know all the facts, an=
d that`s wrong. So our government must do something about it, must make sur=
e that the accounting practices that have been going on for quite a while a=
re addressed.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
DOBBS: Well, Jenna Welch, the President`s mother-in law, paid almost $41 a =
share for 200 Enron shares. She sold that stock last month, two days after =
Enron declared bankruptcy, at 42 cents a share. She lost more than $8,000.=
=20
Well focusing on Enron`s off-balance-sheet partnerships that enabled Enron =
to hide massive amounts of debt. Chris Huntington now takes a look at those=
 Enron deals and the executive who set them up.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At the center of Enron`=
s collapse is this man, Andrew Fastow, the company`s former chief financial=
 officer. Until he was fired last October, Fastow designed and carried out =
a sophisticated strategy that expanded Enron`s business, while keeping loss=
es and debt off its books. It was a strategy blessed by Enron`s top brass.=
=20
DAVID BOIES, BOIES, SHILLER & PLEXNER: Those transactions will be transacti=
ons that were reviewed by the Board of Directors of Enron, reviewed by the =
top management of Enron, and which I believe the record will show, the audi=
t committee of the board and the outside auditors had reviewed it as well.=
=20
HUNTINGTON: In 1999, Fastow`s financial wizardry was applauded by analysts =
as groundbreaking and innovative. At the time, CFO Magazine called Enron a =
master of creative financing, and presented Fastow with its annual CFO Exce=
llence award.=20
While Fastow and Enron`s CEO at the time, Jeff Skilling, boasted about Enro=
n`s deals in general terms, they did not divulge all the details. Anyone lo=
oking for answers about Enron`s nearly 6,000 off-balance-sheet transactions=
 in the quarterly or annual reports, found only obscure footnotes.=20
PROFESSION DOUG CARMICHAEL, ACCOUNTING, BARUCH COLLEGE: It`s really impenet=
rable detail in the footnotes. Someone with some understanding of business,=
 should be able to pick up the financial statements, read the notes, and un=
derstand the full effects of those transactions on the financial statement.=
 With Enron, they couldn`t.=20
HUNTINGTON: In August, 2001 Sharon Watkins, an Enron Vice President who rep=
orted to Fastow, wrote her now famous letter to Chairman Ken Lay, expressin=
g her concerns about some of Fastow`s off-balance-sheet deals.=20
According to Enron documents and a letter from Enron`s lawyer, obtained by =
CNN, the transactions worked this way. Fastow set up limited partnerships c=
alled LJM. LJM then set up what are called Special Purpose Entities or S.P.=
E.s. One of them called Raptor was designed to invest in companies on behal=
f of Enron.=20
The structure of the deal required Raptor to pay Enron, even if the investm=
ents soured. But Raptor was essentially delivering an I.O.U. What we do kno=
w now is Raptor`s only significant source of capital was Enron Stock. Enron=
 was using its own stock to pay itself.=20
LYNN TURNER, FORMER CHIEF ACCOUNTANT, SEC: It`s kind of like a money- laund=
ering case. One of the things that is of interest on LJM, one is the fact t=
hat not only the was the debt and the losses kept off the balance sheet by =
putting these transactions in a separate corporation, but it was then used =
to make payments or provide compensation to the CFO.=20
HUNTINGTON: In an extraordinary move, Enron`s Board of Directors waived its=
 conflict of interest rules, allowing Fastow an ownership stake in the part=
nerships, which earned him millions of dollars.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
Enron ultimately had to account for the LJM and Raptor transactions last No=
vember, when it restated earnings going back to 1997. All tolled, those res=
tatements of off-balance-sheet transactions trimmed Enron`s profits by more=
 than $600 million. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Chris, thank you very much. Chris Huntington. The Enron collapse has=
 devastated for now at least the reputation of the nation`s accounting indu=
stry. There are five major accounting firms. James Copeland is the CEO of o=
ne of them, Deloitte & Touche. What can the industry do to restore investor=
 confidence right now in the financial reporting of corporate America?=20
JAMES COPELAND, CEO, DELOITTE & TOUCHE: Lou, I think there are a number of =
things that the financial industry can do in concert with a number of other=
 people. This is, you know, a real financial crisis for not just our indust=
ry but for the shareholders and employees of Enron who have lost, not only =
their jobs, but also have lost their life savings in many cases. There`s co=
llateral damage with respect to the 335,000 auditors in the United States t=
hat go to work every day.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
COPELAND: Try to do a good job, produce 15,000 audits a year where there ar=
e no restatements, where there are no challenges. These people are being ta=
rred with the same brush and that`s a tragedy as well.=20
DOBBS: Tarred with the same brush and now a number of recommendations, almo=
st instantaneously. Harvey Pitt at the SEC comes forward with his recommend=
ations, which have created some controversy, both in terms of its timing an=
d, if you will, the lack of commitment behind those proposals in they eyes =
of some.=20
Senator Barbara Boxer says "take accounting firms and eliminate the consult=
ing fees from their business, divest it, go back to the business you`re bes=
t at and that`s auditing." What do you think?=20
COPELAND: Well, I think that Senator Boxer`s comments and the proposed bill=
 is going to generate a debate that really needs to be held. There is a lot=
 more heat around this issue than there is light right now, and we really d=
o need to debate the issues.=20
Everyone is looking for an answer to a very complex problem, and unfortunat=
ely, you know, we all tend to want to move to simplistic answers. Sometimes=
 a simplistic answer is the right one. Oftentimes, what you end up with are=
 unintended consequences that are worse than the original problem.=20
So I think we need to be very careful, very prudent. We need to put everyth=
ing on the table and talk about all of the potential problems and opportuni=
ties and then make some very good, very careful decisions.=20
DOBBS: I know that you probably won`t like this aphorism, but the essence o=
f genius is simplicity itself. It is certainly something that can not be sa=
id of the accounting system, the financial system in any way.=20
But if you, James Copeland, were to look and perhaps you have at the annual=
 report of Enron for the year 2000, do you think you, one of the best minds=
 in accounting and audit, would know, have any suspicion of these secret pa=
rtnerships, and I say secret advisedly, and the huge number of off-shore ta=
x havens that Enron had in its structure?=20
COPELAND: I think some of my partners are probably laughing right now about=
 my being one of the best accounting and auditing minds in our profession, =
but.=20
DOBBS: Just go with it, James.=20
COPELAND: I would say that to your point, I believe, the complexity of Enro=
n and many other companies` financial statements, really is getting to a po=
int where they`re very, very hard to understand for all of us, even for exp=
erts in the area. But at the same time, you know, making the complex simple=
 is a real challenge.=20
DOBBS: A real challenge, and certainly no one would be more aware of that t=
han you. The fact of the matter is that we have reached a stage where the e=
ssence of this country`s financial system, its transparency and its securit=
ies markets and its business dealings is, if not already jeopardized and al=
ready perhaps overtaken by complex tax and accounting laws, we are also at =
risk of losing faith in the system itself. We`re as appalled over these mar=
kets right now, cast in the instance for example of Kmart, in which credit =
standards are rising simply because of the Enron experience. This has to co=
ncern you.=20
COPELAND: It concerns me a lot. One of the things that concerns me most is =
that we come up with two or three simple answers that sound good. We all ce=
lebrate, go home, and 18 months later you have another body on the table, s=
o to speak.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
COPELAND: And you know, then what happens to the credibility of the system?=
 We need to quit trying to polish the hood. We have a problem with the engi=
ne, you know, and we need to really get our dirt under our fingernails, wor=
k hard on the things that will really make a difference in the financial re=
porting system.=20
DOBBS: OK. James Copeland, we thank you for taking the time to be with us a=
nd we know you`ll be part of the solution.=20
COPELAND: I hope so.=20
DOBBS: James Copeland, Deloitte & Touche.=20
COPELAND: Thanks very much, Lou.=20
DOBBS: We hope you`ll join us tonight at 8:00 Eastern for a one-hour specia=
l on the rise and the fall of Enron. We`ll be live here in Houston. We`ll b=

On Wall Street today, stocks weaker despite positive earnings news form Ama=

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
DOBBS: Kmart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) in business for more than 100 yea=
rs, today filed for bankruptcy. It is the biggest bankruptcy every in the r=
etailing industry. One reason, suppliers were cutting off their products be=
cause Kmart couldn`t make its payments. And with the collapse of Enron, inc=
reasingly companies are demanding prompt payment for their goods and servic=
es. Kitty Pilgrim reports.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Kmart is keeping all 2,114=
 stores=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DOBBS: Just ahead here, Enron`s collapse has highlighted the vulnerability =
of many retirement plans unfortunately. When we come back, we`ll take a loo=
k at what you can do to protect your retirement savings.=20
The Enron debacle has led to the collapse of thousands of 401(k) accounts h=
eld by Enron employees. The collapse provoked a debate about investment reg=
ulations that could prove precedent setting. At the very core of the debate=
: Does the federal government have any business telling you how to invest y=
our own retirement money?=20
Peter Viles reports.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You`ve heard about all the E=
nron employees who loaded up on the company stock in their retirement accou=
nts and lost nearly everything.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you`ve almost been raped.=20
VILES: You`ve heard the Bush administration says it`s studying the 401(k) r=
ules, with an eye toward protecting your retirement money.=20
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the public is very unea=
sy about their pensions. The public wants to know if what happened to Enron=
 can happen to them. The president wants to make sure that any action is ta=
ken so that others can be protected so that it does not happen to them.=20
VILES: Considering it`s a creation of the IRS, the 401(k) is quite simple. =
First off, it is optional. Your employer is not required to offer a 401(k) =
plan and you`re not required to participate. The employer has the option of=
 putting its money or stock into your account, but on the employer`s terms.=
 And there are no government guarantees or insurance on the money itself. I=
t is yours to invest.=20
DAVID RAY, 401(K) PROFIT SHARING ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA: It is not a define=
d benefit plan. There are not guarantees. It`s not a program where promises=
 about future benefits are made. It`s about setting money aside, investing =
that money and then using those contributions and returns as your retiremen=
t income.=20
VILES: Lastly, the employer does have the right to lock up the plan tempora=
rily to switch administrators. The 10-day lockup at Enron is not considered=
 to be unusually long. So how might Washington protect your 401(k)?=20
Senator Jon Corzine wants mandatory diversity. The government would prevent=
 you from putting more than 20 percent of your account into any one stock. =
But do you really want the government telling you how to invest your money?=
=20
MICHAEL HOLLAND, HOLLAND & CO.: When we start getting lawyers and politicia=
ns telling us where we can invest our 401(k)s, I think it should send shudd=
ers up the spines of individual investors.=20
VILES: Corzine`s argument is that the government sponsors 401(k)s by deferr=
ing taxes, so it has an obligation to regulate them.=20
SEN. JOHN CORZINE (D), NEW JERSEY: It is out of bounds for the federal gove=
rnment to be sponsoring a policy that doesn`t fit together with what any in=
vestment adviser, any reasonable investment strategy coming out of academia=
 or simple commonsense principals that don`t put all your eggs in one baske=
t.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
VILES (on camera): Well, wait, does that phrase resonate here in Houston, w=
here a lot of people wish they had a lot fewer eggs in that one basket of E=
nron stock? Total losses by Enron employees in their 401(k)s alone on Enron=
 stock, estimated at over $1 billion -- Lou.=20
DOBBS: Well, it`s a terrific point. The fact is these 401(k)s are not requi=
red by the companies. It`s become, if you will, fashionable and employees r=
ely upon them. And it puts in stark contrast here, Enron so much it can be =
accused of, the fact is the 401(k), which it contributed, is probably a rea=
son to cut them a little slack there.=20
VILES: Yes, a lot of the stock in those accounts was stock that Enron gave =
the employees. It was a gift that ultimately became worthless, but it was a=
 gift in the first place.=20
DOBBS: OK. Thank you very much, Peter Viles.=20
Coming up next here, another victim of the slumping economy. Two-and-a-half=
 years after Talk Magazine roared into existence, the glossy magazine has f=
