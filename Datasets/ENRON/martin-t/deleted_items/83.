As some current and former Enron Corp. officials try to distance themselves=
 from controversial partnerships that played a role in the company's demise=
, internal Enron documents show top management and directors viewed the par=
tnerships as integral to maintaining the energy-trading giant's rapid growt=
h in recent years.=20
The documents also reinforce the notion that top Enron officials, including=
 Chairman Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling, were directly =
involved in the creation and oversight of the partnerships, which were run =
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Questions about the partne=
rships in recent months contributed to a collapse in investor confidence in=
 the Houston-based company, which just a year ago had a market capitalizati=
on of over $60 billion. Enron filed last month for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-co=
urt protection, which shields the company from creditors while it seeks to =
reorganize.
An Enron spokeswoman said the company didn't have any comment on the docume=
nts. Among these are an internal memorandum from an Enron attorney to Mr. S=
killing regarding procedures for monitoring transactions with the partnersh=
ips. The documents also include excerpts of minutes from meetings of Enron'=
s board and the board's finance committee.=20
Enron and Mr. Lay have consistently said that the company's dealings with t=
he partnerships, which involved joint investments as well as asset sales, w=
ere aimed at helping the company, were carefully reviewed to prevent confli=
cts of interest and were adequately disclosed. The partnership dealings are=
 the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission probe and are being lo=
oked into by Congress.=20
The Enron documents indicate that in mid-1999 the company began using the p=
artnerships to confront changing business conditions.=20
A document excerpting a June 1999 board meeting cited Mr. Skilling as sayin=
g that because of changing accounting rules affecting off-balance-sheet tra=
nsactions, Enron had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. Though=
 the document doesn't provide further explanation, the statement would appe=
ar to be a reference to a concern at Enron about trying to keep as much deb=
t as possible off the company's balance sheet. Too much debt lowers a compa=
ny's credit rating, which was a particular worry for Enron, whose vast ener=
gy-trading operations relied heavily on its credit standing.=20
In the June 1999 document, Messrs. Lay and Skilling were identified as bein=
g designated by Enron's board to help ensure that the company received fair=
 consideration in one of the early partnership deals.=20
A draft version of minutes from an October 2000 meeting of the Enron board =
finance committee cites Mr. Fastow speaking of the need for outside private=
 partnerships to help manage the company's finances so that Enron could "co=
ntinue to grow." Enron planned to continue making "significant capital inve=
stments. . . . some of which would not generate cash flow or earnings for a=
 number of years," the document said.=20
Out of such needs were born in 1999 the so-called LJM partnerships, which w=
ere run by Mr. Fastow. The Enron documents show that an early transaction i=
nvolved the hedging of the value of an Enron investment in Rhythms NetConne=
ctions Inc., a data-communications company. According to one document, Mr. =
Fastow discussed how Enron could protect the value of that holding through =
a complicated swap arrangement that also involved Enron stock and a $50 mil=
lion LJM payment.=20
In a filing last November with the SEC, Enron said that it had incorrectly =
accounted for the Rhythms/LJM transaction. As a result, Enron retroactively=
 reduced its reported net income for 1999 and 2000 by about $100 million, o=
r around 5%.=20
The internal documents show that the board and top management were aware of=
 the possible conflicts of interests in having Enron's chief financial offi=
cer running partnerships that eventually did hundreds of millions of dollar=
s of business with the company. One document, labeled as part of a June 199=
9 presentation to Enron's board, also laid out the huge profit potential in=
 Mr. Fastow's partnership compensation formula, under which he stood to rea=
p as much as half of partnership profits in addition to management fees. En=
ron has estimated that Mr. Fastow made over $30 million from his partnershi=
p activities.=20
To avoid potential conflicts of interests on Mr. Fastow's part, Enron set u=
p a review procedure for any Enron deals with the partnerships. Among other=
 things, all transactions had to be approved by Mr. Skilling and two other =
senior Enron officials, according to one of the company documents.=20
In interviews with several media organizations last month, Mr. Skilling, wh=
o resigned as Enron's president and chief executive officer in August, indi=
cated that he wasn't fully aware of all the LJM-related dealings and was al=
so surprised by the size of Mr. Fastow's partnership remuneration. Yesterda=
y, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said that while he was familiar with the =
structure of the LJM partnerships, "he wasn't aware of or intimately involv=
ed with details" of particular transactions. Those matters were "handled at=
 a lower level" of the company, she added.=20
Mr. Fastow couldn't be reached for comment. But a Fastow attorney has previ=
ously pointed to Enron statements that all the LJM transactions were proper=
 and approved by the board and top management.

Humbled Enron tries to save core business --- Accounting practices thrust i=
nto spotlight
Kristen Hays, Associated Press
01/02/2002

A humbled Enron Corp. will enter 2002 with hopes of emerging from bankruptc=
y with a viable trading business, once the source of 90 per cent of its rev=
enues.=20
The once-mighty energy titan came crashing down with dizzying speed in 2001=
 after investors lost confidence in the accounting behind its core operatio=
ns.
The company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n, the House or Representatives energy and commerce committee and the justi=
ce department.=20
On Jan. 10, an auction will be held of 51 per cent of Enron's wholesale ene=
rgy trading operation. Some Wall Street insiders say bids could be as high =
as $1 billion (U.S.) for the joint venture Enron has been trying to put tog=
ether, enabling it to revive its oil, natural gas and electricity trading b=
usiness.=20
Enron was born in 1985 when Houston Natural Gas merged with InterNorth, a n=
atural gas company based in Omaha, Neb. In 1989, Enron started trading natu=
ral gas commodities and eventually became the world's largest buyer and sel=
ler of natural gas.=20
Later it gained fame by pioneering trading markets in such commodities as w=
eather derivatives, telecommunications transmission capacity, pulp, paper a=
nd plastics. But some of these units and overseas investments consistently =
lost money.=20
The company buried those losses in its profitable trading business and turn=
ed to off-balance-sheet financing vehicles to keep burgeoning debt off its =
books.=20
But eventually, the debt and bad investments couldn't be hidden.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron acknowledged $618 million (U.S.) in third-quarter losses,=
 took a $1 billion charge for losses on bad investments and cut $1.2 billio=
n in shareholders' equity.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy in New York Dec. 2 to keep creditors and lawsuit=
s at bay so the company could try to preserve its trading operation. Money-=
losing assets went up for sale.=20
Credit rating agencies have promised closer scrutiny of off-balance-sheet f=
inancing.=20
"Enron is an animal all its own," said Credit Lyonnais analyst Gordon Howal=
d. "A lot of companies have not handled their finances as aggressively as E=
nron has. But one of the fallouts of Enron is that companies are going to h=
ave to disclose a lot more than they have in the past."

How Enron concealed losses, inflated earnings--and hid secret deals from th=
e authorities. Are criminal charges next?=20
Enron Corp.'s spectacular collapse may have shocked employees and investors=
, who lost tens of billions of dollars. Could it have been a surprise to it=
s top executives or its auditors, Arthur Andersen? The complex side bets an=
d partnerships Enron used left it extremely vulnerable to a drop in its sto=
ck price, its bond rating or the value of fiber-optic lines. The plunge of =
all three doomed the company.
This much is apparent from some internal company documents leaked to FORBES=
: As early as March 2001 the elaborate network of external partnerships Enr=
on used to hedge against declining values of its assets was starting to mel=
t down. Even as former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and Chairman Kennet=
h Lay were selling millions of dollars' worth of shares last spring, an arm=
y of lawyers and accountants was shuttling money among partnerships to fore=
stall disaster. They couldn't. Finally, in November, Lay admitted Enron had=
 taken $710 million in losses to unwind the partnerships.=20
Enron refuses to discuss the workings of these partnerships, beyond the sca=
nty disclosures in the recent 10-Q filed with the Securities & Exchange Com=
mission. But documents laying out how some of the partnerships worked show =
an ingenious structure designed by Enron's former chief financial officer, =
Andrew Fastow. The idea was to use the value of Enron's rising stock price =
to finance a welter of corporations that magically turned balance-sheet los=
ses into gains on Enron's income statement. One round of partnerships forme=
d last year hedged nearly $2 billion in Enron assets.=20
The partnerships were originally designed to comply with regulation 140 of =
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The rule lets companies move fina=
ncial assets off their balance sheets if they are put into entities that ar=
e completely out of the control of the parent company. But Enron skirted th=
e law by having the partnerships issue put options--obligations to buy some=
thing in the future at a specified price--on assets that were still on Enro=
n's books.=20
"It's like somebody sat down with the rules and said, 'How can we get aroun=
d them?'" says Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch Colleg=
e in Manhattan. "They structured these things to comply with the letter of =
the law but totally violated the spirit."=20
Only Enron knows how many such partnerships exist. Carol Coale, an analyst =
with Prudential Securities in Houston, has identified over 3,000 subsidiari=
es and partnerships, many of them off-balance-sheet entities. Several were =
designed to "monetize" assets--sell them to a party unlikely to question th=
e value Enron put on them. Some deals require a complete suspension of disb=
elief.=20
In June 2000, for example, Enron sold $100 million worth of "dark fiber," o=
r fiber-optic cables without the electronic gear necessary to transmit digi=
tized information. The "buyer" was a partnership run by Fastow called LJM2 =
(the acronym reportedly comes from the initials of his wife and children), =
set up in 1999 to trade assets with Enron. On that deal, Enron booked a $67=
 million profit, a significant piece of the $318 million gross profit the c=
ompany reported for the broadband business in 2000. LJM2 later sold $40 mil=
lion of the dark fiber to what Enron refers to as "industry participants," =
and the remainder to another Enron-related partnership for $113 million in =
December. What's curious is that the value of the fiber ostensibly increase=
d 53% between June and December--during the same time that, in open markets=
 at least, the value of dark fiber plunged by 67%. LJM2 reaped a $2.4 milli=
on profit from the fiber trade, contributing to the $30 million of undisclo=
sed gains the LJM partnerships delivered to Fastow, according to Enron.=20

Shouldn't Enron's top management or its auditors have sought the identity o=
f the buyers who so overpaid for the fiber asset? One wonders. And where, b=
y the way, was all this fiber? That $100 million, say a fiber broker and an=
 industry analyst, would have bought at least 33,000 miles of single-strand=
 dark fiber in June 2000--enough to string up three nationwide networks--an=
d considerably more by December. Enron's entire network, presumably consist=
ing of multiple strands, was 18,000 miles at the time, with much of that fi=
ber leased.=20
The deal went undisclosed at a time when Skilling and Lay were talking up t=
he great prospects for Enron's broadband business. There's something else t=
hey neglected to mention. Enron provided what its current 10-Q calls "credi=
t support" to the ultimate buyer, guaranteeing the debt. But if the partner=
ship defaulted, Enron was on the hook for $61 million of the $67 million it=
 booked as profits. Former employees say Enron's broadband business consist=
ed largely of such questionable deals. To win a $20 million broadband servi=
ces contract from Rice University in Houston, for example, Enron donated $5=
 million to the school, and Ken Lay's personal foundation kicked in another=
 $3 million. Unreported was the fact that Rice dropped the contract soon af=
ter.=20
The fiber deal finally came to light more than a year after it closed--in E=
nron's 10-Q for the third quarter of 2001. Some of the most exotic deals re=
main hidden in the files at Enron and its co-investors, files that disclose=
 a welter of Delaware partnerships that Fastow formed in 2000 among Enron, =
LJM2 and the so-called Raptor partnerships, which included trusts, limited =
liability corporations and other entities through which cash, stock and der=
ivatives cascaded.=20
Code-named after Southwestern animals, these "special-purpose entities" wer=
e curious beasts indeed. One of them, Bobcat, was capitalized with 6.3 mill=
ion shares of Enron stock whose value was protected by a six-month put opti=
on, expiring in mid-March of 2001, which Bobcat bought from Enron. The put =
obligated Enron to buy its shares back at $68 each. Bobcat in turn sold put=
s back to Enron, protecting it from declines in the value of various assets=
.=20
One of the weirdest aspects of these fancy derivatives: When an asset decli=
ned in value, Enron was sometimes able to avoid booking the paper loss on t=
he asset at the same time that it immediately counted the payout on the pro=
tective put as income. Pure alchemy: Bad investments become profits on the =
income statement.=20
When Enron was trading at $80, Bobcat and its cubmates worked like magic. A=
ny losses on derivatives sold to Enron were offset by an increase in the va=
lue of their Enron stock. But as Enron shares fell below $68 in mid-March 2=
001, Raptor deals started to fall apart. While Enron declines to comment on=
 what happened next, present and former employees describe a mad scramble a=
s the company tried to keep the elaborate structure Fastow created. Solvent=
 partnerships had to prop up failing ones, while Enron executives continued=
 to bail out of their employer's stock. Enron ultimately was forced to admi=
t that Fastow's safety net had failed. The $532 million in hedging gains ge=
nerated by the Raptors was wiped out by $710 million in losses created by t=
heir collapse.=20
At what point did Enron's top executives realize Fastow's edifice was crumb=
ling? SEC attorneys are surely trying to find out.=20
Pleading ignorance, as Andersen did before Congress, may not work. Market d=
ata about falling values for international power plants and dark fiber was =
readily available throughout the period Enron executives were reporting inf=
lated values and selling some $1 billion in stock. That type of information=
 can be used to establish that insiders sold stock knowing it was overvalue=
d, says Jacob Frenkel, a defense lawyer with Smith, Gambrell & Russell in W=
ashington, D.C. and a former SEC enforcement attorney. "If you intentionall=
y choose to be ignorant," he says, "that can satisfy the question of crimin=
al intent."=20

This isn't how it was supposed to work. After Enron declared bankruptcy in =
early December, the other "energy merchants"--Wall Street's name for compan=
ies like Dynegy, Calpine, and Mirant that are engaged in new businesses suc=
h as trading power and building unregulated plants--disclaimed any sort of =
Enronesque behavior. They also downplayed the aftershocks, reiterating prom=
ises of big earnings growth and at times discussing how Enron's downfall wo=
uld actually benefit them.=20
Benefit? Not quite. Some of the "not-Enrons" have suffered huge stock price=
 declines, with Mirant, the worst performer, losing 43% since late November=
. And many have had to revamp their balance sheets. First came El Paso, whi=
ch on Dec. 12 announced plans to sell more than $2 billion of assets, raise=
 money in the equity market, and cut capital expenditures. A few days later=
 Dynegy followed suit. Then came Williams, and finally, on Dec. 19, Mirant =
joined the better- balance-sheet movement. Unfortunately this newfound reli=
gion hasn't always satisfied the suddenly suspicious credit rating agencies=
. Most notably, Moody's downgraded Mirant's debt to junk status.
Though none have proven themselves to be Enrons yet, the energy merchants d=
o deserve some of this bad rap. They all have huge piles of debt, and like =
Enron (and the dot-coms before that), they need the continued cooperation o=
f the capital markets to fund their business plans. Last year widespread fe=
ars of an energy shortage caused people to throw money at new power plants.=
 And the spiking prices and massive volatility caused in large part by the =
California crisis created big profit opportunities for traders. Now people =
are concerned about an energy glut, and prices have fallen sharply. The eff=
ects of all that (plus perhaps tougher accounting rules) on profits remain =
unclear.=20
Believers in the energy merchants insist that a healthier--albeit slower-gr=
owth--industry will emerge from this. "Long-term prospects appear excellent=
," wrote Goldman analyst David Fleischer in a recent note about Dynegy and =
Williams. "Disarming the shorts!" said UBS Warburg's Ron Barone about El Pa=
so's restructuring plans. (Note that Fleischer and Barone remained big Enro=
n supporters until almost the last gasp.)=20
This Wall Street babble won't amount to much; in the end these companies' p=
rospects depend on the enthusiasm of the markets and flawless execution of =
the restructuring plans. And since those plans rely in large part on asset =
sales, it's worth asking: If everyone is selling, who's buying?

When 401(k)s are KO'd

(Copyright 2002)

Marie Thibaut spent 15 years as an administrative assistant at Enron in Hou=
ston. During that time, she dutifully put 15% of her salary into a 401(k) p=
lan, investing the entire amount in the company's rapidly climbing stock. E=
nron then matched that investment with yet more shares. By the winter of 20=
00, she had amassed close to $500,000 in stock and options, enough for the =
61-year-old divorcee to begin contemplating early retirement. "My children =
told me I should diversify," Thibaut says. "But all the mutual funds were g=
oing down, and I just kept going up." She's not going up any longer. Today,=
 Enron is bankrupt and Thibaut is out of work, a victim of one of the worst=
 corporate collapses in history. Her 401(k) is worth just $22,000.=20
That sorry tale has been repeated thousands of times at Enron, Lucent, Nort=
el, and other companies whose stocks have cratered. But despite the punishi=
ng market and calls for diversification, workers continue to pour a huge po=
rtion of their retirement money into their employer's shares. Benefits cons=
ulting firm Hewitt Associates estimates that as of Oct. 31, almost 30% of t=
he $71 billion in assets in some 1.5 million 401(k) plans were invested in =
the stock of the sponsoring company. At some places the proportion is even =
higher. Microsoft employees keep 46% of their 401(k) funds in company stock=
. At Enron, the figure was 62%. To make matters worse, many of these plans,=
 like Enron's, restrict the sale of stock purchased with matching contribut=
ions until employees are close to retirement.
Now legislators and pension-reform advocates are saying enough is enough. S=
enators Barbara Boxer (D-California) and Jon Corzine (D-New Jersey) are spo=
nsoring a bill that would force diversification by prohibiting any one stoc=
k from making up more than 20% of a 401(k), reducing the tax breaks for com=
panies that match 401(k) contributions with stock, and limiting to 90 days =
the period a company can force employees to hold matching stock. Senator Je=
ff Bingaman (D-New Mexico) also wants to allow companies to provide employe=
es with investment advice without penalty. (Current law makes a company lia=
ble for employees' investment decisions if it offers advice, and as a resul=
t, few do.)=20
The legislation won't necessarily pass without a fight. When Senator Boxer =
attempted to pass a similar bill in 1996, lobbyists-- particularly those fr=
om option-reliant Silicon Valley--succeeded in watering her proposal down t=
o the point where it simply barred companies from forcing employees to inve=
st more than 10% of their own contributions in company stock. There's also =
the issue of companies matching 401(k) contributions with stock. Andrew Lia=
zos, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery, says if this practice is rest=
ricted, many companies may simply provide no match at all. Plus, he asks, i=
sn't telling employees what to do with their retirement funds a bit paterna=
listic?=20
Pension-reform advocates say a little paternalism is just what is needed. "=
It's unrealistic to think that without a new law employees will limit the a=
mount of company stock they buy," says Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer who is su=
ing Enron and its accountants on behalf of its 401(k) participants. Given w=
hat's happened at Enron, it'll be hard to counter that argument this time a=
round.=20

First; Value Driven
The Boardroom Follies: In which we meet the non-stockholders, non- attender=
s, and nonagenarians still among America's corporate directors.

The corporate disaster count seems to be going up, and it's worth asking wh=
y. Not that we can tally these things precisely, but think of just the past=
 few months: Enron, the biggest bankruptcy in history, with over $50 billio=
n of shareholder wealth vaporized; Warnaco, another former highflier, with =
shares that now cost less than a Snickers bar; the U.S. steel industry, whi=
ch has finally thrown in the towel and admitted it can't survive on its own=
. Among slightly longer-running disasters, Lucent and Nortel have actually =
destroyed far more shareholder wealth than Enron, and Xerox isn't far behin=
d--but they've been pushed out of the headlines.=20
What went wrong? These are all man-made disasters, and when you search for =
the people to blame, you end up quickly at the board of directors. Somewher=
e around the last recession (1990-91) it dawned on America's shareholders t=
hat when something goes hugely wrong at a company, the buck stops at the bo=
ard. Thus began a great campaign, still going strong, to improve corporate =
governance. Its cause is noble, and it has won a lot of victories.
And yet the corporate-governance follies carry on with a surprising amount =
of vim. To see just how much, stop by a terrific Website at www.thecorporat=
elibrary.com. For our purposes you'll have to bypass the section that gives=
 you the full text of the employment contracts of hundreds of major CEOs, t=
hough I recommend that you check that out later. Right now we're concerned =
with the state of America's boards, and so we arrive at the site's director=
 screening tool, which answers all kinds of interesting questions about the=
 directors of 1,500 companies.=20
One of the major problems with directors of public companies is that they s=
ometimes don't own much of the company's stock. Odds are strong they'd try =
a lot harder if a significant amount of their own money were at stake. So I=
 asked how many directors owned no stock at all in the companies they direc=
ted. Answer: 963--and the director screening tool gives you all their names=
. For example, did you know that Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs owns no shar=
es of Gap, though he's on the board?=20
Another problem: too many inside directors. Virtually every board will incl=
ude the CEO, which makes sense, and maybe the COO if that person is in line=
 to run the show. More insiders than that can give the CEO too much power o=
ver a group that is supposedly the shareholders' independent guardian. So I=
 asked how many inside directors are on those 1,500 boards. Answer: 4,218, =
or about three per board. Not bad, but what's interesting is the details. T=
he major company with the most inside directors seems to be American Intern=
ational Group, the world's most valuable insurance conglomerate, with nine.=
 You can find plenty of others with seven or eight.=20
Directors who don't go to board meetings aren't worth much, so I asked how =
many directors missed at least 25% of the meetings in the past year. The an=
swer is 271, including many big-deal CEOs who gave short shrift to their ou=
tside boards, such as American Express' Ken Chenault, PepsiCo's Roger Enric=
o, Oracle's Larry Ellison, and News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch.=20
Just for fun, I asked if there were any triple-threat directors: insiders w=
ho owned no shares and had attendance problems, even though the board meeti=
ngs were presumably just down the hall. There were three. You've never hear=
d of them, believe me.=20
I couldn't resist asking one other question: How many directors are over 90=
? Answer: nine. America's oldest director appears to be George E. Kane, 96,=
 who was just reelected to a three-year term at Panera Bread, which operate=
s bakery cafes around the U.S. This Strom Thurmond of corporate America ser=
ves on the board's audit and nominating committees, and was on the compensa=
tion committee until this year. Unlike Strom, he has not promised he won't =
run again.=20
I'd love to tell you things were getting better in the boardroom. By certai=
n gross measures they clearly are. Investors are far more interested in dir=
ectors than they used to be. Many companies are adopting excellent new poli=
cies on important matters such as mandatory levels of stock ownership and m=
andatory retirement ages for directors. Fed-up investors are flexing their =
muscles far more effectively than before, forcing companies to abandon clas=
sified boards--on which only a fraction of the directors are up for electio=
n in any given year--and other devices that entrench management at the expe=
nse of shareholders.That's all terrific news.=20
But the more important question is, Are boards getting better as fast as th=
e world is getting tougher? Just barely. We should all support the good-gov=
ernance campaign of the past decade. What matters most about corporate gove=
rnance, though, is not whether it's good, but whether it's good enough. Unt=
il the disaster count starts coming down, it isn't.

Features/Accounting In Crisis

Where were the auditors? People ask that question after every corporate col=
lapse, and lately they've been asking it with disturbing frequency. At Wast=
e Management, Sunbeam, Rite Aid, Xerox, and Lucent, major accounting firms =
either missed or ignored serious problems. The number of public companies t=
hat have corrected or restated earnings since 1998 has doubled to 233, acco=
rding to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Now, followin=
g the stunning bankruptcy of Andersen's own client Enron, that question--wh=
ere were the auditors?--has become a deafening refrain. "I believe that the=
re is a crisis of confidence in my profession," Andersen CEO Joseph Berardi=
no told a congressional committee investigating Enron's collapse in mid-Dec=
ember. "Real change will be required to regain the public trust."=20
The full story of the Enron debacle--and what Andersen did or did not do in=
 its audit--will take months to emerge. In the meantime, no one disagrees w=
ith Berardino's diagnosis that there's a crisis in accounting--even if his =
sudden emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect att=
ention from Andersen's own culpability. But the kind of "real change" requi=
red is a matter of substantial debate. The government gave the franchise of=
 auditing public companies' financial statements to the accounting industry=
 after the 1929 stock market crash. In the decades since, the accountants h=
ave adroitly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they=
 can police themselves. Now, post-Enron, they're doing it again. The Big Fi=
ve CEOs issued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strength=
en financial reporting and auditing standards. "Self-regulation is right fo=
r investors, the profession, and the financial markets," the release conclu=
des.
But is it? Accounting's main self-regulatory body, the Public Oversight Boa=
rd, is a monument to the profession's failures. The POB was created in the =
late 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at pu=
blic companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in th=
e major auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigat=
es alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which =
the major accounting firms examine one another's procedures. And yet proble=
ms persist; arguably, they have grown more acute. "Is accounting self-regul=
ation working? On the face of it, it is not," says Representative John Ding=
ell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accountin=
g profession.=20
In their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many o=
f which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's compl=
ex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sop=
histicated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=
ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants=
 examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=
e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=
e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =
Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=
ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=
ince 1995.=20
Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=
ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=
s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into "professional =
services" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=
ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=
ers, and evaluating their business strategies (see chart). In 1999, accordi=
ng to the SEC, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, v=
s. 13% in 1981.=20
Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=
f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=
ell more-profitable consulting contracts. "Audit work is a marvelous market=
ing tool," says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =
Columbia University. "You are already there doing the audit. You say their =
internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?"=
 But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =
(consulting). "You cannot serve them both," says former SEC commissioner Be=
vis Longstreth.=20
This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=
n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=
h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=
ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=
oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =
raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =
fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. "If you are au=
diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them," says Ro=
bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=
g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=
as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=
-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=
onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. "They have militantly refused =
to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem," Longstreth says.=20
The major accounting firms say they would not risk their reputations by loo=
king the other way on an audit. And they emphasize that no one has ever pro=
ved that consulting caused a bad audit. Then again, the Big Five are very g=
ood at getting court records sealed and settling lawsuits before trial with=
out admitting wrongdoing. And what has been established during several high=
-profile cases against the Big Five is that auditors' compensation is direc=
tly linked to their ability to sell consulting services. "I think we had lo=
ts of smoking guns," says former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. Two years ago =
the accounting industry waged a bitter battle with Levitt over the issue of=
 auditor independence. He had considered asking firms to curtail consulting=
, but backed off after encountering stiff resistance from the accountants a=
nd their friends in Congress. In the end, he settled for a rule forcing pub=
lic companies to disclose how much they pay their accountants for auditing =
and consulting. Levitt regrets not doing more. "If I could do it over again=
, I would insist that corporate audit committees approve in advance any con=
sulting contract," he says.=20
One might assume that Enron's collapse would finally give the SEC the polit=
ical cover it needs to impose strict rules segregating auditing and consult=
ing. One might even go so far as to think the accounting profession was in =
jeopardy of losing its right to self- regulation, and that the SEC should s=
tep into the breach. After all, how many chances should one industry get? B=
ut there are no signs that either of those things is about to happen. Harve=
y Pitt, the new SEC chairman, was Andersen's lawyer until taking office in =
August and, big surprise, he's sympathetic to the accountants' arguments. H=
e has given no indication that he plans to relaunch Levitt's anticonsulting=
 crusade, and he has voiced support for self-regulation.=20
Pitt does want some reform. He has called for clearer language in financial=
 statements and prompt disclosure of material information. He has instructe=
d auditors to identify the three to five subjective accounting decisions th=
at are most important to a company's financial status. The accountants shou=
ld then "clearly and concisely" explain those decisions to investors and de=
tail what the effect would be if they used a different accounting treatment=
. And he would like to speed up the process by which the private-sector Fin=
ancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) creates new accounting rules. Worr=
ied that Levitt's SEC was too adversarial, Pitt is encouraging companies an=
d auditors to consult with the SEC staff if they have accounting questions.=
 "I'm exceedingly tough on improper behavior," he says. "But I am intereste=
d in finding solutions to problems, not just pointing fingers." Pitt says h=
e supports an "effective and transparent" self-regulatory system for accoun=
tants that is subject to "rigorous" SEC oversight. But whether that means a=
nother incremental increase in the POB's power or the creation of a new sel=
f- regulatory organization, he hasn't said.=20
At the POB, Chairman Charles Bowsher is eager to prove his organization is =
up to the job of policing the industry. A former U.S. Comptroller General a=
nd head of the General Accounting Office, Bowsher is armed with a new chart=
er that gives the POB authority over auditing standards, as well as uncondi=
tional funding from the AICPA. (The professional association previously thr=
eatened to withhold money when the POB began studying auditor independence =
violations. The AICPA now says that was a misunderstanding.) Bowsher has ex=
panded Deloitte & Touche's triennial peer review of Andersen to specificall=
y look at issues raised by Enron. But the POB still doesn't have power to e=
nforce recommendations or to discipline firms when they violate guidelines.=
=20
None of these changes will make any difference if accountants continue to d=
ownplay their job as guardians of the public trust. Many seem embarrassed b=
y their watchdog role and have treated their public responsibility as thoug=
h it were a burden. Auditing isn't sexy, the accountants whine; it doesn't =
make them rich. So they've focused on consulting and tried to branch out in=
to corporate finance and even law (heaven help us!). "The industry, from my=
 point of view, has rarely focused on the public interest, only its own par=
ochial business concerns," Levitt says.=20
It wasn't always so. Once, the industry was led by professionals like Leona=
rd Spacek. Spacek, who died in 2000 at 92, was Arthur Andersen's CEO from 1=
947 to 1963 and the profession's elder statesman for long after that. He wa=
sn't afraid to rankle the big accounting firms or Big Business. Throughout =
his career, he pushed to standardize accounting rules so that different com=
panies' financial statements could be fairly compared. He worked to strengt=
hen audit procedures. And although Andersen's forays into consulting began =
on his watch, he spoke often and eloquently about the auditor's role as a p=
rotector of the public interest. "There aren't any Leonard Spaceks in the i=
ndustry anymore," Levitt laments.=20
Perhaps Enron's collapse will chasten the profession enough for it to retur=
n to bedrock principles. And perhaps another Spacek will emerge to lead it.=
 Maybe then that anguished question--where were the auditors?--will reverbe=
rate less often.=20

Enron's woes

If the executive shenanigans that brought Enron to its knees are not crimin=
al acts, they should be.=20
On Nov. 8, Enron was forced to restate its earnings for the past 4 1/2 year=
s, admitting to a near $600 million reduction due to suspect financial repo=
rting. A major factor involves so-called off-balance- sheet deals run by co=
mpany executives. Enron stock has plunged from $80 to less than a dollar, a=
nd the company has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Investors, trusting and awed by the company's posted earnings, learned too =
late of Enron's departure from "generally accepted accounting principles." =
Many have suffered significant losses. A civil suit charges that employees =
were encouraged to invest more heavily in Enron stock just before it tanked=
.=20
In spite of numerous civil suits and an impending congressional investigati=
on, some experts say that a much higher standard of proof may preclude crim=
inal charges. If so, justice will once again be thwarted. Clearly, somebody=
--maybe several somebodies--deserves to spend some time in jail. But don't =
count on it. An old adage says: "If you're going to steal, steal big."

It scarcely seems possible, but two of the staple items on the conversation=
al menu of the left these past years might well be on the edge of disappear=
ance, or at least a change in content. Mumia Abu-Jamal is no longer on deat=
h row. Pacifica's wars are amid final settlement. In both instances, it's a=
 good advertisement for pertinacity. Had it not been for those tireless and=
 oft-ridiculed Mumiacs, I doubt US District Judge William Yohn Jr. would ha=
ve detected those improper jury instructions. Two years ago the Pacifica Na=
tional Board thought it had the situation under control, and it was only a =
matter of time before the ultras were cleaned out of their caves in the mou=
ntains of Berkeley. But the much-derided left kept at it.=20
One good feature of Judge Yohn's ruling is that it takes the emphasis off i=
nnocence or guilt, which surrenders the basic moral axiom of the anti-death=
 penalty cause, namely, that capital punishment is wrong.=20
As for Pacifica, the heat is now on those who fought the national board to =
exhaustion and defeat. Can they produce decent programming and hike Pacific=
a's dismally low audience figures?=20
Enron and the Green Seal=20
The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one of the great rackets of th=
e past decade: green seals of approval, whereby some outfit like the Natura=
l Resources Defense Council or the Environmental Defense Fund would issue t=
estimonials to the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to the public we=
al of corporations like Enron. These green seals of approval were part of t=
he neoliberal pitch, that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield to modern, "m=
arket-oriented solutions" to environmental problems. Indeed, NRDC and EDF w=
ere always the prime salesfolk of neoliberal remedies for environmental pro=
blems. NRDC was socked into the Enron lobby machine so deep you couldn't se=
e the soles of its feet. Here's what happened.=20
In 1997 high-flying Enron found itself in a pitched battle in Oregon, where=
 it planned to acquire Portland General Electric, Oregon's largest public u=
tility. Warning that Enron's motives were of a highly predatory nature, the=
 staff of the state's Public Utility Commission (PUC) opposed the merger. T=
hey warned that an Enron takeover would mean less ability to protect the en=
vironment, increased insecurity for PGE's workers and, in all likelihood, s=
oaring prices.=20
Other critics argued that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize PGE, in pa=
rticular its hydropower, which Enron would sell into California's energy ma=
rket.=20
But at the very moment when such protests threatened to balk Enron of its p=
rize, into town rode NRDC's top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, Heinz env=
ironmental genius award pinned to his armor and flaunting ties to the Energ=
y Foundation, a San Francisco-based outfit providing financial wattage for =
many citizen and environmental groups that work on utility and enviro issue=
s.=20
Cavanagh lost no time whipping the refractory Oregon greens into line. In c=
oncert with Enron, the NRDC man put together a memo of understanding, pledg=
ing that the company would lend financial support to some of these groups' =
pet projects. But Cavanagh still had some arduous politicking ahead. An OK =
for the merger had to come from the PUC, whose staff was adamantly opposed.=
 So, on Valentine's Day, 1997, Cavanagh showed up at a hearing in Salem, Or=
egon, to plead Enron's case.=20
Addressing the three PUC commissioners, he averred that this was "the first=
 time I've ever spoken in support of a utility merger." If so, it was the q=
uickest transition from virginity to seasoned service in the history of int=
ellectual prostitution. Cavanagh reveled in the delights of an Enron embrac=
e: "What we've put before you with this company is, we believe, a robust as=
sortment of public benefits for the citizens of Oregon which would not emer=
ge, Mr. Chairman, without the merger." With a warble in his throat, Cavanag=
h moved into rhetorical high gear: "The Oregonian asks the question, 'Can y=
ou trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and public benefit issues I've dealt=
 with this company for a decade, often in the most contentious circumstance=
s, and the answer is, yes."=20
Cavanagh won the day for the Houston-based energy giant. The PUC approved t=
he merger, and it wasn't long before the darkest suspicions of Enron's plan=
s were vindicated. The company raised rates, tried to soak the ratepayers w=
ith the cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and moved to put some of =
PGE's most valuable assets on the block. Enron's motive had indeed been to =
get access to the hydropower of the Northwest, the cheapest in the country,=
 and sell it into the California market, the priciest and--in part because =
of Cavanagh's campaigning for deregulation--a ripe energy prize awaiting ex=
ploitation.=20
Then, after two years, the company Cavanagh had hailed as being "engaged an=
d motivated" put PGE up on the auction block. Pending sale of PGE, Enron ha=
s been using it as collateral for loans approved by a federal bankruptcy ju=
dge.=20
Enron is best known as George W. Bush's prime financial backer in his presi=
dential quest. But it was a bipartisan purveyor of patronage: to its right,=
 conservative Texas Senator Phil Gramm; to its left, liberal Texas Democrat=
 Sheila Jackson-Lee (who had Enron's CEO Ken Lay as her finance chairman in=
 a Democratic primary fight preluding her first successful Congressional bi=
d; her Democratic opponent was Craig Washington, an anti-NAFTA maverick Dem=
ocrat the Houston establishment didn't care for). Today some House Republic=
ans want to treat the Enron collapse as a criminal matter, while Democrats =
have been talking in vaguer terms about cleaning up accounting rules and pl=
ugging holes in the regulatory system. The inability of Enron's employees t=
o sell company stock from their 401(k)s while high-ups absconded with milli=
ons may doom Bush's promised onslaught on Social Security. There are many m=
orals in Enron's collapse, and the role of that green seal of approval shou=
ld not be forgotten.

TXU CEO Ready As New Year Rings In Retail Deregulation

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the clock strikes midnight in the Lone Star State=
, ringing in the New Year, it is unlikely many will gather to toast their n=
ewly-gained right to pick a supplier of electricity.
However, 2002 kicks off an important chapter in history of Texas electricit=

Nye said he has been a proponent of retail competition for many years becau=

e said.=20
According to Nye, on average, TXU customers will see a 14% reduction in the=
ir electricity bills compared with last year. Although part of the decrease=
 is due to the effect of lower natural gas prices in the state, the company=
 had promised a minimum of a 6% price reduction, he said.=20
Under the state's 1999 restructuring law, customers of the incumbent utilit=
ies who don't switch energy providers will be assigned to the retail electr=
ic provider operated by the utility company. Those customers will pay a set=
 rate for at least three years, or until at least 40% of the utility's cust=
omers switch to another electricity provider. Meanwhile, the new electricit=
y providers, may change the prices they charge up to twice year if there ar=
e changes in natural gas or power costs.=20
"Outside our area, we are trying to pick up some customers," Nye said. "We =
know we will lose some of our current customers. We are hoping there is at =
least a balance." He declined to more specific about the company's expectat=
ions.=20
As for its earnings outlook, TXU expects it will be able to maintain its 9%=
 to 11% growth rate in the competitive market, Nye said.=20
For the fourth quarter, Nye said he would be "shocked" if the company was u=
nable to meet the current Wall Street consensus of 67 cents a share reporte=
d by Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
A year ago, TXU earned 61 cents a share.=20
"We are very comfortable with the consensus," he said.=20
Despite the imminent start of retail competition in Texas, efforts to persu=
ade consumers to switch electricity providers have been muted so far.=20
TXU's Nye admits his company hasn't spent much on advertising to consumers,=
 but expects the company to step up its marketing efforts as the year progr=
esses.=20
TXU is in the process of establishing offices in parts of Texas outside its=
 traditional operating area, and is making an effort to establish "personal=
 contact" in those communities.=20
TXU also is directly contacting medium-to-small industrial customers that m=
ight consider switching electricity providers.=20
According to Nye, early efforts to get the internal data processing and cle=
arance systems that would allow for a smooth transition to competition oper=
ating properly had preoccupied the company during the six-month pilot progr=
am.=20
During the pilot, 5% of Texas residential customers were allowed to try new=
 providers. Despite a slowed start brought on by computer glitches at the s=
tate's power grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or E=
RCOT, the system is said to be ready to begin as planned.=20
Tony Spare, portfolio manager of Spare Value First and a TXU investor, said=
 the company has been "chomping on the bit for the new business opportuniti=
es" presented by deregulation. According to Spare, TXU is an "effective mar=
keter" and its nuclear assets will help the company's price competitiveness=
.=20
Spare's view of TXU hasn't changed despite a recent bumpy ride in the utili=
ty sector brought on by Enron Corp.'s (ENE) stunning and rapid financial co=
llapse.=20
In the aftermath of Enron's collapse, TXU's comparatively conservative stra=
tegy may be coming into back into vogue.=20
According to Nye, TXU has always used energy trading as a way to obtain mar=
ket information.=20
"We trade around resources," he said, adding that the company's trading act=
ivities are limited to its core areas: electricity, gas and telecommunicati=
ons.=20
That behavior distinguishes TXU from Enron, Nye said. He cited Enron's aggr=
essive trading practices, its accounting practices, and in inability to tak=
e the proper reserves as factors that contributed to Enron's need to file f=
or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early December.=20
Still, there is no doubt that Enron's troubles have caused credit rating ag=
encies to take a tougher stance toward companies in the sector, and TXU is =
among those companies receiving more closer scrutiny.=20
Recently, the two largest credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service=
 and Standard & Poor's, affirmed TXU's investment grade status. However, in=
 its review, S&P said TXU must continue its current efforts to reduce its h=
igh leverage in the coming year.=20
Nye declined to say what the company's ideal debt-to-capital ratio is, but =
he said the company would continue to reduce its debt level. He added, it i=
s essential to have a "strong credit rating ... one to two levels above the=
 investment grade level."=20
Despite the need to reduce debt, Nye doesn't dismiss the possibility for fu=
ture acquisitions at the right price.=20
"We're excited about our prospects for the company," Nye said. As several r=
ival energy merchants begin to shed assets to raise money to reduce debt, T=
XU will be watching closely to see which assets come up for sale.=20
"I had said a long time ago that there will be a secondary market (for ener=
gy assets). That expectation has come to pass," Nye said. "We're interested=
 in the fact that so many are looking to sell assets."=20
In addition to Texas, TXU has been active in the Northeast and the Midwest.=
=20
In Europe, the company has a presence in the Nordic region, and has been bu=
ilding positions in Germany and the Iberian peninsula.=20

USA: Finance - Small steps seen improving financial health.
By Linda Stern

01/02/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - After a bad year, the financial markets are s=
ignaling "Recovery, ho!" But many people don't feel so "recovered" personal=
ly.=20
They may be looking at diminished stock portfolios, flat 401(k)s and stacks=
 of holiday bills. They may be lacking the enthusiasm for yet another New Y=
ear's "get-my-finances-fixed" resolution after last year's list turned out =
so badly.
No matter! It's not the sweeping pronouncements or big market moves that ma=
ke or break a financial life. It's the little actions that add up to financ=
ial stability.=20
So skip the resolutions and get straight to a simple to-do list that will m=
ake you richer by this time next year.=20
Here it is:=20
- Get a better credit card. If you pay off your balances every month, you c=
an't do any better than a straight-up cash rebate card. There aren't many o=
ut there, but three that have no annual fees and offer cash back on every p=
urchase are the Fleet Titanium Cash Rebate Card (http://www.fleet.com); the=
 National City Cash Builder Platinum Visa (http://www.nationalcity.com) and=
 the American Express Platinum Cash Rebate Card (http://www.americanexpress=
.com). All three credit various amounts of cash (up to 2 percent of purchas=
es) to your account once a year. If you're a big convenience user, you can =
accumulate enough cash back on any of these plans to buy your own airline t=
icket once a year.=20
- Dump some company stock. If your retirement plan has more than 10 percent=
 of its assets invested in shares of the company you work for, sell the ext=
ra and buy something else. You don't want to be overly dependent on one fir=
m for your livelihood and your savings, and if you're confused about this a=
dvice, just remember one word: Enron.=20
- Buy some other stocks, or stock funds. Sure, most investors took a whippi=
ng in 2001. But over the long term, stocks still rule and in 10 years you'l=
l be glad you bought now.=20
- Start a no-brainer IRA. If you make under $53,000 a year joint ($33,000 s=
ingle), or you work for a company that doesn't offer a retirement plan, you=
're eligible for a deductible IRA. If you make more than that, you can open=
 a Roth IRA. Either one will allow you to take tax breaks for building mone=
y on your own. Establish this account in a low-fee index fund, such as Vang=
uard's Total Market Index Fund (http://www.vanguard.com) or the Fidelity Sp=
artan Total Market Index (http://www.fidelity.com). For 2002, you're allowe=
d to contribute $3,000, as long as you earn that much in salary. Divide tha=
t by 12 for a monthly contribution of $250. When you set up your account, a=
uthorize the fund company to deduct that $250 every month from your checkin=
g account. That's it, you're done. Readjust again in 2005, when the limits =
go up to $4,000. Look forward to accumulating $20,518 in five years, $63,34=
4 in ten years and more and more as you continue.=20
- Refinance and shorten your mortgage. You've already missed the bottom in =
home loan rates but there are deals to be had. You can get a 15 year fixed =
rate loan for under 7 percent. If you're currently carrying an 8.5 percent =
30 year loan, it will raise your monthly payment by about $80 to downsize t=
o a 15 year loan at today's rates. But you'll be burning that paper 15 year=
s early and you'll save close to $120,000 in interest over the life of the =
loan.=20
- Restructure your debt, like a corporation. The rates on second mortgages =
are way better than the rates on credit cards and most car loans, and the i=
nterest on them is typically tax deductible. If you're carrying credit card=
 and car debt, consider getting a home loan that will consolidate it and le=
t you pay it off in a hurry. Ignore this advice if you don't trust yourself=
 to really pay it off in a hurry and keep those other balances at zero. If =
you don't have that kind of discipline (or cash), at least pay extra amount=
s toward your credit card with the highest rate until you knock that down t=
o zero.=20
- Rebalance your portfolio. Chances are that over the last year, the bond p=
ortion of your portfolio grew relative to the stock portion. With interest =
rates near their lows, and probably headed higher (assuming that 2002 recov=
ery), it's a good time to sell off some of those bonds before they head in =
the opposite direction. Put the money back in stocks until the asset alloca=
tion you get back to your original asset allocation.=20
- Build a bond or CD ladder.zz~ the bond portion of your money on autopilot=
. Divide the amount of money you have invested in bonds into five chunks. P=
ut the first chunk into a one-year bond, the second into a two-year bond, t=
he third into three-year maturities and so on. Then every year, as your bon=
d comes due, roll it over into a five year bond or certificate of deposit. =
In five years, you'll have everything invested in five year maturities, ear=
ning higher rates than you would with shorter maturities. But you'll get so=
me money back to reinvest every year, reducing the likelihood that all of y=
our money will be tied up long term when rates rise. Once you've built this=
 ladder, you can practically go to sleep.=20
- Buy some inflation-indexed bonds before there's inflation. The Treasury s=
ells inflation protected securities (TIPS) and I-bonds. They both guarantee=
 a real rate of return above inflation of about 3 percent. Currently, the T=
IPS (available through www.treasurydirect.gov) are paying 3.5 percent. "Tha=
t is an extraordinary rate of return," says William Tedford, director of fi=
xed income strategy for Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock. "That's=
 probably as good as they are going to get."=20
These bonds do hit investors with a heavier than usual tax bill, though, si=
nce a portion of the income is taxed annually but not paid out until the bo=
nd matures. To avoid that problem consider buying a TIP fund, such as PIMCO=
 Real Return Bond fund or Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund with=
in a tax-deferred account.=20

US energy cos hoping to sell assets to reduce debts - report

01/02/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - US energy companies are now looking to sell off assets to =
lighten their debt-heavy balance sheets, the Wall Street Journal reported.=
=20
Prices for electricity and natural gas in the US have plummeted, while inve=
stors are fleeing and debt holders are worried about credit exposure caused=
 by Enron Corp's collapse, the WSJ added.
Houston-based Enron, until recently the biggest electricity and natural gas=
 trader, filed last month for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Ba=
nkruptcy Code while it seeks to reorganize.=20
El Paso Energy Corp said it will sell natural gas fields in the shallow wat=
ers in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as gas assets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and =
Kansas.=20
It is also putting a 150,000-barrel-per-day New Jersey oil refinery and som=
e coal mines up for sale, according to the WSJ. The company says it wants 5=
00 mln usd for both the refinery and the coal mines.=20
Valero Energy Corp, an independent refining and marketing company based in =
San Antonio, said it "would take a look" at the plant. Meanwhile, Valero is=
 closing a 4 bln usd acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp.=20
In addition, Atlanta-based Mirant said it intends to sell electricity plant=
s in Massachusetts acquired a few years ago. But "almost anything would be =
considered for sale, for the right price," says spokesman Chuck Griffin.=20
TXU Corp is also divesting itself of plants in its home state, to stay belo=
w market-concentration limits that are part of a state electricity deregula=
tion plan. TXU is using proceeds to retire debt and pick up assets elsewher=
e, the WSJ said.=20
The WSJ added that European companies will be looking to buy individual ele=
ctricity plants that can make good profits in the deregulated markets of Ne=
w York, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and California.=20
Among the likely European buyers are E.ON AG and RWE AG, which recently acq=
uired American Water Works, which owns regulated water utilities throughout=
 the US; Tractebel North America Inc, the energy arm of Paris-based Suez th=
at already is building power plants in Washington and Texas; and the UK's P=
owergen PLC, which bought LG&E Energy Corp last year.=20
Among the US companies that could pick up assets are two Houston-based comp=
anies -- Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Apache Corp, as well as others includi=
ng American Electric Power, TXU, Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources Inc a=
nd Entergy Corp.=20

Master short seller raised flag on Enron: Roberts tags Kodak, Safeway as st=
ocks to avoid

With the righteous anger of hindsight, U.S. senators and journalists have d=
emanded why no one foresaw the failure of Enron Corp. In fact, someone did.=
 And it's in writing. Last May, when Enron shares traded at US$59, Off Wall=
 Street Consulting Group issued a 27-page report debunking the profits clai=
med by Enron, the Houston energy-trading firm now notorious in any living r=
oom that has a TV set.=20
"We pretty much put our finger on all the problems Enron had," says Mark Ro=
berts, who runs Off Wall Street's research team in an office on a side stre=
et of Cambridge, Mass. Enron awarded itself profits, noted Off Wall Street'=
s researchers, by marking its trading positions to "market" prices when no =
real market existed for the stuff that Enron traded. Related-party dealings=
 with private partnerships also seemed designed by Enron to boost its publi=
cly reported earnings.
Mr. Roberts' prescience wasn't perfect. He never expected Enron to collapse=
 into bankruptcy. When Enron shares slid below Mr. Roberts' downside price =
target of US$30 -- to US$26 in September -- Off Wall Street recommended tha=
t clients close short positions. And when the shares rallied briefly to US$=
36, Roberts wiped his brow in relief. The shares have since collapsed to ju=
st pennies, but clients who followed Off Wall Street's recommendations made=
 handsome profits.=20
In addition to Enron, Roberts' research boutique supplied 20 other short-sa=
le ideas in 2001 to a clientele of money managers. Over the 12 months ended=
 September, Off Wall Street's recommendations gained 94%.=20
(Gains on short sales are computed by using the current price as the purcha=
se price; as such, a stock that falls 50% would produce a 100% gain.) In co=
ntrast, shorting the Standard & Poor's 500, which fell 22% over the same pe=
riod, would have produced a 44% return.=20
The market has since rebounded. But Off Wall Street still seems poised to c=
lose the year with a 50%-plus paper return on its research, which Mr. Rober=
ts, who doesn't manage money, sells to clients for a hefty price.=20
Since 1995, Mr. Roberts' recommendations have outpaced an S&P index short b=
y an average of 31% a year. That's why clients pay heed to his warnings abo=
ut Eastman Kodak and Safeway Inc.=20
The Off Wall Street process starts with computer screens, looking for an in=
tersection of a high stock price with a business whose operating numbers bo=
de ill. Such a path often leads right into Wall Street's latest fad.=20
At the height of the Internet bubble, Off Wall Street's portfolio of short =
ideas consisted of about two-thirds tech stocks. In the past year, tech nam=
es yielded to medical stocks and alternative energy.=20
Since September, Mr. Roberts has been encouraging investors to steer clear =
of Kodak. The shares (EK/NYSE) had been holding steady around US$45, as inv=
estors took solace that the photography giant could maintain its 4% dividen=
d yield by wringing more cash flow from operations.=20
But the U.S. consumer market for film, which underlies half of Kodak's sale=
s and operating profits, has been declining at an 11% annual rate as digita=
l photography grows. Kodak is faring even worse, with 19% declines in film =
volume as it scraps for a shrinking market against Fuji and the private-lab=
el offerings of Wal-Mart Stores.=20
Kodak spokesman Paul Allen told Barron's the company does not comment on an=
alyst research.=20
In October, Kodak guided down December quarter earnings expectations from a=
bout US46 cents a share, to US15 cents. Its shares have fallen to around US=
$31, but Mr. Roberts believes Kodak could fall to US$22. "We expect the [US=
$1.80] dividend to get cut," he says, "and the dividend is one of the main =
props of the stock."=20
Another of Mr. Roberts' current short recommendations is Safeway (SWY/NYSE)=
, the 1,750- store supermarket chain based in Pleasanton, Calif. He first r=
ecommended sale of the stock in April, when it was trading at US$53. Curren=
t price: US$45.=20
In recent years Safeway has justly earned investors' admiration, with sales=
 growth and profit margins that exceeded those of such rivals as Kroger and=
 Albertson's. But Wall Street has been valuing Safeway at 86% of its US$32-=
billion in year 2000 sales, while valuing Kroger at just 38% of sales.=20
Looking at Safeway's year 2000 earnings of US$1-billion, or US$2.13 a share=
, Mr. Roberts noted that 10% came from sales of real estate and investment =
gains in the supermarket's pension fund. Back out those non-grocery profits=
, and Safeway's earnings grew just 13% in 2000. In prior years, earnings gr=
owth had averaged better than 25%.=20
Sales have slowed in 2001, based on identical-store sales growth. The likel=
y cause, says Mr. Roberts, has been the arrival of deep discounters Wal-Mar=
t and Costco on Safeway's turf.=20
Ultimately, Mr. Roberts believes Safeway could fall as low as US$35.=20
"We strongly disagree with what he [Mr. Roberts] has written," says Safeway=
 spokesperson Melissa Plaisance.=20
She acknowledges that earnings gains from investing and real estate in 2000=
 led to tough comparisons in the current year. But those comparisons are no=
w behind Safeway, and it will give investors updated guidance in a conferen=
ce call Jan. 24.

MUMBAI - Gas Authority of India Ltd., the country's biggest gas supplier, s=
aid it plans to bid for the US$3-billion Indian power plant of U.S.-based E=
nron Corp., which last month made the largest-ever filing for bankruptcy.=
=20
Gas Authority will bid for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit, with a so-=
called "strategic partner," the state-run company said in a statement. It d=
idn't name the partner.
Dabhol was Enron's biggest investment outside the U.S. as the company sough=
t to expand overseas. Enron put the plant up for sale before it filed for b=
ankruptcy because of a payment dispute with a state electricity board, its =
sole customer.=20
Enron wants US$1-billion for its 65% stake. Tata Power Ltd. and BSES Ltd., =
the two bidders for the stake, have said the price is too high and are nego=
tiating with local lenders who have loaned the project US$1.4-billion.=20
Gas Authority needs Dabhol's liquefied natural gas facility to feed more ga=
s through its 4,594-km network of pipelines across the country. It gets its=
 supplies from Oil & Natural Gas Ltd., a state-run oil explorer that hasn't=
 made any big discoveries since 1975.=20
That's forced Gas Authority to look for other sources of gas. It has partne=
red Indian Oil Corp. and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. to build a five-million-to=
n-a-year gas plant in India's western province of Gujarat.=20
Dabhol Power's 5.5-million-ton gas facility was part of a US$2-billion plan=
 to boost the utility's capacity to 2,184 megawatts from 740. Contractors h=
alted work on the plant, saying they hadn't been paid since April last year=
, leaving the expansion 97% complete. The power plant burned naphtha, a che=
mical refined from crude oil, and was to switch to gas once the expansion w=
as complete.=20
The plant was shut in May after Enron gave notice it would cancel a supply =
contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board because it was owed U=
S$64-million in overdue bills. The board stopped paying for Dabhol's power,=
 saying it was too expensive.=20
Enron last month fired 300 workers in India because of the overdue bills. D=
abhol isn't listed among Enron's 17 units that have sought court protection=
 from creditors owed US$31-billion.

GAS AUTHORITY OF INDIA TO BID FOR ENRON'S DABHOL POWER PROJECT

NEW DELHI, Jan 2 Asia Pulse - State-owned Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL)=

Joining the race with Tatas and BSES, where Reliance are the single largest=
 stake-holder, GAIL has communicated its 'expression of interest' to the co=

GAIL is understood to be keen on DPC's LNG line and may shortly start talks=
 with other power companies for joining its bid to manage the power project=
.=20
GAIL communicated its decision to join the race for acquiring stake in DPC =
only after securing clearance from the Ministry of Petroleum, a GAIL statem=

sector as part of its proposed integration into energy related areas.=20
GAIL will shortly sign confidentiality agreements with the concerned partie=
s -- IDBI, DPC and MSEB -- for conducting due diligence study of the projec=
t.=20
The estimated time frame for completion of DPC (Phase-II) with ancillary fa=
cilities is about 18 months from the time the project was handed over to th=
e new management, GAIL said.=20
GAIL intends to adopt a broad-based approach while undertaking the due dili=
gence as it has already made an entry into the power sector through equity =
participation in a gas-based power project in Gujarat.=20
Meanwhile, the consortium of Indian financial institutions led by IDBI has =
asked the Centre to announce a package of incentives and concessions to exp=
edite the process of selling stake in DPC where the operations had come to =

If the commission were to act soon and forcefully on pro forma reporting an=

Pressure for the SEC to get tough on corporate reporting has increased in r=

Pitt said earlier this month that pro forma numbers making a loss look like=

In mid-November, he said the SEC was sizing up possible pro forma enforceme=

Pro forma results skate around accounting conventions - codified in the Gen=

They are sometimes labelled as "core," "normalized" or "adjusted" results. =
Often they exclude costs related to mergers, stock options, unusual events =

The most frequent users of the pro forma style are technology companies. Am=

A technology company is widely thought to be the target, although sources s=

The Regulation FD case expected to be brought soon was not moving as rapidl=

Regulation FD - was adopted a year ago. It requires corporations to disclos=

J.P. Morgan Chase Sues Nine Insurers In Enron-Bond Case --- Institution See=
ks to Quash Demands for Information
By Carol S. Remond
Dow Jones Newswires

01/02/2002
The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- One would think that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., as one of Enron C=
orp.'s largest creditors, would want to find as much information as possibl=
e about the finances of the now-bankrupt energy trader.=20
Not so. In fact, as a sure sign that the interests of various Enron credito=
rs have begun to collide, J.P. Morgan Chase filed a motion over the weekend=
 to quash demands for information related to some $2 billion (2.24 billion =
euros) in Enron-related surety bonds made by nine insurance companies.
J.P. Morgan filed the suit against the insurers after they said that they w=
ouldn't honor about $1.1 billion of the bonds, including $965 million owed =
to J.P. Morgan earlier this month. J.P. Morgan is now seeking to prevent th=
e insurers from using the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District o=
f New York to gather information about whether Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase =
misrepresented the facts to secure the surety bonds.=20
Enron filed a similar motion opposing the insurers' demands for further inf=
ormation, claiming like J.P. Morgan Chase that the court should turn down t=
he insurers because they are going on a "fishing expedition."=20
The insurers are questioning whether forward-sales contracts that they bond=
ed for Enron ever existed. According to court documents, Citigroup Inc.'s T=
ravelers insurance unit and eight other insurers wrote to J.P. Morgan Chase=
 in early December, essentially telling the investment bank that they neede=
d more proof of the forward-sales contracts' legitimacy before they would h=
onor their surety-bond payments.=20
The other insurers include: Kemper Insurance Co.'s Lumbermens Mutual Casual=
ty Co.; Allianz AG's Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.; Chubb Corp.'s Federal In=
surance Co.; St. Paul Cos.'s Fire and Marine Insurance; CNA Surety Corp.'s =
Continental Casualty Co.; Safeco Corp's Safeco Insurance Co.; Hartford Fina=
ncial Services Group Inc.; and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.=20
All the insurers, with the exception of Citigroup's Travelers, have since f=
iled answers and counterclaims in court, essentially demanding that Judge A=
rthur J. Gonzalez declares the surety bonds void because Enron and Chase mi=
srepresented the facts surrounding their issuance.=20
Citigroup's reluctance to stand against J.P. Morgan Chase may be at least p=
artly explained by the fact that both institutions are lead bankers for Enr=
on. Together, they are seeking to set up a $1.5 billion financing package t=
o help Enron back on its feet.=20
In their separate motions, J.P. Morgan Chase and Enron claim that the insur=
ers' demands for information would impede the court's bankruptcy proceeding=
s. The insurance companies "unabashingly seek to invoke Rule 2004 to furthe=
r their own interests," J.P. Morgan Chase said in its motion. J.P. Morgan a=
lso claimed that the insurers' moves are designed to use the bankruptcy pro=
ceedings to further information-gathering efforts in a pending civil litiga=
tion.=20
The J.P. Morgan Chase suit was first filed in New York State Court and then=
 moved to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.=20
The forward-sales contracts in dispute were made between Enron and two offs=
hore companies, Mahonia Ltd. and Mahonia Natural Gas Ltd., both based in th=
e Channel Islands. Under the contracts, Mahonia was supposed to prepay for =
the delivery of oil and natural gas from Enron, which would then procure th=
e fuel from an array of producers for delivery to various end-users. The en=
d-users, in turn, were supposed to pay Mahonia for the oil and gas.=20
The nine insurers bonded Enron's obligation to deliver the oil and gas, but=
 balked when J.P. Morgan Chase asked them on Dec. 7 to honor that commitmen=
t, five days after Enron had filed for bankruptcy. The insurers told J.P. M=
organ in a letter that day that they have "received credible information th=
at, in fact, there may never have been any producer contracts or end-user c=
ontracts. In addition, Enron may never have delivered any oil or natural ga=
s under the forward sales contracts to Mahonia or any other party," accordi=
ng to the letters to J.P. Morgan Chase.=20
In addition to requesting documentation for the forward-sales contracts, th=
e insurers also asked for an explanation of the corporate relationship betw=
een J.P. Morgan Chase and Mahonia.

FAITH POPCORN has seen the future, and it's a real mouthful.=20
Take a deep breath and listen in for a moment.
There you are, surfing Cyberia, when some karaoke manager from the bachelor=
 herd barges in (no supreme C.E.O. he, no master of Genghis capitalism). Th=
is guy needs an ego audit, you mutter, but you hit the boss key anyway. You=
're no flexecutive, after all, just a lowly permalance. Your prebuttals fal=
l flat, and he orders you on to a data fast, tosses a message slip on your =
inflatable, and leaves.=20
You look at the slip. The woman you had the fight chat with. Definitely cos=
metic underclass. Not remotely Pilotable. You toss a lunch lob, and call ho=
me to check on your baboon wife and the free-range children.=20
Whew! Had enough?=20
And now, in a just world, you'd get a translation. Forget it. (Basically, i=
t would take much too long.) No, you'll just have to read ''Dictionary of t=
he Future,'' by Ms. Popcorn and Adam Hanft (Hyperion, $22.95), for yourself=
.=20
(Oh, all right, here are a couple, since they are sort of fun: Bachelor her=
ds are the young men left mateless when older ones grab trophy wives, and b=
aboons are baby boomers with no savings.)=20
What, exactly, is a dictionary of the future? Apparently, the old model jus=
t can't keep up -- with those stuffy, tweedy souls content ''to track the e=
bb and flow of language'' and open the ivied dictionary gates only to words=
 that have stood the test of time.=20
Too slow! the authors cry. This is a split-second, rat-a-tat world. We can'=
t wait around to see what words stick. We'll tell you where the language is=
 headed. We're ''linguistic prospectors,'' ''anticipators.''=20
For this dictionary, dawdlers need not apply. To enter here, words must be =
white-hot, mere moments from the authors' fiery imaginations. ''Downsizing'=
'? Doesn't make the cut. ''Not new enough.''=20
This ''joyride through the culture'' does make a nod to what could be serio=
us, lasting phenomena -- like hybrid cars and wind farms. But for the most =
part it's a breathless effort to be up-to-the-nanosecond fresh.=20
Between cup and lip, though -- between idea and bound book -- the world eco=
nomy slipped, making the boom-time ''employer of choice'' and ''pleading ec=
onomy'' entries decidedly dated.=20
Then again, ''stock therapy'' and getting ''401-K'd'' are frighteningly tim=
ely; think of Enron shareholders. But ''language extinction'' -- that one's=
 too painfully close to home to contemplate.=20
But wait. Are the authors just kidding around? You might think so, with all=
 those wordplays -- hyber-nation and scarevoyants.=20
But there's an undeniable earnestness here, a solemnity. (There is a sugges=
tion to read the book ''in a nonlinear sort of fashion.'') And they do put =
themselves in some heady company, at one point even invoking Shakespeare --=
 that ''unrepentant serial coiner'' -- to bless their mission of invention.=
=20
What fools these mortals be.

Finally, a reporter had the temerity to question Bush on Friday regarding t=
he ignominious collapse of Enron Corp. run by Kenneth L. Lay, a Bush family=
 intimate and top campaign contributor. Bush expressed concern "for the cit=
izens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings" and added: "It=
's very important for us to fully understand the 'whys' of Enron."=20
Sure is, but did Bush never ask "Kenny Boy"--his nickname for Enron's chair=
man--what was going on?
After all, not only was Kenny Boy one of Bush's major contributors, but it =
was Lay and Enron that Bush turned to for critical advice on how to further=
 exploit U.S. natural resources.=20
The media, which had hounded Bill Clinton on his Whitewater connections, ha=
ve allowed Bush to maintain the fiction that his--and his father's--adminis=
tration had nothing to do with the debacle that is Enron.=20
Given the intense interest in the list of those who slept over in the Clint=
on White House, it's odd that no attention has been paid to Kenny Boy's sle=
epover in the early years of the senior Bush's White House.=20
Those early Bush years were crucial for Enron, beginning with the passage o=
f the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which forced the established utility companie=
s to carry Enron's electricity sales on their wires.=20
At the same time, Wendy Gramm, who served under the elder Bush as chair of =
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowed for an exemption in the t=
rading of energy derivatives, which, as the Washington Post reported, "late=
r became Enron's most lucrative business."=20
Once that was accomplished, Gramm, wife of Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, resig=
ned from her government post to take a position on the Enron board. As one =
of the members of the board's audit committee, she now is expected to be a =
key figure in the lawsuits and federal investigation revolving around Enron=
's collapse. Recently, the chief executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's outs=
ide auditor, told a congressional committee that the accounting firm had wa=
rned the Enron audit committee of what he termed "possible illegal acts wit=
hin the company."=20
Wendy Gramm is also mentioned in a bank lawsuit alleging insider trading as=
 having sold $276,912 in Enron stock in November 1998. Her response is that=
 she sold the stock to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, give=
n that her husband was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.=20
Yet she was still very much on the Enron board and being rewarded with futu=
re stock options when her husband last year pushed through legislation that=
 exempted key elements of Enron's energy business from oversight by the fed=
eral government. Phil Gramm had obtained $97,350 in political contributions=
 from Enron over the years, so perhaps he was acting on his own instincts a=
nd not his wife's urgings. The exemption was passed over the objection of t=
he Clinton administration.=20
Wendy Gramm also directs the regulatory studies program at George Mason Uni=
versity, which has received $50,000 from Enron since 1996. Her academic ins=
titute is highly influential in arguing for deregulation, conveniently join=
ing her corporate and academic interests.=20
Unfortunately for true-believer deregulators, the Enron collapse shreds the=
ir panacea. Surely no one, least of all Wendy Gramm, who has said she was k=
ept unaware of the company's chicanery in hiding debt and conducting secret=
 private deals to the detriment of stockholders, could argue today with a s=
traight face that Enron was in need of less government oversight.=20
The fact is that there would be no Enron as we know it were it not for Repu=
blican-engineered changes in government regulation that permitted Enron its=
 meteoric growth.=20
It's true that the corporation had its allies among the Democrats; campaign=
 finance corruption and influence peddling are generally a cover-all-your-b=
ets bipartisan activity. But in this case, the amounts given to Democrats w=
ere puny and late, and there's no doubt that Enron rode to power primarily =
on the strength of Lay's influence with the Bush family. This fact is not m=
itigated by Enron now hiring Clinton's former lawyer and various top Democr=
atic lobbying groups, except to note that these hired guns have no shame.=
=20
The Bush family ties to Kenny Boy Lay are just too intimate and lucrative t=
o ignore.=20
There also are at least four Enron consultants and executives who hold high=
 positions within the Bush White House, and some of them may be drawn into =
the investigations that cannot be avoided, despite the distractions of the =
war on terror.=20
As John Dean once famously said of the Nixon administration, there is a can=
cer growing on the presidency, but in this case it's name is Enron, and it =
won't go away by being ignored.

Tough Sell?
Is it tough for struggling companies to recruit new board members?=20
Lucent Technologies Inc. didn't bother to fill Paul O'Neill's seat when he =
became U.S. Treasury secretary last year. The Murray Hill, N.J., telecom-ge=
ar maker figured it would be a challenge to recruit someone during the heig=
ht of its troubles, according to an individual close to the situation. Luce=
nt has been hit hard by the continuing slowdown throughout the telecommunic=
ations industry.=20
The company is just trying to keep the board intact until it names a chief =
executive, a Lucent spokesman says.=20
But Enron Corp., the collapsed Houston energy giant, named two new outside =
directors after its travails became public. "I don't know if I could assign=
 any degree of difficulty," says Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. "We were =
just looking for people who have had experience with these matters and we f=
ound two perfect candidates."=20
Though Enron subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection, its new board me=
mbers don't have to worry about liability for shareholder suits, says Melan=
ie Cohen, a bankruptcy attorney at Altheimer Gray, a Chicago law firm. "The=
y can't be liable for something that occurred before they got there."=20
One new Enron director, University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers,=
 says it took him only "two or three days" to decide to join its board. The=
 delay was "more of an issue of time and making sure it was compatible with=
 my duties here" rather than doubts about serving on the company's board, h=
e adds.=20
Raymond Troubh, a New York financial consultant and Enron's other board new=
comer, says he is looking forward to his directorship because "board servic=
e of troubled companies is quite fascinating."=20

Deeper Connection=20

One woman wants to take networking to a whole new level.=20
Melissa Giovagnoli, president of Networlding, a Chicago consulting firm, ha=
s developed an unusual concept called "networlding." She helps people make =
"targeted connections" with others who have similar personal values so they=
 can build a safety net that will last longer than a job-transition period.=
=20
"Traditional networking becomes ineffective because you keep running throug=
h people," she says. "But if you form a connection with someone based on co=
mplimentary values, the exchange can be much more dynamic."=20
Since March, Ms. Giovagnoli has started 25 networlding "circles" in Chicago=
, with 10 people in each circle. She plans to start others soon in Washingt=
on, Indianapolis and California's Silicon Valley. Circle members pay $125 a=
piece for a year of participation. The fee enables participants to connect =
with members of other circles both in person and through e-mail.=20
Ms. Giovagnoli also intends to create formal networlding circles within com=
panies, including Motorola Inc. The Schaumburg, Ill., technology-and-equipm=
ent giant has hired her to teach staffers how to network. She intends to im=
plement a circle there this month. An informal Motorola circle already has =
brought together employees who wouldn't otherwise know each other, says Ves=
na Arsic, a corporate-marketing-strategy director.=20
Ms. Arsic says this circle has helped her. "Motorola is in a precarious fin=
ancial state, but I have less anxiety because I know there are lots of peop=
le I can call if I have to," she says.=20

Fewer Options=20

The average number of stock options awarded to chief executives plummeted 7=
6% in 2001. So concludes a new study of 50 Fortune 1000 companies whose fis=
cal years ended during the second or third quarter of 2001. The study was c=
onducted by Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a research firm in Al=
exandria, Va.=20
CEOs' options awards dropped from an average of 1,396,006 in 2000 to 335,01=
3 options a year later, the study found. This plunge occurred despite the f=
act that 25 companies increased the number of options granted their leader =
compared with the prior year.=20
On average, the 50 companies awarded their CEOs 8.4% of all options given t=

Case Summary
Dynegy's Reasons for Terminating Merger Were "Mere Pretexts," Says Enron

01/02/2002
Securities Litigation & Regulation Reporter
Copyright (c) 2002 Andrews Publications. All rights reserved.

In adversary proceedings filed with the bankruptcy court, Enron Corp. accus=
es Dynegy of pulling out of the merger between the energy trading giants so=
 it could ensure Enron's fall and slash competition in the industry. Enron =
also says the alleged material adverse effects used to break the agreement =
were "mere pretexts" used by Dynegy to gain control of a valuable pipeline.=
 In re Enron Corp. et al., No. 01-3626, complaint filed (S.D.N.Y., 02-DEC-0=
1).=20
According to the complaint, Dynegy agreed to the merger with its "eyes wide=
 open" and "with full knowledge of Enron's well-publicized financial crises=
 after conducting two weeks of extensive due diligence."
Enron's ability to preserve its energy trading business and avoid bankruptc=
y protection was dependent on the deal going through, it adds, and Dynegy a=
llegedly understood that credit rating agencies - such as Moody's, Standard=
 & Poor's, and Fitch - only agreed to keep the ratings at above investment-=
grade level based on Dynegy's assurances that the merger would be completed=
.=20
Dynegy is claiming that Enron failed to disclose the acceleration of a debt=
 with respect to a $691 million note that was triggered by a ratings downgr=
ade. Enron counters that the repayment obligation occurred after the merger=
 agreement was executed, and that the downgrade was specifically excluded a=
s a material adverse event under the contract.=20
Due to Enron's liquidity problems, Dynegy invested $1.5 billion in equity w=
hen the agreement was signed in the form of preferred stock in the Enron su=
bsidiary that owns Northern Natural Gas Pipeline.=20
The preferred stock carries the right to acquire all of the ownership inter=
ests under certain circumstances including if Dynegy rightfully terminated =
the merger agreement. However, Enron says Dynegy had no right to pull out o=
f the deal and that it is not entitled to purchase more stock in the compan=
y that holds Northern Natural. Dynegy has also filed its own breach of cont=
ract suit in Texas state court seeking to secure control over the entity.=
=20
Enron's problems started when it released its financial results for the thi=
rd quarter in October and announced a non-recurring charge totally $1.01 bi=
llion (after taxes). In connection with the early termination of certain fi=
nancial arrangement, the energy giant also told its shareholders that their=
 equity had been reduced by about $1.2 billion.=20
Shortly thereafter, the board formed a special audit committee to investiga=
te the company's accounting and the Securities and Exchange Commission bega=
n its investigation.=20
In early November, Enron announced that its financial statements for 1997 t=
hrough 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 would have to be =
restated with an aggregate total reduction in net income of about $600 mill=
ion.=20
The merger agreement was signed on Nov. 9, 2001, and valued Enron stock at =
$10.41 per share. However, the share price continued to decline because Dyn=
egy repeatedly told the press that it had a "due diligence out," says Enron=
, contrary to the agreement and in bad faith, as Dynegy knew that the bad p=
ublicity would only hurt Enron's already precarious financial state.=20
Dynegy undermined the safety net that the merger was supposed to provide fo=
r Enron and should pay for the damages it caused, the plaintiff said. Enron=
 lost an enormous amount of credibility with the credit rating agencies due=
 to Dynegy's refusal to support that agreement and contributed to the downg=
rade that caused the acceleration on the note, the now-bankrupt company say=
s.=20
Enron is seeking no less than $10 billion in damages from Dynegy as well as=
 a declaration that it breached the merger agreement and has no right to ex=
ercise an option to purchase interests in Northern Natural Gas Pipeline.=20
Enron is represented by Martin Bienenstock, Greg Danilow and Brian Rosen of=
 Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York.

Enron Corp.'s 10 most senior officers and directors conspired to inflate th=

The complaint alleges that Causey, Lay, Skilling and Fastow signed false Fo=
rm 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs required by the Securities and Exchange Commission =
at various times during the class period of Oct. 19, 1998, to Nov. 7, 2001,=
 but that all 10 individual defendants conspired with guilty knowledge to c=
onvey false and misleading information through public filings, press releas=
es and other publications to inflate the company stock.=20
They all directly participated in the management of company, were directly =
involved in its day-to-day operations at the highest levels and were privy =
to confidential proprietary information concerning the company and its busi=
ness operations, the complaint said. As a result of their actions, Enron's =
stock price rose from $43.43 per share on Jan. 3, 2000, to $83.12 per share=
 by Dec. 29, 2000.=20
Financial analysts attributed the price rise to the growth and expectations=
 for Enron's Broadband Services Division but unbeknownst to investors, the =
division was experiencing declining demand and financial losses.=20
The defendants knowingly falsified Enron's financial statements by eliminat=
ing unprofitable and debt-ridden subsidiaries from the statements and they =
also lied about the success of the broadband efforts, causing Enron's asset=
s to be overstated in 2000 and 2001 by as much as $1 billion, the plaintiff=
s assert.=20
In particular, the plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants, with t=
he help of Arthur Andersen's accountants, kept the losses of its subsidiary=
 Joint Energy Development Investments off the books and improperly lent $13=
2 million to a second company, Chewco Investments, so it could purchase JED=
I stock for $383 million. (The acronym JEDI is a play on the name of the kn=
ights in the Star Wars movies while the name Chewco is a play on Chewbacca,=
 the name of one of the characters in those movies.)=20
Arthur Andersen falsely represented that Enron's financial statements for 1=
997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 were prepared and presented in accordance with gen=
erally accepted auditing practices and that the accounting company also con=
sented to the incorporation of its false statements in Enron's Form 10-Ks f=
or those years and in Enron's prospectuses for several securities offerings=
.=20
The financial house of cards came apart on Nov. 8, 2001, when the company a=
nnounced that it was restating its revenues for 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and =
the first two quarters of 2001 to correct for errors that inflated the comp=
any's net income by $591 million. Following that announcement, the price of=
 Enron's common stock fell from a high of $90.75 during the class period to=
 a low of $8.20 before closing on Nov. 8 at $8.41.=20
The plaintiffs allege violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchang=
e Act and Rule 10b-5 for deceiving the investing public regarding Enron's b=
usiness operations, management and value to sell more than $2 billion in co=
mmon stock and other kinds of securities offered during the class period.=
=20
The complaint also alleges violation of Section 20(a) of the Securities Exc=

knowledge and ability to prevent the issuance of false statements or to cau=

The plaintiffs are seeking class certification, compensatory damages for al=

Enron hid behind smoke and mirrors

.

Four years ago, Asia was lectured by the West on the deficiencies of its co=
rporate disclosure and accounting regimes.=20
Witnessing the US$60 billion bankruptcy of Enron last month, the region cou=
ld be forgiven a moment of schadenfreude.
Dubious accounting and disclosure practices were at the heart of Enron's de=
mise. Evidently, Asia does not have a monopoly in this area.=20
Texas-based Enron used to be a power firm, pumping gas and electricity to c=
ustomers in the United States and around the world. Then it transmogrified =
into a wholly more stylish animal, befitting the spirit of the trendy dotco=
m in the 1990s.=20
Real assets were no longer in vogue: the smartest companies, as the Interne=
t revolution demonstrated, made money out of thin air, through the power of=
 their intellect and creativity.=20
Enron became a purveyor of "energy services", making markets in everything =
from coal and lumber to bandwidth. The pipelines became incidental. The sto=
ck market applauded, and Enron's shares surged from US$20 to US$90 between =
1997 and 2000.=20
As its stock rose, Enron's financial statements became more complex until, =
it seemed, no one could work out how the company made money anymore.=20
Those seeking enlightenment were given short shrift by Enron's senior execu=
tives. Anyone with the temerity to ask just didn't "get it".=20
Analysts may have been similarly in the dark, but were not about to stand i=
n the way of a Wall Street darling that delivered the holy grail of smoothl=
y increasing earnings.=20
Meanwhile, auditors Arthur Andersen continued to sign off on financial stat=
ements that showed Enron to be a robust and fast-growing company - until it=
s collapse.=20
There are lessons in the Enron debacle that reach beyond the US.=20
Asian investors swept up in the early 1990s by the story of the region's in=
evitable ascendancy will recognise the mixture of hype and hubris that kept=
 observers from asking the difficult questions and Enron from answering the=
m.=20
The Asian financial crisis exposed structural weaknesses that caused system=
ic collapses. By contrast, the fallout from Enron's bankruptcy, while painf=
ul to some (particularly employees who had their pensions invested in the c=
ompany's stock), will be far more limited.=20
The most far-reaching impact is likely to be felt by the auditing professio=
n. Faith in the integrity of financial statements has been shaken, as admit=
ted by Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino.=20
That phenomenon is global. Showing up the deficiencies of balance sheets in=
 Indonesia or Thailand is one thing. But when a giant multinational in supp=
osedly the world's best-regulated market produces financial statements that=
 patently were not worth the paper they were written on, users are entitled=
 to ask: who can we trust?=20
Still, if the morals of the Enron case are heeded, it will have served a us=
eful purpose.=20
First, if a company's accounts are too complex to understand, maybe that is=
 because the company has something to hide, rather than reflecting a defici=
ency of intelligence on the part of investors.=20
Second, if senior executives treat requests for clarification with disdainf=
ul arrogance, perhaps that is because they have something to hide, rather t=
han the questions being foolish.=20
Third, no rules are perfect. While Andersen's role in Enron is the subject =
of debate, a company determined to bend accounting rules in its favour will=
 always find a way to do so. But, as the collapse shows, the truth will out=
 eventually, which leads to Moral No 4: if something looks too good to be t=
rue, it is. Investors believed in Enron's magic dust because they wanted to=
.=20
Scepticism is invariably the first casualty of bull markets. Investors disc=
ard it at their peril.=20

The POWER of CHOICE / It is the dawning of deregulation in Texas, allowing =
consumers to choose their electricity provider - and get a rate reduction a=
s well.
NELSON ANTOSH

Starting today, deregulation of electricity officially arrives in Texas.=20
For the first time, consumers in much of the state can chose their electric=
ity provider. And regardless of whether the customers switch or not, they w=
ill get a rate reduction as of today.
The combination of a 6 percent cut in the base rate for power - as required=
 by state law - plus the impact of lower fuel costs for generating will bri=
ng the total reduction for residential customers in the Houston area to abo=
ut 17 percent.=20
Deregulation of electricity is ready to move onto a mass scale after seven =
years in the planning and seven months of testing, said Terri Waggoner, spo=
keswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, also known as Ercot=
.=20
"All systems are go," adds Brett Perlman, a commissioner on the Public Util=
ity Commission of Texas.=20
But don't expect the promotion floodgates to open today, said Janee Briesem=
eister, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union in Austin.=20
The telephone calls, mailers and television ads will build up gradually. Th=
at's the way it happened in other states. Switching on a broad scale could =
take as long as three years.=20
No customer is forced to do anything. "If all goes well, they shouldn't not=
ice anything different with their service," Briesemeister said.=20
For instance, a customer of Reliant Energy HL&P who decides to do nothing w=
ill automatically become a customer of a competitive supplier known as Reli=
ant Energy Residential Services.=20
Since midsummer, a limited number of residential customers, about 115,000 i=
n the state, have been part of a pilot program to shake out the bugs in the=
 system.=20
Now that deregulation is officially here, an estimated 4.7 million househol=
ds in the state are eligible to participate. As of Dec. 17, nearly 20,000 h=
ad signed up and were waiting for deregulation to arrive before they switch=
 over, according to officials.=20
A sizable chunk of Texas is outside the program. Municipal power sysems, su=
ch as those in Austin and San Antonio, and rural electric cooperatives are =
taking a wait-and-see attitude before deciding if they wll opt in to compet=
ition.=20
The nearest parallel is deregulation of long-distance telephone service.=20
However there is one important difference - the rules are designed to avoid=
 one of the big annoyances of telephone competion, unauthorized switches, b=
etter known as slamming, said Terry Hadley, public information officer for =
the PUC.=20
You will get a postcard in the mail asking if you did, indeed, decide to sw=
itch before anything is done.=20
In Houston, at least 10 companies will be making their sales pitches to res=
idential customers. The number is even larger when you include companies ta=
rgeting commercial and industrial users who use more power.=20
Although there will be a rate decrease for all customers involved in deregu=
lation, it might not show up until the second bill of this year because of =
meter reading cycles, Briesemeister said.=20
Similarly, the time it takes to switch from one company to another could be=
 as long as 45 days because of meter reading cycles.=20
One of the things to watch out for is late payment fees, of up to 5 percent=
. Until now these charges were not permitted for investor- owned power comp=
anies involving residential accounts.=20
Customers also need to be aware of cancellation fees that may be a part of =
contracts, she said.=20
The state's job in this process is to inform electricity customers about su=
ch things as electricity facts labels, which like the label on a can of bea=
ns, allows an apples-to-apples comparison of costs between companies.=20
People already know quite a lot about deregulation, said the PUC's Perlman.=
 He routinely asks people in the grocery store, who say they are aware of d=
eregulation and have placed it "on their list of things to do."=20
There were some glitches in the pilot program, but it was intended as a lea=
rning experience, Perlman said.=20
The measure of success is lower costs, which means that deregulation is alr=
eady working, said Ercot President and Chief Executive Tom Noel.=20
Cities ranging in size from Houston and Dallas to Corpus Christi will parti=
cipate in electric deregulation.=20
There already have been some disappointments.=20
Shell, for instance, was an early player and one of the most aggressive but=
 decided it didn't want to be in the electric retail business. The number o=
f customers involved in the pilot could have been larger by another 100,000=
 or so if Shell hadn't pulled out, Noel said.=20
Any fears about reliability of service are laid to rest by the state's deci=
ding to keep the distribution system - the lines and poles - regulated, acc=
ording to Hadley.=20
Texas planners say they will avoid the fiasco of California where the whole=
sale electric sales was deregulated but retail prices were capped. When the=
 cost of power surged because there weren't enough electric plants to keep =
up with demand, electric companies were not allowed to pass on all those co=
st increases to consumers.=20

Investing/Word On The Street
Enron: The Lessons For Investors; Hindsight, shmindsight. There's much to l=
earn when a stock loses $67 billion in value.
Lisa Gibbs, Jeff Nash and Nick Pachetti

(Copyright 2002)

It seems hard to believe now, but Enron (ENE) used to be the envy of corpor=
ate America. In less than a decade, the Houston company transformed itself =
from stodgy gas-pipeline operation to natural gas and electricity trading p=
owerhouse. Dazzled by sizzling earnings growth, giddy investors bid up Enro=
n's shares 312% in two years to a high of $90.75 in 2000. Then someone turn=
ed out the lights. Beset by marketplace woes and management mishaps, the st=
ock already had tumbled 53% when chief executive Jeffrey Skilling stunned i=
nvestors by resigning last August. After that, the bad news came at hypersp=
eed: $1.2 billion in shareholder equity zapped by risky hedging deals, a Se=
curities and Exchange Commission probe, a last- chance merger with rival Dy=
negy called off and, finally, a bankruptcy filing. By the end of November, =
the stock had plummeted to 26[cents], obliterating $67 billion in market ca=
p--a shocking fall for a company that just last year occupied the No. 7 spo=
t on the Fortune 500.=20
Perhaps most incredible, however, about the Enron debacle is how long inves=
tors hung on to the belief that everything would turn out fine. As recently=
 as MONEY's October issue, our Ultimate Investment Club's Abby Joseph Cohen=
 of Goldman Sachs was calling Enron a "good value." If pros like Cohen got =
it wrong, how could the average investor have discerned the disaster in tim=
e? Sure, hindsight is marvelous. But along Enron's fast track to penny stoc=
k, there were red flags for informed shareholders that all was not as it se=
emed.
Out-of-control valuation. In 2000, investors levitated Enron's stock to a l=
ofty price/earnings ratio of 69 times that year's earnings on the belief th=
at forays into sexy-sounding online energy trading and broadband businesses=
 could sustain supercharged earnings growth. Skilling was telling Wall Stre=
et that Enron's broadband biz alone deserved $37 a share, and investors see=
med to buy it, despite the fact that the unit was unproved and unprofitable=
. His outlandish valuation of broadband drew an early "hold" rating from an=
alyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in March 2000. "An energy compa=
ny trading at the multiple Enron was," Meade explains today, "should have b=
een cause for eyebrows to be raised."=20
The lesson? Pay attention to the P/E even after you buy a stock. Whenever t=
he valuation starts to climb, you should stop and question whether the comp=
any can sustain the sales and earnings growth expected of it.=20
Insider selling. In 2000, then CEO Kenneth Lay netted $66.3 million from ex=
ercising stock options and selling the shares, while Skilling scored $60.7 =
million, roughly double the amounts the year before. By the end of June 200=
1, 16 members of Enron's top management had sold $164 million in shares, re=
ports Thomson Financial Network. While insider sales don't automatically sp=
ell trouble for a company-- executives often have valid reasons for raising=
 cash--the selling at Enron was prolific. And the fact that selling persist=
ed even as the stock fell throughout 2001 was a "screaming red flag," says =
Thomson analyst Paul Elliott. If Skilling and Lay believed the stock was un=
dervalued--as they repeatedly told investors--then why were they cashing in=
? Executive stock trades are easy for ordinary investors to follow: The Wal=
l Street Journal regularly publishes insider trading tables, and websites s=
uch as Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com) list insider trades for each stock=
.=20
Obfuscations. Enron's trading business is extremely complex, and analysts a=
dmit they didn't always understand what Enron was doing. That said, the com=
pany seemed to go out of its way to obfuscate. "I've never seen such compli=
cated disclosures," says Michael Heim, an A.G. Edwards energy analyst. "It =
was hard to follow the movement of money."=20
When pushed to reveal more, management was often tight-lipped and unprofess=
ional. During one famous conference call last April, Skilling called an ana=
lyst an "asshole" for complaining about the company's failure to provide a =
balance sheet with its earnings announcement. Prudential Securities' Carol =
Coale points to rumors in late September of an SEC investigation. "When I a=
sked Enron about an investigation, they said there was no investigation," s=
ays Coale. Once it was revealed that the SEC was conducting an inquiry, she=
 says Enron returned to her with a feeble excuse: "They said, 'Well, you di=
dn't ask about an inquiry.'"=20
The typical investor isn't privy to such conversations, although more and m=
ore company conference calls are in fact being opened to the general public=
. But the larger point (famously stated by Warren Buffett) is this: If you =
don't understand what a company does, don't invest in it. There's a corolla=
ry to that too: If management refuses to fill in holes and keeps investors =
in the dark, run.=20
Fishy filings. Investors who read Enron's quarterly SEC filing in the summe=
r of 1999 would have noticed a new entry under the heading "Related Party T=
ransactions." The item noted that Enron was doing business with a private p=
artnership whose general partner was led by a "senior officer of Enron." A =
proxy filed in May 2000 revealed that the senior officer was Enron CFO Andr=
ew Fastow, and that not one but two partnerships existed.=20
Possible conflicts of interest--is the CFO looking out for Enron or himself=
?--should have turned heads. But even professional money managers like thos=
e at Janus, enthralled by Enron's opportunities, overlooked the partnership=
s as the funds built up their stakes. As late as Sept. 28, with Enron at $2=
7.25, Janus owned 41.3 million shares, which it has since dumped.=20
To be fair, Enron revealed little about the partnerships and their function=
--to divert from Enron's balance sheet the debt from new acquisitions--as w=
ell as the extent to which the companies were in bed together. Besides, bac=
k then the stock was going gangbusters and earnings looked great; the partn=
erships seemed like small potatoes. Even the stock's few critics weren't pa=
ying much attention. Recalls Meade of Commerzbank: "It was difficult to see=
 that there were significant liabilities associated with this."=20
Attitudes began changing after Enron filed its first quarterly report of 20=
01, which said it was entering into complicated and risky derivatives trans=
actions that involved an $827 million loan to one of the partnerships. Whoa=
, some analysts said. "You started to see in the footnotes some pretty larg=
e sums of money," says Tara Gately, energy analyst for Loomis Sayles funds.=
 "It raised questions, and there were really no good answers."=20
Yes, this is complicated stuff and, yes, there wasn't enough information, b=
ut you don't have to be a big-deal financial analyst to know that the CFO i=
n a side business is smelly stuff.=20
Executive departures. When the chief executive--someone who spent a decade =
moving up the ladder and building the company's core energy- trading busine=
ss--flees after just six months at the helm, you've got a problem. Skilling=
, 47 at the time, called it a "purely personal" decision. "That was the wor=
st excuse I've ever heard," scoffs John Hammerschmidt, a fund manager at Tu=
rner Investments. If top management resigns for unclear reasons, consider s=
elling. Hammerschmidt didn't even hesitate in this case: "As soon as I hear=
d that, I dumped my shares."=20
One red flag does not necessarily a disaster make. More often it's a succes=
sion of little somethings that ultimately tells you: It could get real ugly=
 here. The trick is to put aside your enthusiasm for a stock. That's probab=
ly the hardest thing for any investor to do. But as Enron's meltdown shows,=
 the homework isn't over once you buy the stock.=20
