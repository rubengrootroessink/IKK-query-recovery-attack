Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower=20
=20
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower  yesterday in uninspire=
d trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's  surprising high=
 storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local  and short-t=
erm traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price  discovery=
. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could  initia=
te sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays  l=
ackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August=
  also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported sto=
rage  levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 4=
6 Bcf more  than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, muc=
h of the eastern  half of the nation will have more summer-like weather thi=
s weekend and early  next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, bu=
t will not be unusually  high for early June. Hot weather in the southweste=
rn states will begin to move  into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look =
for the market to continue to slip  lower in the absence of any significant=
 driving force. There needs to be  something to change the dynamics of the =
market, but in the meantime, most  everybody is on the same page, and the l=
ocals are simply trying to pick each  other's pockets. The next key level o=
f technical support is $3.60, with $4.00  and $4.20 offering resistance. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery across the US  dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MM=
Btu, except out west where prices continued to  tumble. Canadian spot price=
s rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural  gas for next day delive=
ry at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per  MMBtu.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices
=20
    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate  Governmental Affairs Commit=
tee says he will examine FERCs refusal to cap  wholesale power prices in we=
stern states. Following the recent shift in control  of the Senate to Democ=
rats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that  the FERC has faile=
d to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the  matter. Presiden=
t Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price  caps, arguin=
g they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do  nothin=
g to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and  =
any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation,  Li=
eberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of  der=
egulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of =
 the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into t=
he oil  industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices. =20

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas
=20
    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural  gas volumes f=
rom shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian  Petroleum and P=
enn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to  investigate whether=
 natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep  can be produce=
d economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas  production from coal=
 seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135  Tcf and 260 Tcf=
 of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least  17 Tcf ha=
ve been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market  will=
 cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say  =
many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lin=
es,  meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Ar=
ctic  reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years resear=
ching ways  to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million =
to proceed with a  pilot project.=20

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues
=20
    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by  El Paso is sti=
ll proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the  California PUC =
have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing  looks no cl=
oser to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to  discredit =
a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant  hired by=
 Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It  du=
tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular=
  market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spr=
eads.  As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of pol=
itical  economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Br=
attle's tale  doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 cond=
itions must be met:  * The system for getting gas to California must not be=
 full; * El Paso Merchant  must have unutilized, but available, delivery ri=
ghts; and * Other shippers must  have fully utilized their delivery rights.=
 The final condition, he says proves  that market power is impossible to es=
tablish. =20
