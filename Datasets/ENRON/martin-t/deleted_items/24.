Corporate turnaround expert Stephen F. Cooper likes to rate restructuring j=
obs on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most difficult.=20
"I would rather work on a 10 than a 4," he told the Toronto Globe and Mail =
two years ago as he took over at Burlington, Ont.-based Laidlaw Inc. -- par=
ent of the Greyhound bus line -- shortly before it entered bankruptcy.
Now he may have has his "10" -- at bankrupt Enron Corp., where Cooper was n=
amed interim chief executive yesterday. He replaces company founder Kenneth=
 L. Lay, who resigned last week under pressure from creditors.=20
Cooper said his group will start immediately.=20
"Our focus is on the future of Enron," he said in a statement released by E=
nron. "With more than 19,000 employees worldwide, Enron has real businesses=
 with real value. We will work closely with the board of directors, managem=
ent and the creditors committee to develop a reorganization plan to maximiz=
e value for the company's stakeholders."=20
Whether Enron will survive in any form is highly uncertain, however. The co=
mpany has at least $40 billion in debt, with the full extent of its liabili=
ties from hundreds of partnerships and related companies as yet unknown. In=
 addition, most of its known assets are heavily mortgaged, and some of its =
viable operations have already been sold off.=20
Enron's cornerstone energy-trading operation was sold earlier this month to=
 UBS Warburg, a Swiss bank, and Enron announced yesterday that its presiden=
t and chief operating officer, Lawrence G. Whalley, had resigned to go with=
 UBS Warburg. Earlier, Enron ceded control of its largest pipeline to its H=
ouston-based rival, Dynegy Inc. And yesterday, Enron agreed to sell its Lon=
don-based metals-trading unit for $145 million to Sempra Energy.=20
It is possible all of Enron's remaining assets will also have to be sold to=
 pay creditors, and some experts said Cooper's main challenge may be hammer=
ing out an agreement among creditors on how to divide up the proceeds.=20
As managing principal of Zolfo Cooper LLC, a New York and Los Angeles-based=
 firm specializing in the reorganization of corporations in bankruptcy or o=
ther difficult circumstances, Cooper has worked with such troubled companie=
s as Macy's parent Federated Department Stores Inc., appliance maker Sunbea=
m Corp. and construction firm Morrison Knudsen.=20
The firm "has terrific cachet in the workout community," said Stephen H. Ca=
se of the Washington office of Dave, Polk & Wardwell. "They are very much i=
n demand and highly respected."=20
Cooper is known as blunt-spoken, pulling no punches about what a company ou=
ght to do to survive, and creative in coming up with strategies to achieve =
those goals.=20
And as an executive who tries to rescue companies in extremis, he has won s=
ome and lost some.=20
One of his biggest victories was at Federated, which filed for Chapter 11 p=
rotection in 1990 and emerged two years later. Federated owns Bloomingdale'=
s and other department-store chains as well as Macy's.=20
Federated, once owned by Canadian developer Robert Campeau, was a basically=
 solid business that was overwhelmed by junk-bond debt from the 1980s takeo=
ver binge. Cooper was able to cobble together a large retail firm from the =
wreckage and have it in the black by late 1992.=20
At the other end of the scale, Bradlees, a chain of discount department sto=
res operating in the Northeast, turned out not to be viable and was liquida=
ted, with unsecured creditors receiving 22 cents on the dollar.=20
Cooper is a graduate of Occidental College and holds an MBA from the Wharto=
n School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was not available for commen=
t yesterday.

Accounting for Enron: Enron Selects Cooper of Zolfo Cooper For Post of Acti=
ng CEO, Succeeding Lay
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. said it named Stephen Cooper, a principal at New York restructu=
ring firm Zolfo Cooper, as acting chief executive officer, succeeding Kenne=
th Lay, who resigned from the embattled energy concern last week.=20
In his new role, Mr. Cooper, 55 years old, faces the daunting challenge of =
shepherding Enron through the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. The =
appointment had been expected. Enron still employs some 19,000 people, alth=
ough the company has been mired in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court proceedings =
since last month, which shields it from creditors as it attempts to reorgan=
ize.
Meantime, Enron's board is continuing to search for a chairman, a position =
also held by Mr. Lay. Those close to the matter say that Enron is seeking s=
omeone with a high public stature. The idea is for this person to be someth=
ing of an ambassador to Congress, which now has nearly a dozen committees i=
nvestigating Enron's business practices.=20
Mr. Cooper, who declined an interview request yesterday, is expected to run=
 Enron on a day-to-day basis and help it navigate the bankruptcy process. I=
t is expected that he will leave the post if the company emerges from bankr=
uptcy proceedings. Previously, Enron noted, he has worked on the bankruptcy=
 proceedings of Laidlaw Inc., Morrison Knudsen Corp., Sunbeam Corp., Federa=
ted Department Stores Inc., as well as many other big-name Chapter 11 cases=
.=20
Those who know Mr. Cooper describe him as an energetic deal maker who is go=
od at getting to the crux of issues. In a room filled with suit-and-tie-cla=
d bankruptcy attorneys, Mr. Cooper often stands out for his casual dress. W=
hen discussions get contentious, he is known to defuse the tension with hum=
or then redirects discussions back in the direction of solutions.=20
"He's a very interesting person, and I can't say that about a lot of the pe=
ople you deal with when you're in bankruptcy," said Peter Widdrington, chai=
rman of Laidlaw, the big Toronto-based transportation company that operates=
 school buses in the U.S. and Canada and owns Greyhound bus lines. Laidlaw =
filed for bankruptcy protection last summer, and Mr. Cooper has been advisi=
ng it on how to emerge from court proceedings.=20
Mr. Widdrington said Mr. Cooper has indicated that he will continue to work=
 20 hours a week for Laidlaw, as specified in his contract. "I'm not unconc=
erned about the fact he's now working with Enron," said Mr. Widdrington, bu=
t he added that others at Mr. Cooper's firm are capable of "stepping in."=
=20
Some observers wonder whether Mr. Cooper will, for all his talents, be able=
 to lead Enron out of bankruptcy; they speculate that the company could wel=
l be liquidated in the end. In all, Enron's bankrupt entities have liabilit=
ies exceeding $30 billion.=20
Mr. Cooper will work most closely with Jeff McMahon, Enron's chief financia=
l officer, who yesterday was named president and chief operating officer, a=
nd with Ray Bowen, formerly treasurer, who will step into Mr. McMahon's fin=
ance job.=20
Greg Whalley, named president of Enron last summer by Mr. Lay, has resigned=
 to take a senior level job at UBS AG's UBS Warburg, which this month bough=
t Enron's energy-trading business.=20
Separately, Texas Deputy Attorney General Jeff Boyd filed a motion in the U=
.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York -- where Enron's =
case is being heard -- asking the court to appoint an additional creditors =
committee to represent the interests of former and retired Enron employees.=
=20
"While the major financial creditors of Enron have a right to adequate repr=
esentation in the bankruptcy case, so do the thousands of former and retire=
d Enron employees who are the least able, on an individual basis, to partic=
ipate meaningfully in this case," Mr. Boyd said in a statement.=20
Meanwhile, Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, =
said it will pay $145 million for Enron's London-based metals trading busin=
ess, formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd. The transaction, subject to final aud=
it, is expected to be completed by Feb. 4. Don Felsinger, head of Sempra's =
unregulated operations, said the Enron unit has been profitable "since its =
inception . . . and we expect this track record of success to continue."=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TURNAROUND EFFORT
Enron Names an Interim Chief to Oversee Its Bankruptcy
By SHAILA K. DEWAN With JENNIFER 8. LEE

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 29 -- Enron today named Stephen F. Cooper, a specialist in re=
vamping troubled companies, to lead it through the largest bankruptcy in th=
e nation's history.=20
Mr. Cooper, who will serve as Enron's interim chief executive, fills the to=
p position vacated by Kenneth L. Lay, who resigned last Wednesday as chief =
executive and chairman under pressure from the company's creditors.
Enron is still searching for a chairman, who will serve as the political fa=
ce of the company in Washington, where it is being investigated by Congress=
, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.=20
Mr. Cooper, 55, has been involved in prominent bankruptcies, including thos=
e of Federated Department Stores and Trans World Airlines. But sorting out =
Enron's tangled and opaque finances will be the biggest challenge of his ca=
reer, bankruptcy experts said.=20
Enron also named Jeffrey McMahon president and chief operating officer. He =
succeeds Lawrence G. Whalley, who resigned to take a position with UBS Warb=
urg, which bought the energy trading business that was once the centerpiece=
 of Enron's success.=20
Mr. McMahon, who was named in a letter by a former employee, Sherron S. Wat=
kins, as one executive who complained about the company's conflicts of inte=
rest, became chief financial officer after the forced resignation in Octobe=
r of Andrew S. Fastow, who managed some of the partnerships that helped bri=
ng the company to ruin. Raymond M. Bowen Jr., formerly the treasurer, was a=
ppointed executive vice president and chief financial officer.=20
Mr. Cooper, a managing partner at Zolfo Cooper, a boutique advisory firm fo=
r companies in trouble, was the leading candidate to replace Mr. Lay. In se=
lecting candidates for the Enron board to interview, the creditors committe=
e decided to focus on specialists in corporate turnarounds, rather than chi=
ef executives with marquee names.=20
''Our focus is on the future of Enron,'' Mr. Cooper said in a statement. ''=
Enron has real businesses with real value. We will work closely with the bo=
ard of directors, management and the creditors committee to develop a reorg=
anization plan to maximize value for the company's stakeholders.''=20
Mr. Cooper is known for his ability to balance the interests of warring fac=
tions.=20
''He's a person who can get in there and see where the bodies are buried an=
d see what things are needed to calm the waters,'' said Sandra E. Mayerson,=
 a bankruptcy lawyer at Holland & Knight who represents several of Enron's =
smaller creditors.=20
Still, some creditors not represented on the committee reacted with only a =
cautious optimism, praising the naming of an outsider to run the company bu=
t noting that the terms of Mr. Cooper's contract, which calls for him to be=
 paid an hourly wage with a bonus if he meets certain goals, have not yet b=
een made public.=20
''We're going to keep an open mind as to Mr. Cooper and his team,'' said Da=
vid Bennett, a lawyer who represents a group of oil and gas companies owed =
about $100 million. ''To have someone with restructuring experience is a go=
od thing.''=20
While a few creditors have asked for a court-appointed trustee to oversee t=
he reorganization, some said that the choice of an outsider might satisfy t=
hem. ''He's going to bring credibility to the situation,'' Ms. Mayerson sai=
d. ''I think if you hadn't gotten him involved in management, there would h=
ave been movement for an examiner or a trustee. He can serve that function =
as well as the C.E.O. function. So you are getting two functions for the pr=
ice of one.''=20
A lawyer for the Wiser Oil Company, another creditor that has asked for a t=
rustee, declined to comment.=20
Some bankruptcy experts have questioned Mr. Cooper's lack of experience as =
a chief executive. But Mr. Cooper's defenders point out that what is needed=
 in Enron's case is someone intimately familiar with bankruptcy, not someon=
e who can lead or innovate in the context of a healthy company.=20
''He's a person who knows the ins and outs of restructuring and a person wh=
o knows the ins and outs of forensic accounting,'' said Deborah Hicks Midan=
ek, a principal for Glass & Associates, a Zolfo competitor.=20
Mr. Cooper began work today, sending Enron employees a voice mail message p=
raising the work force and expressing confidence that the company would eve=
ntually emerge from bankruptcy in some form. But many outside experts maint=
ain that Enron may have little choice but to sell its viable businesses and=
 eventually shut down.=20
Mr. Cooper has largely avoided the spotlight, even as he has advised or man=
aged well-known companies in crisis.=20
He grew up in Indiana and received his M.B.A. from the Wharton School in 19=
70. At the accounting firm of Touche Ross, now a part of Deloitte & Touche,=
 he and Frank Zolfo, now retired, founded the reorganization advisory group=
 and were early advocates for bankruptcy as an area of specialty.=20
In the early 1990's, Mr. Cooper served as an adviser to Federated, the owne=
r of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, as it worked through its bankruptcy. In par=
t because of the aggressive timelines Mr. Cooper set, the Federated bankrup=
tcy proceeding took only two years instead of the five years that some anal=
ysts had predicted.=20
He also served as an adviser in two of T.W.A.'s bankruptcies.=20
Even as he takes the Enron job, Mr. Cooper continues to serve as vice chair=
man and chief restructuring officer of the Canadian conglomerate Laidlaw In=
c., the largest North American ground transportation company, whose holding=
s include Greyhound Lines. Though he was called in to help the debt-burdene=
d company stave off bankruptcy in 2000, Laidlaw filed for protection from c=
reditors in June 2001.=20
''When we did eventually file for bankruptcy, we did it in a very orderly b=
asis, and that had a lot to do with his efforts,'' said Peter Widdrington, =
the chairman of Laidlaw. Mr. Cooper cleared a major obstacle by negotiating=
 a recent $55.4 million settlement, announced two weeks ago, in a class- ac=
tion lawsuit against Laidlaw.=20
On a scale of one to 10, Mr. Cooper told a Canadian newspaper, he rated Lai=
dlaw a 4 for complexity. ''I would rather work on a 10 than a 4,'' he said.=
=20
Enron, then, is his wish come true.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TV INTERVIEW
Did NBC Let Lay's Wife Get Around Hard Issues?
By FELICITY BARRINGER

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Lisa Myers, the NBC Capitol Hill correspondent long known as tough-minded, =
left much of her aggressive edge at the door on Saturday when she did an ex=
clusive interview with the wife of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chief executi=
ve of Enron.=20
As a result, Linda Lay felt comfortable enough to say that she and her husb=
and, who took home about $200 million worth of cash and stock the last four=
 years, ''are fighting for liquidity.''
''We don't want to go bankrupt,'' she added. ''Other than the home we live =
in, everything else is for sale.''=20
So should Ms. Myers earn praise from her colleagues for eliciting such a ne=
wsworthy -- and, to former Enron employees, infuriating -- statement? Or di=
d she shirk her duty by failing to grill Mrs. Lay on the details of where a=
ll the money went, accepting the answer: ''There's nothing left. Everything=
 we had mostly was in Enron stock.''=20
For 10 minutes on Monday on the NBC News program ''Today'' and for another =
6 minutes yesterday, Mrs. Lay, the couple's children, Mr. Lay's former wife=
 and his pastor were given a platform to praise the integrity of the man wh=
o Ms. Myers said in a separate report ''led Enron to great heights and to r=
uin.''=20
Ms. Myers, while challenging Mrs. Lay in general terms on issues like Mr. L=
ay's responsibility for Enron's collapse, gave the Lay family plenty of roo=
m to make the case for him, free of prosecutory inquiry.=20
This led some journalists and media critics to ask whether the network and =
one of its sharp-edged correspondents had become soft.=20
Ken Auletta, who covers media companies for The New Yorker, said: ''Lisa My=
ers has proven over the years that she knows how to ask tough questions and=
 be in-your-face aggressive. With this she proved she has another pitch, to=
 draw people out.''=20
He added: ''That's commendable. But there's another pitch, a combination of=
 solicitous and tough questions. We didn't see that third pitch'' in the in=
terview, he said.=20
But Richard Wald, a former ABC News executive who is now a professor at the=
 Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said aggression was oft=
en counterproductive. ''What you wanted was a sense of what this woman was =
like,'' Mr. Wald said. ''I had the feeling she shot herself in the foot.''=
=20
One core question raised by critics was how much leeway an interviewer shou=
ld give when the only person who can be enticed before the camera's eye is =
a surrogate -- a wife, a friend, a child -- for the newsmaker the journalis=
t really wants to interview. ''She's not a main character in the drama,'' M=
r. Wald said, ''she's a peripheral character now putting herself forward.''=
=20
Don Hewitt, executive producer of the CBS News program ''60 Minutes,'' had =
not seen the interview, but said: ''When you invite somebody in and you mak=
e it apparent that you want to discuss the business at hand, there are no g=
round rules. If she knows that much about what he made and what they lost a=
nd what they don't have, she's qualified to answer all the rest of the ques=
tions.''=20
Ms. Myers said: ''I dealt with her on the broad strokes of every significan=
t issue of potential misconduct that had been raised about her husband. But=
 you cannot go into all the minutiae.''=20
A second question, Ms. Myers and Mr. Wald say, is the extent to which relen=
tless critical scrutiny can and should be balanced with sympathetic coverag=
e.=20
In another report this month, Ms. Myers captured the tone and substance of =
much of her Enron coverage. In it, she described an optimistic Mr. Lay sayi=
ng in October that ''we had a good strong quarter.'' Ms. Myers followed by =
saying: ''Six weeks later, Enron laid off 4,000 employees and declared bank=
ruptcy, costing thousands of workers their life savings. Tonight, Enron had=
 no comment on why it didn't level with the public last fall.''=20
Ms. Myers said yesterday that she and the network should be judged by ''the=
 totality of the coverage.''=20
Last night, a Myers report on the defense of Mr. Lay's family included crit=
ical commentary by business experts. Another NBC reporter, Jim Avila, also =
reported on the Lay's $10 million in real estate holdings and $5 million in=
 stock and interviewed an Enron employee who was incredulous about Mrs. Lay=
's claim that her family was nearly broke.=20
As for the amount of time given to the defense of Mr. Lay, she said, ''We w=
anted to let the family make all the points they wanted to make -- they hav=
e a right to be heard from -- the amount of time they've gotten for their p=
oint of view has been dwarfed by the hours and hours of critical coverage.'=

Ill. Regulators Vote To Remove Enron Energy-Sale Rights

By Jon Kamp
CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--The Illinois Commerce Commission approved an order Tue=
sday to strip an Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit of its right to sell electricity =
to retail customers in the state.=20
Illinois law requires retail electric providers such as Enron Energy Servic=
es to be backed by a company with at least an investment-grade credit ratin=
g. Major ratings firms dropped Enron to below that level last November, and=
 while EES has maintained hundreds of customers around the U.S. despite joi=
ning its parent in bankruptcy court, it is missing needed criteria to opera=
te in Illinois, the ICC said.=20
"As a result of Enron's ratings downgrades, EES can no longer rely on the E=
nron guarantee to demonstrate that it is in compliance" with state law, the=
 ICC said in its order.=20
Enron's certificate won't be immediately revoked. Instead, Tuesday's order =
starts a process in which an administrative law judge will review the issue=
, and will give Enron an undermined amount of time to show why it should re=
tain its certificate, ICC spokesman Beth Bosch said.=20
The commission said in its order that EES was notified Nov. 30 that it had =
30 days to demonstrate it had financial resources to meet the state's crite=
ria. But EES hasn't provided any documentation since then, the order said.=
=20
An EES representative didn't return repeated calls seeking comment.=20
ICC Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer said EES has already informally suggested =
it will voluntarily give up its right to serve retail customers in Illinois=
.=20
"My understanding is that they have offered to relinquish the certificate,"=
 Kretschmer said in an interview.=20
But Kretschmer still expects there will be a review process to determine ex=
actly how Tuesday's order impacts EES' ability to do business in Illinois. =
While the company had dozens of Chicago-area customers before its parent's =
collapse, including the city of Chicago and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker =
Oats Co., the ICC said EES wasn't actually supplying electricity for any of=
 its Illinois customers.=20
Instead, EES was acting as a billing agent and manager, helping mostly larg=
e commercial and industrial customers manage their energy use and restructu=
re deals with local utilities, such as Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) Commonwealth Ed=
ison Co. Kretschmer said it is unclear whether EES needs the retail electri=
city provider to serve in such a capacity.=20
"We probably won't have an answer until we go through the (review) process,=
" Kretschmer said.=20
While EES may not have directly served customers with power, some energy ma=
nagement deals were a foothold to later energy provider service. In its eig=
ht-year contract signed with the city of Chicago last summer, for example, =
Enron was to provide management services for the first few years and then a=
ctual electricity for the remainder of the deal.=20
The city of Chicago canceled its Enron deal in early December. Quaker Oats,=
 the University of Chicago and the Archdiocese of Chicago have also backed =
out of their EES contracts in the wake of Enron's financial troubles.=20
EES was a large player in Illinois' young, deregulated retail electric mark=
etplace, but Kretschmer said she doesn't see its withdrawal hindering the g=
rowth of competition.=20
"There are a number of other big players that can pick up what Enron lost,"=
 she said. "I don't think it will have a negative impact here."=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

(This article was originally published Tuesday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Members of Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of director=
s are expected to be asked next week to testify before the House Energy and=
 Commerce Committee, a lawyer representing the board said Tuesday.=20
The board members will appear before the committee whether or not they are =
subpoenaed and will answer all questions, attorney Neil Eggleston said.=20
"I expect something will happen in the next day or so regarding their appea=
rance," Eggleston said. "We were notified already, but we should know for s=
ure by next week."=20
Peter Sheffield, a spokesman for the committee, said Tuesday that he expect=
s committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., to issue subpoenas next week to c=
ompel members of Enron's board to testify, possibly by mid-February.=20
Enron's former Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay, who resigned last week=
 but remains on the board, is scheduled to testify before the House committ=
ee on Monday. Enron's board is named in a number of civil and class action =
lawsuits associated with the company's collapse. Its audit committee review=
ed some of the off-balance sheet partnerships now at the center of federal
investigations, and the full board voted twice to suspend Enron's code of e=
thics to allow former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partners=
hips even as he served as an officer for Enron.

Eggleston said last week Enron's board of directors didn't learn until Octo=
ber that an Enron executive had serious concerns accounting improprieties c=
ould bring down the company, although word of those concerns had spread thr=
oughout the company by early September.=20
The executive, Sherron Watkins, raised her concerns with Lay in August. Tho=
se concerns were shared with the board after being reviewed at Lay's reques=
t by Vinson & Elkins, Enron's outside law firm, Eggleston said last week.=
=20
According to Eggleston, Robert Jaedicke, the chairman of the board's audit =
committee, became aware of Watkins' concerns a few days before the committe=
e met on Oct. 8. Vinson & Elkins advised others on the committee at the mee=
ting, and the rest of the board was informed a couple of days before the fi=
rm released its report.=20
The firm submitted its findings in a report dated Oct. 15, concluding that =
the company's handling of its off-balance-sheet partnerships was proper but=
 could be portrayed in a way that could be damaging to Enron.=20
Enron has declined to challenge Eggleston's account.=20
Some members of Enron's board - including audit committee members Ronnie Ch=
an, chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong; John Wakeham, chairman of=
 the Press Complaints Commission in the U.K.; and Paulo V. Ferraz Pereira, =
executive vice president of Group Bozano in Brazil - reside outside the U.S=
.=20
Eggleston said he didn't know if those board members would travel to the U.=

Enron failed to disclose full lobbying expenses=20
Associated Press=20
Jan. 30, 2002, 6:53AM
WASHINGTON - Enron Corp. apparently failed to disclose many of its lobbying=
 expenses to Congress last year as the energy trader headed toward financia=
l disaster.=20
Enron acknowledged the problem Tuesday night after a private group that tra=
cks money in politics compared Enron's lobbying filing to Congress in Augus=
t with congressional filings by outside lobbying firms. The lobbying firms =
say they were paid more than $1.6 million by Enron for the first six months=
 of 2001. Enron reported spending $825,000.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company's spending figure submitted =
to Congress last Aug. 15 is meant to cover lobbying by the company's own st=
aff and work by outside lobbying firms.=20
"We are reviewing those fees and will respond in writing to the secretary o=
f the Senate," Denne said.=20
Among the lobbyists doing work for Enron were Republican strategist Ed Gill=
espie; ex-Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democratic; and current Rep=
ublican Party chief Marc Racicot; and two ex-aides to House Majority Whip T=
om DeLay. Racicot still collects a salary from his firm but said when he to=
ok the GOP post he would no longer lobby for Enron. In the face of mounting=
 criticism, Racicot has since given up his other lobbying clients as well.=
=20
The discrepancy in Enron's lobbying expenses was discovered by the Washingt=
on-based Center for Responsive Politics. Its executive director, Larry Nobl=
e, said "it is particularly critical at this time for the public to have th=
e full picture of Enron's lobbying activities."=20
Also on Tuesday, Enron's political action committee said it donated at leas=
t $26,000 to congressional campaigns in November, the month before the comp=
any filed for bankruptcy protection. Recipients included several lawmakers =
on the committees now investigating Enron's collapse. At least two, Rep. Ma=
ry Bono, R-Calif., and Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., plan to give their donatio=
ns to charity.=20
The Enron PAC donated at least $120,188 to federal candidates and fund-rais=
ing committees last year, the report shows.=20
In another development, the issue of document-shredding re-emerged at Enron=
, with the company saying it hired private companies to destroy documents. =
Robert Bennett, an attorney representing the company, said the discarded do=
cuments were not sensitive financial records, and any suggestion of any imp=
ropriety was "a bunch of nonsense."=20
Enron hired two companies, one of them named Shredco, to destroy a huge vol=
ume of material, ABC News reported Tuesday night.=20
"There was a contract with a company when Enron consolidated down from two =
buildings to one building," Bennett said. "There was a lot of information i=
ncluding payroll records, resumes, Social Security numbers. These trucks ca=
me in in the light of day."=20
"Even if they're shredding old newspapers, they need to contact the Justice=
 Department" to get permission to do so and allay suspicions, said Rep. Jim=
 Greenwood, R-Pa., who chairs the House Energy and Commerce oversight and i=
nvestigations subcommittee looking into Enron.=20
FBI agents have been investigating allegations of massive shredding of docu=
ments at Enron's Houston headquarters. The company's auditor, Arthur Anders=
en LLP, has acknowledged destroying Enron-related documents and e-mails tha=
t were sought by federal and congressional investigators.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE DOCUMENTS
Enron Says Shredding of Records Was Not Stopped Until Recently
By BARNABY J. FEDER and MICHAEL BRICK

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron acknowledged yesterday that it had contracted until mid-January with =
commercial shredding companies to destroy company records.=20
The disclosure outraged a congressman whose subcommittee is investigating d=
ocument destruction at Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, thou=
gh Enron insisted that the records being destroyed were unrelated to the co=
ntinuing investigations of the company's collapse.
F.B.I. agents were in the company's Houston headquarters as recently as Mon=
day, government officials said. They have been working there to preserve po=
tential evidence since last week, when an employee came forward to say docu=
ments were being shredded earlier in the month.=20
In Washington, House Republican leaders backed President Bush and Vice Pres=
ident Dick Cheney in their refusal to tell Congress about contacts between =
Enron and the administration's energy task force. But several Republican se=
nators called on the White House to disclose the information. [Page C1.]=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said the commercial shredding was a routin=
e matter. The materials destroyed by a private company, Shredco, included i=
tems like payroll runs, old personnel records, performance reviews, medical=
 records and other items that he called ''sensitive employee documents.''=
=20
Representative James Greenwood, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman=
 of the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committ=
ee, said last night that he was dismayed that even routine shredding had co=
ntinued for so long at Enron.=20
''It is stunning to me that this company, which is being investigated by th=
e Congress, by the Justice Department, by the S.E.C., would get anywhere ne=
ar a shredder without at least seeking the permission of the Justice Depart=
ment and others, so that everyone is clear on what it is that they were shr=
edding,'' Mr. Greenwood said. ''Otherwise they are either incredibly arroga=
nt and out of control, or somebody's incredibly stupid.''=20
As for Andersen, the Energy and Commerce Committee sent the firm a letter d=
emanding details of its internal investigation of document shredding, as we=
ll as information about any consulting work it did on a score of Enron's co=
mplex partnership deals.=20
And computer experts said in interviews that the majority -- perhaps nearly=
 all -- of the destroyed Andersen and Enron materials could be recovered by=
 electronic means.=20
Brian Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, declined yesterday to comment=
 on whether agents had secured computer hard drives and other electronic me=
dia at Enron. Asked if the F.B.I. had succeeded in preventing any further d=
estruction of potential evidence at the company, he said, ''We certainly ho=
pe so.''=20
Mr. Palmer said that all shredding at Enron had ceased as of Jan. 14, after=
 the first reports of document destruction at Andersen.=20
''A lot of things are stacking up that under normal circumstances we would =
destroy and employees would want us to destroy,'' he said.=20
Last week, when Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive, disclosed that=
 the company was continuing to shred documents in its accounting department=
, the company insisted that it had issued several directives stating that '=
'all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation.=
''=20
But those directives, issued as e-mail messages beginning on Oct. 25, began=
 by specifying only certain materials related to investigations that had co=
me to light. At the end of October, the company issued a broader message te=
lling employees to preserve just about all documents.=20
On Jan. 14, another directive was issued by Enron's general counsel, James =
Derrick Jr., to ''remind all employees, that, as earlier instructed, in vie=
w of the pending and threatened legal proceedings involving the company, no=
 company records, either in electronic or paper form, should be destroyed.'=
'=20
One Enron employee who insisted on not being identified said that on Friday=
 the company had gathered up the shredders on each floor of its headquarter=
s and put them into sealed-off areas, but that the machines had not been re=
moved from the building.=20
At Andersen, the focus was on electronic records. The firm has hired ASR Da=
ta Acquisition and Analysis, a small computer forensics firm, to recover co=
mputer records that may have been deleted or overwritten.=20
Because nearly all paper documents these days are created on computers, inv=
estigators say that recovering the electronic materials is likely to be far=
 more important to sorting out what happened than gathering and reassemblin=
g shredded paper documents.=20
ASR, based in Cedar Park, Tex., declined to describe in any detail its work=
 for Andersen and for Davis, Polk & Wardwell, the law firm that Andersen ha=
s hired to investigate its dealings with Enron.=20
Andrew S. Rosen, president of ASR, said the extent of his inquiry was ''sti=
ll emerging.'' He added that while it was generally easy to recover deleted=
 data, figuring out who deleted it and when -- crucial information for Cong=
ressional and criminal investigators -- is much harder.=20
''This is like an onion,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''The first layers come off easi=
ly, but it gets harder and makes you cry as you go deeper.''=20
Andersen itself is anxious to complete the investigation because the firm's=
 senior management believes that the inquiry will show that potentially ill=
egal activities were confined to a handful of individuals. The firm is stru=
ggling to retain customers amid growing concerns that its reputation has be=
en irreparably damaged.=20
Andersen, based in Chicago, has promised to issue a complete report on its =
Enron dealings in a few days. The Energy and Commerce Committee, in its let=
ter yesterday, asked Andersen to disclose by tomorrow who was being intervi=
ewed as part of the investigation, anyone identified as taking part in the =
destruction of records and the details of Andersen's engagement of Davis, P=
olk.=20
The continuing pressures come at a crucial time for Andersen as it tries to=
 head off client defections.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Delta Air Lines would give =
other firms the opportunity this spring to bid for the auditing job now per=
formed by Andersen. Peggy Estes, a Delta spokeswoman, described the process=
 as a normal one for the company.=20
Other big Andersen clients, like Utilicorp United of Kansas City, Mo., and =
International Paper of Stamford, Conn., said they were conducting similar r=
eviews.

Enron's ex-chairman Kenneth Lay says he was in the dark; his subordinates s=
ay he knew of their deals. The company insists accountants approved its off=
-the-books partnerships, but Arthur Andersen says key facts were withheld. =
Creditors are demanding payment; the board of directors is eyeing the stagg=
ering stock profits made by former executives.=20
The finger-pointing has started in earnest now that more than 60 prosecutor=
s and FBI agents swarm over Enron's books, trying to untangle a web of myst=
ery partners and offshore entities that swapped and hedged the Houston-base=
d company's debt.
There is still a vast amount unknown -- and no proof so far of criminal int=
ent by Enron officials -- as the Justice Department ramps up its investigat=
ion of the energy giant's collapse. At this early stage, legal experts and =
lawyers close to the probe say, it may not even be clear who the chief inve=
stigative targets should be.=20
Prosecutors are casting about for the right witnesses to guide them through=
 the complexity, a decision that could prove crucial to their success. They=
 are likely to offer deals with some people in exchange for information and=
 testimony. Of central interest is Lay's role at the company, and that of f=
ormer executives Andrew Fastow and Jeffrey Skilling, principal architects o=
f the hundreds of partnerships.=20
"You have to decide who you want to scapegoat -- who you want to build your=
 case toward," said Donald Langevoort, a securities law professor Georgetow=
n University. The choice goes beyond strictly legal questions, he said, for=
 it helps establish a public face for the inquiry.=20
"Would you rather this be a Kenneth Lay story or the story of a highly ambi=
tious second in command?" Langevoort said. "Who you portray as the bad guy =
is a political decision."=20
Prosecutors have focused their early attention on the shredding of Enron re=
cords at the Arthur Andersen auditing firm, though it's not clear that will=
 lead them to the principal figures at Enron. Bringing an obstruction-of-ju=
stice case against Andersen may be a relatively quick call, lawyers close t=
o the probe said, if it's found that documents were destroyed after officia=
ls knew they could be sought in legal proceedings.=20
Investigators have collected numerous Andersen e-mails and memos dealing wi=
th the retention or destruction of documents. The lead Andersen auditor on =
the Enron account, who was fired by the company for allegedly orchestrating=
 the shredding, has already spent seven hours with the Justice Department's=
 Enron task force telling prosecutors about the role he says higher-ups pla=
yed in the document destruction.=20
Any underlying fraud and securities cases against Enron and Andersen will b=
e much more difficult to sort out. Securities law experts closely tracking =
the Enron saga said possible wrongdoing may include insider trading, materi=
al misrepresentations to the Securities and Exchange Commission or to the p=
ublic in press releases, as well as mail and wire fraud.=20
"Serious questions have been posed, but whether anyone is criminally liable=
 for anything is not known yet," said Joel Seligman, dean of Washington Uni=
versity School of Law. Whether charges are brought, he said, likely rests o=
n information not yet pieced together.=20
"Why did people destroy so many documents?" Seligman said. "What was potent=
ially so unnerving in those documents for Enron and Arthur Andersen? I'd re=
ally like to know the answer to that question."=20
Investigators are poring over reams of company records and trying to recons=
truct what was shredded, both at Enron and Arthur Andersen. Help from insid=
ers would be vital to speed the investigation along and illuminate what can=
't be readily gleaned from company records.=20
Forty FBI accountants have been dispatched to Houston to examine Enron's bo=
oks. But former Enron executives and lawyers close to the case say there is=
 only so much the paper trail will reveal. Heading the investigation is fra=
ud division chief Joshua Hochberg, with coordination of prosecutors across =
the country by Leslie Caldwell, former chief of the securities fraud unit i=
n the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.=20
The most pressing unknown at this point may be who the real players are in =
the more than 1,000 Enron-related private partnerships and investment group=
s, many of which were kept off the company books. Those entities hid compan=
y debt and pumped up the company's stock, which Enron executives cashed out=
 for hundreds of millions of dollars.=20
It may take an insider to reveal those names, because they are not on compa=
ny records. Even Enron's lawyers say they don't have them. Similarly, it ma=
y require an inside source to help prosecutors decide if there is a tax eva=
sion case to be made from the partnerships located in the Cayman Islands.=
=20
The prospect of an obstruction case against Arthur Andersen seems to have s=
haken at least one important potential witness loose already. David B. Dunc=
an, Andersen's lead auditor on the Enron account, has met with the Justice =
Department Enron task force twice. His lawyers said he is cooperating, but =
he has not so far entered into any deal with prosecutors.=20
Duncan is in a position to know what went on at both companies and about th=
e partnerships themselves. Enron executives came up with the partnership co=
ncepts and the accountants "tweaked" the financial setups, said one source =
familiar with the accountant's work.=20
The early phase of the investigation may turn on how far up the chain the d=
ocument destruction investigation goes at Andersen. Duncan has told congres=
sional investigators he believed he was following direction from company la=
wyer Nancy Temple.=20
In October, with shareholders filing lawsuits against Enron and the SEC pre=
paring an inquiry, Temple sent Duncan's group an e-mail reminding him of th=
e Andersen document retention policy. It called for the retention of some d=
ocuments and the destruction of others. A week later, Temple e-mailed the p=
olicy to two high-level Chicago partners who were reviewing the Enron audit=
 and the way the partnerships had been reviewed.=20
Yesterday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded information fro=
m Andersen about Enron document destruction, which the company has acknowle=
dged went beyond the Houston office. Committee investigators also are inter=
ested in the role of Andersen's outside lawyers, the New York-based law fir=
m of Davis, Polk and Wardwell.=20
The firm was hired Oct. 9. It has declined to comment on what advice it gav=
e Andersen and Temple about preserving documents. Temple testified before C=
ongress that the firm advised her to send out an e-mail on Nov. 10 -- three=
 weeks after the SEC began probing Enron -- saying it was time to start pre=
serving documents.=20
Davis, Polk and Wardwell is conducting Andersen's internal investigation of=
 the document destruction, prompting questions among committee staffers abo=
ut the objectivity of the investigation.

HOUSTON -- Eight weeks after going broke, Enron Corp. selected management c=
onsultant Stephen Cooper as interim chief executive to steer the fallen ene=
rgy giant through Bankruptcy Court, a battery of shareholder lawsuits and a=
 criminal probe.=20
Board members tapped Cooper, a principal of New York-based turnaround firm =
Zolfo Cooper, less than a week after the resignation of Chairman and Chief =
Executive Kenneth L. Lay. The board has not named a new chairman.
Cooper, 55, said Tuesday that "Enron has real businesses with real value." =
But whether he can restructure the firm and handle the complex legal issues=
 to allow it to keep operating remained an open question, analysts said.=20
Enron already has sold a majority stake in its commodities trading business=
, which generated about 90% of the $100 billion in revenue it reported for =
2000. The company also has handed control of its largest pipeline to Housto=
n-based rival Dynegy Inc., and expects to sell its Portland General Electri=
c division for an estimated $3 billion to Northwest Natural Gas Co. Enron's=
 remaining assets, including smaller pipelines and utilities outside the U.=
S., accounted for just a fraction of its revenue.=20
But Cooper, in a voicemail disseminated to Enron's employees, offered an op=
timistic take on the company's current divisions.=20
"The physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here," Coope=
r said. "The regulated assets--the pipelines and generating plants-- provid=
e reliable, steady cash flow and returns. And they provide a very sound, fu=
ndamental base to restructure around."=20
Many experts, however, expressed doubt Cooper will be able to do anything m=
ore than sell off Enron in pieces.=20
"I find it hard to envision a workable entity coming out of bankruptcy here=
," said Andre Meade, a utilities analyst for Commerzbank Securities. "The o=
nly business that really makes sense is a smaller version of what Enron was=
 in the first place--a small gas-pipeline company, but the demands of the i=
ndustry over the last couple of years have basically eliminated all small-p=
ipeline companies."=20
Enron is still seeking a chairman, who must deal with the firm's interests =
in Washington, where it is under attack on Capitol Hill.=20
Steven Panagos, a partner at Zolfo Cooper, said the firm believes Enron has=
 enough cash to continue operations and emerge from bankruptcy. ''It has a =
good customer base, it has a good supplier base and most importantly it has=
 plenty of liquidity,'' he said.=20
Cooper's biggest asset, analysts said, is whatever goodwill he can generate=
 from the creditors' committee. Cooper comes to the company as an outsider-=
-an attribute sought by committee members who pushed for Lay's exit.=20
Cooper began studying company reorganizations while working as an accountan=
t at Touche Ross, now known as Deloitte & Touche. In 1986, he joined a form=
er colleague, Frank Zolfo, to form Zolfo Cooper. Cooper, a graduate of Occi=
dental College in Los Angeles and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton =
School, declined interview requests Tuesday.=20
As part of the management shuffling announced Tuesday, Enron President and =
Chief Operating Officer Lawrence G. Whalley resigned to take a post at UBS =
Warburg, the Swiss bank that acquired Enron's trading division this month. =
Enron also elevated Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon to succeed Whalley=
 and named treasurer Ray Bowen as CFO.=20
Shannon Burchett, president of Dallas-based energy firm specialist Risk Lim=
ited Corp., noted that the promoted executives have not been implicated in =
the scandal, but "if I were a creditor, what I'd like to see is a whole new=
 cast."=20
When Cooper was hired to help rescue troubled Canadian transportation firm =
Laidlaw Inc. in mid-2000, he clearly identified the problem areas, Laidlaw =
Chairman Peter Widdrington said.=20
"He can get deadlines established which initially look unrealistic, but the=
 more he sells the deadline to all involved, the more realistic they become=
," he said.=20
Some analysts noted that Cooper, a veteran of the bankruptcies of Federated=
 Department Stores and other firms, has little experience in the energy fie=
ld.=20
But Widdrington, who has discussed the Enron debacle with Cooper, said, "St=
eve himself is not awed by the task. He thinks essentially the operational =
aspects of the company are still in decent shape."=20
Cooper plans to continue as Laidlaw's vice chairman and chief restructuring=
 officer.=20
Cooper's firm also has been consulting for Polaroid Corp. since last summer=
 and assisted the firm as it prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy pro=
tection in October. Polaroid spokesman Skip Colcord said the company could =
not comment on Zolfo Cooper's performance because Polaroid has not yet emer=

UCLA bankruptcy law professor Lynn LoPucki said Enron probably can emerge f=

"There will be a lot of pieces of things that survive from Enron, but they =
aren't in any real sense Enron," he said. "One might carry the Enron name, =

Michael J. Miller, a former Enron employee and a member of the organization=

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ACCOUNTING
Fuzzy Rules Of Accounting And Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS and KURT EICHENWALD

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron collapsed after reporting strong profits for years, a fact that might=
 be seen as proof that the profits were illusory.=20
But even some accountants who are extremely critical of Enron's accounting =
now say that accounting rules -- including one that was influenced by Enron=
 when it was being written -- give at least a veneer of acceptability to so=
me of the most widely questioned Enron accounting practices.
''It's conceivable that they complied with the rules,'' said Douglas Carmic=
hael, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College. ''Absent a smoking-gun =
e-mail or something similar, it is an issue of trying to attack the reasona=
bleness of the assumptions they made.''=20
The Enron case highlights a weakness in the system that exists to encourage=
 companies to fairly describe their financial health: when accounting rules=
 are written very specifically, clever accountants find ways to get around =
them. When, as in this case, they are written far more generally, proper ac=
counting can be overly reliant on the good faith of companies and auditors =
in applying the rules.=20
As a result, the evidence that the Justice Department and the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission would need to bring fraud charges would be documents =
showing that accountants made estimates they knew to be unreasonable. To fi=
nd such evidence, investigators would review internal memorandums and e-mai=
l messages. But some of those appear to have been destroyed by employees of=
 Enron and its former auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
The rule in question concerned trading in the energy business. When Enron's=
 energy services division agreed to supply power to a company at a fixed pr=
ice, it made optimistic projections that energy prices would fall enough in=
 the future to guarantee Enron a healthy profit. It was then able to report=
 that profit as soon as it signed the contract -- long before it was clear =
whether its optimistic assumptions would prove to be accurate.=20
''It looked like a license to print money,'' said Glenn Dickson, a former m=
anager in the energy services unit.=20
The decision that energy trading could be accounted for in the way that Enr=
on used was made by the Emerging Issues Task Force, a group under the overs=
ight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the principal accounting =
rule maker in this country. It did so in 1999, after meeting with Enron, wh=
ich was viewed as the leading company in energy trading.=20
Timothy S. Lucas, the director of research at the F.A.S.B. and the nonvotin=
g chairman of the task force, said Enron's role was to provide information,=
 not to serve as a consultant. He said that, as he recalled, Enron had alre=
ady begun using accounting similar to the accounting the task force wound u=
p endorsing.=20
In retrospect, Mr. Lucas said, the task force may have erred by not requiri=
ng more disclosures about the accounting used, particularly in long-term tr=
ansactions.=20
''There are suggestions for good information that we could add to the discl=
osure that we simply did not think of,'' he said, adding that such disclosu=
res would now be considered.=20
The accounting rule in question required Enron to ''mark to market'' the va=
lue of its energy trades. Where there was an active market, as with stocks =
or publicly traded bonds, that is relatively easy to do and difficult to ma=
nipulate. But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =
rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =
the market value.=20
The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=
esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =
company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=
es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=
erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =
Enron officials.=20
Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=
ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=
ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=
he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20
Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over=
 the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the=
 risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=
t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20
Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=
ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=
ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=
ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=
ear to be very risky.=20
A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=
uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=
orce. That official said Andersen accountants viewed the company's structur=
ing of financial instruments to be on the cutting edge.=20
Andersen has a seat on the task force, as do each of the four other large a=
ccounting firms. The other members among the 13 on the task force are 4 rep=
resentatives of smaller accounting firms and 4 executives from large compan=
ies. One industry seat is now vacant, after an executive from General Elect=
ric left. The others are held by officials of J. P. Morgan, Exxon Mobil and=
 Dow Chemical.=20
The task force does not disclose who suggests topics, so it is not possible=
 to be certain which Enron issues were considered. But it appears that one =
such issue came in 2000, when the task force addressed the question of what=
 should be done about what appeared to be the application of widely varying=
 approaches by energy traders to determine how much contracts were worth. T=
he task force refused to specify how valuations should be made, leaving com=
panies free to use methods they deemed best.=20
It is not possible to know how much, if at all, Enron would have been restr=
ained from its aggressive accounting had the task force chosen to enact mor=
e detailed rules. But Mr. Carmichael, the Baruch professor, said that an en=
forcement case would be easier to make had the regulators ''set some kind o=
f parameters on the ability to use an internal model.''=20
Absent such clarifying rules, he said, ''you would expect an auditor to com=
e in and challenge the assumptions made.'' He said the investigation ''is l=
ikely to delve into whether the assumptions were reasonable and to what ext=
ent did Arthur Andersen challenge the reasonableness of the assumptions.'' =
Internal Andersen memorandums could be crucial to making a case against the=
 auditor.=20
Edward W. Trott, who in 1998 was a member of the task force representing KP=
MG, a large accounting firm, and who since 1999 has been a member of the F.=
A.S.B., said in an interview that he believed that the right decisions were=
 made on how to account for energy trading.=20
But, he added, ''if you're telling me that somebody who wants to game the s=
ystem can do it, you probably have a lot of evidence to support that.''=20
The accounting for energy services is not the only area in which Enron enga=
ged in accounting that used rules in surprising ways.=20
In one transaction involving a joint venture with Blockbuster, Enron report=
ed large profits even though the venture never attracted more than a few cu=
stomers.=20
''They were extremely clever,'' said Paul Brown, the chairman of the accoun=
ting department at New York University.=20
In the Enron-Blockbuster deal, the two companies set up a pilot project, st=
reaming videos to a few dozen apartments in Portland, Ore., from servers se=
t up in the basement of the building. With that tiny beginning, Enron opene=
d up a partnership, called Braveheart, which raised more than $115 million =
from a bank in exchange for a promise of most of the earnings from the Bloc=
kbuster deal for years.=20
Enron asserted that there was a market in broadband, and that its transacti=
on amounted to one involving the transfer of financial assets. That meant i=
t could report the transaction on a mark-to-market basis, similar to the wa=
y it accounted for the energy trades. It applied its undisclosed model to c=
alculate how much revenue it could report from the transaction, and reporte=
d more than $110 million. Former executives say accountants at Arthur Ander=
sen approved the accounting.=20
''Nobody in the division could comprehend how they got Andersen to sign off=
 on that,'' one former senior executive in the broadband division said. ''I=
t just didn't make any sense. When we heard what they did, everybody's mout=
hs just hung open. We weren't doing business on any scale even close to tho=
se numbers.''=20
The Wall Street Journal has reported that the bank that put up the money ha=
d a guarantee from Enron that it would not lose money. From the bank's poin=
t of view, that may have made the transaction look like a loan, but Enron s=
ays the accounting came under an F.A.S.B. rule covering the securitization =
of assets. Under that rule, accountants say, Enron could still treat the tr=
ansaction as a sale, while reducing the profit to reflect the value of its =
guarantee.=20
An Enron spokesman said the company believed that it had complied with appl=
icable accounting rules. ''I'm sure all of these past transactions will be =
investigated by lots of people,'' he said. ''Why don't we just wait and see=
 what the appropriate authorities decide?''=20
An auditor at one large firm not involved in the Enron case said it was com=
mon for auditors to face creative ways to use accounting rules. ''These iss=
ues can become very complex and very fact-specific,'' he said. ''You have a=
 lot of sharp pencils on Wall Street cooking up transactions to achieve a s=
pecific result. Oftentimes, they understand the accounting rules as well as=
 or better than we do.''=20
Or, as Mr. Brown, the N.Y.U. professor, put it: ''It's the old adage of a F=
.A.S.B. rule. It takes four years to write it, and it takes four minutes fo=
r an astute investment banker to get around it.''

Chart: ''A Complicated Partnership With Debilitating Results'' Investigator=
s are examining some of the deals that improved Enron's balance sheet but w=
ere not part of its financial statements. Here is one in which Enron used a=
 partnership to increase its short-term earnings. 1. Enron signed a multiye=
ar deal with Blockbuster to provide videos over Enron's broadband network. =
Enron hoped to make millions of dollars off the deal. 2. Enron created a pa=
rtnership called Braveheart whose purpose was to get someone to advance Enr=
on the money it expected to make on the deal with Blockbuster. To capitaliz=
e Braveheart, a small amount of money came from outside investors and Enron=
 lent the partnership some stock. 3. An outside investment bank gave Braveh=
eart $115 million in return for a promise that most of the earnings from th=
e Blockbuster deal would go directly to the bank. If the earnings were not =
enough for the bank to recoup its investment, Enron promised that it would =
repay the bank. 4. Enron recorded $110 million of the money invested in Bra=
veheart as profit. Enron did not count all $115 million because, under an a=
ccounting rule, it had to estimate the value of its guarantee to pay back t=
he bank and reduce its revenue by that amount. PROBLEM: Blockbuster backed =
out of the contract, leaving Enron responsible for repaying the bank. (pg. =

CHICAGO -- Think straight, talk straight.=20
That motto was coined by Arthur Edward Andersen, a Northwestern University =
accounting professor who made standing up for what's right the bedrock prin=
ciple of the company he founded 88 years ago.
What John Wayne was to westerns, Andersen was to accounting--demanding abso=
lute honesty and probity from employees and clients alike. Andersen's fasti=
diousness even extended to an employee dress code, which for years required=
 all auditors to wear fedoras on appointments, no matter the weather.=20
Andersen's company grew into the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, wit=
h more than 100,000 corporate clients, $9 billion a year in revenue and 85,=
000 employees around the world. More than that, it helped set ethical stand=
ards for the entire profession.=20
"Arthur Andersen wouldn't put up with anything that wasn't complete, 100% i=
ntegrity," said George R. Catlett, 84, a retired Andersen partner from Evan=
ston, Ill. "If anybody did anything otherwise, he'd fire them. And if clien=
ts wanted him to do something he didn't agree with, he'd either try to chan=
ge them or quit."=20
Today the Chicago-based firm, known simply as Andersen, is an emblem of acc=
ounting misdeeds, the focus of congressional investigations and the butt of=
 presidential jokes.=20
Andersen vouched for financial statements that overstated Enron Corp.'s ear=
nings by $586 million over nearly five years. It has admitted shredding doc=
uments even after the Securities and Exchange Commission began examining En=
ron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.=20
The scandal threatens the survival of Andersen. And because of the company'=
s prominence, the disclosures are reverberating widely, shaking investors' =
confidence in the profits and losses reported by corporate America. Members=
 of Congress and federal regulators are examining the accounting industry's=
 practices and standards.=20
"The conscience of the industry, essentially, appeared to sell out," said B=
ill Cummings, an accounting professor at Northern Illinois University and a=
 past president of the American Accounting Assn.'s Midwest region. "I think=
 it's pure and simple. It's greed and the allure of the big-money clients."=
=20
Andersen's role in the Enron collapse has revealed the "dark side" of a pro=
fession whose independence has been compromised by the chase for multimilli=
on-dollar fees, Cummings said.=20
Like many accounting firms these days, Andersen wore two hats at Enron. It =
was the company's independent auditor, responsible for ensuring that its fi=
nancial statements were accurate. It was also a financial consultant, helpi=
ng Enron executives devise ways of running the business more profitably and=
 reducing its tax bill.=20
Andersen auditors and consultants occupied a floor of their own in the ener=
gy company's gleaming Houston headquarters. They carried Enron-issued elect=
ronic ID cards, mingled at office picnics--and even wore Enron golf shirts.=
=20
Investigators are looking at Andersen's alleged role in setting up complex =
transactions that inflated Enron's earnings by keeping massive debts off th=
e company's books. Andersen has claimed that its accountants were misled by=
 Enron.=20
Arthur Andersen himself wouldn't have gotten so cozy with a client, to judg=
e from accounts of his career. The son of Norwegian immigrants, Andersen is=
 described as crotchety, opinionated and stubborn.=20
Company lore has it that he lost the prized E.I. du Pont account in the 193=
0s over an interpretation of operating income. Du Pont executives insisted =
on using a more liberal definition that would lump in the value of the comp=
any's large investment in General Motors. Andersen's auditors said no, and =
Andersen backed them up. Du Pont found another auditor.=20
The episode sealed the reputation of Andersen and his firm. The company sti=
ll guards that legacy jealously, said Andersen spokesman Dave Tabolt. "It's=
 an issue that people are concerned about every day," he said.=20
Even now, Andersen employees can be fired for fudging a meal on an expense =
form or lying about their college grade-point averages, say former partners=
.=20
Before accepting a client, Andersen performs background checks on its top e=
xecutives. Andersen auditors are told to summarily "leave the field"--walk =
away from the job--if they meet unreasonable resistance.=20
The firm also has shaped reforms within the accounting profession.=20
Firm Insisted on Tight Central Controls=20
Auditors perform a vital role in the nation's financial system by certifyin=
g the accuracy of profits, losses, debts and other financial data reported =
by companies. They are hired by a company's shareholders and its board of d=
irectors to ensure that financial statements meet federal disclosure standa=
rds.=20
During the 1950s and 1960s, Leonard Spacek, Andersen's successor, openly cr=
iticized the profession for tolerating what he considered a sloppy patchwor=
k of accounting standards that left the investing public no way to compare =
the financial performance of different companies.=20
Spacek's evangelism led to the creation of the Accounting Principles Board,=
 an industry group that established uniform financial accounting and report=
ing standards. In 1973, the board was replaced by the Financial Accounting =
Standards Board, an independent body recognized by the SEC.=20
"They wanted what they considered to be substandard accounting principles .=
 . . to be improved," said Stephen Zeff, an accounting professor and histor=
ian at Rice University. "The accounting establishment back East . . . didn'=
t want the cage rattled. Arthur Andersen rattled the cage."=20
The firm also has set itself apart over the years by cultivating a corporat=
e cohesiveness that borders on clannishness, say experts and former employe=
es.=20
The firm has always insisted on tight central controls and uniformity. Befo=
re computers, Andersen partners around the world worked off a cross-indexed=
 central filing system that listed every client, audit and supporting memos=
.=20
At the firm's campus in rural St. Charles, Ill., about 40 miles west of Chi=
cago, uniformity is stressed to new recruits during an intensive two-week t=
raining course.=20
"They always talked about the one-firm philosophy. . . . No matter where yo=
u are, there was one firm, one philosophy," said Vadim Fridman, 31, a forme=
r Andersen auditor who is now chief financial officer for St. Maartens Spir=
its, a distributor of premium liqueurs in Santa Barbara.=20
Over the years, the practice of accounting changed in ways that Andersen's =
original credo didn't anticipate.=20
Accounting firms now offer lucrative consulting services. Their clients inc=
lude complex businesses with dozens of different divisions. And when compan=
ies go bad, shareholders often target the auditors as well as the managemen=
t.=20
Worries over shareholder lawsuits rippled throughout the firm and shaped ho=
w audits were conducted during the 1990s, former employees say.=20
Auditors use two files to keep records of their work. One is for working pa=
pers that offer supporting documentation for the auditor's findings about a=
 company's finances. The other file is for personal notes, memos and other =
documents. At the end of an audit, papers in the second file are destroyed =
while those in the first are preserved.=20
"The emphasis when I was at Andersen was to take more and more out of the w=
ork file. They wanted fewer and fewer source documents to be in the source =
file, across the board with any client," said a former employee in Houston,=
 who left the firm about a year ago. "The less of that you keep in the file=
, the less likely there is of someone coming back in and finding a smoking =
gun."=20
Equally troublesome, say regulators and critics, was Andersen's habit, comm=
on in the industry, of encouraging its auditors to seek employment with the=
 companies they were auditing. This gave Andersen a network of allies in bi=
g corporations and with it leverage to preserve its auditing and consulting=
 contracts and prospect for new ones.=20
Andersen alumni hold top positions in industries where Andersen has a large=
 share of the auditing business. Andersen is the dominant accounting compan=
y for Texas energy companies. Former Andersen executives hold top corporate=
 slots at such companies as Dynegy, Petroleum Geoservices and Comstock Reso=
urces. All buy auditing services from Andersen, whose contracts are reviewe=
d annually.=20
"We call it practice development," said one Andersen alumnus. "The biggest =
reason to do it is, if there's other [non-audit] work to be done, you want =
to be the first one they call."=20
Case in point: Vadim Fridman. He worked in Andersen's Woodland Hills office=
, auditing mid-size businesses. When he left the company, he wasn't forgott=
en. "They've always maintained contact," he said.=20
Two jobs later, an Andersen executive called him and asked whether he had a=
ny interest in becoming chief financial officer of St. Maartens Spirits, th=
e Santa Barbara company.=20
"They did some [consulting] work for the company and came up with the fact =
they needed a CFO and got me the interview," said Fridman, who ended up get=
ting the job. If St. Maartens ever needs the services of a major accounting=
 firm, he added, "obviously I'd lean toward Andersen. I know how they work.=
"=20
Over the years, Enron hired away dozens of current and former Andersen empl=
oyees--including Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president who eventuall=
y warned of the company's collapse. In 1993, Enron shifted 40 employees to =
Andersen's payroll when it hired the firm, already its outside auditor, to =
take over internal auditing as well.=20
Outside auditors examine transaction records to verify the accuracy of a co=
mpany's financial statements. Internal auditors monitor the effectiveness o=
f the company's internal financial controls.=20
The arrangement meant that Andersen would be essentially policing its own w=
ork, said one former Andersen energy expert.=20
In the case of another Andersen client, Waste Management Inc., the SEC cite=
d such interlocking ties when it levied a $7-million fine against Andersen =
last year, the largest ever imposed by the agency on an accounting firm.=20
In that case, Andersen issued "materially false or misleading audits" that =
overstated Waste Management's net income between 1993 and 1997 by more than=
 $1 billion, the SEC said. The agency also fined four Andersen partners and=
 barred them for varying periods from working on audits of publicly traded =
companies.=20
"Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management =
and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste Management's shareh=
olders and the investing public," said Richard Walker, the SEC's chief of e=
nforcement.=20
The agency disclosed that every chief financial officer and chief accountin=
g officer at Waste Management from 1971 until 1997 was a former Andersen au=
ditor. Altogether, 14 former Andersen employees worked for Waste Management=
 during the 1990s in key financial and accounting positions. Andersen and W=
aste Management paid $220 million to settle several lawsuits over accountin=
g practices.=20
The case was one of the latest in a string of lawsuits and sanctions agains=
t Andersen or its partners for alleged shoddy or misleading work. In April,=
 the SEC sued an Andersen partner for allegedly covering up a massive manag=
ement fraud at appliance maker Sunbeam Inc. Andersen agreed to pay $110 mil=
lion to settle a related shareholder lawsuit.=20
In 1999, the accounting giant paid $90 million to investors and $2.5 millio=
n to Connecticut authorities to settle allegations that it knowingly approv=
ed overly optimistic projections for real estate ventures launched by Colon=
ial Realty, a commercial real estate company.=20
Those settlements have come as Andersen has fought tighter restrictions on =
the accounting industry.=20
Last year, Andersen led the lobbying campaign that ultimately defeated a pr=
oposed SEC rule to force accounting firms to separate their business consul=
ting practice from auditing. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and others a=
rgued that the twin functions posed a temptation for firms to coddle high-p=
aying clients or bury their accounting sins.=20
At Enron, Andersen collected $52 million for its auditing and consulting se=
rvices for 2000.=20
The firm that once defied du Pont is accused of wilting in the face of a du=
bious client that paid it a million dollars a week in fees. "Nobody's going=
 to walk away from that," said Cummings, the Northern Illinois University p=
rofessor.=20
Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino rose to the defense of his firm t=
his week, saying the Enron debacle does not represent the true character of=
 the company and its 85,000 employees.=20
"They want you to know that this is not their Andersen," he said.=20
Berardino conceded the company was losing business. One recent defector is =
Keystone Automotive Industries, a Pomona-based distributor of auto parts. I=
n November, the firm's board voted to hire Andersen after using Ernst & You=
ng as its auditor for 20 years. The board dropped Andersen when the Enron r=
evelations began to roll.=20
"We just felt that there was so much noise surrounding this situation that =
maybe for us the best thing to do was not be second-guessed" by stockholder=
s, said John Palumbo, Keystone's chief financial officer.=20
Among the clients sticking by Andersen for now is Houston-based Swift Energ=
y, an oil and gas exploration firm. Yet Bruce Vincent, Swift's executive vi=
ce president, said he could understand why others might desert the company.=
=20
"The risk to Andersen is almost like that of a bank," said Vincent. "If you=
 have a loss of credibility, you have a run on the bank. If you have enough=
 clients that start switching, they're out of business."

Accounting for Enron: U.S. Probes Enron's Effect on Power Prices
By Jeanne Cummings
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/30/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- Federal energy regulators are looking into whether Enron Corp=
. improperly boosted the electricity prices that Californians and other con=
sumers in the Pacific Northwest will be paying for years under long-term en=
ergy contracts, as a private study suggests.=20
Several senators from western states cited the report at a Senate hearing o=
n the impact of Enron's collapse on the energy sector, and Federal Energy R=
egulatory Commission Chairman Patrick Wood said he would open an inquiry in=
to the matter.
Overall, Mr. Wood said he has concluded that the U.S. energy markets absorb=
ed the Enron Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing without major disruption or price spi=
kes, and the debacle shouldn't "sound the death knell for competition." Sti=
ll, the FERC chairman and five other experts said the situation exposed a n=
eed for greater transaction disclosure, particularly in the area of online =
energy trading, Enron's core business.=20
Because Enron's trading wasn't subject to government oversight, the evidenc=
e of price manipulation presented against Enron at the hearing was anecdota=
l.=20
Robert McCullough, a Portland, Ore., energy consultant with clients affecte=
d by last year's energy crisis in the West, conducted research to determine=
 Enron's market dominance in one pricing area -- the area along the Califor=
nia-Oregon border -- by studying data voluntarily made public by other comp=
anies in the same business. His conclusion was that Enron accounted for mor=
e than a 30% share of the business.=20
On Dec. 3, the day after Enron filed for protection from its creditors unde=
r Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the forward markets -- hedge trad=
ing on future energy prices -- on the West Coast fell 30%, Mr. McCullough t=
estified. After ruling out other possible causes for the price drop -- a de=
cline in hydroelectric supply or a spike in fossil-fuel prices -- "the clea=
r implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to set=
 forward prices," he said. With Enron out of the market, prices fell.=20
Enron denies any manipulation. "There is political grandstanding going on r=
ight now, and it's been going on against Enron for more than a year," compa=
ny spokeswoman Karen Denne said. "There are a number of factors that drive =
prices, seasonal, weather or demand factors. There have been a number of in=
vestigations into price manipulation and collusion, and none of them found =
Enron to engage in any of those practices."=20
Indeed, Lawrence Makovich, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associat=
es in Massachusetts, told the committee that forward prices dropped markedl=
y throughout the country earlier in the year and the decline identified in =
the study could have been part of that pattern.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) questioned whether Enron's trading could=
 have contributed to California's struggle last year to recover from an ene=
rgy shortage that led to rolling blackouts, sharply higher prices charged t=
o consumers and big political problems for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.=20
Mr. Davis is running for re-election this year; he faces a tough Republican=
 field and an electorate that gives more credit to its own conservation in =
ending the state's energy crisis than to the governor's actions.=20
As part of his recovery plan, Mr. Davis signed several expensive, long-term=
 energy contracts. Though none of those agreements was with Enron, official=
s hope to prove that Enron's dealings in the marketplace improperly boosted=
 the overall market price. Such a finding could pave the way for California=
 and other entities to attempt to break their contracts and renegotiate low=
er prices for consumers.=20
Mr. Wood said he has concluded Enron didn't contribute to California's shor=
t-term energy crisis last year. But, he said the allegation about manipulat=
ion of the futures market "is an interesting question." In his review, he s=
aid he would try to determine how big the forward-market is and to what deg=
ree Enron dominated it.=20
He suggested to Ms. Feinstein that California file a formal complaint with =
his agency, which would trigger a formal, 60-day investigation. Ms. Feinste=
in said she would see that it is filed.=20
Mr. Wood also endorsed lawmakers' suggestions that Internet energy trading =
should be subjected to rules for disclosure.=20
Much of Enron's business -- buying and selling of over-the-counter energy d=
erivatives -- was exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading=
 Commission. Mr. McCullough and other witnesses said online traders should =
face the same disclosure requirements as traditional trading entities, such=
 as the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
"We need to find out if there is only one person in the [trading] pit," Mr.=
 McCullough said. "If there is, we know to proceed with caution."

The nation's top energy regulator promised yesterday to investigate whether=
 Enron Corp. manipulated long-term energy prices in western states until th=
e day it declared bankruptcy last month.=20
Pat Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, made th=
e pledge during a congressional hearing in which several senators voiced co=
ncern about Enron's dominance of electronic trading of financial instrument=
s tied to energy. Such trading is unregulated.
This would be the second time FERC has looked at Enron's role in setting we=
stern energy prices. During the year-long California energy crisis that end=
ed last summer, the agency found no evidence that energy companies, includi=
ng Enron, had manipulated the short-term market for electricity, although i=
t found serious flaws in the market structure.=20
"There are issues about whether Enron was manipulating the West Coast energ=
y markets," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "It's important not just to ratep=
ayers on the West Coast, but it goes to the issue of the confidence America=
ns need to have in the energy market. We need to lift the veil of secrecy a=
bout how energy is bought and sold in this country."=20
The hearing by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was meant =
to explore the impact that Enron's collapse in December had on energy marke=
ts.=20
Robert McCullough, an energy consultant whose clients include utilities in =
the Northwest, testified that the price of unregulated financial energy con=
tracts on the West Coast dropped 30 percent on Dec. 3, the day after Enron =
filed for bankruptcy. This suggests, he said, that "Enron may have been usi=
ng its market dominance" to set long-term energy prices.=20
Wood, a former Texas utility commissioner backed by longtime Enron chairman=
 Kenneth L. Lay for the federal job, told lawmakers that Enron's demise did=
n't damage the nation's energy-trading industry or disrupt the supply of en=
ergy.=20
Enron, meanwhile, named Stephen F. Cooper, a corporate turnaround expert, a=
s its interim chief executive, replacing Lay, who resigned last week.=20
In other Enron-related news:=20
* A House subcommittee leading the investigation of document shredding by E=
nron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, announced it will turn its foc=
us to Enron at hearings next week. Merrill Lynch & Co. confirmed that some =
of its senior executives invested in one of the controversial Enron partner=
ships involved in the company's unraveling last fall.=20
* More than 400 past and present Enron workers asked the bankruptcy judge t=
o appoint an official panel to give them greater say in the case, saying on=
e worker representative on the 15-member creditors' committee was inadequat=
e.=20
* Enron said its investigation of papers shredded at the company's Houston =
headquarters after it received subpoenas from federal investigators had tur=
ned up no evidence that any relevant materials were destroyed. "Based on ou=
r investigation so far, we are unaware of any improper shredding of documen=
ts," Enron attorney Robert Bennett said last night. The FBI is continuing t=
o interview everyone at Enron headquarters who had a role in shredding docu=
ments. An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company continued shredding do=
cuments until recently but maintained that they were payroll and other pers=
onnel records unrelated to the investigation.=20
* Police in Sugar Land, Tex., said they could not disclose the contents of =
the suicide note written by J. Clifford Baxter, a former senior Enron execu=
tive, without the permission of the Texas attorney general.=20
At the Senate hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others said the=
 danger that Enron posed occurred before it collapsed, from its success in =
lobbying state and federal regulators against disclosure of energy prices a=
nd supplies.=20
That secrecy has allowed companies to dominate markets and "price-gouge" co=
nsumers, Feinstein said. Enron's large role in trading financial energy con=
tracts coupled with the company's control over "50 percent to 70 percent" o=
f natural gas going into California gave the company the tools it needed to=
 set prices unfairly, she said.=20
In December 2000, Congress exempted such "derivatives" contracts -- which a=
re used to hedge against price swings but also to speculate on price change=
s -- from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Sen. Jeff=
 Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the committee, said the Enron fiasco shows =
the need for greater public disclosure about energy derivatives and how the=
y are traded.=20
James E. Newsome, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sai=
d that if Congress decides that energy derivatives need more oversight, his=
 commission should provide that oversight.=20
In announcing new hearings next Tuesday and Wednesday, the House Commerce s=
ubcommittee on oversight and investigations sent out a new round of letters=
 requesting documents. Among them was one to Enron seeking copies of a repo=
rt a New York law firm prepared last summer on problems with partnerships t=
hen headed by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Fastow sold t=
hose interests last July 31.=20
The Internet magazine Salon reported last week that Jordan Mintz, an Enron =
attorney, had asked the Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson law firm for =
an opinion on the partnerships. Enron sources confirmed that an opinion was=
 prepared but would not provide details of its contents.=20
A Merrill Lynch spokesman said, in response to a report by Bloomberg News, =
that executives at the brokerage firm invested in the LJM2 partnership, one=
 of the private entities run by Fastow.=20
"The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties =
on all sides of the transaction," the spokesman said. "Consistent with comm=
on industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as inter=
nal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest."=20
The partnership was one of many that helped Enron keep debt off its books -=
- debt that investors, including those following the Merrill Lynch analysts=
' recommendations on Enron, were not aware of. The spokesman said the Merri=
ll Lynch investors in the partnership didn't tell the analysts about their =
investment.=20
Meanwhile, the Federal Election Commission said it was unclear what would b=
ecome of the $430,000 remaining in Enron's political action committee coffe=
rs at the end of 2001. The PAC made donations last fall to several members =
of Congress who are now investigating the company. "We have never had to ad=
dress anything like this before," said Kelly Huff, a spokeswoman for the el=
ection panel.

NEW YORK -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. needs to find a new lawyer in its high-=
profile legal battle to force insurers to honor $1.1 billion in Enron Corp.=
 surety bonds.=20
A federal judge on Monday disqualified Davis Polk & Wardwell because the Ne=
w York law firm also represents Chubb Corp., the parent company of Federal =
Insurance Co., an insurer named as a defendant in the suit. U.S. District J=
udge Jed S. Rakoff wrote in a nine-page opinion that Davis Polk has "entang=
led itself in conflicts of interest" by advising Chubb and J.P. Morgan at t=
he same time.
On Dec. 11, Davis Polk helped Chubb file papers with the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission that outline Chubb's obligations on $220 million worth of =
Federal Insurance surety bonds related to Enron affiliates, the judge noted=
. On the same day, Davis Polk, acting for J.P. Morgan Chase, filed the laws=
uit in New York state court against Federal Insurance and eight other major=
 insurance companies over the surety bonds.=20
"It is doubtful that Chubb would have approved such wording [on the SEC fil=
ings] if it had known that Davis Polk would simultaneously bring suit on th=
ese bonds against Federal," the judge wrote.=20
A Davis Polk spokesman said: "We are obviously disappointed by the court's =
decision. We believed that we had good grounds to proceed on behalf of J.P.=
 Morgan Chase bank under the applicable ethical standards, but we will of c=
ourse abide by the decision of the court." Judge Rakoff ordered all proceed=
ings in the case on hold for two weeks to allow J.P. Morgan time to obtain =
new counsel or appeal the decision. J.P. Morgan Chase declined to comment.

Burden of Doubt: Stocks Take a Beating As Accounting Worries Spread Beyond =
Enron --- Investors Ignore Good News About Economy; Banks Are a Focus of Se=
lling --- `A Big Haircut' for Some
By E.S. Browning and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

It's not the economy anymore, stupid. It's the accounting.=20
Yesterday was the day that the smoldering corporate accounting scandal, whi=
ch started with Enron Corp. and quickly spread to Arthur Andersen LLP, reac=
hed a wide group of U.S. companies and seriously singed their stock prices.=
 Accounting problems surfaced in sectors ranging from banking to oil, promp=
ting fears of new mini-Enrons and spurring a sell-off of shares at the slig=
htest whiff of such trouble.
As a result, despite broadly upbeat economic news, the stock market took a =
tumble, with shares falling to their lowest levels in three months.=20
Signs of toughening stances by auditors and regulators emerged, raising que=
stions as to how many more corporate managements will be forced to restate =
their earnings and abandon cozy accounting treatments that easily passed mu=
ster a few months ago.=20
Stocks in the banking industry, for instance, fell sharply following word t=
hat PNC Financial Services Group, a Pittsburgh-based banking group, was res=
tating its 2001 results. Analysts immediately fretted that many other banks=
 could be hit. In addition, pipeline company Williams Cos. delayed an earni=
ngs report to examine the impact of commitments to a former unit, and congl=
omerate Tyco International Ltd. suffered on news that it had made a $20 mil=
lion payment to an outside director and to a charity he controls. After the=
 markets closed, Houston energy producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp. announced=
 it made a billion-dollar mistake in the way it calculated the value of its=
 domestic oil and gas properties for the quarter ended Sept. 30, citing fau=
lty tax assumptions.=20
The upshot: Tyco was down almost 20% for the day, PNC fell more than 9%, an=
d Williams fell more than 22%. Together, the three lost $21 billion in mark=
et value in one day.=20
On a day in which the big-picture economic news was good -- and other corpo=
rate earnings were, in fact, up -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average neverth=
eless fell 2.51%, or 247.51 points, to 9618.24, its lowest level since Oct.=
 29. Trading volume was the highest it has been since the week the markets =
reopened after the September terrorist attacks.=20
Behind the frantic trading is a watershed development in American business:=
 The fundamentals of the accounting profession have been called into questi=
on. Where two decades ago, accountants were still held in high esteem, now =
they rank in public opinion polls below politicians and even journalists. A=
n opinion letter from a Big Five accounting firm, once viewed as a trusted =
seal of approval, now may not carry the imprimatur of authority.=20
Some of the sell-off could be an overreaction. The U.S. continues to have o=
ne of the world's most rigorous accounting systems, and most companies clea=
rly function within the rules.=20
But just as investors ultimately turned away from overhyped tech stocks dur=
ing the Internet bust, in the wake of Enron they clearly have no stomach fo=
r any hint of accounting irregularities.=20
"The market has little or no tolerance for any of the unknowns associated w=
ith . . . accounting right now," said Matthew Johnson, head of U.S. stock t=
rading at New York brokerage firm Lehman Brothers. "It is just bar-the-door=
s."=20
Amid a growing sense that bull-market excess made companies push accounting=
 rules to the limit in the late 1990s, regulators, accounting firms and rat=
ing agencies have become more sensitive than ever -- raising the specter of=
 more bombshells. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, las=
t week reminded public companies of the need to clearly disclose financial =
transactions, including off-balance-sheet financings, in their forthcoming =
annual reports. Moody's Investors Service Inc., the big credit-rating agenc=
y, has demanded that more than 4,000 bond issuers provide new information o=
n off-balance-sheet arrangements that could involve financial risks. And au=
diting firms are taking a tougher stance with clients.=20
In the case of PNC, the bank said it planned to restate its numbers in the =
wake of an accounting probe by the Federal Reserve and the SEC.=20
"What is underlying this whole thing is a huge discrepancy concerning what =
really constitutes earnings," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer=
 at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "The market is =
giving a big haircut to companies whose earnings numbers raise questions in=
 investors' minds."=20
Several of those companies said the attention is unfair. "Clearly we are in=
 an environment where people are intensely skeptical of Corporate America,"=
 said Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chairman and chief executive, who said his c=
ompany's payment to the director was "appropriate" and had been fully discl=
osed in Tyco's proxy statement. "Obviously, we believe the reaction in our =
stock price was unjustified."=20
Williams executives have in the past said their accounting practices are mo=
re open than Enron's. A spokesman said yesterday the company has "the finan=
cial capability" to make good on its commitments to its former unit.=20
Investors also suspect that organizations assigned to make the rules, like =
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, often act more like protectors of=
 the industry they watch. That, in part, is why Enron, like so many other c=
ompanies, was allowed to exploit lax rules for "special-purpose entities" t=
hat allowed it to keep tens of billions of dollars of debt off its balance =
sheet. Losses related to this debt contributed to Enron's abrupt downfall.=
=20
The consequences of those suspicions could be huge, both for the stock mark=
et and the accounting profession. Politicians and investors, for instance, =
are openly questioning whether the accounting industry should be allowed to=
 continue regulating itself.=20
The recession that began last year is helping drive accounting issues out o=
f the woodwork. Analysts say it is a lot easier for companies to hide poor =
performance through aggressive accounting during good times -- when stocks =
are rising and the economy is booming -- than it is when the market is in t=
he tank and the economy is slowing down.=20
When bear markets hit, companies like Tyco, which had relied on high-priced=
 stock acquisitions to fuel their growth, no longer have the currency to ke=
ep buying other companies. And while investors and analysts often are willi=
ng to let things slide during good times, they want real answers and inform=
ation when stocks are going down and wiping out their portfolios.=20
Enron has added an unsettling new dimension. As complex and opaque as its f=
inancial statements were, what many investors are starting to recognize is =
that they don't understand the financial statements of many other companies=
 in which they have big stakes. Neither, they fear, do the rating agencies =
ranking the quality of their debt or the Wall Street analysts and brokers w=
ho are recommending the stocks.=20
Restatements have been on the rise for more than a decade, and the SEC now =
has more accounting-fraud cases on its hands than ever before. According to=
 a study last year by the research arm of Financial Executives Internationa=
l, a trade group in Morristown, N.J., there were 464 financial restatements=
 by companies from 1998 through 2000 -- more than in the previous 10 years =
combined.=20
Enron, however, was the financial markets' equivalent of the perfect storm =
-- a debacle so huge on so many different levels that it demanded the natio=
n's attention. What's more, it exposed the degree to which hundreds of othe=
r companies' accounting practices are similar in certain ways to Enron's.=
=20
The large accounting firms, such as Andersen, say the problem lies not with=
 their conduct and priorities but with weaknesses in generally accepted acc=
ounting principles themselves. Likewise, they say, if only they could be de=
legated the job of fixing the system, then it could be fixed.=20
Until investors conclude it is fixed, though, the market may have to brace =
for more days like yesterday.=20
In addition to the declines in the Dow Jones industrials, the broad Standar=
d & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.86%, or 32.42 points. The Nasdaq Compo=
site Index, dominated by technology stocks, fell 2.62%, or 50.92 points, to=
 1892.99, leaving it down 3% for the year.=20
In a sign of how much times have changed, the normally staid banking group =
fell far harder yesterday than technology stocks, which ordinarily are the =
market's most volatile group. A widely watched index of the nation's major =
bank stocks compiled by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, for example, fell =
more than 5% on the day, while the exchange's index of the nation's main co=
mputer-chip stocks, which has been one of the market's most volatile groups=
 in recent weeks, fell only 2.4%.=20
The worry wasn't just that accounting issues could cause more high-profile =
bankruptcies, although that certainly was on some people's minds. It was al=
so that accounting issues could hold down earnings growth by forcing compan=
ies to use more-conservative accounting practices.=20
Recalling that Enron investors suffered if they held onto the energy-tradin=
g company's stock until they understood how bad the accounting problem was,=
 shareholders in other companies tarred by accounting questions tended to s=
ell first and ask questions later.=20
Money flowed out of stocks and toward the relative safety of Treasury bonds=
, pushing government securities' prices up sharply. The government bonds ro=
se despite stronger economic news, which normally would push bonds down bec=
ause it would spur expectations that the Federal Reserve has finished cutti=
ng interest rates. The 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, or $8.125 for each=
 $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.97%.=
=20
The renewed preoccupation with accounting problems shifted investors' atten=
tion away from the two-day Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy that =
is to wind up this afternoon. After cutting its interest-rate targets 11 co=
nsecutive times in an effort to stimulate the economy, the Fed is widely ex=
pected to leave rates unchanged, the first time it has done that in more th=
an a year. The Fed is expected to announce its decision and issue comments =
on the economy at about 2:15 p.m. EST today.=20
But now, investors said, they want to see the economy actually respond, in =
the form of improving corporate performance.=20
"The concern is that these accounting issues are going to cause the economy=
 to go into a double-dip" recession, in which the recovery stalls and the e=
conomy sinks a second time, Lehman's Mr. Johnson said. "There is a concern =
that there is more truth serum that has to be taken by companies."=20
In addition, some investors still caution that the economic recovery is wea=
ker than many investors think.=20
"There has been a modest bounce in economic activity," Greg Jensen of Westp=
ort, Conn., money-management firm Bridgewater Associates said in a report t=
o clients, but "at this point, all we have done is return to Sept. 10 level=
s. Prior to Sept. 11, we described the economy as `post-bubble and vulnerab=
le,' and it still is."=20
What would spook both the stock and bond markets would be any hint from the=
 Fed that it sees a risk of inflation, which would require it to raise its =
target interest rates.=20
As concerns have spread in recent weeks about an Enron effect on the broade=
r market, some policy makers have started to fret.=20
"This runs the risk of truly undermining business and consumer confidence,"=
 New Jersey Democratic Sen. Jon Corzine said at a Senate Budget Committee h=
earing last week. The senator, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs & Co.,=
 wondered aloud "about whether the concerns and the issues that have been r=
evealed here are not more broadly applicable in the economy," and could the=
n "lead to a rise in the cost of capital, lead to serious concerns about fo=
reigners wanting to continue to invest in America in the way that they have=
 supported us with regard to our foreign trade balance."=20
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan dismissed those worries at the same hearing, ho=
wever. Still, Mr. Greenspan suggested that the fallout could transform the =
way investors and companies interact.=20
"The reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking in a l=
ot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to in=
formation coming out of business into the investment community," the Fed ch=
airman said. "I think we're going to find there's going to be a good deal l=
ess of that and that the old issue of competing for reputation is going to =
re-emerge," he added. "And I think you're going to find at some point that =
there are going to be people out there who are going to say that `our accou=
nts you can rely on.' And that probably will increase their price-earnings =
ratios."

At Energy Firm, A Post-Enron Double-Check

The shadow of Enron Corp.'s collapse spread yesterday to Williams Cos., an =
Oklahoma energy-trading firm that postponed its quarterly earnings announce=
ment after questions were raised about $2.4 billion worth of potential liab=
ilities related to a telecommunications investment.=20
Executives at Tulsa-based Williams said they would need several weeks to fu=
lly evaluate issues related to loan guarantees the company had provided Wil=
liams Communications Group Inc. -- a former subsidiary that was spun off to=
 the public last April.
The company was forced to take a closer look at its financial relationship =
to the telecommunications firm after credit-rating agencies raised concerns=
 about potential liabilities previously reported only in footnotes.=20
A company spokesman said the review is directly related to a new, more aggr=
essive approach by ratings agencies in the wake of Enron's collapse. Enron =
had kept billions of dollars in liabilities off its balance sheet through p=
artnerships and other financial arrangements.=20
"People began doing a better, more fuller job examining all our liability,"=
 said Williams spokesman Jim Gipson. Gipson added that the additional scrut=
iny ultimately should have a positive impact on the industry and investors,=
 as people better understand the financial condition of companies.=20
News of Williams's postponed earnings announcement was not received well by=
 investors yesterday. Shares of the company fell $5.36, or 22.2 percent, to=
 $18.78.=20
Gipson said Williams has consistently disclosed the $1.4 billion in guarant=
eed loans to the former subsidiary along with an additional $1 billion in g=
uarantees related to leases for fiber-optic cable and the Williams Communic=
ations headquarters. But the company did not count the obligations as liabi=
lities, something that credit-rating agencies have said they may now requir=
e.=20
"Recent events have caused us to reevaluate those obligations," Williams ch=
ief executive Steven Malcolm said in a conference call yesterday. Among the=
 events Malcolm cited was the broad downturn in the telecommunications indu=
stry, including Monday's announcement by Global Crossing Ltd., an internati=
onal fiber-optics firm, that it had filed for bankruptcy because it was una=
ble to continue paying interest on more than $12 billion in debt.=20
Some analysts said Enron's collapse, which has already hurt several energy =
firms, may now reverberate through the weak telecommunications sector, wher=
e many companies are struggling under mountains of debt.=20
"Rating agencies are more likely to downgrade a company or take a conservat=
ive view of the company than they did 12 months ago," said Drake Johnstone,=
 an analyst with Davenport & Co. "A lot of these [telecommunications] compa=
nies are clinging to the edge, and it doesn't take a hell of a lot to push =
them into bankruptcy."=20
Shares of Williams Communications, which traded as high as $57 in 1999, fel=
l 29 cents yesterday, or almost 18 percent, to $1.34.=20
Corporate credit firms threatened to strip the Williams energy company of i=
ts investment-grade rating unless it finds a way to resolve questions of li=
ability related to its investment in Williams Communications, Gipson said.=
=20
The company had already announced a plan on Dec. 19 to firm up its balance =
sheet by reducing its capital expenditures from $4 billion to $3 billion. I=
t also said then that it may sell $250 million in core assets and an additi=
onal $1 billion in equity. The combined savings and increased revenue would=
 be used to offset any liabilities related to the Williams Communications d=
ebt.=20
Williams is among several energy companies that have invested in telecommun=
ications in recent years. Enron spent more than $1 billion buying 18,000 mi=
les of fiber-optic lines with a goal of creating a market among companies t=
hat would bid for rights to transmit data and voice traffic.=20
But Enron was hardly the only company to invest in fiber-optic lines, and a=
 glut of capacity quickly developed. It is that glut that eventually sank o=
ther companies, including Global Crossing, which invested billions on the b=
et that demand would outstrip supply for fiber-optic capacity. Instead, the=
 opposite proved true, and tens of thousands of miles of fiber-optic lines =
now lie unused.=20
Williams, founded in 1908 and publicly traded since 1957, hoped to take adv=
antage of its old-economy business by installing fiber-optic cable along it=
s gas pipeline rights of way. Eventually, the company completed a 33,000-mi=
le network of its own, which is now a leading supplier of fiber-optic capac=
ity to the media industry. Hundreds of television stations and film product=
ion companies use Williams's lines to send video footage around the nation =
and the world.

The former employees, organized for their trip by the Rev. Jesse Jackson an=

Katherine Benedict, a former marketing executive at Enron, said the group w=

"We are trying to be a voice for the people who are hurting," Benedict said=

truggling and that's what we want to put out there."=20
More than 100 people made the trip from Houston, including former employees=

The ex-employees group, on a trip dubbed the "Journey for Justice" by Jacks=

Today, the group is scheduled to meet with lawmakers on the House side, inc=

Jackson Lee arranged for Jackson and one Enron employee to be in the chambe=

All three said the president did not sufficiently address Enron's downfall =

Enron purchased the metals company in July 2000 from Metallgesellschaft Ltd=
. Enron Metals Ltd. has about 60 employees and its president, Thomas McKeev=
er, will continue in his role, Sempra officials said.=20
The sale of the metals business will provide needed cash for Enron, which r=

. . . And the Enron Pundits

The debate about campaign finance reform can be boiled down to one question=
: What exactly are corporations buying when they give millions of dollars t=
o politicians?=20
Now, there's some heated talk about journalistic finance reform -- that is,=
 what are corporations buying when they lard their payrolls with prominent =
media folks? And should columnists and commentators be taking cash from com=
panies such as Enron, about which they later find themselves delivering str=
ong opinions?
The contretemps has exposed just how cozy the relationships are between som=
e in the pundit class and the corporate world, in which $50,000 can change =
hands for what the average cubicle dweller would consider remarkably little=
 work.=20
The journalists involved have, with varying degrees of candor, disclosed th=
eir Enron ties while writing about the collapse of America's seventh-larges=
t corporation. But they find themselves facing the sort of hostile question=
s usually reserved for committee chairman who do legislative favors for big=
-time donors.=20
I've been critical of journalistic buckraking since the mid-1990s, when I w=
rote about a $30,000 speech that Sam Donaldson had given to an insurance gr=
oup. The gilded trail of corporate honoraria quickly led to such luminaries=
 as David Brinkley, Robert Novak, David Gergen, Cokie Roberts, Christopher =
Matthews, Larry King, Mark Shields, Fred Barnes, George Will and Michael Ki=
nsley, who memorably said: "I didn't do it for years, but it became more so=
cially acceptable." King likened it to "white-collar crime." Many refused t=
o discuss it on grounds they weren't public officials.=20
The issue began to fade as a number of news organizations, including ABC an=
d NBC, banned the practice. (The Washington Post had long barred honoraria =
from corporations or trade groups that lobby Congress.)=20
But now, for those who took Enron money, there's no place to hide, the burg=
eoning scandal having replaced the war as the Beltway's reigning obsession.=
 And the journalists involved (with one exception) have whacked Kenneth Lay=
 & Co. pretty hard.=20
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who got $50,000 from an Enron adviso=
ry board before joining the Times, blamed the criticism on an "effort by co=
nservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left." Unfortunately for this =
argument, most of the Enron journalists are free-marketeers on the right.=
=20
Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who received $25,000 to $50,000=
 for speechwriting help, told me: "I don't regret having done the work -- i=
t was honest work, honestly done, hard work too, reported on my taxes, not =
hidden in any way. . . . But my feeling is: I have to talk about my experie=
nce in order to talk about Enron, and I have to talk about Enron because I =
have strong feelings about what they did."=20
Lawrence Kudlow of CNBC and National Review said that he should have disclo=
sed earlier that he'd gotten $50,000 for consulting and research, but he al=
so said that he's tougher on the energy company because he feels betrayed.=
=20
Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who received $100,000 from the advisor=
y board, sees nothing wrong with such work. His role was disclosed in a Sta=
ndard piece by another Enron beneficiary, contributing editor Irwin Stelzer=
, who praised Lay and Enron for "leading the fight for competition."=20
Other than Stelzer, who failed to disclose the arrangement in articles for =
the British press, the other writers can boast that their criticism of Enro=
n demonstrates they can't be swayed by mere money. Of course, had Enron not=
 suffered a spectacular meltdown, we likely would not have known about most=
 of these financial ties -- and still don't know about other such moonlight=
ing.=20
The Enron pundits have put themselves in a weird box. If they recused thems=
elves and wrote nothing, as some critics suggest, then the company would in=
 effect have bought their silence. By writing on Enron, they risk the appea=
rance of biting the hand that fed them just to flaunt their journalistic co=
urage.=20
Perhaps what rankles most is the notion that Enron was trying to do what it=
 did with George W. Bush, John Ashcroft, Joe Lieberman, Lawrence Lindsey, R=
alph Reed and about half of official Washington -- making an investment tha=
t could pay off later on. What, after all, did the commentators do for Enro=
n? "This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of," K=
rugman told his newspaper. Exactly.=20
It's hard for journalists who work for big companies, write books and appea=
r on television to avoid all conflicts these days. But many of these commen=
tators wax indignant when politicians of all stripes appear to be doing the=
 bidding of those who fill their campaign coffers. For media people to line=
 up at the same corporate trough is just asking for trouble.=20

Greedy Liars? The Enron Scandal; TheBIGStory An Occasional Look at Stories =
Everyone Is Talking About

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Last year Enron was the seventh largest U.S. company. Today it's bankrupt. =
Thousands of Enron workers have lost their jobs. Some have even lost their =
life savings. And maybe it didn't have to happen.=20
What went wrong? It's a story so complicated that investigators have just s=
tarted unraveling the mystery. But lots of people think there's something p=
retty simple at the bottom of the Enron mess: lies and greed. John Kelly ta=
kes a look at the scandal.
The Birth of Enron=20
Enron started life in Texas as a company that owned underground pipes and s=
old natural gas to power plants. Then Enron expanded into all sorts of othe=
r businesses. It sold natural gas, electricity, Internet connections and mo=
re. It bought other companies and grew larger and larger.=20
Enron looked like a success, a company people wanted to work at and invest =
in. But then . . .=20
Secrets & Lies=20
Companies are allowed to keep some secrets -- the recipe for a best-selling=
 soft drink, for example. But there are some secrets they can't keep, espec=
ially if they're a "publicly held" company.=20
Publicly held means that the public can buy stock, or ownership, in the com=
pany. When the company does well and makes a profit, the value of the stock=
 goes up. But when a company is badly run, the stock value goes down. By st=
udying information provided by a company, people can decide which stocks th=
ey should buy and which ones they should sell.=20
For years everyone thought Enron was one of the best companies in the Unite=
d States. If you bought one piece -- or "share" -- of Enron stock in Januar=
y 1998 it cost you about $20. By September 2000 that same share was worth n=
early $90.=20
Enron's secret, officials say, is that it wasn't a well-run company. It was=
 losing money, not making money. And to hide that fact it created dozens of=
 partnerships. These secretive side deals allowed Enron to hide its debt. T=
he idea seemed to be to convince people that it wasn't Enron that was in tr=
ouble, it was these other groups. The problem: Those other groups were Enro=
n. And Enron was like a shaky building about to collapse.=20
Rich Bosses, Poor Employees=20
As Enron's stock increased in value, the people who ran the company got ric=
her and richer. They often were paid in stock, in addition to their salarie=
s. Regular employees did well too -- at least on paper. They were allowed t=
o buy Enron stock to save for retirement. In fact, it was encouraged: Last =
October, Kenneth Lay, the head of Enron, sent an e-mail to workers saying t=
hat the stock was a great deal and the company was going strong.=20
But it wasn't going strong. And Enron's bosses seemed to know that. For yea=
rs they'd been selling some of their stock. It was almost as if they knew t=
he value was going to drop. And it did drop. Last fall, when Enron announce=
d that it had earned $586 million less over the past four years than it had=
 said at first, the stock value plummeted. It was a good time to sell Enron=
 stock.=20
At around that time, though, Enron employees weren't allowed to sell their =
stock. They were frantic as they watched their life savings drip away. But =
company bigwigs were allowed to sell their stock.=20
Today stock once valued at about $90 a share is worth about 45 cents.=20
Politicians' Problems=20
Enron didn't only spend money buying pipelines and other companies. It also=
 donated money to Republicans and Democrats to help those politicians pay f=
or their election campaigns. This is legal, but a lot of people think it sm=
ells fishy. They worry that a senator or representative who got a lot of mo=
ney from Enron might hesitate to do anything that would upset the huge comp=
any.=20
Think about it this way: If someone gave you a $10,000 "gift," would you th=
ink they expected something in return?=20
President Bush received money from Enron. So did Attorney General John Ashc=
roft while running for re-election to the U.S. Senate. (Ashcroft, now in ch=
arge of prosecuting companies that cheat the public, has said he won't be i=
nvolved in the Enron investigation.)=20
Because of these connections, and the fact that such a big company failed a=
nd so many workers lost their jobs and their money, people are wondering wh=
at the Enron investigation will reveal.

Re "Cheney Defends Refusal to Detail Energy Meetings," Jan. 28:=20
Vice President Dick Cheney feels previous administrations have "traded away=
" authority and that the demand for more information regarding the White Ho=
use/Enron dealings is a partisan "fishing expedition." Funny, this administ=
ration seems to have exactly the opposite view regarding the treatment of t=
he general public in its so-called war on terrorism, curtailing our civil l=
iberties and casting a wide net to catch "evildoers."
Regardless of what may or may not have happened in those energy meetings, t=
here appears to be a stink bomb in the administration's Enron baggage, and =
we the public want to know: Did they pack it themselves? Were they asked to=
 carry anything for anyone? Has it been in their possession at all times?=

Cheney regarding Enron: "There is no evidence to indicate anybody did anyth=

Bob Stroh=20

Congressional hearings have been convened to investigate the Enron tragedy =
in what seems to be record-breaking time. When issues directly affect its m=
embers, Congress can move with uncharacteristic speed. The far more urgent =
concern of extending unemployment and health benefits for the growing joble=
ss ranks, however, has been shunted aside for the umpteenth time. Could thi=
s be because the Enron debacle provides greater political finger-pointing o=
pportunities than the survival struggle of those less fortunate?=20
Jane Garcia=20

*=20
"Enron Vision Proved Costly to Firm, State" (Jan. 28) portrays Enron as the=
 root of all electric-industry evil. It fails to portray what happened. Der=
egulation is working in other states. California's Legislature dropped the =
ball. AB 1890 was not a deregulation bill. It was called "industry restruct=
uring" because the legislators would not let go and create a true market, a=
s you allege Enron wanted. The joke of 1996 was that AB 1890 was "re-regula=
tion."=20
You imply that Enron was the most influential lobbyist. In fact, California=
 utilities like Southern California Edison contributed large sums of money,=
 personnel and influence during that period, not to create the "perfect mar=
ket" but to create legislation that would allow them to recapture 100% of t=
heir stranded assets. Many lobbyists were heavily involved in that legislat=
ive process, trying to secure legislated benefits for other narrow constitu=
ents. For state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) to now say, in effect, "Enron=
 made me do it" leads me to believe that he is not the brightest bulb in th=
e Legislature.=20

The American public should say thank you to Enron. The dramatic implosion o=
f Enron reveals a fatal flaw of privatization and deregulation. The Califor=
nia energy crisis is a good example of failed deregulation, where the state=
 opened the energy system to manipulation and price gouging. It drained the=
 state's resources from the three publicly traded utilities--as well as the=
 state's surplus--to the bone.=20
Hopefully, the Enron bankruptcy will slow down the bullet train of privatiz=
ation and deregulation being pushed by the Republican Party. Imagine the su=
ffering the public will face if the privatization of Social Security is suc=
cessfully rammed through Congress on the coattails of the president's popul=

SUGAR LAND -- The Police Department says it will get an attorney general's =
ruling -- a process that could take months -- before releasing the suicide =
note written by a former Enron executive whose body was found in his car Fr=
iday.=20
More than 60 news organizations, including the Chronicle, have asked the Su=
gar Land police to release the note written by John Clifford Baxter under t=
he Texas Public Information Act.=20
"The Police Department has completed its review of the note for investigati=
ve and testing purposes and, at this stage, does not have any objections to=
 the release of its contents," said Joe Morris, Sugar Land's city attorney.=
=20
However, Morris said there are confidentiality and right-to-privacy issues =
and that the city wants a legal opinion from the Texas attorney general's o=
ffice before releasing the note.=20
Rob Wiley, a Houston lawyer familiar with public-information law, said such=
 requests are decided on a case-by-case basis.=20
"The general criteria seem to be, is there an overwhelming public interest,=
 and whether that outweighs any privacy or investigative interest that migh=
t be present," Wiley said.=20
Usually, he said, a suicide note is personal and releasing it serves no ser=
ious public interest.=20
However, in some cases, usually involving the suicide of a public official =
or newsworthy person, the attorney general has ruled in favor of releasing =
suicide notes.=20
Wiley added that the attorney general could rule that parts of the note are=
 private and others public.=20
When someone requests information from a Texas government agency, the agenc=
y has 10 business days to provide the information or seek an attorney gener=
al's opinion on whether it is public information. Sugar Land officials rece=
ived the first requests for the Baxter note Friday afternoon.=20
The attorney general then has 45 business days to make a ruling, although t=
hat period can be extended by 10 business days.=20
Officials expect to send the request to Austin in a few days, said city spo=
kesman Doug Adolph.=20
Baxter, 43, a former vice chairman of Enron, was found shot to death in his=
 Mercedes-Benz sedan, which was parked in the 5800 block of Palm Royale. A =
.38-caliber pistol was found in the car. His funeral is scheduled for today=
 in his hometown, Amityville, N.Y.=20
Although the Harris County medical examiner has ruled the death a suicide, =
Sugar Land police say their investigation is continuing.=20
But that does not mean the Police Department disagrees with the ruling, Pol=
ice Chief Earnest Taylor said Tuesday.=20
"As is the case with most routine investigations, other forensic tests such=
 as ballistic tests, fingerprinting and hair and fiber analysis must be per=
formed," he said. "These and other tests are thoroughly and methodically ev=

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: AN EXECUTIVE'S DEATH
Hometown Remembers Man Who Wore Success Quietly

AMITYVILLE, N.Y., Jan. 29 -- When J. Clifford Baxter returned to this quiet=
 village in September for his 25th high school reunion, his success was no =
secret. He arrived with a chauffeur, and afterward, he treated a group of 2=
0 or so classmates to drinks at Giacomo Jack's, a nearby restaurant.=20
But those who grew up playing football and climbing trees with Mr. Baxter, =
43, a former vice chairman of Enron, said they were shocked to learn that h=
e committed suicide in Texas last week. Many of his friends said they had a=
lso not realized the extent of his success: that since leaving Amityville, =
a village on Long Island's South Shore, Mr. Baxter had climbed to a top pos=
t at one of the country's largest companies.
''He looked great; he was in shape; he looked young for his age,'' said Tim=
 Schultz, a high school classmate. ''But I don't think many people, if any,=
 really knew how far he had come.''=20
In Amityville, an insular place where children run back and forth among nea=
t, modest homes and spend their summers in or near the waters of Great Sout=
h Bay, Mr. Baxter, who is to be buried here on Wednesday, will be remembere=
d not for his successful career but as a loyal son who did not brag about h=
is accomplishments and who always came home.=20
Almost everyone in Amityville seems to know the Baxter family: Mr. Baxter's=
 father was a sergeant in the village police department, and his grandfathe=
r, a plumber, was a village trustee. People knew that Cliff, the youngest o=
f six, was bubbly and smart.=20
But until recently, few people here seem to have given much thought to Enro=
n, let alone realized that Mr. Baxter was among its top executives. ''I nev=
er knew the name of the place,'' said Joe C. Slack, a village trustee and f=
amily friend. ''I never gave much thought to it.''=20
Mr. Slack knew other things. He was invited, for instance, to the 80th-birt=
hday party that Mr. Baxter held for his mother at a nearby catering hall. T=
here were mussels and shrimp, Swedish meatballs and gracious toasts, and Mr=
. Baxter surprised his mother with two gifts: a Lincoln Continental and a t=
rip to Ireland, Mr. Slack said.=20
''All of the sudden, bam,'' Mr. Slack said. ''You see this good-looking boy=
 in the paper, and you say, 'Holy mackerel.' ''=20
John Bochicchio, 43, a high school classmate, said he was struck at the reu=
nion by Mr. Baxter's modesty, his generosity and his connection to his home=
town. Mr. Baxter had mentioned he was interested in setting up a college fu=
nd for Amityville high school students and donating money ''to fix up some =
things in town,'' said Mr. Bochicchio, a bartender at Runyon's, a restauran=
t not far from the high school.=20
''He was really nostalgic,'' Mr. Bochicchio said. ''As successful as he bec=
ame, he never forgot his roots. He loved Amityville.''=20
Mr. Baxter spent his childhood swimming at Amityville Beach, climbing the a=
pple tree in his backyard and playing baseball on an abandoned cornfield on=
 Oak Street that is now filled with condominiums. ''The cornfield boys,'' h=
e and his friends called themselves.=20
Mr. Baxter started playing guitar before high school. Later, in business sc=
hool, he humored his classmates with a pointed rendition of ''Money for Not=
hing,'' a hit by the group Dire Straits.=20
His intelligence was evident inside the classroom, where he once confidentl=
y argued a point with a high school biology teacher until the teacher ackno=
wledged that he had erred, and on the playing fields.=20
''If the ball was out of bounds, he wouldn't just shout you down,'' said Ji=
m Cheviot, 44, a classmate. ''It was an organized debate.''=20
Once, during a game of catch, Mr. Baxter initiated a conversation that Mr. =
Bochicchio found so surprising he remembers it now -- more than 30 years la=
ter.=20
''He's telling me, 'Isn't it amazing about gravity? The earth is spinning, =
and we can be out here catching a ball,' '' Mr. Bochicchio recalled. ''I'm =
doing everything I can just to catch and throw it, and he's already into ph=
ysics and Newton. Even then I knew this guy was different.''=20
But not too different. In his high school yearbook, a surprised-looking Mr.=
 Baxter, wearing an apron, is pictured during shop class, but not as most l=
ikely to succeed.=20
''He was so naturally smart,'' Mr. Bochicchio said. ''I'm not sure he pushe=
d himself to the limit, it was so easy for him.''=20
As things became tougher, Mr. Baxter rose to the challenge. After leaving A=
mityville, he graduated from New York University cum laude, with a degree i=
n finance. He joined the Air Force, where he met his wife, with whom he had=
 two children, and became a captain.=20
Then came Columbia Business School, where he graduated as a co-valedictoria=
n but stood out for being kind and approachable.=20
''He was just warm and engaging and not in any way elitist or condescending=
,'' said Virginia Weiler, a classmate who is now an adjunct professor or ma=
rketing at the University of Southern Indiana. ''He was so rare, too, espec=
ially in the late 80's. He had a sense of propriety about him, and he was a=
 straight arrow, unlike the Ivan Boesky wannabes in our class.''=20
When Ms. Weiler learned about Mr. Baxter's death last Friday, she was horri=
fied. Upon reflection, she came to the conclusion that he must have acted o=
ut of conscience.=20
''He was very much a man of principle and very much a man of honor,'' she s=
aid. ''He was ethical and very much had that military bearing about him.''=
=20
Alumni officials at the Columbia Business School and N.Y.U. said Mr. Baxter=
 was not actively involved in alumni affairs, making his appearances at hig=
h school reunions all the more poignant.=20
''I would have been surprised if he didn't come'' to the recent reunion, Mr=
