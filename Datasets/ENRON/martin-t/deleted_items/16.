Tom,
 
What do you think about getting tickets for this?  It is the Saturday after spring break.  I bet Matthew would love it.

Lyne,
We will NOT be going to this one as we have a girl scout function at Camp
Misty Meadows-Hugs and Kisses, the girls work with the horses.  I haven't
told Krista about this conflict.
You can use our 3 tickets at the SEC Club price and order additional at the
guest price.  Please let me know, so I can turn it in ASAP for the better
seats.
Margaret
