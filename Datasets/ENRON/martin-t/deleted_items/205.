Tom,

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

Cindy

Cindy,

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live
with it.  Becky Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can
also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not
as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least
it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

Tom

P.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you
have for me.
