WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives met six times last year with officials=
 of the Bush administration's energy task force, though they did not talk a=
bout the energy company's finances, Vice President Dick Cheney's office sai=
d in a letter to Capitol Hill.=20
One of the meetings included a 30-minute session between the vice president=
 and Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay that had been previously disclosed. =
In addition, Enron officials met in large and small group meetings with the=
 task-force staff. Two of the meetings occurred after the staff completed w=
riting its report, including one as late as Oct. 10 -- days before Enron be=
gan its rapid slide into bankruptcy court.
"None of these meetings included a discussion of the financial position of =
the Enron Corporation," David Addington, the vice president's legal counsel=
, wrote in a letter Thursday to Rep. Henry Waxman of California, ranking De=
mocrat on the House Government Reform Committee.=20
Mr. Addington, who was responding to a request from Mr. Waxman for informat=
ion on Enron's contacts with members of the energy task force, provided few=
 details. He suggested all of the meetings were consistent with the Energy =
Policy Development Group's plan to conduct "meetings with a broad represent=
ation of people potentially affected by the Group's work."=20
Nonetheless, these newly disclosed contacts are likely to become grist for =
further congressional inquiry as half a dozen committees plan oversight hea=
rings into the failure of the giant energy-trading company. Next month, the=
 Senate Government Affairs Committee expects to open hearings on Enron. Com=
mittee Chairman Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) said at a news conference last=
 week that he wanted to explore, among other things, whether Enron influenc=
ed administration energy policy.=20
The letter produced a swift response from Mr. Waxman, who wrote the vice pr=
esident yesterday asking for more detail. The first response, he said, "rai=
ses additional questions about the extent to which Enron may have influence=
d the administration's energy policies or provided information about its ow=
n operation." For example, Mr. Waxman noted that the day after Mr. Cheney m=
et privately with Mr. Lay, the vice president stated his opposition to elec=
tricity price caps in California, a position that Enron had espoused previo=
usly.=20
Mr. Waxman said the response did not provide names of participants other th=
an the vice president, nor did it mention the subject of the meetings, any =
requests for policy changes and copies of any documents or e-mail communica=
tions between Enron and the administration.=20
White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said task force members conducted the=
 meetings to learn as much as possible about energy issues. The meetings, s=
he said, were held by the staff with "many, many groups across a broad rang=
e of interests to insure they had a thorough understanding" of the topic. S=
he said that the White House was committed to cooperating with members of C=
ongress reviewing the Enron situation "provided they are not pursuing open-=
ended investigations or fishing expeditions."=20
Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed =
for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its =
investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with pr=
ivate partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its =
market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billi=
on last year.

Democrats squeeze information from White House on Enron-Cheney meetings=20
WASHINGTON (AP) - Because of Enron Corp.'s sudden bankruptcy, congressional=
 Democrats have won their first victory in a nine-month effort to squeeze i=
nformation from the Bush White House on its ties to the energy industry.=20
For the first time, the White House is acknowledging that Enron representat=
ives met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides on energy i=
ssues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing pub=
lic realized the company was heading for disaster.=20
Since last April, Cheney had fended off congressional requests for the iden=
tities of business executives and lobbyists who met with the White House as=
 the administration formulated its pro-industry energy plan.=20
The picture changed when Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., began pressing the Wh=
ite House about last month's crash of Enron, whose CEO, Ken Lay, is among P=
resident Bush's biggest political supporters.=20
The vice president's office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide =
was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admission=
s by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening =
into bankruptcy court.

Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met six times with Enron Corp. exec=
utives while the administration crafted its energy policy, Cheney's office =
revealed in a letter made public yesterday, fueling criticism over the ener=
gy company's White House influence.=20
The letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, from Cheney counsel David S=
. Addington, came after a standoff that has threatened to escalate into a c=
ourt battle.
But rather than quell the furor, the letter's limited disclosures appeared =
likely to lend ammunition to critics seeking to link Enron's Dec. 2 bankrup=
tcy to the administration. Waxman called the letter helpful but insufficien=
t.=20
"The vice president has given us a letter with some of the information we r=
equested about the energy task force," Waxman told The Chronicle yesterday.=
 "I think that's useful to have, but it only gives us some answers, and I t=
hink we need a lot more."=20
Until now, the administration has refused repeated congressional requests t=
o disclose whom the Cheney-led task force met with to form its energy polic=
y. Comptroller General David Walker is expected to make a decision later th=
is month on whether to sue to request the task force's internal documents.=
=20
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest corporation, collapsed in a mire o=
f dubious financial maneuvers, dealing a major blow to thousands of employe=
es and stockholders and sparking an uproar on Capitol Hill.=20
Eight separate congressional investigations into the company's business dea=
lings have started, and many Democrats vow extensive probes into Enron's re=
lationship to the administration, especially former Enron chief executive o=
fficer Kenneth Lay's close ties to President Bush. Lay was a longtime Bush =
fund-raiser, and he and Enron were major contributors to Bush's presidentia=
l campaign.=20
"Enron was a major player in the energy issue, we saw them actively involve=
d in California, and we need to find out what influence they had over the a=
dministration's energy policy and whether people in the administration knew=
 what was going on in Enron before its collapse," Waxman said. "This is goi=
ng to be an ongoing investigation of a major financial catastrophe."=20
The letter from Cheney's counsel released by Waxman's office, which is date=
d Jan. 3, said Lay had met with Cheney April 17 for a half hour. The letter=
 said the two had discussed "energy policy matters, including the energy cr=
isis in California, and did not discuss information concerning the financia=
l position of Enron Corp."=20
The letter responded to Waxman's Dec. 4 request for Cheney to "release info=
rmation about secret contacts your energy task force had with Enron Corpora=
tion. . . . In light of Enron's financial collapse, it is important to know=
 whether Enron communicated pertinent facts about its financial situation t=
o the task force."=20
Addington noted that Cheney had revealed the meeting with Lay in a May 17 i=
nterview on the television program "Frontline."=20
Bush appointed the Cabinet-level task force, called the National Energy Pol=
icy Development Group, to develop the administration's energy policy, which=
 leaned heavily toward boosting supplies, including the controversial propo=
sal to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The task force=
 was formed Jan. 29, issued its report in early May and shut down Sept. 30.=
=20
The letter said the group's support staff had met with "a broad representat=
ion of people potentially affected by the group's work," including energy c=
ompanies, environmental advocacy groups, regulators, unions, researchers an=
d other parties.=20
But top environmental groups had complained bitterly that they were shut ou=
t of its deliberations.=20
"We had one meeting with the vice president a month after the report was re=
leased," said David Hawkins, director of the National Resource Defense Coun=
cil's climate center, which has also filed a lawsuit to force the task forc=
e to hand over documents.=20
"I know that the environmental groups' leadership asked repeatedly for a me=
eting with the vice president before the plan was released, and we never go=
t that meeting," Hawkins said, adding that they had been allowed one meetin=
g with the task force staff.=20
The letter released yesterday by Waxman's office said Enron representatives=
 had met with the task force's executive director twice, on Feb. 22 and Mar=
ch 7. The staff met April 9 with representatives of two dozen utilities, in=
cluding Enron.=20
Two more meetings with Enron took place after the report was released, the =
letter said, including an Oct. 10 meeting with the former task force execut=
ive director, who had moved to the vice president's staff. The letter said =
neither meeting had any discussion of Enron's financial position.=20
Addington played down the meetings, noting that Cheney had met with Lay onl=
y once and disclosed the meeting on television in May, and that none of the=
 meetings had discussed the company's finances.=20
Critics were unmoved, however, saying the administration was continuing to =
stonewall.=20
"This is one of these things where just hiding the information continues to=
 make the story worse and worse," Hawkins said. "And dribbling it out by sa=
ying, 'OK, we'll tell you some of the people we met with such as Enron,' le=
aves the question, . . . why can't they tell us about meetings with other i=
ndustry representatives?"=20
The vice president's office did not return requests for a response.

Big Banks Seeking Enron's Energy-Trading Business
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/09/2002
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Several financial institutions and companies, including Citibank, UBS and B=
P, have indicated a serious interest in buying the energy-trading business =
of the bankrupt Enron Corporation, according to people involved in setting =
up an auction of the business. Each company was required to put up a $25 mi=
llion deposit to bid for all or part of the operation, according to court d=
ocuments.=20
An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, would not comment on the number of bidde=
rs or their identity. ''All we're saying is that we received multiple bids,=
'' she said.
There were conflicting reports from different sources yesterday of addition=
al interested buyers, and one lawyer whose client will be involved in the a=
uction said that other companies might submit bids even though the official=
 deadline had passed. The auction is scheduled to take place tomorrow. ''We=
 have the ability to be flexible,'' the lawyer said.=20
Trying to buy a piece of Enron is not as surprising as it may sound, accord=
ing to analysts who follow energy trading and Enron's business. What is val=
uable in a trading operation, according to one analyst whose firm is involv=
ed in the bankruptcy proceedings, is not just the tangible assets -- the co=
mputers, proprietary software and other necessary tools of trading -- but t=
he experience of its employees. And surprisingly few employees have left th=
e trading operation of Enron North America, a subsidiary.=20
More than 500 employees remain, including researchers, traders and analysts=
 whose job it is to determine what the price of a given transaction should =
be, Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said. ''There has been a real effort =
to keep that business intact so that Enron would retain some of the benefit=
s of that business,'' she said.=20
Part of that effort included payments of millions of dollars to keep crucia=
l employees, including some natural gas and electricity traders, both befor=
e the collapse of Enron's merger with Dynegy and soon before the company so=
ught bankruptcy protection. Those payments, which were criticized by credit=
ors at the time, may have bolstered the value of the trading business.=20
''Forget about having all these physical assets,'' said Peter Rigby, direct=
or of utilities, energy and project finance for Standard & Poor's. ''It's a=
 very knowledge-dependent business.''=20
An energy trading business at its simplest sells energy commodities, like g=
as or electricity, at a specific time, Mr. Rigby said. But the business bec=
omes more complicated for a market maker like Enron, which matches buyers a=
nd sellers of commodities, as well as hedging products that allow companies=
, utilities or other entities to protect themselves from fluctuations in th=
e prices of energy products. Some traders might watch the weather in differ=
ent parts of the country to anticipate energy needs, for example.=20
Where the experience becomes valuable, though, Mr. Rigby said, is in unders=
tanding more of the complexities of energy markets -- the times of peak use=
 in different markets in different time zones, the location and capacity of=
 power plants in different regions and potential matches of buyers and sell=
ers.=20
''You've got to know about markets; you've got to know about the weather; y=
ou've got to know about power markets and fuel markets,'' he said.=20
But determining how much that experience is worth is another question -- co=
mplicated, Enron's lawyers say, by the fact that bids are taking the form o=
f ownership stakes in a joint venture that would also operate the trading b=
usiness. Potential buyers propose the percentage of the joint venture they =
would own, the lawyer said; the advantage to the trading business is the fi=
nancial credibility that it would have as a result of financial backing fro=
m outside Enron.=20
A committee of Enron's creditors and company executives will meet with bidd=
ers this week to try to improve the offers that have been made. A winning b=
id could be approved as early as Friday by the bankruptcy court.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron gets bids for trading operations.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Two banks have submitted bids for a controlling=
 stake in Enron Corp.'s dormant energy trading business, moves that may all=
ow the once-dominant business to revive in coming weeks, people familiar wi=
th the company's plans said Tuesday.=20
Enron, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, received bids from Citicorp Inc=
. and UBS Warburg for a majority stake in the Houston-based energy trading =
operations. But a third financial institution that previously expressed int=
erest, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. declined to submit a bid by last night, the =
deadline for bids for the Enron assets, these people said.
Citicorp, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on any interest i=
n Enron assets.=20
Analysts said its difficult to value the once-powerful trading operation th=
at has virtually shut down, hobbled by worries over Enron's murky finances.=
 The assets being auctioned make up the bulk of Enron's wholesale services =
business, which generated $94.9 billion in 2000, with $2.2 billion in reven=
ue.=20
John Olson, an analyst with Houston-based Sanders Morris Harris, estimated =
the trading business stake could go for $1 billion to $1.5 billion, since "=
this thing is going to have to crawl before it can walk."=20
However, Robert Chambers, analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he anticipated=
 bids of no more than $100 million, since he said Enron is basically auctio=
ning off only "people, computers and software, but not the book," referring=
 to contracts that Enron had forged before its bankruptcy.=20
"Chances of getting a $2 billion auction bid are impossible, given that the=
y are not selling the book," said Chambers. He acknowledged being "bearish"=
 on Enron, but said there is still Enron, particularly its distressed bonds=
, which he values at 35 cents on the dollar, even though they are trading a=
t 24 cents.=20
Another analyst, who asked to remain unnamed, said the operation could comm=
and a value of 10 times earnings, or about $10 billion, and any valuation d=
epends on "a big caveat of whether this trading operation will come back."=
=20
In addition to the banks, British oil giant BP Plc also said it may be inte=
rested in the Enron operations, once the world's biggest trader of contract=
s for natural gas and other energy commodities.=20
BP said it had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron'=
s assets, including some back office functions and information technology a=
ssets. A spokesperson for the London-based company it said it may be intere=
sted in other assets but declined to elaborate.=20
Enron has all but shut down its Houston-based trading operations while it s=
eeks a financial backer that could guarantee contracts for the myriad commo=
dities that it has traded. Enron trading operations generated the bulk of i=
ts $101 billion in revenue in 2000.=20
Previously, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg had expressed interest in=
 this role, according to people familiar with the company's plans.=20
The company is slated to decide on Thursday whether to accept a bid. Enron =
lawyers previously stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, bu=
t rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent. The stake would give the b=
idder cash flow from the operations, but it would agree to guarantee contra=
cts.=20
Any bid for the trading operations must be approved by Judge Arthur Gonzale=
z of the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court, which is overseein=
g Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.=20
Enron is offloading the trading operations to generate cash to pay off as m=
uch as $40 billion in debt.=20
Enron collapsed after disclosures of hidden debt in off-balance sheet trans=
actions destroyed investor confidence in the Houston-based company. Enron's=
 advisors have made it a priority to revive the trading operations, which h=
ave all but stalled in the wake of the bankruptcy filing.

Enron favours Sempra Energy to buy its metals trading group - sources

LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp favours the San Diego-based Sempra Energy as an a=
cquirer of its metals trading arm over other interested parties Glencore, t=
he Swiss commodities trader, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs, sources told AFX News=
.=20
"Enron considers Sempra to be the best bidder because it wants the business=
 and the people while other parties just want the positions," the source sa=
id.
"The preference of Enron's bankruptcy committee is to find a buyer who is w=
illing to take the people as well as the positions," the source said.=20
In this way, Enron would also avoid employee severance costs, he said.=20
Sempra director of media relations David Klein said the company is interest=
ed in certain assets of Enron, "which would be complementary to our busines=
s."=20
However, those interests have not been identified to the public, Klein said=

Yesterday, Enron company sources told AFX News that Enron has already agree=
d to sell its metals trading arm to Sempra.=20
Klein would not comment on the report in line with company policy regarding=
 market rumours.=20
Enron was expected to formally announce the winning suitor of its metal bus=
iness before Christmas, but a decision was delayed because of difficulties =
in unravelling the group's complex corporate structure, according to a Fina=
ncial Times report last week.=20
However, the deal was completed as early as before Christmas and details ar=

Enron could not be contacted at the time of reporting.=20

Philippine Min Expects Enron Pwr Pacts Buyout By End-Jan

Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANILA -(Dow Jones)- Philippine Energy Secretary Vincent Perez said Wednesd=
ay he expects the government to reach a deal by the end of January to buy o=
ut power contracts of financially-troubled Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Perez told reporters that the Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management =
Corp., or Psalm, appears to have secured a large discount for the contracts=
.
Psalm was created to assume the debts and assets of National Power Corp. (Q=
.NAP), or Napocor, prior to its privatization.=20
"For Psalm to sign an agreement with Enron, a higher discount rate must be =
offered and it looks like it's going to happen," Perez said.=20
Enron initially offered a 12% discount on future cash flow from its power s=
upply contracts with Napocor, but Psalm wanted a discount rate that is in t=
he "high teens."=20
"Psalm and Enron are still in discussions. We expect something by the end o=
f the month," Perez said.=20
Enron's operations in the Philippines include two oil-fired plants - the 11=
0-megawatt Batangas plant and the 116-MW plant in Subic Bay - which the com=
pany runs under build-operate-transfer contracts with Napocor.=20
Under the terms of its power contracts with Napocor for the Batangas and Su=
bic Bay power plants, if one party seeks to pull out of the contract ahead =
of the expiry date, both parties will negotiate the cost of exiting the con=
tract prematurely.=20

O'REILLY: In the "Unresolved Problem" segment tonight, who's at fault for t=

tives who made millions while mismanaging the company into bankruptcy, and =
the little guy got hosed.=20
But Fox News financial reporter Terry Keenan believes individual stockholde=
rs are at fault, as well. Terry, who hosts the weekend business program "CA=
SHING IN," joins us now.
This is personal to me, because I had Enron stock. And the reason I bought =
it was because I buy a tout sheet by a guy named McIntyre up in Massachuset=
ts, pretty good reputation, guys have a (inaudible) track record. He's tell=
ing me Enron's a good buy. I buy it. And how am I supposed to know what the=
se criminals are doing behind the scenes at this company?=20
TERRY KEENAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, if there was fr=
aud involved, and there probably was, that still doesn't negate the fact th=
at this stock was extremely overvalued. There wasn't a lot of good reportin=
g on it. A lot of people didn't even know what the company did.=20
And the first rule of investing is, don't buy things that you don't know ab=
out, and certainly don't...=20
O'REILLY: Well, I knew about it...=20

KEENAN: And you probably looked at the chart, and the stock was trading at =
$80 or $90, and like a lot of people...=20
O'REILLY: Well, it had a big P/E.=20
KEENAN: ... (inaudible) -- wow, this is, this is a great company.=20
O'REILLY: OK. But it was in a good industry, and McIntyre is telling me it'=
s a good stock, all the brokerage houses are saying it's good, all the CNBC=
 people are saying, Hey, it's great. So how do I know?=20
KEENAN: Well, the second rule of investing is, don't listen to those Wall S=
treet analysts, because they're paid to tout stocks. And what they're...=20
O'REILLY: All right, well, wait a minute...=20
KEENAN: ... (inaudible)...=20
O'REILLY: ... who am I supposed to...=20
KEENAN: ... to do.=20
O'REILLY: ... listen to? I can't get the records from this Enron company, I=
 can't see...=20
KEENAN: Oh, you can, the SEC, they're filed public records every quarter.=
=20
O'REILLY: Who do I go to, down to Washington and look up Enron?=20
KEENAN: No, you go -- there's a Web site, FreeEdgar, doesn't even cost you =
a cent. You can go on there, you can see -- all the records are probably wh=
at you would find, because there were a lot of footnotes and a lot of unexp=
lained questions in this company...=20
O'REILLY: To where? You're telling me...=20
KEENAN: ... and it was, like I said...=20
O'REILLY: ... as an investor, I should go to the SEC Web site and look up E=

KEENAN: The other thing is...=20
O'REILLY: And what am I going to find there?=20
KEENAN: You're going to find all of their public documents. And you're goin=
g to find a lot of footnotes that are going to raise a lot of questions abo=
ut why this stock was trading at 50 times earnings when its counterparts...=

O'REILLY: Did you know that stock was...=20
KEENAN: ... are trading at 50.=20
O'REILLY: ... was going to tank? Did you know?=20
KEENAN: I didn't buy it. I certainly had a lot of questions. But I didn't u=
nderstand it. They were trading something called broadband. I didn't know w=
hat that was, and I didn't know why the stock...=20
O'REILLY: Well, I know what broadband is.=20
KEENAN: I didn't know why -- I didn't know trading broadband was.=20
O'REILLY: All right. Well, here's the deal. Most people, they're not sophis=
ticated enough, including me, to go to the Web site and figure out what the=
 footnotes are. I don't know. I'm trusting certain people to give me financ=
ial advice. Obviously, the people who did that are not on my A-list right n=
ow. But you've got guys in that company who made millions of dollars as thi=
s stock came down, OK? And I saw public announcements. These guys came out =
in public and said, "Our stock's fine. Our company's great. There's no prob=
lem here." They ought to be arrested!=20
KEENAN: And probably ought to disgorge all of those profits...=20
O'REILLY: That's right!=20
KEENAN: ... from selling the stock.=20
O'REILLY: Absolutely.=20
KEENAN: But as a small investor, you could go on Yahoo, put in the name Enr=
on, and this is what you would have found in the summertime. This is the in=
sider selling.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: But Terry, look.=20
KEENAN: ... those -- those executives selling the stock.=20
O'REILLY: Look at this. How many people have time to do this? See? I mean, =
a lot of people had Enron and their 401(k)s. Their advisers bought it for t=
hem. I mean, come on!=20
KEENAN: Well, if I had 100 percent of my net worth in Enron stock, I would =
have been looking to see if my bosses were selling.=20
O'REILLY: Fine. Granted. But even when you have insider selling, the only w=
ay I know about to get it is from "Barron's," and they list it, like, four =
or five weeks after it's sold.=20
KEENAN: Yeah, but they started selling in 2000. They sold 6 million shares,=
 these executives, in the year 2000.=20
O'REILLY: All right.=20
KEENAN: Only two million last year. So they got out right at the top.=20
O'REILLY: All right. So they got out right at the top. These guys inside, t=
hey started selling. But they told the public and all they told all the ana=
lysts there's nothing wrong with the stock. It's going continue to do well.=
 So they lied. So they lied. So what should happen to them?=20
KEENAN: They should go to jail. If they lied and if they committed fraud, w=
hich it perhaps looks like they did, it's not 100 percent sure...=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: Well, let's have an investigation, right?=20
KEENAN: Yeah. There's eight federal investigations right now.=20
O'REILLY: Well, there aren't really investigations. There are congressional=
 hearings. John Ashcroft hasn't assigned the FBI, as we talked about earlie=
r, to investigate the Enron guys.=20
KEENAN: No, he hasn't. And hopefully, he will. But you know, $4 trillion in=
 market value has been lost in the stock market over the last year and half=
. More money was lost in Cisco in 2001 than in Enron. Are we going to have =
a federal investigations...=20
O'REILLY: Yes!=20
KEENAN: ... into every one of these stocks?=20
O'REILLY: If there's insider selling. If these CEOs are lying and they're s=
elling and saying everything's great, yes. That's fraud in the inducement. =
That's against the law!=20
KEENAN: Well, it's going to keep a lot of people very busy. The public...=
=20
O'REILLY: Well, good. Let's clean this up!=20
KEENAN: The public pronouncements are wrong. You can't tout the stock while=
 you're selling, but it's legal for them to sell their stock...=20
O'REILLY: And I think...=20
KEENAN: ... and disclose it, as they did.=20
O'REILLY: And I think all of these -- all of these, you know, spinmeisters =
that go on your show and Cavuto's show and everything -- I should -- you sh=
ould give them their home addresses when they do this kind of stuff!=20
KEENAN: Yeah, but let me tell you, I've had a lot of negative analysts on w=
ho've said negative things.=20
O'REILLY: All right.=20
KEENAN: Some of them have gotten death threats.=20
O'REILLY: I got it. I got it.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: You know what I'm talking about, though. A lot of these pinheads =
don't know what they're talking about. Terry Keenan, thanks very much.=20
We'll be right back.=20

Recession-Proof? Hot Texas Deal Climate Could Chill
BY LAURA MANDARO

Copyright (c) 2002 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Texas has been having its share of woes -- Enron Corp.'s failure, oil price=
s declining, and technology companies and airlines in distress -- none of i=
t good news for the banking industry. But opinions differ on how severe the=
 impact on Texas' economy will be.=20
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn, for example, says Texas ma=
y avoid the recession altogether thanks to its industrial diversity.
And his colleague Chip Carlisle, the regional president of Wells' metropoli=
tan markets in Texas, said, "Our loan demand has remained really strong. I =
wouldn't say that some of the things you see on a national scale you're see=
ing here."=20
There are concrete signs, however, that the once-thriving Texas economy has=
 begun to slow, and some observers say it will suffer the worst of the cred=
it problems and rebound later than the rest of the nation.=20
Unemployment in the state, which has a population of more than 20 million, =
jumped from 3.8% last January to 5.4% in November. The national figure rose=
 from 4.2% to 5.6% in the same period.=20
Diane C. Swonk, the chief economist for Bank One Corp., said that when Texa=
s recovers "it won't be the boom state it was in the late 1990s."=20
She predicts that the nation will come out of the recession in the first qu=
arter, growing at a 0.6% rate. She expects the economies of Texas, Louisian=
a, and Oklahoma -- three states tracked by Bank One in its Oil Patch index,=
 where Texas is the dominant economy -- to shrink at an 0.8% rate, and not =
to emerge from recession until the second quarter.=20
However, the recession in Texas "will be more muted, and bouncing out of it=
 will also be more muted" than at the national level, Ms. Swonk said.=20
Muted or not, the slowdown is making at least one bank consider putting the=
 brakes on its ambitions in Texas.=20
Zions Bancorp of Salt Lake City, a seasoned acquirer of community banks in =
the West, has long had its sights on entering the Texas market. At an inves=
tors conference in December, chief executive Harris H. Simmons pointed out =
that Zions has branches in five of the top 10 growth markets in the country=
 but is not in the second- and third-fastest-expanding markets: Dallas and =
San Antonio.=20
"I could see us getting into Texas with the right kind of deal," Mr. Simmon=
s said. But, he added, with signs of a slowdown there "we're in no rush." R=
eached Tuesday, he said that he did not wish to add anything to that statem=
ent.=20
Increased caution on the part of out-of-state buyers would be big news for =
independent Texas banks. Of 741 banks and thrifts in the state, 714 have le=
ss than $1 billion of assets. And out-of-state banks have been eager to pur=
chase community banks, particularly in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth ma=
rkets.=20
In mid-December, for example, Wells Fargo announced plans to buy Tejas Banc=
shares in Amarillo for $82.5 million. Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham=
, Ala., and BOK Financial Corp. in Tulsa, Okla., have bought several small =
banks, and Bank of Montreal has also expressed interest in Texas.=20
Though many of the acquisitions cost less than $1 billion, the deals eventu=
ally add up. The percentage of Texas deposits controlled by out-of-state ba=
nks leapt from 19.3% on June 30, 2000 to 41.9% by the end of last June.=20
Texas is not an insignificant market for larger banking companies either.=
=20
Bank One gets 14% of its deposits from the state, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. g=
ets 14% and Hibernia National Bank 13%, according to research from Goldman =
Sachs Group Inc.=20
Wells Fargo's Mr. Carlisle said that the one significant change he has seen=
 among commercial borrowers is an increased interest in restructuring their=
 debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. "We're seeing a lot of req=
uests -- certainly something we have to be prepared to do."=20
But even a delayed slowdown could deter more banks from pursuing deals in T=
exas.=20
Acquisitions aside, observers say the slowing economy will probably hurt lo=
an volume and credit quality, particularly among small-business and middle-=
market commercial borrowers.=20
Already, larger national banks such as Morgan Chase, FleetBoston Financial =
Corp., and Bank of New York Co. have said that they expect to take charges =
for this quarter because of exposure to Houston-based Enron. But it is the =
future influence of Enron's failure, the pending sale of Compaq Corp., and =
low profits at Texas-based airlines such as Continental that will hurt loan=
 volume and credit.=20
Texas is likely to experience a "more pronounced erosion in commercial midd=
le-market relating to a more-rapid-than-expected slowdown in the economy," =
said Credit Suisse First Boston bank analyst Rosalind Looby.=20
"I don't think we're looking at a meltdown, but this is going to cease to b=
e the real bright spot that it was," she said.

FORTUNE Advisor/Investing; Against The Grain
Caught Off Balance Bond sleuths were ahead on Enron. Now they have their si=
ghts on three others.

If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess, take this lesson to heart: A=
 company's inability to handle its debt can be its downfall-- no matter how=
 much Wall Street likes its stock. Indeed, while earnings may be a window t=
o a company's psyche, the balance sheet is what gives you a truer picture o=
f its well-being. Bond analysts make a beeline to this crucial piece of fin=
ancial disclosure, paying special attention to a company's ability to servi=
ce its debt. And when the ratio of cash to debt plunges--watch out!=20
The best balance-sheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding si=
gns of trouble. Sometimes, however, the big credit-rating firms, Standard &=
 Poor's and Moody's, which get paid by the companies they rate, are slow of=
f the mark--slower, as a rule, than independent bond-rating services like E=
gan-Jones of Wynnewood, Pa., or research firms like New York-based Gimme Cr=
edit. "We don't have the constraint of trying to keep a company happy," say=
s Egan-Jones President Sean Egan, whose downgrade of Enron to junk beat the=
 big guys by about a month. (To be fair, Moody's is revising how it assesse=
s companies, taking into account additional information that could lead to =
a default. Standard & Poor's, for its part, argues that its existing method=
s are adequate.)
Given the scope--and the surprise--of the Enron failure, it's worth asking:=
 Are there other companies out there that these aggressive independent cred=
it-rating agencies are flagging now? You can bet on it. We're not necessari=
ly talking future Enrons, but simply companies whose financial situation is=
 more dire than the market thinks. Certainly one where the alarm bells are =
ringing loudly (and which--don't remind me--got a positive nod from this co=
lumn a year ago) is Ford Motor. It's no secret that Ford is having serious =
problems, but you wouldn't know it from its credit rating, which is still i=
nvestment grade. Egan-Jones, however, labels it BBB-, a few notches lower t=
han the other rating agencies do and just one step above junk. That's where=
 Egan-Jones thinks Ford will arrive within six months, as the sales boost f=
rom the much heralded 0% financing starts to wane and bad auto loans pile u=
p. Junk status raises the cost of borrowing and would be particularly damag=
ing for Ford, whose ability to cover its debt has been deteriorating rapidl=
y. Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating a company's int=
erest coverage ratio--pretax income plus interest expense divided by intere=
st expense.=20
The ratio, which varies widely by industry, is key to credit analysis. Egan=
 calculates that Ford's interest coverage has tumbled from 2.2 in September=
 2000 to just above 1 now. "That's akin to saying that nearly everything yo=
u earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense, which doesn't lea=
ve a lot of money to invest in the business," he says. Ford responds that i=
t's "disappointed" by the Egan-Jones rating; both S&P and Moody's insist th=
ey haven't been laggards and that their ratings are appropriate.=20
Egan-Jones is even warier of computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Its credit pic=
ture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger, according to Egan-Jones=
--which has already tossed the tech giant's debt on the junk heap with a ra=
ting of BB+, several notches below that of the major rating agencies. "It's=
 appropriate to view Hewlett- Packard on a stand-alone basis, which is not =
particularly attractive," Egan says. "Today it is hard to name any business=
 where it's the undisputed leader--even its printer business is being attac=
ked." Making matters worse: From October 2000, Hewlett- Packard's interest =
coverage has sunk steadily from 19 to just 6.6. (By contrast, IBM's ratio, =
according to Egan-Jones, is 11.7.) Hewlett- Packard officials couldn't be r=
eached for comment.=20
Finally, there's retailer Gap (another company this column once argued you =
should never bet against, because of its miracle-working marketing genius o=
f a CEO, Mickey Drexler). While Gimme Credit's Carol Levenson says Gap's ba=
lance-sheet condition is not yet critical, it's "not nearly as strong as it=
 used to be." Egan-Jones points out that Gap's interest coverage ratio has =
plunged from 27.3 down to 8.8 over the past four quarters. As a result, the=
 firm rates the retailer's debt one step above junk and a couple of notches=
 below that of both Standard & Poor's and Moody's ratings. Gap officials sa=
y they have never "worked" with Egan-Jones and point to the retailer's stan=
ding with the major rating agencies instead. The problem is, as Enron prove=
d, those agencies are not always the first to sound the alarm.=20
