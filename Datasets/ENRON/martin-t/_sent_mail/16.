Thanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.

  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.

Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.

Any Thoughts?

Love,

Tom
