Everything other than the LDC business has been done in the name of HPL even if not physically located on HPL.  I want to start intiating transactions that are not physically on HPL in the name of ENA so they would not have to transfer as part of the sale (ie. Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthaqe Hub).  I understand Dave Baumbach has arranged a meeting with you and Jeff Hodge to discuss.

Thanks,

Tom
