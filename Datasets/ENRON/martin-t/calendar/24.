The State of Texas Energy Section - Christine Marcus
The State of Texas Energy Section - Richard "Dick" Bone

Christine and Richard are responsible at the General Land Office for taking the State of Texas royalty oil and gas in-kind. They have been successful in taking the in-kind oil and swapping it for gas at Katy. Tom, this is the gas sold to the GLO at the Katy tailgate monthly. (We would like to turn this into a longer term transaction.) The State in turn is selling the gas to Reliant who is making deliveries to various schools and offices in the Houston area for the State of Texas.

Tom, Brian and Laura,

I am just putting this on your calendar to let you know they will be in the building. I would like to introduce them to each of you. No need to plan to spend more than introduction time with them. They will be on the floor between 9-10 am this date.
