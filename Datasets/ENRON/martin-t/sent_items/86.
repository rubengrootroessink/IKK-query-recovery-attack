Brian,

As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:

Ed Gottlob
Elsa Villareal
James McKay
Gary Hanks
Darren Farmer
Stacey Neuweiler
Pat Clines
Dave Baumbach
O' Neal Winfree


Let me know what you think.

Tom
