Louise,

I asked Tammie to call the presenters to make sure of their availability.  I also talked to Mari and she is trying to find a bigger room given the size of this group.  She indicated that approximately half the group will review documents and the other half will participate in the presentations.

Tom

This has got to be the last time.

Tomorrow morning a new team will arrive for due diligence purposes.

Tom Martin will be hosting this team

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows.  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Tom   .

9:30		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:00		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
10:30		Credit				Bradford

12:45		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub / Bob 
1:15		HR				Oxley

Afternoon	Dataroom and Trader discussions

Please make yourselves available.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

The Maple Leaf is sending a team of 9 people.  They should arrive between 8 and 8:30 Wednesday morning and stay through Thursday evening (They are planning on a late night on Wed).  

We are currently planning on using room 3371 for the data room, but are looking for another room that might be more accomodating for such a large group.  Please let me know who your point person will be and the schedule for the initial meetings.

Louise
