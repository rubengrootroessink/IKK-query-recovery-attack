Jim,

Noon brunch would probably work better for me considering Matthew's nap time and that Monday is a school day.  I will handling the kids solo since Lyne will be at MD Anderson with Elaine that day, so I hope everyone is patient with Matthew as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants (he has been known to inflict fear in waiters, waitresses and owners alike).  Remeber those days........

Tom

What do we want to  do on Mother's Day?  Mom & Dad have A D Players that day (with me,  Henrietta, Ken, and Mary Ann) from 2 PM to 4:30 PM (or 5 PM ??).  Do we  want to do a noon brunch in the Kirby/Galleria area, or dinner in the same  area after A D Players?
 
I gave mom a  heads-up a month ago about this overlap of events and she chose not to re-schedule A D  Players.
