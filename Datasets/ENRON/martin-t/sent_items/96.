Sherrie,

I talked to Karen Buckley and she said that the HR analyst and associate program is currently full but may be looking to hire again in the summer.  She told me that there may HR needs and/or recruiting needs in specific divisions that she is not aware of.  Her recommendation is to look on the Enron Job Seeker website to see if there are any specific jobs that may be of interest to you.

Call me if you after you look at the website and let me know if there are any opportunities that make sense for you.

Tom

Hi Tom,

Thanks for talking to me last night about Enron and their different
associate opportunities. Below is the description I found about the HR
Associate/Analyst Program on Enron's web site
(http://www4.enron.com/corp/jobs/recruiting/program.html):

HR ASSOCIATE/ANALYST PROGRAM

Enron's Human Resources Associate & Analyst Program is designed to identify
and groom the best people to become future leaders in their chosen field.
Through their rotations, Associates and Analysts have the opportunity learn
our business, become acclimated to our corporate culture and contribute to
our growth.

Graduates
For the Associate program, Enron seeks individuals with an advanced degree;
at least 2 years' work experience (not necessarily HR); and an
entrepreneurial spirit. Associates are expected to assume active roles of
responsibility in development of the HR function, working independently or
on teams. Rotations are for 6 months each, with promotion to HR Manager
being purely merit based. Business Unit rotations will afford you an
opportunity to gain insight into the business and staffing needs of Enron.
HR rotations are designed to develop your generalist, consulting, and
leadership skills.

The contact person listed is Karen Buckley (713.345.4667).  My resume is
also attached. My HR experience was prior to graduate school. I worked at
Vinson & Elkins as their Interim Litigation Coordinator from 1994-1996 and
The University of Michigan, where I was a Department Manager from 1992-1994.

Thanks so much for helping me Tom; I really appreciate it. Also, if you
have any advice about my resume or need any additional information, you can
reach me at home (713.868.9464), my cell (832.444.2229) or this email. I'm
online most of the day.

Thanks again and I'll wait to hear back from you.

Sherrie
