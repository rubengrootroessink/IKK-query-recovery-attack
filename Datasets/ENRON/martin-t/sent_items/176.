I guess the first available weekend you would have is the weekend after I get back.  Let me know and I will respond to this.

Howdy,
It's time to schedule another 1-2 days at Mom/Dad's to
try and 'straighten up' the library and kitchen table.
The holidays are fast approaching, so I don't want to
wait too long 'cause our schedules will REALLY get
crazy then.
Please send me 2 dates that you are available to
assist with these tasks asap. Thanks.
It seems that Jocelyn is working out at Mom/Dad's. She
cleans the bathrooms, washes and cooks. Keep your
fingers crossed that this continues.
Have a grand weekend!
Love,
Mary
