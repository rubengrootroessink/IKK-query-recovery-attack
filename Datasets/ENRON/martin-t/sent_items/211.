That is a sensitive question as I have asked you before about us giving up Reuters and getting one Bloomberg monitor.  We have heard nothing since that lady came by took Reuters away and said she would get us Bloomberg.

Tom, does anyone in our group have a Bloomberg account?  I am going to send in a request for a list of all of the applications that each person in our group has, including Market Data applications.  I think that this is information that I should have.  Until then ... should I forward a copy of this email to everyone in the group?

Laura

All,

To ensure a smooth transfer to Enron Center South we must notify Bloomberg of all Bloomberg accounts moving over this weekend. Market Data needs to know who is currently using Bloomberg in your group. 

Please reply with the names of the people in your group currently using Bloomberg. Please reply if there is no one in your group is using Bloomberg.

Thank you,
