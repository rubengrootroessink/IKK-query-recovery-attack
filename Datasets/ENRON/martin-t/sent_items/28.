Rob,

Lavo has given me the idea that Brian Redmond may not be part of NETCO and it is possible that the Texas Gas Origination business may go away completely.  I would like to talk to you before you make a final decision.  I do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the East and Central it is a source of information for the trading business.  It is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in Texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market.  My opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process.  Give me a call to discuss at 713-853-3079.

Regards,

Tom
