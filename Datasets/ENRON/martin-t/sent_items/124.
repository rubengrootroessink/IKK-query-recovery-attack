From my perspective the Waha, Exxon Katy Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.

Thanks,

Tom

Barbara and Tom -

Please advise as to the latest status of the HPL products being offered on EnronOnline.  Barbara, please advise as to whether the transition from HPL to ENA is effective on June 1 and whether the Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate locations should be offered as ENA prior to June 1.

Thanks 

Rob

Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Tom
