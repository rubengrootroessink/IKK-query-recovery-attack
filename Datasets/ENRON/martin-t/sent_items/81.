Greg,

I am short traders this week and Schwieger is out until Thursday afternoon.  Is there any way that we can move this meeting to Friday afternoon.  Jim and I would like to be involved but we can not make it Wednesday morning.  If the meeting can not be changed then Ed will go in our behalf.

Thanks,
Tom
