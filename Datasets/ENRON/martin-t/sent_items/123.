Tom, you may wish to tell Mary to get it to me as soon as possible.  Interviews begin tomorrow afternoon.

Sorry, I don't think I said her name;  it is Mary Martin.  I left a message for her so I bet you will be getting her resume in a day or so.

Thanks,

Tom

I forgot to ask your sister's name.  We'll look for her resume via fax: 713-646-2147.
