 << File: Vac Time thru 093001.xls >> 
Tom, I've attached a report that I downloaded from SAP, and that shows (in hours) how many hours of vacation you've taken, and how many hours you have remaining.  It's only thru the end of September, so the vacation that you took the other weekend is not included.

Just thought you might like to look at it.
