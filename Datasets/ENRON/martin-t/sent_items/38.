Almost no notice is needed as long as the Products you intend to use are ones which previously appeared on EnronOnline.

Please note that Jan. 21 is a holiday, so we are planning on the launch of NetcoOnline happening on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

Thanks for the info.

Dave

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?
