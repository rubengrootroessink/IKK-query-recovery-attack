Subject:	Log On ID's / Passwords

Please provide any Log On ID's and Passwords for any application(s) that someone would need to access in your absence.  I also need your system Log On ID's and Passwords, as well.

I need this information ASAP - not only for while you are out, but also for purposes pertaining to our big move to the new building, which (by the way) is next Friday, November 9th.  WOO HOO!  I'll be sending more information to you soon about the move.

Thanks,
Laura
