I haven't worked on TBG in four years, so I am probably not who you want on this matter.  I would suggest starting with Frank Vickers or Scott Neal.

Thomas,

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro
