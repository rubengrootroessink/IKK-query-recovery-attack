Since I anticipate that we will be trying to inject and Katy is the only location that helps, I am trying to give us a little extra incentive to get gas in the ground.  I don't anticipate buying much Clear Lake gas other than the short that we have there (6,500/d I think).

Looks okay.  No chance of going $.01 wider on non-tailgate?  Also, I don't think we'll be able to take Clear Lake gas until Phase I is completed (sometime around 5/7 I'm hearing).

Lauri,

Here are the rates for May.  Again the A/D long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month.  Call me if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Tom
