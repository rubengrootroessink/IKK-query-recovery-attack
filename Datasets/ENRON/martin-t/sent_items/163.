The 29th is OK for me other than it is NX1 for Natural Gas.  Starting at 3:00 makes it possible but 4:00 would be better or even the 30th at 3:00 would be better.  I am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist.  The other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then I'll be there at 3:00.

Tom
