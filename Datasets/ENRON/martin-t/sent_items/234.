How come you didn't go to school?  Is it because of your lice?

I am sorry that you are having problems with Shanna.  I am proud that you
are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be
very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna
feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know
it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to
the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the
best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a
new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and
Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that,
but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come
school and it does not impact your friendship with her.
To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of
uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be
fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let
everything else work itself out.
I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably
about bed time.
Thanks for writing to me.
Love,
Dad
