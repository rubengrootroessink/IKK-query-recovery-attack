In a recently  televised event that rivaled the  Survivor finale, the votes were  counted and it was decided that the Martin's Mothers' Day celebration will be at  12:30 PM at Jalapeno's Restaurant  (Mexican), located at 2702 Kirby @ Westheimer Rd.  (And no  one was voted off!!)  Jalapeno's has a nice brunch every  Sunday.
 
Six of our group  will have to leave at 2 PM to attend a play nearby.
 
PLEASE RSVP soon so  that accurate reservations can be made.
