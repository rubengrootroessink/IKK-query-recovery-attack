Jeanie,

I have enclosed Sherrie Trigg's resume.  She is interested in a Recruiter position, job # 00001088305, Traci Warner supervisor.  She is also interested in a Specialist/Sr. Specialist position in HR, job #0000108135, Laurie Miller supervisor.

Her experience has been in marketing, human resources and recruiting.  If you can do anything to help I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tom
