Maybe we should meet.  I am not sure what Dave has told you but my intent i=
s for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objec=
tive in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have=
 a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I coul=
d utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his =
current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role=
 and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opport=
unity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity t=
o see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move D=
ave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into =
trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under t=
he impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appe=
ars that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and=
 certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this=
?

Tom
