Please forward the information to Eddie Leschber and Laynie East.  I know the origination was classified as Gas Assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group.  If those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to Gas Assets.  Ask Eddie and Laynie how they want to handle it.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom, Lamphier and Wallis had orig during the 1st Qtr but was classified as Gas Assets and not Middle Mkt Texas.  These two have been classified as Gas Assets for quite a while now (back to Jan 2000).  Danny and Elsa did not have any orig during the 1st Qtr.
