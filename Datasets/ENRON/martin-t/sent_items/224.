Lyne,

I have 108 hours of vacation left and wanted your input as to how to use some of it.  I will carry over 40 hours to next year.  We are off Christmas Eve.  I was thinking of taking 11/19 off since I have that doctor appointment.  Otherwise maybe 3 to 5 days the first two weeks of December will work.  I may be able to take a half day or two at other times if there is something special you want me to do.

Tom


Correction 104 hours of vacation.
