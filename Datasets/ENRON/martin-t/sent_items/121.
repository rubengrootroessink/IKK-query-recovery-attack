Karen,

Any chance she can start sooner?  Can we leave her assigned to me until the end of June?  I am not trying to turn away help because I definitely need it;  I am struggling with her starting in August.

Tom

I will probably have my needs met by August.  My interest has been in Analyst/Associates coming off rotations that are available in June.  I have been working with Neil Davies to get this done.  I will let you know if I have further needs.

Thanks,

Tom
