I received a call back on the HPL on EOL subject from Ed and it appears that AEP intends to replicate what we have done on EOL via ICE.

Brian,

Tom and I have talked about what Enron would like to do to keep EOL going on HPL.  I do not know what AEP's plans are for trading on their system ICE.  Tom suggested I talk with Bill about the options, what do you think?  Is this OK with you?
