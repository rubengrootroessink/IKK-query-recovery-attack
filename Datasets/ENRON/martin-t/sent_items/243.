I talked to Ina and Eric said he will come in.  The time is apparently between 2:00 and 3:00.

Tom, Ina has sent an email (below), letting us know that some people can come in on Sunday to test their computers/applications.  Do you think it's a good idea for anyone to come in on Sunday, or should we leave it alone and have everyone come in early Monday morning?

Assistants:

It was approved for some essential people to come in on Sunday to test applications and systems only. There will not be time for unpacking.  That will need to be done on Monday morning.
Please check to make sure if these people will be coming in on Sunday and if there needs to be any corrections, please let me know as soon as possible.

GAS TRADING TEAM

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).  

Thank you!
Tammy

We will open the floors between 2:00pm & 5:00pm on Sunday, for the following groups to come in and test their systems and telephones, the users are being selected by the heads of departments and we have support staff on-hand to deal with problems and questions.
25 Gas traders / admins
