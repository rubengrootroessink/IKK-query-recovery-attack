Cindy,

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live with it.  Becky Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

Tom

P.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you have for me.
