Dave,

I generally am pretty flexible regarding vacation as long as there is coverage.  I am not sure that after we become UBS if vacation carryover will happen; my guess is that you will receive vacation based only on your years of service with Enron.  Do you know the answer to that queston?  If not I will find out for you.  Given the size of our group now, it will be hard for you and Mike to take four weeks of vacation after we start up again.  I would encourage you guys to take some now before things get busy.  Let's talk.

Tom
