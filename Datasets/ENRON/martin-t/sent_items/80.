Nick, I am short traders this week and generally do not like to meet during the hours in which the NYMEX is open.  Can we move this meeting to the afternoon(after 3:00), preferalbly when Schwieger is back in town?  If this meeting must occur as scheduled I plan on sending Ed in my place.

Thanks,
Tom
