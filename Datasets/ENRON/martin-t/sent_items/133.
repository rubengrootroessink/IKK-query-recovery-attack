Karen,

Chance Rabon is an Analyst in the Texas Risk Group who is interested in interviewing for the Trading Track Program.  He joined the company in February 2001 from Coastal where he worked in their natural gas risk group.  He seems to be sharp, aggressive and willing to work hard.  Can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round?

Tom
