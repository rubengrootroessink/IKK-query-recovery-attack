Don,

We have not heard of this guy.  It looks like his most recent experience has been managing Coastal's refinery gas supply activities.  Unfortunately the people who have the most history with industrial and refinery gas buyers went with the HPL sale.

Please take a quick look at this guy and see if you know him or about him.  Ask around the desk as well.  I am a little nervous about anyone looking for a job change this close to year-end, but I need someone for my Texas markets.  Thanks for your help.

Don,

I forwarding the resume of David Horacefield.  I was wondering if you were interested in talking to this candidate as a potential replacement for Roger Reynolds.  He has good Texas Natural Gas knowledge.

Let me know.

Regards,
Todd Peikert
