Lyne,

Mom called me today to ask if we would be available to join them Sunday morning December 16th as Dad is receiving an award at Church from the "Dominican Family".  She pointed out that day is the day that you and the girls are joining Mom for the Christmas function at Jones Hall.  Let's talk tonight.

Tom
