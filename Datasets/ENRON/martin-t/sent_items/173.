I don't think we are interested in Hockey but Texans may be of interest.  Send an E-mail to Redmond for us to discuss.  Maybe we can share with another desk.

Tom, read below and let me know what you think!  

Also, would you like for me to look into getting season tickets for the Houston Texans?  I know that Jessica, Barry Tycholiz's assistant, purchased some earlier this year.
