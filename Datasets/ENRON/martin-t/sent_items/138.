What ages? Are there organized activities for them as well?  If not I think they will get bored after an hour or two.  I have not generally done it because I did not have time to keep up with them for such a long period of time.  Maybe someone can bring them up before lunch for a while.

Hi, Tom.  Assuming my children are not SICK!! ... what's the norm about the "Bring Your Child to Work Day" on the Trading Floor?  It's June 29th, and I just thought that I would inquire about it.  I had heard that it's just not done on the trading floor (??).  

My husband works on the Broadband Trading Floor, and we had thought that maybe we could bring both children (one stay with me and the other stay with him), and then switch at lunch time so that they can see where the both of us work.  It's not a big deal though ... the kids won't be terribly hurt because they would be missing out on swimming day at the daycare if they come to work with us on that day.  :o)

Let me know what you think,
Laura
