Fine with me.  As I told you last night I am having dinner with our future Enron gas and power traders in the "Trading Track" program at Nino's at 6:00 PM.  Just to be safe, I probably won't be home until after the kids bedtime.

Tom

Sorry I've been so absent. My weekends have pretty
much just been catching up on my chores. I'd love to
have dinner with you either Sat.10/20 or 10/27.
I'm house sitting at Barb & Rick's this week
(281/482-8069) and then at Michael's next week
(713/868-9776). I'll be at Ken & Mary Ann's on the
Saturdays.
Also I would like to do Halloween with ya'll, if
you're gonna do your usual trick or treating. Maybe
I'll catch up with Tom downtown and take the HOV home
with him that day.
See ya soon!
Love,
Mary
