Bryan,

Yes, I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.  But I still would like to talk to you before you make a decision.

Tom

Tom,

I wanted to let you know that I have started interviewing for my next rotation.  Last week I had interviews (and offers) from two groups in Power. I would prefer to stay in Natural Gas.  I wanted to know  whether or not you have decided to hire an analyst or not. I am very interested in the possibility of working on the Texas Desk.

Thanks,

Bryan Hull
