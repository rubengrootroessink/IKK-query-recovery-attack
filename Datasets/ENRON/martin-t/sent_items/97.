Sorry we have not talked again recently.  I have been trying to get a better handle on other personnel movement on the gas floor that has an impact on my needs.  I would like to talk further with you.  Maybe we can get together next week after work for a beer and talk about what your interests are and I can tell you more about my needs.  I am open Tuesday - Thursday.  Let me know if you can get away.  If not let's try to set up some time to talk in the afternoon.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom,

Just wanted to follow up with you Tom to make sure that you got my resume regarding the Gas Trading position on your desk.  If you would like to get together to discuss the opportunity please let me know.

Thanks,
