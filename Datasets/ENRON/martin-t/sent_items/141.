Elsa,

I was just made aware yesterday that I am to provide my direct reports the following material.  Please make a cursory review and tell Anne Koehler by noon today if you have any matters that should be added to the schedule or corrections that should be made.  I don't anticipate that you will have any issues but I am required to provide this to you.

Thanks,

Tom

In addition you must provide the Key Employees listed on Schedule II attached to this email that are under your supervision with the relevant sections of the Purchase Agreement and the Schedules relating to their relevant areas of responsibility and ask them to notify Brian Redmond of any additional disclosures or corrections that should be made. Accordingly, PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL ON TO THOSE PERSONS LISTED ON SCHEDULE II THAT REPORT TO YOU AND ASK THEM TO CONTACT BRIAN REDMOND IMMEDIATELY IF THEY ARE AWARE OF ANY ADDITIONAL MATTERS THAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE SCHEDULES OR CORRECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE MADE.

It is imperative that this be completed no later than n 12:00 noon on Thursday.  A certificate will be sent to you for your signature attesting to your compliance with the foregoing.
