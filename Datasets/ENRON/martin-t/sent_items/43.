I looked over Daren's shoulder while he highlighted what needed to be deleted.  Disregard my phone call.

Hey Gang,

Attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by Russ Severson... Please take a peek and let us know if we need to change, add/delete, update any points/mappings going forward in a Netco environment... For instance, I would like to change Texoma to Carthage on the curve mappings... Also, I would like to delete all derived curves, leaving only Carthage, KatyTailgate, and Agua Dulce.
The other physical locations would be ShipChannel, Waha and Katy (non-tailgate)... Let me know your thoughts... O'Neal 3-9686
