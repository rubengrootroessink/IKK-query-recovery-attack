I did not know if you heard that Enron has agreed to settle the dispute over NNG and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to Dynegy.  Enron has the right to  buy it back by June 30th.  Enron will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include NNG in that suit.  Bottom line for now NNG employees will become Dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless Enron excercises its right to buy it back.  I wonder if this will impact Eric and Wendy?
