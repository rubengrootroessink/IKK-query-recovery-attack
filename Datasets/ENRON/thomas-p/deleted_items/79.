On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent
presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this
conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher
impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.


My comment:

This is a serious mischaracterization of what was said.   No collusion is
required.  All that is needed for a large impact on prices from the
exercise of market power is for the generators to act in their own self
interest.
