Due to the large number of interpretations regarding the guidelines for
completing and
 submitting the UCAP Certification form, the following is designed to
reduce confusion
 and to bring uniformity to the certification process.

1.   All participants in the UCAP market who have had any purchase or
  sale activity must submit a certification.

2.   All transactions (including ISO auctions) must be recorded on the
  certification form.
   The ISO will validate your reported auction transactions.

3.   If you report activity in any month, you must continue reporting until
  the end
   of the (Winter or Summer) capability period.

4.   Bilaterals transacted after the certification date for the reportable
  month will not be
   recognized by the ISO.

5.   The ISO is are now changing the methodology for the recording of
  sales.

  The following procedure must be followed by a Supplier who physically
  owns capacity
   and does not serve a load.

a.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold by PTID as a purchase, with
positive
      values, to themselves.  Do not report more UCAP than was sold.
b.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold to OTHERS, without denoting
PTIDs as
      negative values.

  The following procedure must be followed by a Supplier who physically
  owns capacity and
  does serve a load, or an LSE who self-supplies from its own resources
  (i.e., SCR).

a.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold by PTID as a purchase, with
positive values,
     to themselves.  Do not report more UCAP than was sold to OTHERS, and
     claimed for self-supply.
b.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold to OTHERS, without denoting
PTIDs as
     negative values.
c.   The Supplier will not report the sale of UCAP to itself, these sales
have been included
     in step a. above.

6.   The following procedure must be followed by Load Serving Entities.
  a. the LSE will not identify PTID's.
  b. the LSE will report purchases as positive values.
  c. the LSE will report sales as negative values.

Attached are three sample certifications and one blank certification.

Sample 1

A Supplier with 200 MW of UCAP sold 100 MWs to the NYISO in the December
   monthly auction.  This Supplier has not sold 100 MW of the 200 available

Sample 2

A Supplier/LSE with 300 MW of UCAP available to sell, sold 50 MW to a new
LSE, kept 150 for its
 own needs and purchased 50 from an a new supplier to meet its 200MW UCAP
requirement.
This Supplier/LSE has not sold 100 MW of the 300 available

Sample 3

A LSE with a 75 MW requirement purchases all its UCAP from two sources.
