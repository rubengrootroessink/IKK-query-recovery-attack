( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Jacobs Ranch Coal Mine Expands to Meet
Demand for Low Sulfur Coal, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 24, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Kennecott Energy Company, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto
(NYSE:RTP), is ramping up production at its Jacobs Ranch coal mine
from 29 million tons up to 41 million tons annually by the end of
2002. The production ramp up will utilize existing infrastructure,
although some mine haulage trucks will be added. Production of Powder
River Basin coal has skyrocketed in recent years due to high demand
for low sulfur coal at power plants. The low sulfur coal burns cleaner
and is cheaper to mine than other types of coal. The Jacobs Ranch coal
mine, located in the Powder River coal basin in Wyoming, is the fourth
largest coal mine in North America.
	   Kennecott Energy is also expanding its coal reserve base in
Wyoming. The company recently announced the acquisition of the North
Jacobs Tract for $379.5 million. The acquisition will add
approximately 537 million tons of coal reserves and will extend the
life of the Jacobs Ranch Mine. Long term development plans for the
North Jacobs Ranch tract include constructing a 2.5 mile overland
conveyor from the tract to existing facilities at Jacobs Ranch, but
officials say it will be 2007 or 2008 before that happens.
