    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc., Houston,
Texas). Seminole Electric Cooperative, Incorporated, (Tampa, Fla.), a
cooperative-owned public utility company, began commercial operation
on January 1, 2002 in Hardee County of a 500MW (mega-watt) power plant
in Bowling Green, Florida.
	   The Payne Creek Generating Station is configured with gas-fired
combined cycle technology utilizing two 160MW Westinghouse turbine
generator sets, two heat recovery steam generators and an 180MW
Westinghouse steam turbine generator.
	   After extensive testing and demonstrating reliable service at
various load levels in December, Seminole has begun delivering power
to the grid. The station's output economically replaces capacity
previously purchased from another Florida utility. The 1,300-acre site
was also the first successful use of reclaimed phosphate mining land
for power generating unit construction and operation.
	   Black & Veatch (Shawnee Mission, Kan.) and subsidiary Overland
Constructors constructed the $200 million plant in 21 months. It will
require 23 people to operate the plant, which is located on 6697
County Rd. 663 in Bowling Green, Florida, some 40 miles southeast of
Tampa.
	   Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative. It
provides bulk supplies of electricity to 10 member distribution
cooperatives located throughout Florida. More than 1.5 million
individuals and businesses in 45 counties utilize Seminole and its
members for electric power service.
