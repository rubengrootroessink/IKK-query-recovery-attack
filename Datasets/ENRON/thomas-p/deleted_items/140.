( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Capacity for the Polypropylene
Market Could Arrive in the Second Quarter of 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Polypropylene (PP) has enjoyed a growth
of over 6% annually until the year 2000 and its future growth is only
expected to slow slightly. Polypropylene's diversity in end uses has
helped sustain its growth through a very slow 2001 industrial spending
year and estimates indicate growth for the next two years will be
approximately 4% annually despite a rapidly slowing economy.
	   Polypropylene has a high tensile strength and excellent chemical
resistance properties that make it attractive for both industrial and
consumer products such as fibers, films, compounded plastics and
packaging materials. These qualities and markets supported several
years of bullish pricing and strong demand. Capacity increases over
the last two years such as new unit additions by both ExxonMobil and
Dow has brought nearly 1.2 billion pounds per year of new capacity to
the market and translated that into reduced operating rates for some
producers as capacity slowly crept past demand.
	   Additional capacity is planned to come online in the second
quarter of 2002 when Phillips Petroleum begins operations of its new
775 million pound per year unit at its Bayway refinery in Linden, New
Jersey using UNIPOL technology.
	   2002 will likely result in lower profit margins for most PP
producers, but its diversity and a good supply of polymer grade
propylene feedstocks will help it remain in a position of growth.
