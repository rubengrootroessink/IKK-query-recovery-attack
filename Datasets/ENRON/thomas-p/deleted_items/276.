>foreign affairs, it's been quite a bumpy ride.  Even so, there
>are promising signs that 2002 will see a return to more normal
>times.  With that thought in mind, TD Waterhouse wants to wish
>you and your family a happy, healthy, and prosperous new year.
>
>We thank you for your past business and look forward to
>continuing to help you manage your money successfully.
