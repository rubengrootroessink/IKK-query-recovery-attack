    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN) (Houston) is underway
with the construction of two new power plants that will bring 1,010
mega-watts (MW) into service during the 2nd quarter of 2002 in the
ECAR (East Central Area Reliability) region.
	   The larger of the two projects, the $150 million, 680MW
Renaissance Power Plant, will be located in Carson City, Mich., on a
30-acre track of land north of Highway 57 on property that was
originally developed by Decker Energy International back in June of
2000. The natural gas-fired plant will utilize four Westinghouse model
501F combustion turbines and will tie into Consumers Energy's
transmission system through a 2-mile interconnection line. Gas
connections will be provided by a 9.2-mile pipeline from Michigan
Consolidated Gas Company.
	   The second project, Foothills Generation Station, is adjacent to
Dynegy's 500MW Riverside Generation, located near Louisa, Ky., that
began commercial operation in June 2001. This $100 million natural
gas-fired simple-cycle peaking plant consists of two Siemens
Westinghouse 501F combustion turbines and brings an additional 330MW
to the grid. American Electric Power will provide transmission
interconnects and fuel will be provided by Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.
	   When Renaissance and Foothills come online along with Riverside,
Dynegy will have added approximately 1,510MW to the ECAR region by 2nd
Quarter 2002. Steve Bergstrom, president and chief operating officer
of Dynegy added, "These power projects will contribute significantly
to the financial base of the communities, providing for expanded
community services that will directly or indirectly benefit local
residents. These projects also will contribute to the county's goal of
continued growth and development, as well as provide much needed
capacity to help enhance electric service reliability in the areas."
