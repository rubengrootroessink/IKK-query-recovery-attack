( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Plover Ethanol Prepares to Fire Up
Wisconsin's First Ethanol Plant in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 11, 2002--The following is an
advisory by industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated; Houston). Plover Ethanol (Plover, Wis.), a privately
held company, is putting the finishing touches on a new ethanol plant
in Wisconsin and has intentions of producing ethanol this month.
	   The five million gallon per year ethanol plant began construction
back in August of 2001 and after a heat exchanger is put into service,
Plover plans to begin producing ethanol from a variety of feedstocks.
The plant was originally designed to process two million bushels per
year of corn seed into the synthetic fuel but it will also have the
capability of utilizing cheese whey and potato waste feedstocks to
produce alcohol.
	   Situated in a region heavily populated by dairy and cheese plants,
Plover intends to capitalize on its location by accepting cheese whey,
a by-product of cheese processing and producing an additional two to
three million gallons per year of alcohol utilizing waste heat from
the main plant. Additional equipment such as an expanded distillation
system will be added to accommodate the additional throughput.
	   They will have the competitive advantage of using low-cost
industry byproducts instead of higher-price corn as feedstocks. When
the plant begins commercial operation, area cheese-makers will have a
constructive alternative to disposing of their whey on farm fields, an
environmentally questionable practice.
	   The plant is situated in central Wisconsin, roughly 80 miles west
of Green Bay in the small town of Plover in Portage County. The 100
foot tall elevator structure can be seen on the Wisconsin horizon from
miles away. The facility will also be the first ethanol plant in
operation in the state since the mid 1980's.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides a comprehensive Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) that
outlines all current development activities in the emerging ethanol
market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants currently in
operation and 62 plants under development. For more information on
