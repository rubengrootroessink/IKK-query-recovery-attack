( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) DOE's Vision 21 Program Sets Goal of
Zero Emission Power Plant of the Future, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston). The energy plant of the future is being developed through a
series of research projects funded jointly between the DOE (Department
of Energy) fossil energy division and private sector partners. The
Vision 21 Program seeks to develop an ultra-clean, virtually
emission-free power plant ready for commercial generation by 2015. The
program sponsors emerging state-of-the-art technologies, which will be
combined in a modular plant configuration to utilize multiple fuels
(coal, natural gas, biomass, petroleum coke, and municipal waste) and
produce electricity along with other liquid fuels and/or chemicals.
The program sets performance targets of greater than 60% fuel to
energy efficiency for coal systems and greater than 75% fuel to energy
efficiency for gas.
	   Speaking at the recent annual meeting of the Western Coal
Transportation Association, Fred Palmer, vice president of legal and
external affairs for Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) (St. Louis), said that
Peabody Energy is fully supporting and is an active partner in the
Department of Energy's Vision 21 Program. The goal of this innovative
program is to build the power plant of the future with essentially
zero emissions. Mr. Palmer went on to mention an ambitious coal
industry program to achieve a zero emission coal-fired power plant in
operation by 2025.
	   This summer the DOE announced the winners of the third and final
round of project funding. So far the DOE has promised $22 million to
be spent over three years on the twelve projects selected. These
projects focus on developing specific modular components of the plant
and involve fuel cell technologies, coal gasification, high strength
materials, hydrogen separation, and computer systems to name a few.
