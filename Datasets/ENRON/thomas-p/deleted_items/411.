Guys:

Bob ask if I could help coordinate a meeting with you to gather valuable input.  
Would Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 4:00 be an acceptable time ?  If so, we'll be happy to step up and visit with you.

Thanks so much...

T.

Teresa,

I was talking to True Quote while in New Orleans and Chris indicated that a northeast RTO was looking at potentially buying there real time system.  I am not sure why they would be looking at the system but suspect that they could use it as a means of communicating with the individual asset owners.  Maybe they would use it to display capacity and prices from the asset owners.  My desire to talk to the desk is to see if they can help me get a better idea of what the RTO's will be doing and to see if they had any ideas on how to structure a deal for the RTO's.  PJM seems to be a front runner in developing solutions for RTO's and has in fact created a company called PJM Tech.  Apparently they came to talk to us in the past.  I have a good contact at PJM but what to clear a meeting with the desk first.
