( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Hydro Aluminum Investment in North
American Secondary Aluminum Sector to Exceed $100 Million, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston). Despite a somewhat depressed secondary aluminum market,
Hydro Aluminum Metal Products North America (Louisville, Ky.) a
subsidiary of Norsk Hydro ASA (NYSE:NHY) (Oslo, Norway) will spend
over $100 million on new facilities over a five year period. As part
of a continuing strategy to expand its international network of
secondary aluminum smelters, which includes five in Europe, Hydro
Aluminum has started construction of its second grassroot North
American secondary aluminum smelter to be located in Commerce, Texas.
The $37 million plant is scheduled to start operations late this year.
The plant will produce 90,000 metric tons a year of aluminum billet
from recycled scrap for sale to extruders and other aluminum end
users.
	   2001 was an active year for Hydro, not only did they open their
first grassroot secondary aluminum smelter in Henderson, Ky., they
also acquired Wells Aluminum and its associated secondary smelter in
Monett, Mo. This will give the company three secondary aluminum
smelters with a total capacity of 260,000 metric tons starting in 2003
when the Commerce plant will be in full operation. The company has
plans on the drawing board for a fourth smelter to supply the
northeastern U.S., once market conditions necessitate the demand. As
competitors have downsized recently, Hydro Aluminum has gone against
the grain utilizing its industry experience and energy efficient
technology to become a world leader in the aluminum billet market.
	   Norsk Hydro is an industrial leader-based in Norway and focused on
world growth of oil and gas resources, light metals and agricultural.
