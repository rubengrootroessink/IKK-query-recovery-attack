     It Never Felt So Cold!  Perception  has a lot to do with how someone f=
eels. If you are told  it is 30 below zero and it really is only 10 below, =
you  will still act as if it is 30 below.       For more than 50 years the =
NWS and forecasters have been  telling you the wind chill and you have been=
 preparing for  the worst. It turns out this formula needed some serious  u=
pgrading when research showed the values in the formula  were much too low.=
 The old wind chill did the public a disservice  by convincing people they =
could safely endure extreme cold.  More often, it scared people into stayin=
g indoors when they  could safely go out, and it prompted unnecessary schoo=
l  and business closings.  Specifically, the old wind chill was too cold si=
nce it  was based on wind measurements at 33 feet (the official  height for=
 wind observations), which can be 3 times as strong  as the wind at the sur=
face. In 1945, Antarctic explorers  Siple and Passel developed the first wi=
nd chill index by  measuring the heat loss from a container of water as it =
 froze while suspended from the 33-foot pole. When the old  formula was dev=
eloped, the technology did not exist to verify  the accuracy those index va=
lues.   The new formula, implemented Nov 1, 2001, uses winds measured  at 5=
 feet, which is much more representative of the wind  that a human body exp=
eriences. The new Wind Chill/Temperature  Index also makes use of advances =
in meteorology, biometeorology  and computer modeling to provide a more acc=
urate, useful  formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and  f=
reezing temperatures. In addition, clinical trials have  been conducted and=
 the results of those trials have been  used to verify and improve the accu=
racy of the new formula.  Check out the new Wind Chill values by watching t=
he live  weather from your closest WeatherBug weather station as  well as c=
hecking the windiest and coldest sites on Wild  Weather in the Cool Links/R=

In Idaho, weather is serious business. Which is exactly  why Dan Heuck purc=
hased an AWS WeatherNet System for use  by his businesses - Dan's Ferry Ser=

 ID, Dan's  WeatherNet System provides a valuable service to community  mem=
bers: local farmers and ranchers use the humidity readings  to monitor the =
best times for crop retrieval, snow enthusiasts  check out the live weather=
 conditions before they leave  the Boise city limits and duck hunters acces=
s the images  from Dan's WeatherNet Camera before venturing outside.   Heuc=
k notes that his store's visibility has significantly  increased since he p=
urchased the WeatherNet System for his  business. "The response to our Weat=
herNet Weather Station  has been great - especially since KTVB/Channel 7 in=
 Boise,  Idaho has picked up our name and stats for use in their  weatherca=

 Earlier this month, WWL-TV (Channel 4) in New Orleans and  WBRZ-TV (Channe=
