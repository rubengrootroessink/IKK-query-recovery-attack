    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc, Houston).
Sithe Energies Incorporated (New York), a Private Energy Producer
(PEP), is investing over $3 billion in new power generation for the
United States and Canada. There are six plants in various stages of
development totaling 3,700MW and five facilities under construction
with over 2,600MW of new power generation scheduled to come online
through 2005.
	   Sithe Energies currently has an 800MW plant under construction in
North Weymouth, Mass., which is expected to come on line later this
year. A proposed project in Rockland County, N.Y., referred to as
"Ramapo" has recently been cancelled due to unfavorable market
conditions.
	   Sithe owns, develops and operates power generation facilities in
North America, Canada and internationally. In North America, Sithe
currently owns and operates 27 power plants producing approximately
3,800MW and expects to increase the number of operational power
generating facilities to over 38 by 2005.
	   Sithe Energies was founded in 1984 and is one of the top five
PEP's in the world. Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC)(Chicago) currently
owns 49.9% of Sithe Energies and over the next 5 years, may have the
option to purchase the remaining 50.1%. Exelon was formed in October
of 2000 from the merger of PECO (NYSE:PE)(Philadelphia) and Unicom
(Chicago). With over $15 billion in annual revenues and serving over 5
million customers, Exelon has become the nation's largest unregulated
supplier of natural gas and electricity
	   Although more than 70 percent of Exelon's 19,000MW generating
capacity comes from nuclear plants, Sithe Energies North American
facilities consist primarily of fossil and hydro power generation.
