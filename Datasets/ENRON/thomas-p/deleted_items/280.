The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 10:00 and 18:00 in the January 9,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 6:00, 13:00, and 14:00
in the January 9, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 10, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.
