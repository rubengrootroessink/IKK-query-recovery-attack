( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New South Wales Coal Project Boost By
BHP Billiton, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated, Houston). BHP Billiton has given the go ahead for
construction of the Dendrobium metallurgical coal mine in the
Illawarra region of New South Wales in Australia. Capital expenditure
on the project is estimated at $126 million with the mine scheduled to
produce 5.2 million tons of raw coal per annum.
	   The company already operates four underground coal mines in the
area with a current capacity of 7.9 million tons of clean wet coal per
annum. The coal produced is primarily suited for coking purposes.
Dendrobium, which is expected to start production in early 2005 and
reach full capacity in 2006, will replace the Elouera Colliery, which
will cease longwall operations following reserves depletion in 2005.
	   In the year ended June 2001, Illawarra Coal shipped 5.9 million
tons of coking coal from the BHP Billiton group total of 33.9 million
tons. Dendrobium will produce 2.6 million tons of metallurgical coal
to be blended for domestic and export consumption, including BHP
Steel's Port Kembia plant, and 1 million tons per annum of by-product
thermal coal for export. The project, which will employ 170, will
inject $190 million into the regional economy and generate 1,000
direct and indirect jobs using existing rail transport, coal
preparation plant and pit-top facilities.
