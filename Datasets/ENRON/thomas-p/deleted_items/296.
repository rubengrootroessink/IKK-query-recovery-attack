( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Tall Corn Ethanol Plant Taking Shape in
Iowa, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Two shiny corn storage silos and a
112-foot tall dry distillers grain storage silo can be spotted from
miles away on the Carroll county landscape as another ethanol plant
begins to take shape in Iowa.
	   Tall Corn Ethanol Cooperative (Coon Rapids, Iowa) and joint
venture operating partner TCE LLC are nearing the halfway point on
completion of a $48 million ethanol plant that will convert some 14.8
million bushels per year of no. 2 yellow corn into 40 million gallons
per year of fuel grade ethanol.
	   Due to mild winter conditions in Iowa and under the direction of
leading ethanol plant constructor Broin & Associates (Sioux Falls,
S.D.), the facility is on schedule for a September 2002 completion and
start-up. Tall Corn will utilize a dry processing technology and some
120,000 tons per year of dry distillers grain by-product will be
marketed as feed additives. The plant is located in west central Iowa
in Coon Rapids, some 60 miles northwest of Des Moines.
	   The Cooperative, which consists of 450 producer and non-producer
members, has invested $9.7 million in the project and is committed to
delivering 4.85 million bushels of corn to the plant annually. Other
area farmers and cooperatives will provide the remaining bushels of
corn to reach the projected 14.8 million.
	   Jay Brunson, Synthetic Fuels Manager for Industrialinfo.com,
added, "This is one of fourteen ethanol plants that are currently
under construction or in operation in Iowa. The state is one of the
nation's leaders in ethanol production with over 418 million gallons
produced annually and when the seven new plants currently under
construction are completed sometime during mid 2003, Iowa will have
the ability to produce over 628 million gallons of ethanol per year."
