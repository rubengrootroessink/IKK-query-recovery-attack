Iris,

I agree with Rob that the course is a little light relative to the time spent.  The course material is on the web and I suggest going through this.  I would also include Paul Thomas in your resource list and recommend spending some time with Paul and the Northeast Physical group.  They live and breath this market daily.

Tom.

Hi,

	I came across a workshop which discusses all the aspects of NYISO' s operation - see email below.  

	Some of the transmission guys suggested that Enron should be represented at this conference.

	However, Rob Stalford says that you guys are able to tell us everything we need to know about the new NYISO regulatory environment. 

Thanks,
Iris

Unfortunately, this course does not stand up to the time invested by the participant. You will find better resources internally at ENRON.
