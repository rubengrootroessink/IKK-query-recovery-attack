Terminals Making Progress Toward Fruition, in an Advisory by

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated; Houston). In an article written on July 18, 2001
concerning the future demand for natural gas in North America,
Industrial Information Resources identified LNG terminals as part of
the solution to the supply and demand problem. The demand for natural
gas is still expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet per year by the
end of the decade, leading to a deficit of 8 trillion cubic feet a
year over today's production. Importing LNG by tanker to a terminal
and then regasifying the liquid before introducing it to the pipeline
system is a very economical way of obtaining a supply of natural gas.
	   Since July of 2001, one LNG terminal has been reactivated adding
600 million cubic feet per day to the supply side and bringing the
total receiving capacity to 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural
gas from three operational LNG terminals. Of the 23 operational
terminals, one is near completion of an expansion and another is
planning a further expansion to begin construction in mid 2002. A
fourth terminal with a capacity of 750 million cubic feet per day on
the East Coast is in the process of reactivation. After the addition
of an 850,000 barrel insulated LNG storage tank, the facility will be
ready to receive its first tanker load in the fall of 2002 and has
further expansion plans to double the size by 2005.
	   Since July the total number of planned LNG terminals has increased
from 10 to 12 in North America. The average capacity of each will be
about 750 million cubic feet per day. Two will be located in Canada,
six in the U.S. and 4 in Mexico. The actual number moving ahead since
July is somewhat different and reduces the number to one in Canada and
two in the U.S. Three of the four in Mexico have moved into the
permitting stage and two of these are seeking E+P+C contractors, while
the third has already selected one. These projects run an average of
$350 to $400 million apiece and most have multiple phases carrying out
to 2008.
	   Ed Weatherly, Petroleum Terminals Group Manager with Industrial
Information Resources, stated, "I believe that at least seven of these
terminals will be constructed and therefore introduce 5.25 billion
cubic per day of natural gas into the pipeline grids of Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S. by late 2005. LNG has a regasification ratio of
618:1 at a specific gravity of 0.43 which will allow the average LNG
tanker to carry 2.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas in a liquid
form, which is about a 3.5 day supply for the average LNG terminal
being planned. I think that there is a growing interest in these
capital intensive projects and by the end of 2002 we should have a
good idea of which of the players will get to market first and supply
the natural gas needed in the energy industry. There have been ripples
in the marketplace as of late, but there will still be many electrical
plants with natural gas as the primary fuel type coming on line over
the next decade."
