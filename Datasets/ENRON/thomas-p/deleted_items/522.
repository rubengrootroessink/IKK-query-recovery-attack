No it is through expedia, we would have to call american airlines and ask
how much the ticket is by itself and pay it of w/ the credit we have w/
them. From what I have seen $1000.00 will be ticket price then we would have
to pay the rest (hotel and lift ticket)

Did you get my e-mail about benefits?
I also looked for Phoenix I foun for $280.00 (COntinental) & $399.00
(American)

Love
me

Raquel Nunes Thomas
