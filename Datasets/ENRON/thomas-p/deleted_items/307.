The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System  is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
January 8 ,2002.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and
Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.
