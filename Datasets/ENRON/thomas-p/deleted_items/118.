The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 07:00 and 16:00 in the January 22,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 through 6:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 23, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.
