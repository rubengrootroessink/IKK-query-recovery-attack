( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Texas prepares for Power Deregulation,
in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas) Texas residents and businesses are preparing for
deregulation that begins in the state on January 1, 2002 by educating
themselves on how electric provider choices can benefit them.
Depending on your geographical location, savings are being forecasted
between $14-$21 per month depending on your electric provider.
	   The Texas plan ranks among the best in the country in its approach
to electric restructuring through reasons like uniform business
practices and codes of conduct that were not present during the
deregulation of California. The state is primed for a successful
transition into a competitive electric retail market and other states
are watching as well to see how smoothly the transition proceeds.
	   Others hoping to benefit from deregulation are the Private Energy
Producers (PEP's) who will construct and operate new power plants
across the state. The Calpine's, Duke Energy's and the Kinder Morgan
Power's of the world will replace familiar utility company names like
Reliant Energy, American Electric Power and TXU Electric on electric
bills.
	   The majority of Texans will be able to choose a new Retail
Electric Provider (REP) as of January 1, 2002 and up to 5% of
customers are getting a head start on electric choice by participating
in a pilot program. Customers can pick and choose a provider based on
whether they want to save money, support environmentally friendly
sources of generation, seek better customer service, or stay with a
brand name they know and trust.
	   In Texas alone, Industrialinfo.com is tracking 49 PEP projects.
These projects are in various phases of development from planned,
engineered and under construction. In all, these projects represent
some 33,447MW of electric generation capacity and have an estimated
construction value of over $19.6 billion. Industrialinfo.com
speculates all 49 new power plants to be on-line by 2006.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Energy and Power markets as well as
