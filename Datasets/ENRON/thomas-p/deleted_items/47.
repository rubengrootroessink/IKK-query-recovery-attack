( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Distrigas Nears Completion of Its East
Coast Liquefied Natural Gas -- LNG -- Receiving Terminal Expansion, in
an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 29, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston). Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation
(Boston) a subsidiary of Tractebel (Brussels, Belgium) is currently
expanding its Everett LNG receiving terminal in Massachusetts. The
current 435 million cubic feet per day capacity will be increased to
over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day and is scheduled to receive its
first new expansion tanker load on March 1, 2002.
	   Kvearner (London) was awarded the engineering contract and
Tractebel coordinated the E+P+C contract. Ground was broken on the
expansion project in February of 2001. The heart of the $125+ million
expansion is the addition of four new 150 million cubic feet per day
Kaldair model submerged combustion vaporizers and two new NOx units
utilizing ammonia as a catalyst for the removal of nitrous-oxide. The
expansion capacity is already contracted to a 1,800 mega-watt
gas-fired power plant currently under construction in the area. Once
completed, the expansion will make the Everett LNG terminal the
largest LNG terminal on the East Coast and the first in a line of
expansions and new facilities that could add up to an investment of
$3.2 to $4 billion before the end of 2005.
