( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Drilling Deep Oil Reserves Offshore
Angola, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Girassol, the Angolan offshore, deepwater oil project
run by TotalFinaElf is set to raise the country's daily output by over
25% from 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 950,000 bpd. The US$2.7
billion project is expected to start pumping by the end of 2001 and to
have 40 wells at a depth of 1,360m producing 200,000 bpd.
	   It is estimated that a number of the wells could produce 40,000
bpd. Partners in Block 17 with TotalFinaElf are Exxon-Mobil, BP,
Statoil from Norway and Norsk Hydro with stakes ranging from 10% to
20%. Claiming that the 1,300m riser tower is the tallest offshore
structure in the world, the company has installed a floating storage
and production vessel (FPSO) with a capacity of two million barrels of
crude. The potential of this and two other discoveries in the area
with a combined total of around three billion barrels has motivated
the company to meet and solve the challenges of ultra deep water
drilling.
