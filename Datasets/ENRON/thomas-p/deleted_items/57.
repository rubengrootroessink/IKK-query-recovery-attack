( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Shell and Eskom Get Together in $540
Million Power Boost Project for Nigeria, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 28, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, TX). A $540 million contract has been awarded to the Shell
Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) for two major
gas-fired projects at the Afam Power plant near Port Harcourt. The
contract from the National Power Authority (Nepa) is in line with the
Nigerian Independent Power Producer Program that is set to break
Nepa's monopoly by licensing local and foreign private investors.
	   The contracts to refurbish, operate and transfer the Afam I-IV
plant and to lease, operate and transfer the Afam V plant will involve
Shell taking over the existing assets in 2002 and operating the Afam
power plant for a period of fifteen years.
	   The projects will be undertaken in conjunction with Eskom
Enterprises of South Africa who will act as operations and maintenance
contractor to Shell. Eskom will handle the daily running of the plant
and supervise the overall contract and project management of the
construction phase.
	   The Afam power plant currently supplies about 240MW to Nigeria's
national power grid. The new investments are expected to make around
400MW available to the Nigerian national grid in 2002, increasing to
930MW by 2004. After the rehabilitation of the existing plant and the
commissioning of Afam V, Nigeria's national generating capacity will
be increased by 20% which could help to cure chronic outages in a
country where only 36% of the population has electricity.
