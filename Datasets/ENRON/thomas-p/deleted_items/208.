	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas) In 1995, Virginia Port Authority (VPA)
was faced with a dilemma. A key question was asked: What steps needed
to be taken to ensure the VPA maintained its market share among
competing US East Coast ports? To answer that question, VPA
commissioned a study to be done by a consulting team of maritime
experts. The results of this study would provide VPA with insight into
what steps needed to be taken to meet their long-term goals.
	   The study was completed in June of 1995 and entitled "The VPA 2010
Plan." The Plan focuses on two (2) key areas: Maximizing existing
port-wide cargo handling capabilities and developing new or improved
facilities to handle the market needs of the future. According to the
study, VPA has the potential for a possible 250% increase in
containerized cargo (potential Intermodel volume increase of 300%) by
the year 2010. In addition, breakbulk cargo could increase by 200% in
the same timeframe.
	   To be capable of handling these potential increases in port
capacity, VPA had to take a hard, serious look at its existing
facilities. It was determined that each of their three (3) cargo
terminals would need renovations and expansions future growth.
	   The largest renovation/expansion would have to take place at their
Norfolk International Terminal (NIT). However, renovation/expansion
work would also be taking place at the Newport News Marine Terminal
(NNMT) and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT).
	   All total, VPA is initially looking at over $334 million worth of
improvements and expansions to help attract the more then 16 million
tons of general cargo forecasted for VPA by 2010. Some of the work
planned includes Intermodel Container transfer facility
renovations/expansions at NIT, a new 4,000 ft wharf at NIT, additional
container/gantry cranes at NIT, NNMT and PMT, the development of an
additional 250 acres of container storage at NIT, the renovation of 81
acres at NIT, the development of an additional 41 acres of container
storage at PMT, additional berths added at NNMT, plus miscellaneous
modifications and renovations at all three (3) terminals.
	   When it is all said and done, VPA is taking the steps necessary to
position themselves as best they can to take advantage of their
potential future to the fullest. Investments, such as those mentioned
above, will ensure that VPA has the capability to maintain their
competitive edge for years to come and hopefully allow them to
increase their market share by 2010.
	   The Port of Virginia is among the largest and most successful
ports on the East Coast. The three (3) VPA Terminals trade with more
then 100 nations and account for an estimated 116,000 jobs throughout
Virginia.
