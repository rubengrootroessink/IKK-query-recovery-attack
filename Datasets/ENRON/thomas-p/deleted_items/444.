New Green Energy Power Development, in an Advisory by

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). Canada's Northwest Territories provincial
government has been looking at the region's major river systems as a
source for green or environmentally friendly hydroelectric power.
Studies indicate that the six river systems in the province could
produce 11,630 mega-watts (MW) of power. Developing hydroelectric
power of this magnitude would require about $16.6 billion for new
generation construction alone, with several billion more needed for
power transmission line and infrastructure construction.
	   The largest river system in the province, the Mackenzie River
system, has the greatest potential for future development. It is
estimated that the river system has the capacity to support the bulk
of studied new hydroelectric generation construction at around $14
billion.
	   Utilization of green power instead of fossil fuels for new power
plants could reduce future CO2 emissions in Canada by approximately
50% and supports the provinces' push for greenhouse gas emission
reductions. In addition, communities in the region would be able to
share over $428 million of power sales related revenues annually from
power companies locating in the area. These power projects can also
stimulate industrial growth by attracting new support businesses to
the area.
