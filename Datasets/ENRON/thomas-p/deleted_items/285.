    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston). Two petrohemical projects worth $100 million
are now being launched in Malaysia by Sasol, the South African
petrochemicals and synfuels company. The first plant going on stream
at Kernith is a cracker for the production of ethylene and propylene
from natural gas. It will produce 600,000 tons of ethylene and 85,000
tons of propylene per annum. Sasol has a 12% interest in this plant,
with Malaysia's Petronas taking 64% and the U.S. company Dow 24%.
	   The adjacent plant at Petilin will produce 255,000 tons of
low-density polyethylene a year and will service markets in China,
Taiwan, other Asian countries and Africa. Sasol has a 40% share in
this plant with Petronas 40% and DSM from Holland 20%.
	   The two plants will increase Sasol's production of polyethylene by
50%. Sasol will use its 10% interest in Wesco, a distributor of
polymer products in China and Taiwan, to access Asian markets for its
Malaysian output.
