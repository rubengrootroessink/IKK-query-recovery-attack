( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) TVA Starts Construction of the Nation's
First Energy Storage Plant, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston, Texas). The Tennessee Valley Authority (NYSE:TVB)(NYSE:TVC)
recently started construction of the nation's first large scale power
storage facility at a two acre site off of Highway 373 just east of
the Air Force Base near Columbus, MS. Construction of the $25 million
facility is expected to take 18-24 months to complete, creating
roughly 60 jobs before the project is finished in 2003. "This
innovative energy-storage plant is designed to improve power
reliability and customer service, have limited environmental impact
and contribute to economic growth for consumers in Mississippi and
throughout the Tennessee Valley," says TVA Chairman Glenn McCullough
Jr. "TVA continues to set the pace for energy production and
demonstrate its role as a national leader in the use of cutting-edge,
21st-Century technologies."
	   The plant was designed by Regenesys Technologies Limited, part of
Innogy plc (UK) and utilizes regenerative fuel cell technology. During
periods of low electrical demand the cells are charged with
electricity generated at other locations. The stored energy is then
released during times of demand. The power storage facility is
designed to store up to 120 megawatt-hours of energy and will be
capable of providing power to 7,500 homes for up to 10 hours. "This
will be the first use of the Regenesys technology in the United
States," said Regenesys Technology Chief Executive Officer Andrew
Duff. Rengenesys and Innogy are currently building a similar plant in
the United Kingdom scheduled for completion in 2002.
