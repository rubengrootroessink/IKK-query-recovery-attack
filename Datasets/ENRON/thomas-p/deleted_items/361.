( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Russia Versus the Rest in Guinean
Bauxite Scrap, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). The Dian-Dian bauxite concession in the West African
country of Guinea is the bone of contention between Russian Aluminium
(Rusal) and a consortium, CBG (Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee),
which has among its members Pechiney, Comalco, Alcoa, VAW and Alcan.
The Russians already have a concession at Kindia but set the cost of
bauxite production at Dian-Dian at roughly 50% of their Kindia deal.
They claim that a deal was struck when the Guinean president visited
Moscow in July, which pre-empted the CBG group who in turn claim to
have first right of refusal with the government in the capital Conakry
and are challenging Rusal's claim.
	   Dian-Dian is reported by Rusal to hold between 400 million and one
billion tons of bauxite. Local Guineans are split between increasing
support for the Russians to assist in developing the national alumina
and mining industry and those who doubt whether the Russians will
eventually build a planned alumina refinery in Guinea. The latter
faction sees CBG benefits in broad industry involvement and the
stability of its members.
