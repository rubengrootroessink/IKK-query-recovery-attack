Construction of 468MW Energy Center in Illinois, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). AmerenEnergy Generating Company (Saint
Louis, Mo.) is currently underway with the construction of a $160
million 468 mega-watt (MW) energy center to be located in Elgin,
Illinois. AmerenEnergy is an operator of more than 3,500MW of
generating capacity.
	   Construction began in November of 2001 for The Elgin Energy
Center, located on 1559 Gifford Road near the intersection of Gifford
and Spaulding Roads in Cook County and completion is expected in the
fall of 2002.
	   Sargent & Lundy (Chicago, Ill.) was selected to provide
engineering services and Fru-Con Construction Corporation (Ballwin,
Mo.) was selected as the overall general contractor to construct the
new power station.
	   The facility will use four simple-cycle natural gas fired
turbines, which will produce up to 468MW of peak load electricity. The
turbines will have the capability to be operated with wet compression
if needed for power augmentation following achievement of normal full
load power output. Wet Compression entails introduction of water into
the inlet air duct and evaporation of the water in the compressor.
	   Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) provides electric and gas services
to customers in Missouri and Illinois through its subsidiaries,
AmerenCIPS, AmerenUE, and AmerenEnergy Generating Company.
	   Ameren has $9 billion in assets, almost $6 billion in market
capitalization and $3.5 billion in total revenues. Ameren companies'
net generating capacity is nearly 12,000MW with a total of 14
base-load and hydroelectric plants, currently employing over 7,300
people.
