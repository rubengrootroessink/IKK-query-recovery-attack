=09 If you made a New Year's resolution, you've got company -- with history=
, that is! Making New Year's resolutions has been a tradition since the ear=
ly Babylonians. While their most popular resolution was to return borrowed =
farm equipment, your resolution probably has something to do with getting b=
etter organized and prepared for the semester or to become a better student=
 with higher grades.   With  Questia , this is one resolution you'll be abl=
e to keep. Questia is the essential tool for any college student; and at $1=
9.95 per month , it's a great value. Compare Questia to the investment you =
already have in your education -- room and board, tuition, college prep cou=
rses, etc. Questia is a much smaller investment, less than the cost of a te=
xtbook, and will help you to achieve success at school.  =09
