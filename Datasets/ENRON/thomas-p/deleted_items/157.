( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Canada's Iogen Produces Ethanol From
Wheat Straw, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Iogen Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario) a privately held
company, is preparing final touches on a pilot scale ethanol plant to
demonstrate how ethanol can be produced from cellulose plant fibers.
	   Iogen is on target to begin producing 3,100 gallons per day of
fuel grade ethanol by the spring of 2002, utilizing approximately 40
tons per day of wheat straw feedstock. The process involves making
sugar from cellulose plant fiber. The sugars are fermented and
distilled into ethanol. Formerly, Ethanol-from-cellulose was
impractical and costly to manufacture until Iogen had success in
developing and manufacturing industrial enzymes to make ethanol fuel
out of agricultural residues.
	   The facility, located in Ottawa, Ontario Canada, has been in the
works since October of 1997. With capital assistance from Petro-Canada
(Calgary, Alberta), Iogen has made an investment of $30 million
(Canadian) to validate the usage of ethanol-from-cellulose technology.
Plans are already underway to find a site to construct a commercial
scale facility to produce roughly 50 million gallons per year of
ethanol.
	   Jay Brunson, synthetic fuels manager for Industrial Information
Resources said, "Iogen has been investigating possible sites for the
$60 plus million commercial scale plant in the United States, Canada
and the United Kingdom. We could see the first use of this type of
technology in a large scale commercial plant as early as 2004."
	   Industrial Information Resources has developed an exclusive
real-time database for the ethanol industry. The Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. For more information on upcoming construction
activities in the synthetic fuels industry as well as other industrial
