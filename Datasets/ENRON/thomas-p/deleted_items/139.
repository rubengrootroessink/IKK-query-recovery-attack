    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). US Energy Partners LLC (Russell, KS) have completed
construction of a $30 plus million ethanol plant in Kansas that will
produce fuel grade ethanol from some 9 million bushels of milo
feedstock annually.
	   When fully commissioned in February of this year, the plant will
produce 25 million gallons per year of fuel grade ethanol. US Energy
Partners have also entered an agreement with Williams Bio-Energy
(Pekin, Ill.) to market all of the ethanol to be produced at the plant.
	   The plant will also receive process steam from the City of
Russell's new 15MW (mega-watt) cogeneration power plant that is
currently under construction near the site. The steam will be utilized
to dry the distillers grain by-product produced during the process of
making ethanol.
	   The facility is located roughly 220 miles west of Kansas City,
Kansas.
	   Jay Brunson, IIR's Synthetic Fuels Manager added, "US Energy is
the fifth operational ethanol plant in Kansas. Currently about 37
million gallons per year of ethanol come out of Kansas. Four
additional ethanol plants are currently underdevelopment and when they
come on line in 2003, the state will have the capacity of producing
about 152 million gallons annually."
