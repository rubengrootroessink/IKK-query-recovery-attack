Auto Making Industry for the 21st Century?, in an Advisory by

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas) Is the dominance of Detroit, MI and the
Midwest in the auto making industry nearing an end? At least a half
dozen major auto manufacturers are either looking at, or have already
built, auto-manufacturing facilities in states such as Mississippi,
Alabama, and South Carolina. Along with the new auto-manufacturing
facilities come the inevitable Tier-1 and Tier-2 support plants that
provide the parts and supplies necessary to manufacture automobiles.
The southern states are pulling out all the stops, through economic
benefits packages, to attract the automobile manufacturers and their
support structure to these non-traditional states in an effort to
boost local economies. At stake are billions of dollars and thousands
of jobs in the lucky state or states that can attract the lucrative
auto making businesses.
