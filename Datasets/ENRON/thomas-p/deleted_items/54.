Dear Market Participant,

Technical Bulletin # 49 - Multi-pass methodology of Security
Constrained Unit Commitment - was revised to conform with
changes resulting from the implementation of virtual bidding.
For your convenience, redlined and clean copies of the revised
Technical Bulletin are attached.

The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation
in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.
