"Depillo, Raymond V." <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In regard to the message below, I was wondering if there is anyone out there
could shed some light on a few questions.

1.  Where could one go to find information on the Rockland Electric
reconfiguration (FERC filings or even just information updates)?
2.  Why was this not an issue in any of the longer term auctions?  Don't we
now have very inconsistent treatment across the various TCC auctions?
3.  When exactly will this happen?  Since I have yet to see a filing, can we
assume this will be done by November?  If not, it is obvious this move will
relieve congestion on Center East, and potentially lead to an
undercollection problem on TCC revenues?  If this is the case, will these
costs be socialized across all loads (TOs), or funded by the entity that
physically called for the removal of the load?
4.  What happens to any of the grandfathered rights (TCCs) associated with
serving this load?  Will the TO that served this load release those to the
market?  Will they just disappear?  Or will the TO be allowed to keep them?
5.  Will this move be coordinated with PJM or can we expect some gaps
between the treatment of the Rockland load between the two ISOs and their
various markets?

Thanks,

Ray

The five remaining rounds of the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction for
Six-Month TCCs will be conducted with the Rockland Electric Company portion
of Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc. represented as external to the New
York Control Area (NYCA).  This will reduce the load in Zone G (Hudson
Valley) PTID 61758 by approximately 20 percent.  No individual generator
PTIDs are affected by this change.
