Dear Market Participants,

Software release for November 27, 2001

A new Consolidated Invoice will be utilized to report
NYISO billing information. The new invoice will have
the capability to present the current month's billing
and up to eight settlement adjustments, on a single
invoice. Additionally, enhanced data access for bill
reconciliation will be available.

New data postings will be made available on the web site
to provide real-time internal transmission limits and flows,
as well as transmission line scheduled and actual outages.
This posting is part of the collection of data requests made
by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information (this change was
originally scheduled for October, but was delayed). A new
application, called the Moving Range Chart, will plot LBMP
prices for a specific generator or zone and will be available
on the NYISO website.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
