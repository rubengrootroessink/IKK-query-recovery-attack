( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) ``Everything But Arms'' - EU Trade
Development Assistance Scheme, in an Advisory by industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated, Houston, Texas). Mozambique has become the first country
to take advantage of the new `Everything but Arms' initiative launched
by the European Union earlier this year. In terms of the new
regulations, certain goods originating from developing countries may
enter the EU duty-free. The first exports of sugar under the scheme
have arrived in Lisbon, bringing scarce foreign exchange and revenue
to the reviving sugar industry.
	   The past sugar season was the first time that Mozambique had
produced a crop large enough to have an exportable surplus after
meeting domestic demand. The depredations of decades of civil war
followed by two years of devastating storms and floods have dogged the
country's efforts to get up from its knees.
	   The reconstruction and rehabilitation of the sugar industry has
caused the placing of strict import controls on the commodity.
Mozambique will receive an annual allocation of the EBA quota. The
scheme began in Georgetown, Guyana in May 2001, when Mozambique
initiated the first meeting of the developing nations to ensure
efficient negotiating interaction with European refiners.
