( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Brach & Brock Confections Plan New Plant
South of the Border, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.; Houston,
Texas). Brach & Brock Confections Incorporated (Chicago, Ill.), a
privately held company, has begun construction on a new $50 million
confections plant in Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
	   Site work commenced back in mid September on a 350,000 square foot
plant that will be the new home to Brach's line of candy corn and
other seasonal confectionary products that used to be produced at the
soon to be phased out plant in Chicago, Illinois.
	   Jacobs Severdrup (Saint Louis, Mo.) is providing design services
and their Mexico division, Kujesa-Jacobs (Mexico City, District
Federale Mexico), will install the production lines and provide
construction management services. Group Garza Punzo (Monterrey, Nuevo
Leon, Mexico) will act as the general contractor for the 350,000
square foot production building shell. The project is scheduled for
completion in August of 2003.
	   Industrialinfo.com reported back in January 2001 that the company
had announced plans for a phased shutdown of the 2.3 million square
foot Chicago confections plant due to high domestic sugar prices, the
age of the nearly century old facility and consolidation among major
candy players. All manufacturing operations in Chicago will cease by
the end of 2003, but their headquarters will remain there.
	   Originally founded in 1904 by Emil J. Brach, Brach Confections
purchased Brock Candy Company in 1994 forming Brach & Brock
Confections Incorporated, which produces over 200 varieties of
candies, chocolates and fruit snacks.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Food and Beverage market as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to foodandbeveragegroup@industrialinfo.com or
