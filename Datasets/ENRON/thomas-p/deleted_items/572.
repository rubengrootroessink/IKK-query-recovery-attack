Here is the Weekly Analysis & Summary you have subscribed to as part of Ameritrade's Report & Alert Service.  This service provides an Excel workbook containing separate areas of analysis on two different worksheets.  After opening the attached file, use the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet to move between worksheets:

* Weekly Summary Worksheet - Includes personalized market and portfolio summary charts showing your portfolio's performance over a 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, or 6 month period of time in relation to one of 15 popular indices.  This worksheet also graphically represents the individual positions within your portfolio through a performance by position bar chart, a value and sector distribution pie chart, and a portfolio table grid.
* Stock Charts Worksheet - Includes price and volume performance graphs for every stock in your portfolio along with stock trading fundamentals over a one week or one month period.

If prompted, please be sure to choose "Enable Macros" when you open the workbook.
