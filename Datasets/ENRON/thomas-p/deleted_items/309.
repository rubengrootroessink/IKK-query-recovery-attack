( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pipe Link Through Algeria Could Bring
Nigerian Gas to Europe, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston, Texas). Nigeria and Algeria have signed a
memorandum of understanding, which could see Nigerian gas being
exported to Europe by pipeline. The pipeline construction studies to
be undertaken between the two countries will look at a route from
southern Nigeria, through Abuja and across Niger and the Sahara Desert
to Beni Saf on Algeria's Mediterranean coast. Beni Saf is planned as
the terminus for the proposed pipeline between Algeria and Spain.
	   The original project to build a pipeline around the West African
coast to Algeria did not progress, although it spawned the West Africa
Gas Pipeline between Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin, which is now
scheduled for construction.
	   The new plan will need 4,000 kms of pipe laying at a cost
estimated between $5 and $7 billion and would see Nigerian gas flowing
through the new line to Spain and the existing line to Italy.
	   In the wake of the Enron debacle, Nigeria LNG, Italy's ENI, and
Spain's Iberdrola are looking at the gap which will occur for the
Bonny liquefied gas complex if the US company's intention to buy 4
billion cubic meters a year has evaporated. This could motivate action
plans for the new pipeline. So far, the Spanish have signed for 1.5
billion cubic meters and the Italians 1 billion cubic meters of gas
and February 2002 is the scheduled decision time on whether to go
ahead with production from the planned fourth and fifth trains at the
Bonny complex.
