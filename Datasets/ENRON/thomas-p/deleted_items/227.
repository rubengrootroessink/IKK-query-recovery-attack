( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Information Resources'
Ethanol Production Package Forecasts $4 Billion in Capital Spending
Through 2005, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). Today, synthetic fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel
are emerging as the renewable fuels of the future. New requirements
for reformulated gasoline, particularly in California, mean that the
gasoline additive MTBE no longer meets requirements and that its usage
may be environmentally hazardous. In California, the state air quality
board is requiring the removal of MTBE from gasoline by
December 31, 2002, making ethanol a likely substitute. Thirteen other
states are investigating similar requirements. The controversy
surrounding MTBE presents new opportunities for the ethanol industry
for the future.
	   The renewed interest in ethanol has prompted Industrial
Information Resources (IIR) to develop an exclusive Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) to track
the new developments occurring in the industry, along with current and
future plant production capacities, contact information, and capital
spending data. IIR is tracking over $4 billion in capital spending
expected to take place over the next three to five years. This will
more than double the current capacity of today's ethanol production
capabilities. In the year 2001, some 1.8 billion gallons were produced
in the U.S. The market for ethanol is forecasted to grow to more than
3.9 billion gallons per year by 2005.
	   Biodiesel, also known as methyl esters, is another renewable fuel
derived from new and used vegetable oils. Recent interests in
biodiesel have come about after discovering that when a mixture of 20%
biodiesel is blended with standard petroleum diesel fuel, sulfur
content will be reduced down to acceptable levels. In its pure form,
biodiesel can be used as a fuel source in most combustion engines that
accept diesel fuels. Further interest could push this product to the
commercial market in the future. Today, biodiesel fuel production is
at 61 million gallons per year. As demand grows, production is
projected to reach 100 million gallons or more annually within the
next few years.
	   A Bioenergy stimulus package currently before Congress is intended
to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil by 0.5%, while
increasing the use of synthetic fuels by 0.5%. Synthetic fuel
producers are anticipating a greater role for ethanol and biodiesel
through 2005 and beyond. It is forecasted that renewable fuels could
boost the U.S. economy by $300 billion and create as many as 300,000
new jobs in the synthetic fuel sectors of the economy by 2016.

	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. The Ethanol Production Package provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development. For more
