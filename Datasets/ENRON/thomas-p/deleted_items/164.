( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Aluminum Bottle Products May Lead to
Increased Aluminum Usage in the Beverage Packaging Industry, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). About a year and a half ago, Daiwa Can Company,
Japan's largest aluminum can producer, began producing aluminum
bottles for beer and tea companies. The novelty has caught on in Japan
where the company produced approximately 480 million aluminum bottles
in 2001. Along with two other manufacturers of aluminum bottles,
capacity is expected to double over the next 2-3 years. All three
manufacturers of aluminum bottles in Japan are contemplating line
additions or expansions at this time.
	   The aluminum bottle can has all the attributes of the aluminum
beverage can, it is lightweight and recyclable, but is shaped like a
bottle. It comes with a resealable aluminum screw on cap, which is
also recyclable. Aluminum bottles are expected to take market share
back from PET (Plastic) bottles, which have grown in popularity lately
and have replaced both glass & metal in some markets. It's only a
matter of time before this product catches on in the U.S. and other
international markets.
