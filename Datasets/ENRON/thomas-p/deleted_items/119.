Why didn't we think of this????????
When you get ads in your phone or utility bill, include them with the payment.
Let them throw it away.
When you get those pre-approved letters in the mail for everything from
credit cards to 2nd mortgages and junk like that, most of them come
with postage paid return envelopes, right?
Well, why not get rid of some of your other junk mail and put it in with
these cool little envelopes!
Send an ad for your local cleaners to American Express, Or a
pizza coupon to Citibank.
If you didn't get anything else that day, then just send them their application
back!
If you want to remain anonymous, just make sure your name isn't on anything you
send them.
You can send it back empty just to keep them guessing!
Eventually, the banks and credit card companies will begin getting all their
junk back in the mail.
Let's let them know what it's like to get junk mail, and best of all THEY'RE
paying for it! TWICE!
Let's help keep our postal service busy since they say e-mail is cutting into
their business,
and that's why they need to increase postage again!

They'll get the message if we keep passing this on.
