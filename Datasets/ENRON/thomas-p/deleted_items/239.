Security Level:?         Internal

 A Japanese company and an American company decided to have a canoe
race  on the Missouri river. Both teams practiced long and hard to reach

there  peak performance before the race. On the big day the Japanese won

by a  mile.

Afterwards, the American team became very discouraged and morally
depressed. The American management decided that the reason for the
crushing defeat had to be found. A "Measurement   Team," made up of
senior  management was formed. They would investigate and recommend
appropriate action.

  Their conclusion was that the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1
person steering, while the Americans had 1 person rowing and 8 people
steering. So American management hired a consulting company and paid
them
incredible amounts of money. They advised that too many people were
steering
the boat and not enough people were rowing.

   To prevent losing to the Japanese again next year, the rowing team's
management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors,
3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering
manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give
the  1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was
called the "Rowing Team Quality First Program," with meetings, dinners
and free pens for the rower:  "We must give the rower empowerment and
enrichments through this quality program."

  The next year the Japanese won by 2 miles.

   Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor
performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and
canceled all capital investments for new equipment.  Then they gave a
High Performance Award to the steering managers and distributed the
money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.
