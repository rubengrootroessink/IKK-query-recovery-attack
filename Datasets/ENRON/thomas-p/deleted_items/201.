In a train carriage there was Bill Clinton, George Bush, Janet Reno and Bo
Derek. After several minutes of the trip, the train passes through a dark tunnel
and the unmistakable sound of a slap is heard.
>
>      When they leave the tunnel, Clinton has a big red slap mark on his cheek.

>      (1) Bo Derek thought - "That sleazeball Clinton wanted to touch me and by
mistake, he must have                         put his hand on Janet Reno, who in
turn must have slapped his face."
>
>
>      (2) Janet Reno thought - "That dirty Bill Clinton laid his hands on Bo
Derek and she smacked                                 him."

>
>      (3) Bill Clinton thought - "George put his hand on Bo Derek and by
mistake she slapped me."
>
>
>      (4) George Bush thought - "I hope there's another tunnel soon so I can
smack the shit outa Clinton again."
