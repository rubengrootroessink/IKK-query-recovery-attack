( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) King's Hawaiian Bakery Says Aloha to New
Bakery Site, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Food Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). King's Hawaiian Bakery (Torrance, Calif.), a
privately held company, has broken ground and has begun preparing the
site in Torrance, California for a new $28 million bread bakery.
	   King's Hawaiian has been in Torrance since 1977 but has since
outgrown its existing bakery operation and plans to relocate to the
new and expanded bakery by the end of the year.
	   Under the direction of leading food industry architects and
engineers Webber/Smith Associates (Lancaster, Pa.), the new 130,000
square foot bakery will be outfitted with state-of-the-art automated
baking ovens and packaging equipment and two 6,000 pound per hour
bread baking lines. Products that will be produced at the plant
include King's Hawaiian famous sweet bread and multigrain bread plus
dinner and sweet rolls. The bakery has been in the planning stages for
over two years.
	   In 1955, Robert Tiara founded the company, which had its first
operation in Hilo, Hawaii. Realizing the potential for his round loaf
bread in the states, he built and relocated the company to the
mainland in Torrance, California in 1977 and has been baking bread at
that location ever since. The new plant represents the largest
investment ever made by the company.
