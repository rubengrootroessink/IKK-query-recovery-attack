A lady walks into a shop that sells VERY expensive Persian rugs. She browses
around, then spots the perfect rug and walks over to inspect it.  As she
bends to feel the texture of the rug, she farts loudly. Very embarrassed,
she looks around nervously to see if anyone has noticed her little accident
and hopes a sales person doesn't pop up right now. As she turns back, there,
standing next to her is a salesman. "Good day, madam. How may we help you
today?" Very uncomfortably she asks, "Sir, what is the price of this lovely
rug?" He answers, "Madam, if you farted just touching it, you are very
likely going to shit when you hear the price."
