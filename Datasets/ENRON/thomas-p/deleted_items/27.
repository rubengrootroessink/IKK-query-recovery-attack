( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Quebec Emerges As Key Location for New
Pharmaceutical and Biotech Plants, in an Advisory by

    Business Editors & Health/Medical Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). The Canadian province of Quebec is successfully courting new
capital investment from pharmaceutical and biotech companies
worldwide. In the past year, over $300 million in new capital projects
were announced. Quebec is not only seeking established international
companies; they are also "hatching" them on a regular basis from their
strong Biotech City, located in Laval, Quebec. Biotech City is already
home to about 30 biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and information
technology companies and research centers. INRS-Institut Armand
Frappier, the host of Biotech City, is spending over $100 million to
add new R&D laboratory space and upgrade existing facilities.
	   Offering a host of attractions, including lucrative government
incentives and a strong intellectual property base at the
universities, Quebec is emerging as a major player in both research
and development and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and biotech
products. Gone are the hints of outsiders being shunned for not being
French. Clever marketing efforts now promote that deep European flavor
coupled with a desirable North American location. Those efforts are
paying off.
	   The roster of companies investing in new or expanded facilities is
growing every year. Industrial Information Resources (IIR) is tracking
these companies. Merck Frosst Canada & Company (Kirkland, Quebec) is
in the midst of a $250 million expansion and modernization program at
their Kirkland, Quebec site. Pharmascience Incorporated (Montreal,
Quebec) recently completed a $50 million expansion at their Montreal
facility. Quebec is also under serious consideration by two
international pharmaceutical companies for new plant investment at a
combined cost of almost $1 billion.
	   IIR tracks project spending trends in the Pharmaceutical-Biotech
industry and has recently released the 2002 US Pharmaceutical-Biotech
Industry Forecast
(http://www.industrialinfo.com/2002pharmforecast.htm)
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
