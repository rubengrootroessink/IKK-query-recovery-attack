( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Manufacturing Outlook To
Remain Steady In 2002, In An Advisory By Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2002--An advisory from
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). According to the latest release of the 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm)
published by Industrial Information Resources, portions of the
industrial manufacturing sector will remain depressed for the upcoming
year. Capital spending remained moderately low in 2001 for the
automotive, printing, publishing, and plastics and rubber products
molding industries. Other industries, such as semiconductor
manufacturing and textiles and apparel, experienced depressed market
growth with very minimal capital investment taking place.
	   The automotive sector has been one of the strongest capital
spending sectors over the last several years. America's "Big Three"
producers have spent billions of dollars retooling plants to increase
production of popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs), keeping up with
demand and staying competitive with foreign automakers. One of the
major trends affecting capital spending in the automotive industry is
the continuing effort by foreign automakers to transplant production
operations to the U.S. Billions of dollars have been spent by foreign
owned automakers to construct new plants and build or expand tier
supplier parts manufacturing plants. Even with the slowdown in the
economy, this trend will continue in 2002.
	   Bring up the words "technology" or "high tech" and the general
public frowns over the losses that have been posted by this sector.
Semiconductor manufacturing has not been excluded from these losses.
Over the past several years, this sector had been a large contributor
of capital spending for the industrial manufacturing markets. In 2000,
Intel spent over $6 billion building or expanding wafer fabrication
plants. However, as the market turns down, capital budgets are cut to
make up for the losses being posted by most firms. The worst hit
semiconductor producers are those who manufacture memory devices.
Currently prices are at rock-bottom lows. In 2001, we saw plants
lay-off employees, scale back production, or even close or sell off
manufacturing assets.
	   For 2002, IIR forecasts capital and maintenance spending for the
industrial manufacturing sector to increase slightly from 2001.
Coverage of this industry includes over 30 different sectors,
including: automotive, heavy machinery, electronics, semiconductors,
textiles & apparel, printing and publishing, durable and non durable
product manufacturing. IIR's recently released 2002 Industrial
Outlook, available on CD-ROM, outlines in detail issues and trends,
including capital and maintenance spending, for the Industrial
Manufacturing Industry and other industrial market segments. For more
information on the 2002 Industrial Outlook, trends and upcoming
construction activities in the industrial manufacturing industry as
well as other industrial sectors, send inquiries to
