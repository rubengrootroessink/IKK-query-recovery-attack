Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.

Paul
