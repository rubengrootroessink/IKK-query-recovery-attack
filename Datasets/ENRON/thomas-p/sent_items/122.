Subject:=09NYISO - Weekly Update 6/8/01

Attached FYI is the weekly update prepared by the NYISO. In addition, sever=
al noteworthy actions were taken at Wednesday's Management Committee meetin=
g:
ICAP: Culminating an 18-month effort that I have been chairing, the MC gave=
 final approval to two fundamental changes to NY's ICAP market, that, if ap=
proved by FERC, would go into effect on Nov.1, 2001, with the start of the =
winter capability period. The first changes the nature of determining the p=
roduct to be bought and sold from one based on tests results (ICAP) to one =
that includes, as an element, a unit's forced outage rate (referred to as u=
nforced capacity or UCAP). The design adopted by NY is very similar to the =
accreditation system that has been used in PJM for many years.  It will rew=
ard units that are more available than the average unit in the state, and i=
ncent the below average units to improve their availability. The second maj=
or change adopted moves NY to a monthly procurement requirement for loads. =
The current requirement is six months at a time. The change should facilita=
te customer switching under retail access programs and avoid the experience=
 just witnessed in upstate NY for this summer capability period, where 1400=
 MW of load were deficient and got stuck paying a huge deficiency price for=
 the entire six month period. Under the revised program, load could cover t=
heir positions month by month. This latter change was approved by the MC ov=
er the objections of the PSC and certain utilities, who continued to argue =
that any change to the current ICAP rules may damage NY's reliability.=20
Penalty and Public Disclosure Provisions: In a surprise vote, the PSC-led e=
ffort to get the MC to approve additions to the ISO's Market Mitigation Pla=
n that would add penalty and public disclosure provisions for parties whose=
 bids are mitigated by the ISO was defeated when only 55% voted for the mea=
sure. (A 58% vote is required for passage.) An earlier version of the propo=
sal had been passed by the MC but had been rejected by the ISO Board becaus=
e it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to =
engage in behavior detrimental to the market. The PSC-led effort to respond=
 to the Board's concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the origina=
l version to change their vote this time around. Whether this effort is res=
urrected again (by the PSC/utilities or the Board itself) may hinge on what=
 FERC decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before F=
ERC. The ISO Board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer =
to help it  manage price spikes.
Unbundling of Schedule 1 Charges: Efforts to finalize the unbundling of the=
 ISO's fixed schedule 1 charges (nearly $100 million a year) were sent back=
 to a working group for further work. However, the direction to be taken fo=
r some issues appears clear.=20
TCCs: We succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned=
 to existing TCCs, and that if costs are to be assigned to this market, the=
y should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the TCCs =
compared to the annual auction revenues, rather than on the basis of number=
 of TCCs purchased.
Exports and Wheelthroughs: We succeeded in getting a separate category crea=
ted for these transactions that will result in $/MWH costs that are much le=
ss than what is currently charged. Conversely, there is now likely to be a =
small charge on imports into NY; however, since all generation will be hit =
with this charge, it should be reflected in everyone's bids equally and sim=
ply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price.
The exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a nu=
mber of issues including whether the TOs should be assessed a portion of th=
e ISO's overhead right off the top.
