  Subject: Do you remember this?  Ollie made the headlines in
  1987 and was laughed at by the News Media.

 IT WAS 1987!

 At a lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt.
 Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
 Reagan administration.

 There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree.
 But what he said was stunning!!
 He was being drilled by some senator; "Did you not recently spend close
 to $60,000 for home security system?"

 Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir." The senator continued, trying to get a
 laugh out of the audience," Isn't this just a little excessive?" "No
 sir," continued Ollie.

 "No? And why not?" the senator asked.

 "Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir."

 "Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.

 "'By a terrorist, sir." Ollie answered.

 "Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?"

 "His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

 At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but
 couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A
 couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

 "Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.

 "Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know
 of," Ollie answered.

 "And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator.
 "Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an
 assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
 the earth."

 The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that
 was shown of the clip.

 If anyone is interested, the Senator turned out to be none
 other than Al Gore.
