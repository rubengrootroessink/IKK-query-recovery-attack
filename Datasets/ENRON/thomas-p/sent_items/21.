Paul:

The estimated trans loss charges for August have been entered (NE Hourly # 700778.3 @ ; NE Phys # 700783.3).  They're unusually high due to the increase in deal volumes as well as inflated prices due to extreme heat (08/06 thru 08/10 in particuar).  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to come by and discuss with me or Rebecca.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.
