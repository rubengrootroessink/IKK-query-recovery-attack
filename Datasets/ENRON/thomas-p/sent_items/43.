Kim, we would like to extend a formal offer to Reagan J. Mathews who is currently working for Enron Broadband.  Please forward the formal documentation to Reagan so that the transfer to East Power can take place.

TJ, if you could find out who Reagan's assistant and HR representative are and fax the documentation to the appropriate persons so that he can join our group.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Paul
