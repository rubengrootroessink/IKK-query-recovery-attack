Currently, we have a corporate guarantee of $20MM, however I believe that this number can be reduced to $10MM or less.  NY will should be able to tell them exactly how much credit they will need to post in order to own this portfolio.

What is the collateral requirement for these TCCs?  Edison Mission is inquiring because they would need to post with the NYISO.  Nick
