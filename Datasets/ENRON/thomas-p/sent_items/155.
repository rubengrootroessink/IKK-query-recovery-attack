Dear Quote.com User,									November 2, 2001

As a valued user of Quote.com, we'd like to thank you for choosing us as your
online source for financial information.  We continue to work hard to provide
you with superior products.  At this time, we need to inform you of some upcoming
changes to our services resulting from changes by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
(CME) E-Mini Service.

Many of you have been enjoying the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) real-time
E-Mini data for free.

Effective November 15, 2001, the CME will provide E-Mini real-time data (E-Mini
S&P 500, E-Mini NASDAQ 100 and Fortune e-50 Index futures and options contracts)
at a cost of $10 per user per month (E-Mini real-time data fees are not pro-rated)
and Quote.com must in turn begin to charge our users for this service.
The E-Mini exchange subscription package will be available for registration November
9, 2001. Until this time you will continue to receive this data without interruption.

Sincerely,
Quote.com
A Lycos Finance destination
