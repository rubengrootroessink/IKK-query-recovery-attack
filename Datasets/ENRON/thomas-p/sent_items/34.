Hoon,
I just looked at the Bernhardt website and I didn't see the style we want, but
they had on the catalog at the Noel store.

the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a wage (the middle part) and it comes
w/ 4 pillows
the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the code is 7063-010
                 - on two pillows the code is 7143-032
                 - on two pillows the code is 7132-002

Noel's price - $5228 with delivery included

I would like two or three more pillows, depending  on the additional cost.


Let me know what Louis Shanks and the other place  says about it!

Love
me
