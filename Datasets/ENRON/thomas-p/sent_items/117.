pmorrison@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
  recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
  transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not
prepared to receive the revised Daily Advisory statement.

Change #'s:
SWHE-4WQLHZ; KKIR-4WQLHE; VLEE-4WQQGL; RDEY-4WTLS6; DCUK-4WRGYU

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with
us about these changes.

Thank you,
