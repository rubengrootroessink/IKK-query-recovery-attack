Just as an FYI for you both- you will receive your tuition reimbursement on your 1/31/01 check.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,
Anne

Veronica,

I gave those to Irma just before we left for Christmas.  They did not have your stamp on them, as Ben had not turned them into you yet.  Irma said, however, that they could still be processed.

Jeanie,

We currently do not have tuition for both Paul and Peter.  I did not notice that they are in the Ass/Ana grp.  You might want to check w/ Terry Bosien as her team had this process separate from us at one point.

Paul Thomas and Peter Makkai submitted tuition re-imbursement forms to Kim Melodick prior to bankruptcy approx Nov. 15.  I can not track down the actual paperwork and wanted to make sure that this was being processed.  Please confirm.
