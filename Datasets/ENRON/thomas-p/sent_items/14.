Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.  

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.  We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it off.  

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!! 


Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

Hi Paul:

How have you been?  How is Enron treating you?, well I hope?

Yeah, we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000.  When looking at a map of
our solar system, Lyon is practically in the center of France.  We're more
or less located at the foot of the French Alps.  At about a million people,
Lyon is smaller than Houston.

Because of the Internet Boom, my Internet investments appreciated enough to
buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the
city.  We've been renovating it ever since.  I've learned a hell of a lot
about working on homes!

Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and bought
a house in or near Linkwood (off Stella Link).  I imagine you married that
young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis?  F?licitations!
Have you been to Brazil?  I'd like to see it one day if ever the opportunity
presents itself.  Since you're hitched now, I guess you are obligated to
have children soon. :)

So yes, since the 22nd of September I've been the proud father of a baby
girl -- Camille.  She's a real angel and quite a character too (read
rascal).  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are not
work related because I've attached a photo of her that is as recent as
tonight.  She's got brown eyes like her mommy.

I heard you went to NYC.  How did you like it?  I love NYC and I was just
there one week ago!  No matter how many times I go there I will never run
out of things to do.  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the
Guggenheim.  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that
I've not seen so I know I will return.  Actually, I ponder the idea of
getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little
American culture for six months at a time (NYC is only six hours from
Paris).  Since Camille is American, I think this would be good for her.  Of
course the problem is the price of an apartment.  It's bloody expensive,
mate.  (Stress BLOODY)  I asked one agency and they told me $450,000 for a
studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan (I don't know how accurate this
off-the-cuff quote was).  That's a little too much for me unless I get a
mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money.  Perhaps something
cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood.  You know, the ones with ugly
whores hanging around every small street intersection.  Then there's Harlem,
maybe I can get a pad next to Clinton's.

June 10th, 2000, we got married for a second time.  The marriage was in
France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too.  They
(my mother and aunt) were a little shocked to say the least.  They speak no
French and were like fish out of water (to say the least).  But you didn't
hear this from me.

I've tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this
e-mail covers all the big stuff that's been happening.

Best Regards,
Aaron

Aaron,
How are you doing?  How is France?  I imagine that it has been a great
experience for you to live in another country and get to know another
culture?

Anyways, I just talked your mom and she let me know that you are a
dad!!! Congrats!!

Let me know how are things are going?

Paul
