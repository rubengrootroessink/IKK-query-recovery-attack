Paul,
Thanks for the map.  
One more question: where is it from?
Max

Sorry.. I sent it but the file is too big..

You can find it @ M:/power2/analyst/PJM/NYISO Map.ppt(close to that name)

It should be the only powerpoint file in there.

Hey Paul,
I know you're busy, but can you let me know where to find the map detailing the Northeast transfers limits you included in the presentation you put together for Dana.
I'd like to include it in a presentation I'm putting together for John Llodra.
Thanks,
Max
