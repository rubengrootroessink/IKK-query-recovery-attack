On September 4, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed revisions to amend Attachment F of the NYISO Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff to extend the duration of its currently effective $1,000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO-administered markets; and amend Attachment Q to the NYISO's Open Access Transmission Tariff and Attachment E of the ISO Services Tariff to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities.  

If you need further information please let me know.
