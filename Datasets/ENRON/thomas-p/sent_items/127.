I researched all the errors and they were deal entry problems on the scheduler or trader's side, not program errors.

I think is looks good and can be moved into production.

We will have to watch it closely for a while and the might be some small changes or enhancements, but overall I think it is done.

I will get together with the schedulers and traders sometime today to show them what to do.

Thanks for all your hard work.

Rebecca
