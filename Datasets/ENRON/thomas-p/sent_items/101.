Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by
New York State Regulators

(London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's
leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as
complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long
Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's
formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580-
megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks-
off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.

International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy
facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of
New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the
State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses
all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project,
including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.

"The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long
Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said Peter
Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. "We are planning to
begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and
expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added.

Notes to Editors-

The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of
industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66
and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When
completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million
homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to
the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.

International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric
generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net)
under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,
Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was
created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading
independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock
Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges
is "IPR".
