Yes, Paul Broderick is the administrator for the PJM e-applications.  Ask him and he should be able to get you set up with a username and password.

Paul,

I am looking to get read only access to the PJM eTOOLS, eData web applications.  Do you know what steps I need to take to gain this access?

Thanks,
Jaime
