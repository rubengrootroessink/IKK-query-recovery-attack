Dave,

I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that you can give us the same information that the course would while you are here?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

Paul D. Thomas
