Brain,
I need to you to purchase Oasis for me for Friday, Sat, Sun, and Monday.  I am unable to do it because it must be done the day b4... so tomorrow (Thurs) I will need to buy Fri Oasis.. Friday you will be able to buy Oasis for Sat, Sun and Monday.  The ramp is set and you will need to see what gets accepted on the NY side to make sure the ramp matches the volumes accepted in NY.


--- The PJM ID # is N78958 << this is the PJM schedule where the ramp and Oasis needs to be purchased.
--- The NY ID # is 5039123 << this is NY schedule that is flowing.

--- PJM will ask you if NY IS # 5043451 is flowing? The answer is no.

Give me a call so I can walk you through it the first time
