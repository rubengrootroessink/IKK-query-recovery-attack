Hey Paul, how is it going??  Attached you'll  find some of the pics from the halloween party.  I hope you like  them.  I'm going to Brasil today!!!  Just for 4 days, I guess  it's better than nothing.  Let's do something when I get back.  Our  weekends have been pretty laid back lately.
 
We miss you guys!!! 
 
Um grande abraco,
Eduardo
