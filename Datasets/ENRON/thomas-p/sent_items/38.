I would like to get a quote on the following sofa
It is a Bernhardt brand and the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a wedge (sectional sofa) and I would like 4 pillows
the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the fabric code is 7063-010 ( I believe this fabric is an I grade)
                 - on two of pillows the fabric code is 7143-032
-	on two of pillows the fabric code is 7132-002

I live in Houston Texas.. you can include ballpark shipping costs
Thank you for your help

Paul Thomas
