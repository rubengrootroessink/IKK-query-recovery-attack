I understand there was a problem on my desk this week with a market that was
posted and executed on by one of our traders. I was not in the office and a
decision was made for the trade to stand.

I apologize if there was a lack of professionalism at this end. We do a lot of
business with Enron and  I am interested in keeping a working business
relationship.

Please include me in any discrepancies with our real-time traders and their
accounts: pplhourly(1-8).

A small deal,as I see it you owe us a jab...and I won't be asking for any
favors any time soon.

thanks
