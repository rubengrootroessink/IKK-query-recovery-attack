Paul,

During testing of the NYISO Deal Upload I noticed that there are many hourly deals in Enpower for the same NYISO Transaction ID.

Please tell your guys that if this is going to work there can only be ONE deal in Enpower for EACH NY trans id.

__

The testing is almost complete - as it stands now the upload can be used for NE-PHYS deals (I have updated 6/1-6/18), but until we resolved
The problem mentioned above it can NOT be used for HRLY-NE deals.

There are still some enhancements needed for error/warning processing and reporting and researching.

Thanks,

Rebecca
