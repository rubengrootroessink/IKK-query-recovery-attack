showers ending early in the morning, cloudy into the mid morning timeframe with high pressure sliding in behind the frontal boundary as the day moves on.  Winds will become northerly and northeasterly throughout the day gusty at times as well should clear out late in the afternoon....temps will be fairly low and below normal should be a high of like 72 or so on Saturday

It is supposed to rain on Friday and I have updated our weathermans comments..

I think that Sat is fine.

Love
ME

What are we going to eat?  Cajatero!
