Jiewen and Mark,

I am sure I do not understand the basis for the information but two reports seem to contradict.  

The PJM 180 day forecast predicts 4000MW offline today.
<http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&title=PJM%20Generation%20Outages&url=/Cooper/PJMOutage.asp>

The PJM outage report predicts 1908 MW offline.  
<http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&url=http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/scripts/outage.dll?REGION=MAAC>

Do we have a feel for which of these is more reliable?    
Li, Jiewen; Symms, Mark
Thanks,
David Ingram
