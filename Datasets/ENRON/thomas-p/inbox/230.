Hi Mark and Ted

	I have recently set up a NYISO 5 Min real time load processing application in Cooper 
and developed a front-end application to view these load as hourly average.

	Please help me to check the format and make necessary changes to fit our server's layout as well as suggestions for further improvement. 

	Rika informed me to place the following link "NYISO Load" in the Daily Information Module.

	http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/cooper/ny_rt_load.asp

	Thanks !

	Jason
