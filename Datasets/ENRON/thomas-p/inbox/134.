Paul,

Regarding the phone conversation we had last week, please be aware of the
following:

- I mis-spoke when I stated that a letter will be going out to Enron
containing the details of the total assessment. The letter that did go out
to customers was distributed on the TIE email list and was only a generic
explanation. That email is included below for your information.

- The details that I had promised are included in the attached spreadsheet
file.

I am still trying to find out when you will receive the invoice for this
assessment. When I have that information, I'll pass it on.

I hope the attached information is useful to you.

Thanks,
Dave Evanoski

Dear Market Participants,

In September 2000, the NYISO implemented ECA 20000907A, addressing
Hour-Ahead Market transactions failing check-out.  Attached below is a
letter describing a recent Discretionary Acts Committee decision concerning
assessment of ECA 20000907A financial impacts from September 8, 2000
through October 10, 2000.  The letter will also be posted on the NYISO
website at:

If you have any questions about this issue, please call the Customer
Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.
