 << File: Market Data Toolbox.xls >> 

Rika, I have compiled a short list of items to be put in the Northeast Market Data Toolbox.  I know that we have other items that need to go in the Toolbox to start.  I will continue to send you a file like this one (if ok) for future items that need to be added.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Paul
