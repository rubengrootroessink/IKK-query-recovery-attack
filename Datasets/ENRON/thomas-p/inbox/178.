Lloyd, Stephen, 
 
FriedWire had to revamp our password procedures for the PowerSurge trial as we had some conflicts with the Traffic Report login system.    You should go through the following steps to login to PowerSurge using the test IDs I sent you a couple of days ago.
 
Go to www.friedwire.com 
Click "PowerSurge Login"
Agree to all parts of the End User Agreement and click "Accept" at the bottom
Customize or confirm (at least) your User Name, Password, First/Last Name, E-Mail Address and click "Save" at the bottom
Click "Login".  This will take you back to FriedWire.Com where you then go through the PowerSurge Login with your new info.

 
Let me clarify (if need be) that you all are testing a pre-release version of this product.  As I noted earlier, we are tuning for performance, backfilling historical data, fixing bugs, etc.  This is not the trial of a completed product and we are relying on you all to give us your feedback (positive or negative) so we can know where we stand and make the product as good as it can be.  
 
Call (303) 447-0288 and press my extension 31 or "0" if you need any help.  You can also e-mail us at support@friedwire.com .  Thanks again for your help in testing.
 
Stuart Wright
