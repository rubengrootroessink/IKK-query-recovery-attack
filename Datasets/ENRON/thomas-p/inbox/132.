The Analyst and Associate Program recently began utilizing one central system for our pool information.  We are now in the process of verifying all pool members rotation information for reporting purposes.  Please respond as soon as possible with:

Your rotation end date	   	                              
				       (mm/dd/yy)

Your cost center number	  	                              	


Thank you,
