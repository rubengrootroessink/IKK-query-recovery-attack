Dear Market Participants,

The virtual transaction software was implemented late yesterday afternoon
for bidding into tomorrow's Day-Ahead Market.  While there were some
connectivity problems with submission of virtual bids, those were solved
yesterday evening and several Customers submitted virtual bids for
evaluation.  Security Constrained Unit Commitment ran this morning,
including the virtual transaction bids, and posted around 9:00 a.m.

If you have any questions about virtual transactions, please call your
Customer Account Representative or the Customer Relations Help Desk at
518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
