For anyone that will be in Houston for Thanksgiving weekend, we will be
having our annual game-watching party at my (parent's) house Friday at 11am
to watch Texas kill A&M on the big screen.  We will even have our token
aggie (Sanay) there to heckle...  Come around 10am to pre-party for the
pre-game activities.  The address is 5230 Willowbend, if you need
directions call me on my cell at 512-789-4421.

Hook 'em!

Chris
