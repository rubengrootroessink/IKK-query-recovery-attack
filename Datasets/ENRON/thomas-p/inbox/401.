Rhode Island Plant to Produce Enbrel, in an Advisory by

    Business Editors & Health/Medical Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc; Houston) The
Immunex Corporation (Nasdaq:IMNX)(Seattle) is set to start
construction on a fourth manufacturing plant for their very profitable
arthritis therapy, Enbrel(R). Immunex enjoyed a third quarter 2001 net
income of approximately $40 million, an increase of 26% over the same
period last year. Immunex is working towards ensuring enough
manufacturing capacity to support an anticipated $5 to $6 billion in
Enbrel(R) sales over the next five years.
	   Dubbed the "BioNext Project," the new facility is being engineered
by Kvaerner Process (Bridgewater, N.J.), with Turner Construction
(Dallas) handling construction management. The plant will house one of
the largest bioreactors used in the industry, estimated to be 20,000
liters in capacity. There will also be a centralized utility area
featuring water-for-injection (WFI), clean steam, and other central
utility services.
	   The project is adjacent to an existing facility that is currently
being retrofitted to produce Enbrel(R) in an agreement with
Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals (Saint Davids, Pa.), another division of
American Home Products Corporation (NYSE:AHP) (Madison, N.J.), which
has 41% ownership of Immunex. AHP has agreed to sell Immunex the
facility, which it purchased in 1999 specifically for the production
of Enbrel(R). The new plant is expected to employ 350 people once
construction is complete in 2005.
	   The Immunex Corporation was founded in 1981. The biopharmaceutical
company focuses on immune system science innovations, with Enbrel(R),
their rheumatoid arthritis therapy, adding heavily to their 2000
revenues of $861.8 million and a net income of $154.4 million.
