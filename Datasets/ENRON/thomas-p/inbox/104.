The image is a panoramic view of the world from the new space station.
It is a night photo with the lights clearly indicating the populated
areas.

You can scroll East-West and  North-South.  Note that Canada's
population is almost exclusively  along the U.S. border. Moving east
to Europe, there is a high  population concentration along the
Mediterranean Coast. It's easy to  spot London, Paris, Stockholm
and Vienna. Check out the development  of Israel compared to the
rest of the Arab countries.

Note the Nile River and the rest of the "Dark Continent". After the
Nile, the lights don't come on again until Johannesburg. Look at the
Australian Outback and the Trans-Siberian Rail Route. Moving east, the
most striking observation is the difference between North and South
Korea.

Note the density of Japan.

What a piece of photography. It is an absolutely awesome picture of
the Earth taken from the Boeing built Space Station last November on a
perfect night with no obscuring atmospheric conditions.
