( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Fate of Enron's Forest Products Group Up
in the Air, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston) Energy giant Enron Corporation (NYSE:ENE) (Houston), also the
seventh largest newsprint producer in North America, recently agreed
to be taken over by energy rival Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN)
(Houston). Dynegy has given the forest products group, which falls
under Enron's Wholesale Services business segment, an "under review"
status in determining which businesses are core or non-core. Whether
Dynegy sheds or retains its papermaking assets may not be known before
the summer of 2002, when the transaction is expected to close. The
forest products group consists of a mill on the east coast and two in
eastern Canada, which will require an infusion of capital for
improvements.
	   Last year, Enron Industrial Markets purchased Garden State Paper
from Media General, a communications company, for roughly $72 million.
Located in Garfield, N.J., the mill employs 290 people and has a
capacity of 240,000 short tons a year of newsprint.
	   Earlier this year, Enron acquired Daishowa Forest Products Limited
to gain ownership of its newsprint mill and related assets in Quebec
City, Quebec. The former Daishowa Forest mill, now called Papiers
Stadacona is integrated with a Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (TMP) mill that
feeds four paper machines and employs over 1,000 employees. The mill
has studied the addition of a new de-inking plant, a bio-mass boiler,
and modernizations to the four paper machines.
	   NLK Consultants and Enron share ownership in the Papier Masson
mill in Masson-Angers, Quebec. The single machine mill employs over
300 workers and produces approximately 600 metric tons a day of
recycled content newsprint.
	   Upon completion of the merger, the new Dynegy is expected to have
revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 billion in assets.
	   Dynegy is one of the world's premier energy merchants. Through its
global energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk
management capabilities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to
customers in North America and the United Kingdom and Continental
Europe.
