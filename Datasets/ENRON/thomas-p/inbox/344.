Subject: FW: Move Related Issues





As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend. =20

?       Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear a=
ll new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, g=
reetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cut=
over the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed=
 when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon=
 your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on. =20

?       Building access - ECS will not be available for general access unti=
l Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined=
, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come =
in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those=
 who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose name=
s have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Su=
nday.

o       Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees=20

?       Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with t=
he routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be s=
ure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you=
 need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes high=
lighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to =
have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access wi=
thout their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage =
via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back th=
rough the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round=
 kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed bac=
k to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?       Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following =
is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will=
 be on the floor when we move in. =20

o       Red - Move Team=20
o       Orange - Desktop Support/IT=20
o       Green - Telephony=20

?       Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper s=
ubscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have =
all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floo=
r corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick=
 up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick =
up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor o=
f ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?       Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more=
 than about 4  boxes per person. =20

?       Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any l=
abels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing label=
s printed.

?       Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been =
removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks=
 are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order=
 to move the computers as scheduled.

.       Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispense=
s filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowe=
d on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottle=
s of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered wa=
ter at several locations. =20

?       Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted=
 to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a tu=
rret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will b=
e waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might=
 have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much =
for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRID=
AY, 11/16/01.=20

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with=
 the move.=20

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd=20
