Juan,

Thanks for your contact information.

Virtual bidding is separate from bidding and scheduling physical energy.
Your virtual bid is not required to be tied to a generator or physical
transaction. The limit to your virtual bid is the amount of credit
established for the purpose of virtual bids.

Additionally, I would like to arrange some time to come and visit you in
Houston. We are hoping for 2 or 3 hours on Monday, Oct 22. I'll be making
the trip with Frank Francis, who is the NYISO customer rep for Enron Power
Marketing. We have already contacted Paul Thomas at Power Marketing, who
may be contacting you about this trip. Perhaps it will be practical to meet
with both Energy Service and Power Marketing at the same. Frank and I will
plan to have the entire day available to meet with you and Power Marketing.
If you prefer to conduct the meetings separately that is also perfectly
acceptable to us.

Thanks,
Dave Evanoski

Dave,

one more question I forgot to throw at you during our conversation......
is "Virtual Bidding" going to take the place of the bidding (or
scheduling) process in place today.... or is it going to be a second
mean of bidding...?

I appreciate your help.  Look forward to working with you.

Juan
