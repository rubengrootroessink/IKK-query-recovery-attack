Dear NYISO Customer:

The version mapping that was posted to the web on 06/08/2001 was created
from a customer file that joined
the NYISO on April 11, 2000.  This resulted in the mapping not being valid
for any customers that were already
qualified for the entire month of April.

For all customers that were qualified customers for the entire month of
April 2000, the following mapping applies:

Date Current             Previous
1    V-7       minus          V-4
2    V-7       minus          V-4
