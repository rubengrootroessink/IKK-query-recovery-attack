All right people, time to quit screwing around and to start planning a
little weekend trip up here to Tahoe!  I'm thinking either the 1st or 3rd
weekend of March...  I have a friend who's a travel agent and can most
likely get everyone a good deal given enough advance notice.  Let me know
sometime this week if you're serious about going and what weekend you vote
for and I'll get some prices together...

Peace,
Chris

CHRIS, VERY IMPOERTANT!
Disregard dates re last e-mail.  The three of us
cannot go on those dates, look at the next weekend,
the 15th, 16th and 17th.  Let me know what up!
Aloha, Sean
