AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

We'll be running the third training session on Virtual Bidding on Friday,
November 30. This course is valuable to everyone involved in our energy
markets -- not just to those bidding "virtually". We fully booked our
previous two sessions, and this will probably be our last VB program this
year. Therefore, if you haven't attended so far, we suggest you give this
serious consideration.

The program covers:
     NYISO Bidding Fundamentals - an optional overview of the NYISO
marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Virtual Transaction bid entry & billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions


We start the program with an optional 75-minute Introduction to the NYISO
and LBMP. This opener provides some basics on power systems and how we
operate the New York electric marketplace. If you're new to the electric
business, or at least to New York's market, we think you'll find it very
useful.

On the other hand, if you're familiar with our operation (other than
virtual bidding), you probably don't need the introductory. It's an option
intended to help newcomers get up to speed for the rest of the program,
which focuses on Virtual Bidding topics.

Our registration desk will open at 8:00am and remain open all morning.
The introductory starts at 8:30 am.
If you don't want the introductory, just show up for the Virtual Bid
portions, which will starts at 10:00 am.

The program will be conducted at the Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road,
Albany, New York.
Register for the seminar through our web site at:

Details are included there.

Hope you can make it on the 30th to discuss this exciting new aspect of the
two settlement system.
