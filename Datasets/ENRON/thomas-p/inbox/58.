    [IMAGE]    Are you a genius?     Imagine having an IQ that's off the  c=
harts -- a real superbrain! You wouldn't have to worry about grades because=
 you'd ace every course.  As a matter of fact, you'd probably be teaching c=
lasses instead of attending them. But how would you  fit in at school or wi=
th your friends? Oftentimes, people with exceptional intelligence struggle =
to  be accepted and understood because of their nontraditional thinking. No=
bel Prize winner, John Nash,  whose life is portrayed in the movie "A Beaut=
iful Mind," is a good example of how challenging the  life of a genius can =
be.  Here at Questia,  we decided to take a look in our collection to under=
