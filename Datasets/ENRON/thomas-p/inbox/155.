Stephanie,

I am going to be joining the Northeast Power Group trading the Northeast Hourly Night book.  I've requested a copy of Enron Online through E-request and need a user ID and password.  Brian from the helpdesk said that you would be able to set me up with this.  I appreciate your help.

Regards,
Brian Terp
