PJM West is scheduled to go into operation January 1, 2002 (there is some talk that the IT vendors are somewhat behind schedule do to the priority of getting NYC back in operation and that this may delay the startup - I will keep you posted).  On Day 1 of operation, PJM West will be the Allegheny control area only.  Work is progressing on Duquesne and the earliest date I have heard for integration of Duquesne into PJM West is sometime in the 1st quarter of 2002.  PJM West and PJM proper will be integrated such that there is one energy market (day-ahead and real-time) across the entire region, based on LMP, and no pancaking of transmission rates (pay the rate of the transmission system at point of withdrawal just as is done in PJM today).  However, there will be two different capacity markets - ICAP in PJM and ACAP in PJM West - to reflect the difference in reliability standards of the two NERC regions.

PJM has recently announced PJM West market trials for the Day-Ahead market on Nov 21 and Nov 28.  Real-time energy market trials are scheduled to be conducted starting on Nov 26 and continuing through Dec 31.  For additional information regarding the market trial see the enclosed notice from PJM.

Tom, could you do a paragraph up that describes PJM West (i.e operation, LMP, players, key dates, tx instruments etc) for Robert Benson and copy it to Kevin (they only want a paragraph at most).  They are especially interested in whether PJM West intend to price aggregate nodes to create hubs on start date.  Theres no point in me acting as intermediary....

cheers
