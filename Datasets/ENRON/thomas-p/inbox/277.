( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Startup Mining Company Hopes to Expand
Only U.S. Fluorspar Mine, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Located close to Cedar City, Utah, a start-up mining
venture hopes to expand the only fluorspar mine in the U.S. According
to company's President, John Price, "Milford Mining Company LLC is the
only miner of fluorspar in the U.S." Price went on to say, "We've
started of on a small scale, but our market shows promise and if all
goes well, we may look at expanding in the future."
	   According to data collected by the USGS, the U.S. consumes
approximately 523,000 metric tons of fluorspar annually. All of this
is imported from foreign sources, 67% from China, 22% from South
Africa, and 11% from Mexico. The majority of this, about 90%, is acid
grade fluorspar used in the production of hydrofluoric acid and
aluminum fluoride.
	   Milford Mining produces metallurgical grade fluorspar and also
kaolinite and silica. It is studying options for the sale of these
minerals to new markets. Currently, it sells fluorspar to west coast
cement plants, where it is used as a fluxing agent in rotary kilns.
Fluorspar helps to reduce the melting temperature of clinker (an
intermediate product of the cement manufacturing process produced in
rotary kilns), enabling cement producers to increase throughput
without significant equipment additions. Future plans include adding
increased crushing, screening, and processing equipment to enable the
company to expand service to the cement industry, as well as other
metallurgical grade fluorspar users such as the steel or aluminum
industries and possibly acid grade fluorspar users at some point in
the future.
