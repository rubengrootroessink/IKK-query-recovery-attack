Lloyd, these are the IDs that are enabled for Traffic Report and PowerSurge access.  Feel free to pass them out as needed.  If anyone wants to really check these systems out thoroughly (particularly PowerSurge), I would highly recommend a 30-40 minute remote tutorial with either Barbara O'Neill or Mike McNair, the two primary developers of the PowerSurge product.  
Thanks - Stuart Wright
