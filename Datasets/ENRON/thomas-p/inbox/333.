At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved=
 that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges. The first involves t=
he assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry =
costs. As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way=
 its electric program costs are assessed to market participants. Under the =
new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providi=
ng transmission service, including ISOs. NYISO estimates an annual assessme=
nt of $4-6 million. These fees will start to be recovered through the rate =
Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002. This should equate to roughly =
$0.03 per MWH. The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the p=
roposed 2002 budget for the NYISO. Total costs will be increasing roughly $=
12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (cu=
rrently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of =
the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board. Offsetting=
 these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been=
 collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund=
. The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the cu=
rrent year.
