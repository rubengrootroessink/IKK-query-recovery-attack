Actually I have raised issues related to the PARs several times. There is
currently an item on the MSWG agenda concerning them though not concerning
control (ISO vs ConEd) but rather modeling and pricing.

Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out
that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in
direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I,
would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing
Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we
are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to
die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.
