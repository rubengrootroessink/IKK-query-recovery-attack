Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are
rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these
outages.

In addition to the excel document, there is a dbf file that is formatted
like the
daily delivery you receive nightly. This will enable you to
load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me
know. Thanks.
