would like to invite you to:

THE 2001 HALLOWEEN MONSTER BASH

Houston's definitive, all-out Halloween party:

	Friday, October 26
	8:00 pm
	Garden in the Heights

We are proud to announce the return of the Halloween Monster Bash on Friday,
October 26 at Garden in the Heights.  You may remember this party from 1998;
it was a smash success then and will be at least as much fun this year.
We've got an awesome DJ, and tickets include light food and all the drinks
you can handle.

Door prizes including gift certificates from Houston's finest restaurants
will be awarded for best costumes.

The tickets are essentially at a break-even price, but if there is any money
left over, it will go to Rice's scholarship/fellowship fund, so Rice can
continue to attract even smarter, harder-working students than they've
already got.

DETAILS
Date:  Friday, October 26
Time:  8:00 PM til midnight or so
Place:  Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan
	(if you need directions, please call (713) 880-1065)

TICKETS
Tickets:  $25 with costume or $30 without.
How to get tickets:  Call the Rice Alumni Office at (713) 348-4057 for
advance tickets, or buy them at the door.

SPONSORSHIPS
Group and corporate sponsorships are available.  Enron, The Princeton
Review, and the law firm of Hirsch & Westheimer have already signed on as
sponsors.

This party is not exclusive in any way - all of Houston is invited (everyone
over 21, that is).  So please invite your friends and encourage them to
come.

You may get other emails about this as well, as we try our hardest to get
the word out.  I hope to see you there!
