Hey guys,

I've started a contact list (for networking purposes), so that we can stay in touch.

If you would like to add your name, just modify the file, highlight your changes in red, and send the file back to me.

Forward the file to anyone else who might be interested.

I'll merge all the names, and send the file to everyone.

Thanks,

Diana Allen
