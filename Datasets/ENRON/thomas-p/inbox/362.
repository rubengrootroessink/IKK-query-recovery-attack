FriedWire has just placed a number of enhancements into the new PowerSurge System, which is now fully released and available to be licensed:
 
NEW 
}         Search tools - as opposed to pull-down menu filtering
}         Front Page "Pop-out" components (Click-on "Pop" to cut that chart/map out and place it in a dedicated window on your desktop and have it update 'live' all day long even though you might close PowerSurge entirely)
}         On screen pop-ups for event notification (i.e. price change alerts -you still get the e-mail or page but also an on-screen alert)
 
COMING -  Within the next  couple of weeks we're adding:
}         Frequency disruption notification so you can get e-mail or a text-page when there's a frequency dip in the east
}         Customizable scales on your price and spread charts
}         Small, medium and large sized graphs that pop-out and fit your available screen real-estate
}         Pop-outs for all price and flow maps
 
Incentive pricing on PowerSurge is available for November.  Contact us for details.
