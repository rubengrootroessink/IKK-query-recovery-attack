November 2001

Dear Friends & Family,

Happy Thanksgiving!  We hope that all of you are able to spend quality time
with your loved ones over the long holiday weekend.

Sophie and I would like to inform you that we have recently moved to New
Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA), as of Labor Day weekend.  As many of you know,
our recent transition is a result of Sophie's admission into the Tulane
School of Medicine.  She is currently pursuing her life-long dream of
becoming a doctor and we are both very excited for this opportunity.

NOLA is a familiar environment for both of us; it's where we met nearly
four years ago.  We are still maintaining a partial residence in Houston
and try to visit family & friends at least once a month.  I am still based
out of the Accenture Houston Office and currently work on a project in
Atlanta during the week.  Although we will be a little further away from
all of you, we very much look forward to your visits.  And we're especially
happy to announce that we'll be able to entertain you in our new loft
(unless, of course, Med School exams are going on).

Please feel free to update the following contact information and take note
of the upcoming events that will be taking place in New Orleans...
