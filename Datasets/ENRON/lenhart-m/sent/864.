i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over 
charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i 
was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at 
this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday 
either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like 
on my birthday when we just slammed everything as fast as we could.
