nice email.  anyway, congratulations on your recent engagement.  max saved 
you from becoming a major cougar like your buddy stacey.  just kidding.  i 
was really happy for both of you.  as far a my responsibilities as the best 
man, i need to make sure that we send max out of the single life in style.  
don't worry, there will not be anything crazy going on with hired 
entertainment or anything.  how is work going for you?  must be going well 
since you and max just bought a big house.  i will be in town on dec 22nd so 
be ready to go out.
