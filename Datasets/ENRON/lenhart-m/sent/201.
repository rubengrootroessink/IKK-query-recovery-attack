hey-  chevys are nice, that is what i drive.  so tom came up to north dakota 
to steal your car and didn't even buy you guys dinner?  that kid has no 
class.  things are going well here.  i have been seeing some girl for awhile 
now.  other than that nothing is new.  enron is getting all its employees new 
computers so let me know what billie wants to do with the laptop that you 
guys gave me.  if you guys want it i can send it up, if not i will keep it 
still.  it is a very good cpu.  i think you guys should buy a new lincoln 
ls.  they are very nice cars and i don't think that they are too expensive.  
has grandma set a date for our vacation this summer?  any time is really ok.  
give me a call when you get a chance.  i will be home all weekend.

love matt
