Here's an update on the Fall league. Once you have a list of people
(hotties) who want to play, sent it to me and I'll make sure our team is
stacked.

Pass this on the Brian Hull.

I hope everyone enjoyed themselves this past season!!
As for me, despite the mood I was in during our loss Tuesday, I did
actually have fun!  Sorry for being such a d---head!!

Anyway, on to more positive stuff.... I have decided to put myself through
this one more time (no Winter league for me!), but I need your help.
Please let me know the following...

     - if you are interested in playing full-time in the Tuesday night Fall
coed league that will begin Oct. 3rd
or
     - if you are only interested in being a sub

Remember, the cost of the team is fixed and each person's share is
determined by the number of people paying, so please only commit if you
will be coming out to play (and pay).

Please reply by next WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27th.  I will not assume that you
want to play unless you send me a confirmation email.

Thanks,
Roy
