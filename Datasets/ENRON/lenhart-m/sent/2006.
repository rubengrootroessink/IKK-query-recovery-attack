what is going on?  i figured that you wouldn't be coming to houston due to 
the weather on saturday.  just let me know if you want to come in and we can 
hit the town.  i won't be in houston over thanksgiving or the following 
weekend.  actually, the following weekend i will be in new orleans.  my 
brother is coming in town and we are staying at my family's place in the 
quarter.  talk to you soon.
