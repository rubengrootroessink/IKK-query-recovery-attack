enron's stock has been getting punished.  a lot of my stock options are 
worthless.  it is so dark here right now.  it is going to pour.  i think i am 
going to head to denver for a week in may.  i am not sure which week, but i 
think that would be a good time to go home.  tell martha and billie hello and 
i will try to call you guys this week.
