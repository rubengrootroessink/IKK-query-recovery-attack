Little Johnny In School
>>>
>>>A teacher asks her class, "If there are 5 birds sitting on a fence and
>>>you
>>>shoot one of them, how many will be* left?" She calls on little Johnny.
>>>He
>>>replies, "None, they will all fly away with the first gun shot" The
>>>teacher
>>>replies "The correct answer is 4, but I like your thinking," Then little
>>>Johnny says "I have a question for YOU. There are three women sitting on
>>>a
>>>bench having ice cream: One is delicately licking the* cream. The second
>>>is
>>>gobbling down the top and sucking the cone.* The third is biting off
>>>the top of the ice cream. Which one is married?" The teacher, blushing a
>>>great deal, replied "Well I suppose the one that's gobbled down the top
>>>and
>>>sucked the cone" To which Little Johnny replied, "The correct answer is
>>>the
>>>one with the wedding ring on,...but I like your thinking.
>>>
>>>Math Class
>>>
>>>Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic.
>>>Why?"
>>>asks the father. The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3' I said "6" But
>>>that's
>>>right!" Then she asked me 'How much is 3x2?' "What's the fucking
>>>difference?"
>>>asks the father. That's what I said!"
>>>
>>>English
>>>
>>>Little Johnny goes to school, and the teacher says, "Today we are going
>>>to
>>>learn multi-syllable words, class.* Does anybody have an example of a
>>>multi-syllable word?"* Little Johnny says "Mas-tur-bate"* Miss Rogers
>>>smiles
>>>and says, "Wow, little Johnny, that's a mouthful." Little Johnny says,
>>>"No,
>>>Miss Rogers, you're thinking of a blowjob."
>>>
>>>Grammar
>>>
>>>Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed
>>>to
>>>go to the bathroom.* He yelled out, "Miss Jones, I need to take a
>>>piss!!" The
>>>teacher replied, "Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in
>>>this
>>>situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please
>>>use the word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to
>>>go."
>>>Little Johnny, thinks for a bit, then says, "Yu're an eight, but if you
>>>had
>>>bigger tits, you'd be a TEN!!!"
>>>
>>>Beautiful
>>>
>>>One day, during lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show
>>>of
>>>hands from those who could use the word "beautiful" in the same sentence
>>>twice. First, she called on little Suzie, who responded with, "My father
>>>bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it."
>>>Very good, Suzie," replied the teacher. She then called on little
>>>Michael.
>>>"My mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully," he
>>>said. "Excellent, Michael!" >Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.
>>>"Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was
>>>pregnant, and he said,** 'Beautiful,.....just fucking beautiful!
>>>
