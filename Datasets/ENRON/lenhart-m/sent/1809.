double or nothing means  if  i win you pay me 100  and if i lose we are 
flat.  do you remember you lost $50 to me on jan 1?  your math is bad.  our 
bet isn't if i win you owe me $100 and if you win i owe you $100.  that 
doesn't make sense.    you need to stop sniffing the glue.  how is the house 
hunting going?  so are you and max going 50/50?  i haven't met all cougars.  
i met a little hottie who is an education major.  she is still in school.  i 
am going young so when i get married i wont have to turn her in as early.  
cougars don't have a long marriage expectancy if you marry someone who wants 
to trade you in when you are really old for a younger model.  geaux tigers.
