nothing going on here.  i went to new orleans this weekend for a bachelor 
party.  i am still dead.  so phoenix was nice?  i had a massage in cayman and 
i thought it was the best thing.  i couldn't figure out why a spa would be a 
good vacation until i had my massage.  give me a call when you get a chance.  
i will be home tonight.
