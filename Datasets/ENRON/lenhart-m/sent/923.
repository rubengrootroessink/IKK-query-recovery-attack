i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th 
at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  
i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf 
swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for 
picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.
