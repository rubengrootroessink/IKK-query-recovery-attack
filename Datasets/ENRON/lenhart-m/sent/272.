oh yeah- i forgot we covered that the other night.  there is no question 
about your birthday and the superbowl unless denver plays.  i went to a 
buddy's house to watch the game and left at halftime b/c i had no interest in 
the game.  your favorite band was on at halftime.  i know you were excited 
about that.  so why don't you come over this week and watch 9 1/2 weeks.
