i have heard the rodeo opens at 6:45 for rodeo activities, but the concert 
won't start until about 8:30.  someone up here went to duran duran last night 
and it said the same thing on the schedule.  i will call tomorrow and double 
check, but i really don't think they would start a concert that late, def 
leppard isn't that old.
