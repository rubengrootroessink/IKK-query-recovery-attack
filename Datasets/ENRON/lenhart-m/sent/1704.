Subject: DUMP AT WORK

> >> ESCAPEE
> >> Definition: A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or

> >>
> >> COURTESY FLUSH
> >> Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone

> >>
> >> WALK OF SHAME
> >> Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you
> >> have
> >> just stunk-up the bathroom.  This can be a very uncomfortable moment
> >> if
> >> someone walks in.  As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the

> >> OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER
> >> Definition: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it.
> >> You will

> >> THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)
> >> Definition:  A group of coworkers who band together to ensure

> >>
> >> SAFE HAVEN
> >> Definition:  A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where
> >> you can
> >> least expect visitors.  Try floors that are predominantly of the

> >>
> >> TURD BURGLAR
> >> Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall
> >> and
> >> tries to force the door open.  This is one of the most shocking and

> >>
> >> CAMO-COUGH
> >> Definition: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the
> >> bathroom
> >> that you are in a stall.  This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or
> >> to
> >> alert potential TURD BURGLARS.  Very effective when used in

> >>
> >> ASTAIRE
> >> Definition:  A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD
> >> BURGLARS
> >> that you are occupying a stall.  This will remove all doubt that the
> >> stall
> >> is occupied.  If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the bathroom immediately
> >> so the
> >> pooper can poop in peace.
> >>
> >> WATERMELON
> >> Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet
> >> water.
> >> This is also an embarrassing incident.  If you feel a WATERMELON
> >> coming on,
> >> create a diversion.  See CAMO-COUGH.
> >>
> >> HAVANA OMELET
> >> Definition:  A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes
> >> in
> >> the toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee.  Try using a
> >> CAMO-COUGH
> >> with an ASTAIRE.
> >>
> >> UNCLE TED
> >> Definition:  A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever.
> >> Could
> >> spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on
> >> the pot.
> >> An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you
> >> should
> >> always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This
> >> benefits you
> >> as well as the other bathroom attendees.
> >>
> >> FLY BY
> >> Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk
> >> in,
> >> check for other poopers.  If there are others in the bathroom, leave
> >> and
> >> come back again.  Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People

> >>
> >> CRACK WHORE
