there is an offer to join a golf club called the houston oaks for $145/mo.  
there are 36 holes.  i heard it is a good couse.  it is up near 290 and hwy 
6.  the only thing you pay for is a cart.  sounds like a good deal.  i heard 
it is a nice course.  i am thinking of getting in if anyone else is 
interested.  let me know today what you think.
