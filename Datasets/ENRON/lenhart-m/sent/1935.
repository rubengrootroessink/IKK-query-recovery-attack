i can't get down there by the end of the year.  so you are finally going to 
get a job?  that is good.  why cant your state get all their votes in?  if 
they don't vote for bush i am going to be so pissed.  sounds like max and jen 
bought a big house.  we might need to make a bet on the lsu-flor game in the
