there is more than enough room.  there is parking just in the street 
somewhere.  you might be able to get rock star parking in the front of the 
place.  if not, just find some place out on the street.  no camo or bright 
orange and dont make duck calls all night.  i will be there at 6pm.  should 
be a good weekend.  see you soon.
