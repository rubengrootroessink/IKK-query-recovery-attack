okay i will answer your questions.  i made more money the first time you 
stayed over than i lost the second time you stayed over so i am net up.  here 
is a simple equation to explain:   2x -1x = x.    x is still positive.    i 
watched the show and i can't believe that i am that in to it.  so what are 
your rumors?  you have to tell now.
