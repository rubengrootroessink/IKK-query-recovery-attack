mom said you weren't feeling well.  i just wanted to send you an email to see 
how you are doing.  i hope you feel better.  hopefully you will be able to 
make it to denver.  this should make you feel better, i am still terrible at 
golf.  i shot a 100 the other day, so i think you can still take me.  i will 
be in vegas this weekend for a bachelor party but i will try to call next 
week.
