how can you call those nerds beautiful.  the guy with the beard and the one 
with the dreadlocks are eye sores.  and those litte mos aren't more rugged 
than me.  i could kick all their asses.  anyway, why don't you come over 
between 7 and 8.  that will give me time to work out for the 8th time of the 
day tomorrow.
