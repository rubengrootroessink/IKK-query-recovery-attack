Big Unit's fastball kills  dove
During the seventh inning of the Diamondbacks'  split-squad 10-6 victory 
against the Giants on Saturday, Randy Johnson hit  and killed a dove flying 
in front of home plate with a fastball. Johnson's  pitch to the Giants' 
Calvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home  plate when it 
struck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked  up the dead bird 
with his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson  before taking it to 
the dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. "I  didn't think it was 
all that funny," he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield 
killed a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The  Ontario police charged 
him with animal cruelty, although the charge was later  dropped.
