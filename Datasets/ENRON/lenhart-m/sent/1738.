it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well.  anyway, men get 
distinguished as they age.  i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep 
my hair.  i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed.  that is 
the best time to be at that place.  i do feel better at work today.  i found 
out i get to go to monterey, cali in two weeks for a boondoggle.  it is all 
paid for and all i will do is booze and golf.  i look foward shit like that 
now.    you should be going out every night while you can.  one day you will 
hit the real world and you can't do that.  lsu is not the real world.  you 
can still party a lot while you work, you just have to be in pain at work and 
pretend like you are not hung over so they don't think you have a problem.  i 
usually go out 2-3 nights a week.  i try to live like a rock star (like 
britney spears).  email me back when you get a chance.
