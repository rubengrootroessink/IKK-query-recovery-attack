what does mmmcchhhaaa mean?  is that the scary sound from friday the 13th?  
things have been good.  just been working a lot and living it up a little.  
that is great that you started teaching 4th grade.  i watched florida play 
last week.  they got lucky.  we will have to make a bet on the lsu-flor 
game.  i will take the points of course.  i will let you think of the bet 
since you are into that stuff.  i went out with jen & max in denver.  i guess 
they are back together.  what is a good smaller town in florida to live in.  
one with golf courses right on the ocean.
