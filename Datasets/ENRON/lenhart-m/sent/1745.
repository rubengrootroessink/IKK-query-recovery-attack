you must be a hoodoo for the tigers.  i went in for the tenn game.  it was 
awesome.  you dont realize how good we had it at school until you leave.  
check out md anderson.  it is the top cancer research hospital in the 
country.  how is everything going there?  i talked to our babe kelsey walker 
a couple of weeks ago.  she was in houston for a bachelorette party.  she is 
still hot.   i also saw  brooke and emily last weekend.  brooke looked good.  
i am planning on going to jacques wedding.  when is it?  what lsu games are 
you going back in for?  i am definately hitting the bama game and possibly 
miss st.   talk to you later.
