		Broncos Topper
		 McGlockton defends himself
		
		
		brn0507csm
		McGlockton (J. Leyba)
		 Weighing in at 352 pounds, Chester McGlockton is the heaviest starting 
defensive lineman in Denver Broncos history. He also has become a mighty big 
target. 
		
		Last month, former San Diego Chargers director of player personnel Billy 
Devaney, working for ESPN as an NFL draft analyst, applauded each of the 
Broncos' offseason moves - except one. Devaney blasted the Broncos for 
signing McGlockton, whom he candidly accused of being a negative locker room 
influence. About which McGlockton shrugs.

		 The Denver Post's Broncos writer takes your questions each week and responds 
to the pick of the litter in "Adam Schefter's Broncos Mailbag," which is 
posted each Thursday. Check out this week's installment as Adam tackles 
questions ranging from the silly to the scintillating, including several 
about training camp.

		Jackson (AP)
		 He misses family members, friends, food and the fun. Yet these days, 
Barcelona Dragons quarterback Jarious Jackson - on loan from the Denver 
Broncos - misses out on nothing. 
		
		Jackson's Barcelona, Spain, hotel is positioned along a topless beach. He 
swims in Europe's history and traditions. He travels as if he were a college 
backpacker, visiting Berlin last month, Dusseldorf, Germany, last weekend, 
with plans that still include Amsterdam and Scotland.

Donnie -

Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -
Val

Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.


Donnie
