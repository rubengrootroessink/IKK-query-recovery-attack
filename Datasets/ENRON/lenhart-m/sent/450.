hey annie!   good to hear from you.  how is everything going?  do you have a 
valentine?  i have one.  it is a girl i have been seen for a few months.  you 
are so lucky you get to go skiing.  i wish i could hit the slopes.  i haven't 
skiied in over a year.  you do need a rich guy to support you in san fran.  
it is so expensive there.  you could just go anna nicole and get some guy who 
is almost dead and inherit all his cash.  you're not that type of girl though 
which is good.  who else lives up there.  i thought erin and her sister lived 
there also.  i can't remember.  keep in touch and stay warm there.  

matt
