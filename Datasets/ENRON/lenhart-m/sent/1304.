looks like i might be coming to denver for a couple of days the first or 
second week of august.  i don't know how much time i will have but i will let 
you know the plans next week.  there is some kind of gas convention called 
coga held up there.  i think i will be golfing and meeting with people some 
of the time.  i should have some time though and we can get together.  i will 
let you know.
