i sold the jeep monday to some kid going to a&m next fall.  i bought a chevy 
tahoe.  it is great.  i pick it up today. it is midnight blue with a tan 
stripe at the bottom.  i got an incredible deal on it.  it is a 1998 and i 
was looking at 96's that were selling for more.  it is probably a little too 
nice for me, but what the hell.
