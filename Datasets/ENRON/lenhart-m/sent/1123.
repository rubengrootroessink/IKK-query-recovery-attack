> Did you hear about the long delays on a golf course
> outside Washington, DC?
>
> Seems like there was a foursome playing that was taking forever to
> get around the course. The group consisted of Monica
> Lewinski, OJ Simpson, Ted Kennedy, and Bill Clinton.
>
> According to observers, the problems they were having were
> attributable to typical problems faced by the novice golfer; Monica
> is a hooker, OJ is a slicer, Kennedy can't drive over water, and
> Clinton is never sure which hole he's supposed to be playing.
