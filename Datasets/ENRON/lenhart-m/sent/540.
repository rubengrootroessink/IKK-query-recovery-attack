i got a room for sept.6th - sept. 9th.  it is the rainman suite at the 
mirage.  there are 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a huge living room.  with the 
room we get limo service to and from the hotel.  if there are 7 of us paying 
it will cost roughly $225 for each of us.  that is pretty cheap.  this way we 
don't need to get another room.  i also reseved a room at the luxor that can 
sleep 4 and a suite with 1 bedroom and a living room.  this will cost us $200 
per night.  tell me which one you prefer.  we also neet to make sure everyone 
goes b/c if someone drops out it will cost us a lot more.  merlin, the suite 
at the mirage wasn't available for the 13th-16th.  get back to me soon.  you 
can email me back or call me at 713-807-1699.
