how could you vote for gore?  especially if you want to become a teacher.  i 
am not scared to go to florida, i just haven't done it.  lsu might play 
florida in the sec championship which would be in dec.  we wont know that for 
two more weeks.  how else is everything going?  i am just keeping busy with 
work and partying.  get back to me when you get a chance.
