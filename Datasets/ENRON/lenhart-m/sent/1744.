i don't listen to nsync.  i like color me bad more.  they are more my speed.  
they have a more mature sound.  you don't know what a boondoggle is?  a 
boondoggle is where another company takes you on trip to discuss business 
over golf and booze.  they pay for it all and it is usually fairly 
extravagant.  they make this job worth it.  i am having a shitty day.  i am 
losing a shit load of money.  do you go out every night or something?  you 
are living the wild life.  what are you taking the gre for?  what the fuck is 
the gre for anyway?  is that the grad school test?  what is your major?  i 
can't remember what you told me.  speech something?  where are you going to 
grad school? lsu?  talk to you later.
