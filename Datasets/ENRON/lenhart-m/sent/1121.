that is the saddest story i ever heard.  my security guard girlfriend work at 
night as a tow truck lady and she probably got pissed when she saw me hanging 
out with you guys and towed your car.  actually i don't think the game is 
going to play until 8:30.  here are your tasks for next week while i am out 
of town:  
 1. plan your party
 2. get music
 3. get food
 4. get booze 
 5. invite some people
 6.  let me know what i owe you

sounds good.  if the game comes on at 6 and we go to two rows i will let you 
know.  is your old ass boyfriend coming to the party?
