it is such a sleazy show though.  and it is cheesy.  i am not cheesy, but i 
do enjoy it.   i thought you had some good rumors.  the equation was 
helpful?  sometimes it is easier to understand if you see the numbers.  come 
over tonight around 730ish or after friends since you don't want to miss that
