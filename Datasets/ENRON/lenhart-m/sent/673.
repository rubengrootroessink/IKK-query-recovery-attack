 We need your help. Please read the following:

   Unfortunately, it has become all to frequent that a man will father a
  child and then run off.  Often times without paying any child support.
  The girl in this picture will face many challenges because she has no
  father in her life.  If you know who her father might be, please contact
  the  police immediately.
