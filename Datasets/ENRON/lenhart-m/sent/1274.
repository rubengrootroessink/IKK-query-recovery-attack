i bought a ride on friday.  it is a pretty cool car - kind of retro.  i 
bought a gremlin, like the one in wayne's world.  some people laugh at it, 
but i think it is pretty cool.  it is also affordable.  tell angie she can't 
get into a fist fight.  i don't want to be embarassed if we all go out.  you 
guys can't throw your central gang signs or whatever you guys do before you 
represent.
