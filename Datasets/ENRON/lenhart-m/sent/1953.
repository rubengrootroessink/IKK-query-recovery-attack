Hey, man, I just forward the things.
I don't write 'em.

They pay me to wave the flag along the highway, not screw with email.
By the way, shouldn't you guys be passing gas or power or whatever it is you
guys pass?

I'm not sure I ever sent you this, but its from my honeymoon...

 Frickin' hilarious - maybe you saw this last night during the
election.  It
 was on one the major networks, I don't remember which one, though.
Be sure
 to click on all four guys.
