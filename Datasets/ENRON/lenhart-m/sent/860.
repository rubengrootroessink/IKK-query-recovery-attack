i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i 
think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get 
into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading 
support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope 
that helps you out.
