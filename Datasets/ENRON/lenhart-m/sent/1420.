>>>
>>>5. No emotional discussions -- Ex.: Where are we heading with this?
>>> Do you love me? The answer is no, so don't ask.
>>>
>>>6. No plans made in advance -- that is why you are called the
>>> "backup," unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-
>>>time advanced arrangement.
>>>
>>>7. All gifts excepted -- money is always good.
>>>
>>>8. No baby talk -- however, dirty talk is encouraged.
>>>
>>>9. No asking for comparisons with former lovers -- it's really none
>>> of your damn business.
>>>
>>>10. No calling each other "friends with privileges" -- we are not
