i don't understand your rationale in this bet.  i was up $50 going into our 
bet, you were down $50.  for me to now be down $100 is a $150 swing.  why 
would i risk $150 vs. you risking $50?  florida's math dept. is lousy.  when 
are you and max going to vegas?  i just got back in town from monterrey, ca.  
it was another boondoggle for work.  here is a stock tip for you: pxlw.  
check it out.  also ene.  very strong long term.
