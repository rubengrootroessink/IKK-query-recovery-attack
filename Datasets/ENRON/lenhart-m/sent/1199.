Most of you know that I very rarely send fwds, but my Dad sent me the one 
below ;and although I've read it, I still think its worthwhile to read again.

Everyone have a good weekend.

READ THIS.  LET IT REALLY SINK IN.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU START YOUR DAY TOMORROW.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good
>>  >> > mood and always has something positive to say:
>>  >> >
>>  >> > When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "if I
>>  >> > were any better, I would be twins!"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > He was a natural motivator.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the
>>  >> > employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to
>>  >> > Michael and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive
>>  >> > person all of the time. How do you do it?"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you
have
>>  >> > two choices today.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a
bad
>>  >> > mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose to be in a good mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I

>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose to learn from it.

>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose the positive side of life.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Yeah, right, it's not that easy,"  I protested.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Yes, it is,"  Michael said.  "Life is all about choices. When you
>>  >> > cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people
affect
>>  >your
>>  >> > mood.  You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > The bottom line:  It's your choice how you live life."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the
>>  >> > company to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often
>>  >> > thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of
>>  reacting to
>>  >> it.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious
>>  >> > accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was
>>  >> > released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I saw Michael about six months after the accident.  When I asked
him
>>  >> > how he was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna
>>  >> > see my scars?"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone
>>  >> > through his mind as the accident took place.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my
>>  >> > soon to be born daughter," Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the
>>  >> > ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live
>>  >> > or I could choose to die. I chose to live."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?" I asked.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael continued, "...the paramedics were great. They kept telling
>>  >> > me I  was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER
and
>>  I
>>  >> > saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got
>>  >> > really scared. In their eyes, I read "he's a dead man. I knew I
>>  >> > needed to take action."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "What did you do?" I asked.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me," said
>>  >> > Michael.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "She asked if I was allergic to anything. "Yes, I replied."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply.
>>  >> > I took a deep breath and yelled, "Gravity."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to live. Operate
on
>>  >> > me as if I am alive, not dead."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because
>>  >> > of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have
>>  >> > the choice to live fully.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Attitude, after all, is everything.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
>>  >> > about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You have two choices now:
>>  >> >
>>  >> > 1.  Delete this.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > 2.  Forward it to the people you care about.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I hope you will choose #2.  I did.
