that is the saddest response i have heard.  teachers should be continually 
tested.  i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their 
incompetence.  you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your 
job and half way competent.  democrats are so lazy.  how could you vote 
democrat?  al gore makes me sick.  enough of my ranting and raving.  what are 
you doing this weekend?  i am tired today b/c i went out last night.  this is 
a good scene.  probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now 
and our downtown is booming.    name some small towns that are cool to live 
in near south florida.  i heard naples is great.  i need to live on the 
ocean.
