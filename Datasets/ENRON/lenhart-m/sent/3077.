Dear Phillip Allen and Matthew Lenhart:

As you know, I am Matthew Lenhart's PRC representative. As such, I would
like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year
end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of
the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that
I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC.
Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby
Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is
that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if
needed.

If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at
x3-6173.

Regards,

Ben
