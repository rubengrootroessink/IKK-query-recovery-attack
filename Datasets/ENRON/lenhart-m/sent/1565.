that game was great.  i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole 
office.  the defense is a major concern.  i am torn between being impressed 
with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out 
b/c of that defense.  st. louis had a good defense last year.  i hope their 
defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense.
