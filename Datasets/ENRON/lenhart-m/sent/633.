that date sound good to me.  we can stay at the mirage, treasure island, the 
alladin, mgm, ect.  there should be some websites like expedia.com which can 
find hotel rooms easily.  i can arrive thurs evening after probably around 
6.  i will check flights.  it shouldn't be a busy weekend.  i can't wait.  
should be a great weekend.
