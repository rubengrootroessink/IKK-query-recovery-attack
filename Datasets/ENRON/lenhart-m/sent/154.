lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most 
important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have 
such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has 
proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were 
this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule 
and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at 
this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned 
out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou.  
good luck.
