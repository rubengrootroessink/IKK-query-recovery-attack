i probably am going to cancel my sailing lessons b/c i don't have a car b/c 
that dude backed out on me.  i got to work this morning and he left a message 
for me last night at work saying his wife didn't want to sell it.  i am 
pissed.  i was ready to have it today.  i need to look for a car this weekend 
b/c this fell through.  i will be at telas tonight also.
