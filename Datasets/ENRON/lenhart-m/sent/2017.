i am actually going to fly into new orleans next friday.  i arrive around 
6pm.  we can meet up at our place in the quarter when you guys want to come 
down.  i will try to give you a call next week.  i have to go to shreveport 
for thanksgiving.  one of my friends is getting married to a divorced lady 
with a kid.  the wedding should be fun except for the shreveport part.  i 
hate that place.  have a good time in lake chuck.
