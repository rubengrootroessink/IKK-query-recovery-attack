is your dad ok?  what is hines?  is that a development firm?  i just didn't 
call her last night.  you can't call them the next night.  that looks 
pathetic if you do.  this way she can sit around and think about me for a 
day.  she is a cool chick.  nice, cute sorority chick.  well let me know if 
you go out.
