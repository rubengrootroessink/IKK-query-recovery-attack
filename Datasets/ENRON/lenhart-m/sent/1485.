Wow, what a response we have had so far...23  players are in (old news, more 
than that now).? WE NEED MORE  HOWEVER!!!!? Don't forget to spread the word 
if anyone you know would be  interested.? I surely expect atleast 10 more to 
join but would love alot  more.? Anyway, now to the important stuff...getting 
on the  site.
?
Unlike in years past, I feel that people are more  internet literate and can 
get signed up in a league without step by step  instructions.? So I am going 
to give you the basics and you can figure it  out from there.? I advise you 
do it sooner than later incase you have any  problems.
?
The site is www.commissioner.com.? On the home  page, you will see the?a 
place to sign into commissioner.? You must  have an account with 
commission.com to join the league.? It is the same  site we used last year 
and your name and password should still be active.?  If you don't remember 
it, you can create a new one or there is probably  somewhere that you can get 
them to email you your?username and  password.? Anyway, once you set up an 
account scroll down and select Office  Pool Manager. Our league name is 
Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name  of Loser (they might ask for that 
also, **notice no 's').? The password is  3333.
?
You should be taken to a page to pick who you  are.? Your name should not be 
in the list.? Select "new player" and  enter your name.? This should take you 
to the site.
?
Once you are in....BOOKMARK IT.? It will make  it alot easier to get to it in 
the future.? Take a look at the site.?  The three main links you will be 
using are...1)Make Picks...2)My  Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think 
Tuesday) commissioner.com will  enter the lines on the Make Picks page.? 
These lines will stay constant  untill they close the entries for the week (1 
hour before first kick?off,  includes Thursday games).? You can make your 
picks and change your picks on  this page.? To view your picks you can go to 
My Picks.? On Monday you  can check the Standings.? You can view it by a 
certain week or the yearly  totals.? Just click on the top on what column you 
will want to sort  by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you 
want to check  them out...it is a great site.
?
As for the rules...the money will all be determined  as I get an exact number 
of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!!!! There will  be weekly winners 
and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each  week will be each 
game that week, including Monday nights game.? In  addition to Monday's game, 
you will pick the Monday night total points  scored.? This tie breaker will 
determine weekly winners in case of any  ties.? The person closest to the 
total will win the tie breaker (absolute  value).? If the absolute value is 
equal, the under will beat the  over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player 
A picks 35...B picks  20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.? 
Don't worry, it  is real easy.? 
?
As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?  Anyone that is tied at the 
top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our  playoffs.? I will send out the 
lines (the site won't have them) to the  players involved.? You will pick all 
four games and the person who gets the  most correct will win.? If multiple 
people tie then we will weed out and go  on to the next weeks.? If it makes 
it all the way to the superbowl, then we  will pick the game and an 
over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker.
?
Don't worry if you don't make your picks one  week.? You won't take a zero?( 
I am a softie).? Too many people  have those weeks that they can't get around 
to making there picks.? If I  gave zeros, that would kill your chances for 
the yearly total.? Anyone that  doesn't get their picks in will take all the 
AWAY teams.? I will enter  those picks after the deadline to enter picks.? 
All these games will count  to the yearly total but can not win the weekly 
prize.? 
?
That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?  You can send me a check ($50) 
to the following.? 
?
Michael Brookner
3001 Hillcroft #508
Houston, TX 77057
?
?
PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW  PLAYERS.??I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS 
IN.? IF YOU KNOW  SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT 
BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO  TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST.
?
?
THANKS....Brook
