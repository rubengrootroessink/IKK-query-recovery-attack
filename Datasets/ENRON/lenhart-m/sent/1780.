i don't think we bet, but i will give you the benefit of the doubt.  since 
florida won that makes us even.  here is the math:

you owe me 50
i owe you 50
net = 0

florida's math dept. must not have been that stellar.  so you and max are 
buying a house together?  that is good to hear.  i don't know what i am doing 
for thanksgiving.  one of my buddies from school is getting married that 
weekend and i might just go to that.  what else is new in denver?  you still 
selling drugs?  so who is going to be the bread winner, you or max?  i have 
been meeting some girls.  a lot of cougars.  cougars make me laugh b/c they 
think they are a hot commodity or something.  where are you and max going to 
buy?  does he still like the 5 points area?  that isn't exactly mayberry.  
well practice your math and keep in touch.
