you have to give me a second to reply.  so you are going to meet me there?  i 
can leave you tickets for the booth at my place or you can call me on my cell 
when you get there.    i will put your name on the list at the enron booth.  
my cell phone is 7138258410.  if i dont hear it call again.  if i don't hear 
it after the second time check the booth and i will try to put your name on 
the list.  did your friends say it was fun last night?  i will be drinking a 
lot tonight so don't give me grief like last time.  i am real sensitive.
