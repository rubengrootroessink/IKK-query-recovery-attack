Hey guys and gals, just a reminder that we  are?less than a week away from 
kickoff and I see that you have not joined  in the office pool.? By now you 
should have received the directions on how  to join the pool.? There is still 
plenty of time but I still advise not to  wait to long just incase you have 
any problems.
?
We are at over 40 players as long as each of you  join up.? Let me know if 
you have changed your mind so I can take you off  my list (at least for this 
year).
?
Hope all is going well and I'll look for you on the  page.
?
Brook
