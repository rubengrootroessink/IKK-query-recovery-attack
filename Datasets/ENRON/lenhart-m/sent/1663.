sounds like you would be calculating a book each day.  it might be a good 
entry into trading, but i would check with them on how they have their 
program set up to get people into trading positions.  let me check with h.r. 
today.  they move slow.  i would ask some questions on that posting to find 
out where it would put you eventually.  trading is the way to go.  more money 
in trading and your opportunities would open up throughout the industry.
