i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  
the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best 
thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing 
lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of 
struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will 
try to call you and grandma this weekend.
