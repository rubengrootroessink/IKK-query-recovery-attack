actually i am staying at the adam's mark hotel downtown.  i will definately 
be able to see you guys at least once.  i am not sure what the schedule is so 
i will just play it by ear.  i wish i was coming in for the weekend, but the 
tickets were twice as much and they don't want to pay for my vacation.  call 
me tonight & i will let you know details.
