what do you mean i wasn't doing so hot saturday night?  i thought i was in 
great shape.  i was dancing better than menudo.  i was hurting when we left 
sat.  i almost puked in my car when i was driving back to houston.  going 
back to football games is so much fun, but the drinking kills you.  i haven't 
drank that much for that long in a while.  it was worth it.  i am tired 
today, but it is nice for everyone to say how we kicked ass this weekend.  i 
still can't believe you didn't get tickets.  i had extras.  i could have 
hooked you up.  i heard brittney spears was at fred's on sat night.  did you 
hear that.  not that i am a fan of hers, i just heard that.  shoot me another 
email when you get a chance.
