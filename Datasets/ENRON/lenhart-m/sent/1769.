damn!  you got a 112?  did you answer yes to the animal sex question?  i 
scored lower than you.  i scored a 96.  my mother would be proud.  i am just 
an angel.    you should move to the french riviera.  i think i am going to do 
something similar.  i need to go anna nicole and marry a rich old woman and 
move to the carribean.  i think i could quit work and become some old blue 
hair's boy toy.  i would only be a couple of years.  i would probably be able 
to get a girlfriend on the side who is more my age.  all i would really have 
to do is get on a different sleeping schedule than her and i could totally 
avoid her.  fuck working.  i don't want to use my mind.  i think that is what 
i am going to work on this weekend.  i can go volunteer at some old person 
place and find a honey.  sounds like a plan.  talk to you later.
