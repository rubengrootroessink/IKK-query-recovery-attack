i wish i lived the life of a rock star.  that would be good.  actually life 
is good.  work is going well.  do you feel better?  hopefully we can get out 
to phoenix over thanksgiving again so you can beat the tar out of me at 
golf.  here is my analogy of you & me at golf:  you are tiger woods on sunday 
and i am greg norman at the masters on sunday.  i will try to call this 
weekend.

love matt
