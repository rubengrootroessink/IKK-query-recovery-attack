Hey there, just an update on where we stand.?  We are up to 33 people that 
have responded that they are in with a few more that  I definitely expect in 
by the time games start.? Only 8 have signed in but  there is still time to 
get on the site.? I wouldn't wait till the last  second incase there are 
problems.? Let me know if you can't figure anything  out and I will try to 
help.
?
Just a few side notes...1)? Applebaum, we are  going to have to work on that 
name you signed in with...2) Susan, I will send  you a seperate email in the 
next couple of days with some help on getting on  line.
?
Anyway, don't forget to get more players.? BUT  DON'T FORGET TO HAVE THEM 
REFERENCE YOU!!!? I am receiving emails from  people I can't reference and it 
just takes a little work to figure out who they  are.? We have got all of 
them cleared up except for one that I am still  working on.? It just makes it 
alot easier if they mention you from the  begining.
?
Well, that is it for now.? Will get back to  you towards the middle of next 
week with some more updates.
?
Brook
