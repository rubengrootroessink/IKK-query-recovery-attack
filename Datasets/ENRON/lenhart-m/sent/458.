sorry about leaving last night.  i know that was selfish.  you always stay 
over when it isn't convienient for you and i should have stayed.  i don't 
want you to think that i am trying to just walk all over you b/c i am not.  i 
did have a good time last night and i am sorry i ruined it at the end.  
hopefully you are not too mad.  email me later.
