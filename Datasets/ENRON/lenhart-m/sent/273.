damn baby chill!   did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed this 
morning?  9 1/2 weeks isn't a dirty movie, it's a classic.  you will see.  so 
why don't you come over tomorrow.  but don't come too late b/c i can't stay 
up that long.  did you cry tears of joy when nsync was on?  i couldn't have 
made it in that band b/c i am too rugged.  those guys are little sallys.
