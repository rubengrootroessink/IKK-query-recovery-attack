Matt,  

Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and 
by pipe in CA.  Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be 
shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.  Let's discuss 
the impact on sendouts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Philip is a list of the gas plants.  CEC list is all plants including QFs and 
non QFs (i.e.utility plants and the IPPs - Reliant, SOuthern et al).
