i can't wait for the cruise.  i will watch out for the hot women on the 
boat.  i might just stay in grand caymen and run a boat business if it is 
really nice there.  i want to go to denver over labor day weekend.  if you 
guys go up for the inagural it would be the following weekend.  memorial day 
would give me an extra day off. if you guys cannot stay through that weekend 
i will try to go over the 18th.  i will try to call tonight or tomorrow.

love matt
