did you get my email yesterday?  i emailed you to see if you could get me the 
numbers and email addresses of the bachelor party guys.  go ahead and send 
them to me if you have them.  i would love to go to miami on april 6th but i 
might have a wedding in new orleans.  if i don't have to go to this wedding i 
will go to your engagement party.  things are good here.  i am still dating 
this girl that i was dating when i was home over xmas.  i guess we are 
boyfriend/girlfriend b/c she gave me the business last night on how she 
wanted to be treated and crap like that.  i like her though.  so how does 
that work for your wedding?  what all is the wedding party expected to pay 
for?  work is good.  i have just been working and partying.  email me back or 
i will call you and max this weekend.

take care
matt
