Hey, is anyone else interested in this trip besides the following?

Me
Tanya
Clint
Roby
Naquin
Bernie

Shannon....you had said you might be interested....what do you think?

Don, what about you and Wendy?
Myers????Shauna????Porthole????Clay???Deltart? Tommy, what about Timmy and
Tricia? Gooch????

We need to know pretty soon, and we haven't really heard from anyone except
the people above. Let's get this thing locked up...it is a great price
compared to other trips that Clint and I have priced out, and it is to 4
great ski areas....this will be fun, so get off your rockers and let's do
this thing....Start saving now...you still have 2 1/2 months left.....
