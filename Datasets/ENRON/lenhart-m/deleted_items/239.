I think Denis is going to come over and cook at my crib before the game (or
before we go out to tailgate in the late afternoon). We can concelebrate
game day with Bourge's and Gooch's B'day (both this week). If anyone wants
to come over and eat, drink, and watch other good games on TV, please let
me know so that I can plan for it. Let 's say it will start at Noon, with
food to be ready around 1-2 o'clock, and beer to be ready all day. I figure
we can go to campus around 4-5pm......anyone interested?
