we might need to hit his parents up for some of those, this may sound gay,
but I'll bet they would like it, we could give it to them as a present, a
video slide show of Max and Jen growing up and meeting.  Their parents might
already be doing this but they did it at Josh and Lisa's (cousin) wedding
and it was cool.
