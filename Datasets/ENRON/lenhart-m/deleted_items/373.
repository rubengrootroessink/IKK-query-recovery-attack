layer News   Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Cha=
mp Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's ex=
pected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missin=
g this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoo=
t if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moor=
e (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. =
He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him F=
antasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17=
/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t=
o play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s=
tart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Update=
d 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during S=
unday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play,=
 but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of t=
he week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all=
 possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed pr=
actice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seife=
rt expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If=
 you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terribl=
e Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Mat=
his (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Su=
nday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues fr=
om a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated =
10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected =
to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too un=
reliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. =
He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his=
 swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in D=
allas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB =
DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the ye=
ar, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown fl=
ashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still mi=
nimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Be=
nnett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a ri=
ght ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentic=
e serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN =
- Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=
 against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to=
 start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unl=
ess it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He retu=
rns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.=
  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published =
reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. =
He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan w=
ants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this wee=
k, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any=
 Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mac=
k will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too produc=
tive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   K=
eenan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled =
in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in th=
e previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot =
of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins w=
ill have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of=
 passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC -=
 JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches =
and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yar=
ds and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady=
 is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is liste=
d as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only ha=
s five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01=
 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several =
passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after t=
earing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disapp=
ointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mo=
rnhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a signi=
ficant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! L=
arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , R=
B OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley w=
ill miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was=
 beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie G=
arner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out=
 Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse"=
 back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to=
 four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/=
17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both kn=
ees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not a=
ffect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more =
involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are h=
ealthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the ye=
ar, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Patho=
n , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be=
 able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game a=
gainst Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot pla=
y again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Hera=
ld says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with st=
ress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smit=
h , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Sta=
! , Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the com=
ing weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each oth=
er very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration=
 on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Al=
exander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed =
a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to t=
he injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Micha=
el Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concus=
sion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. H=
is status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but =
he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 C=
lark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on hi=
s right hamstring three weeks ago. "It was encouraging," Clark told the Con=
tra Costa Times. "I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before =
the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I coul=
d do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison." Head C=
oach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make =
his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game=
 against Chicago.    More Updates  Playe! r ! News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matty Pl=
ayer News  Michael Pittman , Active RB Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffer=
ed a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on=
 Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questio=
nable, but he is expected to play.   Giants , Active DT Updated 10/17/01 De=
fensive tackle Keith Hamilton suffered a separated shoulder during Sunday's=
 game against St. Louis, but he is expected to play on Monday night against=
 Philadelphia. Linebacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able=
 to play in the game as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a s=
prained ankle, and his status against the Eagles is questionable at this po=
int.   Michael Bennett , Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as d=
oubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Ex=
pect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his bac=
kup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Marshall Faulk , Active RB Updated 10/16=
/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets=
 despite a bruised right knee. "He really could possibly play this week," c=
oach Mike Martz said. "We're not going to rule the possibility of him playi=
ng completely out." If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will =
be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decis=
ion on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation=
 throughout the week.   Brian Griese , Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 The Bron=
cos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego,=
 according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right =
shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder =
surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunda=
y's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Brad John=
son , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Johnson finally had a productive game Fan=
tasy-wise, throwing for 287 yards and three scores against Tennessee. He is=
 still not worth starting on a regular basis, however, and is better off us=
ed when the matchup is good.   Terry Glenn , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Gle=
nn had a huge game in his return from a suspension, catching seven passes f=
or 110 yards and a score. He won't post numbers that good on a weekly basis=
, but he is worth picking up and starting if you need help with your receiv=
ers.   Rod Smith , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Smith's yardage numbers might=
 be a bit disappointing this week if Seattle CB Shawn Springs (hamstring, p=
robable) is close to top form. But he should still catch at least one TD pa=
ss as the Seahawks hurt their secondary with the lack of a solid pass rush.=
  Frank Wycheck , Reserve TE Updated 10/12/01 Look for Wycheck to catch a l=
ot of passes this week. He hasn't had a lot of looks because he has been us=
ed mostly as a fullback, blocking for Eddie George. But George is suffering=
 from an ankle injury and isn't expected to get a lot of carries. The Titan=
s will throw to Wycheck to compensate.   Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 10/12=
/01 Horn is a must-start this weekend against Carolina. The Panthers' secon=
dary is very vulnerable, and Horn has put up good numbers against them in t=
he past.   Oronde Gadsden , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Gadsden should find=
 himself in position to catch a TD pass against the Jets. Miami will score =
often against the New York defense.  Sebastian Janikowski , Active K Update=
d 10/10/01 Janikowki needed five stitches to close a cut on his head that w=
as suffered during an off-field incident. He has not missed practice and sh=
ould play against the Colts this week.  J.J. Stokes , Reserve WR Updated 10=
/09/01 Stokes, who injured his knee during Sunday's win over Carolina, is l=
isted as probable for this weekend's contest at Atlanta. He's been inconsis=
tent thus far, and shouldn't be depended on to produce Fantasy-wise.   Aaro=
n Brooks , Active QB Updated 10/08/01 Brooks turned in his second consecuti=
ve mediocre performance Sunday. He only threw for 210 yards with an interce=
ption and no touchdown passes. Brooks has struggled in the last two games b=
ut the Saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning gam=
es. He's worth a starting spot Fantasy-wise this week against Carolina.   [=
