                                           simple)





 MAKE A WISH BEFORE BEGINNING THE TEST!!

A Warning!      Answer the questions as you go along..
      There are only four questions and if you see them all before
finishing

- you will not have honest results. Go down slowly and do each exercise as
you scroll down. Don't look ahead. Get pencil and paper to write your
answers
as you go along. You will need it at the end. This is an honest
questionnaire, which will tell you a lot about your true self..



Put the following 5 animals in the order of your preference.
       a. Cow
        b. Tiger
        c. Sheep
        d. Horse
        e. Pig






Write one word that describes each one of the following:
       Dog
       Cat
       Rat
       Coffee
       Sea



        Think of someone (who also knows you and is important to you) that
you can
relate them to the following colors. (Please do not repeat your answer
twice.
 Name just one person for each color.)
        Yellow
        Orange
        Red
        White
        Green







        Finally,write down your favorite number and your favorite day of
the

week.








       Finished? Please be sure that your answers are what you REALLY WANT.










        Look at the interpretations below: (but first before continuing,
repeat your wish.)






        This will define your priorities in your life.

        Cow signifies CAREER
        Tiger Signifies PRIDE
        Sheep Signifies LOVE
        Horse Signifies FAMILY
       Pig Signifies MONEY

      Your description of dog implies YOUR OWN PERSONALITY.
      Your description of cat implies the personality of your partner.
      Your description of rat implies the personality of your enemies.
      Your description of coffee is how you interpret SEX.
      Your description of the Sea implies your own life.


        Yellow:  Someone you will never forget
        Orange: Someone you consider your true friend.
        Red:      Someone that you really love
        White:   Your twin soul
        Green:   Someone that you will remember for the rest of your life.


      You have to send this message to as many persons as your favorite
number and your wish will come true on the day that you put. This is what
the
Dalai Lama has said about the Millennium -- just take a few seconds to read
it and think. Do not put away this message, the mantra will come out from
your hands in the next 96 hours. You will have a very pleasant surprise.
This
is true, even if you are not superstitious.



       Please do this. It is fascinating.


        SEND THIS E-MAIL MANTRA TO AT LEAST FIVE PERSONS AND YOUR LIFE WILL
IMPROVE

        0-4 persons: Your life will improve slightly.
      5-9 persons: Your life will improve to your liking.
      9-14 persons: You will have at least 5 surprises in the next three
weeks.
       15 or more persons: Your life will improve drastically and all that
you have always dreamed will take shape.

      If at any time you do not receive the smile you were expecting, be
generous and give that person a smile. Because nobody has as much necessity
of a smile than the person that does not know how to smile at others.
