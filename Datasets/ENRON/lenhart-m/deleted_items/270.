n, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01Dixon missed Monday game because of =
a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this =
week.Joe Jurevicius, WR NYG - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/24/01Ike Hilliard=
 regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of=
 a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. H=
owever, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he=
 could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been =
inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times =
in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. Reggie Swinton, WR DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury=
 and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worke=
d with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough =
to say for sure he will be availa! bl! e," said head coach Dave Campo. Darr=
in Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. =
Joey Galloway, WR DAL - The Nice Machine Updated 10/24/01Galloway is listed=
 as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboy=
s are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a spra=
ined foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say =
he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improv=
es the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo.   Darrin Chiave=
rini, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01Chiaverini practiced Monday and i=
s listed as probabl! e ! for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is rec=

 10/24/01Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without =
any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. Ricky Watters,=
 RB SEA - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01According to the Tacoma Ne=
ws Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return=
 to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another mon=
th or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. =
"I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the l! in! eup. He=
 was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and pl=
ayed well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."=
 If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs o=
n your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexan=
der down the stretch. Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dil=
fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the=
 starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy roster=
s at this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Hassel=
beck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against M=
iami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer=
, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This=

e, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Update=
d 10/23/01The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's ga=
me at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of t=
he concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Fre=
e Agent Updated 10/23/01Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury.=
 He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantas=
y player at this point in the season.Lamar Smith, RB MIA - The Lie Downs Up=
dated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is s=
till expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this=
 week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01Chiefs =
Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris =
Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use =
either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposi=
ng. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.Jerome Path=

ut the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate! h! im. He will =
work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whethe=
r Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unle=
ss it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 p=
ercent healthy. Warrick Dunn, RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/23/01Accordin=
g to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was=
 originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, =
but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI=
 - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/23/01Staley started Monday's game against th=
e N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three =
times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buck=
halter, who gained 34 yards on! 1! 1 carries late in the game. At this poin=
t, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so co=
nsider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. Joe Ned=

nday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Free =

twhackers Updated 10/23/01McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result=
 of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's=
 game. Chris Sanders, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01The Tennessean re=
ports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is =
expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, =
an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie=
 Drew Bennett will play in his absence. Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI o=
n his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. Fred Taylo=
r, RB! J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out o=
f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai=
ns uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe=
rcises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T=
imes-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=
 is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=
 of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inac=
tive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt, WR C=

oncussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next wee=

t four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen, RB BAL - The Guzzler=
s Updated 10/23/01Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game wit=
