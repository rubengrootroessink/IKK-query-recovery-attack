 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Thrill Kill =
Cult Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 3=
6-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewi=
s is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNa=
ir , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to pl=
ay with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will proba=
bly miss some practice time this week. He should still be able t! o ! play =
in the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/19=
/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sun=
day's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remai=
nder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties i=
n Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Update=
d 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but t=
he Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He s=
hould still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR S=
TL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New=
 England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as=
 day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Updated 11/19/01 Wayne s=
uffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod S=
mith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could n=
ot finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is u=
nclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/19/01 =
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70=
 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he=
's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Har=
ris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/1! 9/! 01 Harris suffered a strained r=
ight hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return=
 to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - No=
rth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detro=
it on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injur=
ed his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quinc=
y Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his =
hamstring has healed eno! ug! h that he's ready to return to action. Howeve=
r, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets=
 his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this=
 season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   Jame=
s Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Clevel=
and Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Raven=
s. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to ga=
metime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emerg=
ence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Lea=
f , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing t=
his weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the=
 team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better th=
an waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free =
Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the fir=
st quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Phi=
ladelphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against=
 Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he =
would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent G=
raham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attracti=
ve Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake P=
it Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sp=
rained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dall=
as faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game=
 against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's=
 win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to d=
ay.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered =
a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to =
day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/18/01 Muha=
mmad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His sta=
tus for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DE=
N - The Guzzlers Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 c=
arries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 =
yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fa=
ntasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Micha=
el Westbrook , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nin=
e passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing o=
n rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting th=
e year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/18/=
01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroi=
t. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a bette=
r game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 11/18/0=
1 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carri=
es. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin=
 at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caugh=
t two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate=
 for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie=
 Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed=
 for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a s=
core. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the=
 goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of =
the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught=
 12 passes ! fo! r 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 y=
ards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy n=
umbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also errat=
ic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caug=
ht 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the en=
d zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is =
very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - One Man Show Updated 11/18/=
01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is=
 not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR =
CHI - The Executioners Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 =
yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a =
superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter=
 what matchup he faces.   More Updates  Transactions, View  [IMAGE]     [IM=
