Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560

The first is the 10.50 and the second is the 8.85.
