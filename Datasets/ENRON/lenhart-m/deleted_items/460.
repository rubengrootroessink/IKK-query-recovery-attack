, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
! h! asn't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration =
in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Fo=
otball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last tw=
o games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom=
 Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick=
 announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for =
the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to=
 a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady migh=
t have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fai=
rly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/=
21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seaso=
n due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to =
rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abse=
nce hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more b=
y opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.!   Marvin Minnis , WR KC - =
Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's=
 game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 1=
1 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup =
at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell=
 , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sid=
eline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours b=
efore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to=
 a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he wi=
ll start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as=
 you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Tayl=
or received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groi=
n injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder o=
f the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that =
the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, =
and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain! i! n his hip, a side effect =
of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again =
this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a fin=
al decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith ,=
 WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enou=
gh for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss=
 Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggrav=
ated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smi=
th on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bro=
ncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it =
would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 1=
1/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Ale=
xander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during =
their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against t=
he Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patri=
ots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's =
No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. B=
rady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to you! r ! rost=
er as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadric=
eps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game. =
 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has=
 not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times=
 . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Sha=
un Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as =
the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/2=
0/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy=
 involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterba=
ck," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is no=
ne within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get =
us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought t=
o satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated =
11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder=
 injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because B=
ruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  =
Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contr=
a-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects t=
o play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinn=
ey (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to =
return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated=
 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a=
 risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's=
 practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to=
 miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Up=
dated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to=
 start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/0=
1 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may =
have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/=
20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game=
 against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jer=
ome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the s=
eason. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurti=
ng, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting =
lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told =
the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup =
Ra! y ! right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the s=
tarter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play =
turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike=
 Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently heale=
d to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to ev=
aluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he=
 can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he ca=
n't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep h=
im out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how=
 much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in s=
ome of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend aga=
inst Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the w=
ide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Ba=
nks , QB WAS - Free Agent U! pd! ated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks =
will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concus=
sion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the =
injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to pract=
ice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and =
is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Marti=
n Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the=
 overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries are=
n't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the startin=
