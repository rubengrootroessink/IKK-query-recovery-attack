 Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart =
, RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's=
 game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.  Keys=

econd half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because =
of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already pla=
ying with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will =

y are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I proba=
bly could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain." =
 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced hi=
mself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17=
-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, =
but I'll be all right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn'=
t know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was abl=
e to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next=
 week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evalu=
ated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.  =
   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 According to =
published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game agains=
t Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.!  Eddie Kennison ,=
 WR DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yar=
ds against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has r=
everted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. =
  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed fo=
r only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eigh=
t-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37=
 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this y=
ear.!  David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught =
five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a sco=
ring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  =
Troy Brown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes =
for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 y=
ards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive t=
eams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Upd=
ated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In t=
he past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug F=
lutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations =
as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/0=
1 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two=
 passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and =
Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seem=
s to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside! =
t! he red zone.   Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Ce=
nters was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. Th=
e Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Ri=
emersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Pr=
ice , WR BUF - The Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for=
 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he app=
ears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt=
 Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best =
game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he=
 continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball=
 downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine=
 Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Co=
nsidering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers look=
ed respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to =
post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his=
 overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/=
01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wide=
out is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  =
James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight=
 passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami=
 receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne ,=
 RB NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards=
 on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good num=
bers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer =
, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for =
109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy play=
er, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Executi=
oners Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but w=
as held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, bu=
t the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move th=
e ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for =
190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, no! w ! th=
e erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce =
Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday ag=
ainst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, wi=
th two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush =
defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears no=
ting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which sugge=
sts that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both ris=
ky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10/28/! =
01!  Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadel=
phia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured ba=
ck while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Exe=
cutioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns =
and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall=
 challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bet=
ter stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhacker=
s Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunda=
y against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lo=
t for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was st=
ill a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he shoul=
d break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half =
of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pit=
tman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been muc=
h better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player wi=
ll be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Bosto=
n , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes fo=
r 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inco=
nsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy=
 player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's=
 easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, =
I did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns=
 and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how i=
nconsistent he can be. Unless! t! he matchup dictates otherwise, you should=
n't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Su=
nday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' def=
ense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the match=
up, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit w=
ill give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 ya=
rds, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23=
 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't g=
reat for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' seconda=
ry. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  More U=
