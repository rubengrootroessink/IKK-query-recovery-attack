son , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of =
Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right kne=
e bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a so=
re right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in =
the morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying t=
hat it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not =
have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith=
 , RB DAL - ! Ro! cks Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite =
having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over A=
rizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all r=
ight," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree=
 the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off the=
 field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New =
York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, b=
ut said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepp=
er , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 According to published report=
s, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He =
is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - FIBSABs=
 Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England=
, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  stati=
stical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB D=
EN - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr=
ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the B! ro!=
 ncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap=
pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W=
R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he =
remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - The K=
lap Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denv=
er. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a =
big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedul=
e.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes=
 for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, bu=
t now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is fi=
nally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , =
TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Jones overc! am! e a sprained ankle to =
play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his ca=
tches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers=
 on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tig=
ht end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF =
- Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards =
on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfi=
eld to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from =
Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart  Updated 10/28/=
01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Pri=
ce is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for F=
antasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two =
TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing=
 key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexa=
nder , RB SEA - The Klap Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=
 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan=
der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat=
tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better =
defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Up=
dated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami'=
s No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fanta=
sy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Baja Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught=
 eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The=
 Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron D=
ayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 ya=
rds on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good =
numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toom=
er , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109=
 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player,=
 no matte! r ! what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenha=
rt Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was =
held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but t=
he Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the b=
all.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 1=
90 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the err=
atic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Stale=
y , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakla=
nd but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catc=
hes for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, an=
d should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that C=
orrell Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that ne=
ither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts. =
 Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21=
 times for 77 yards and a touchdown ! Su! nday at Philadelphia. This outing=
 could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone W=
heatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 10/28=
/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in=
 Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagle=
s' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future wee=
ks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for=
 just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get=
 intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats agains=
t the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a=
 bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fa=
ntasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB=
 ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 y=
ards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this se=
ason, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option fo=
r the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated 10/2=
8/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. Wh=
ile Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspe=
ctive, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks =
in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team=
.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yar=
ds, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further=
 exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwi=
se, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys=
 , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to t=
hree points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the gam=
e. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective base=
d on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing th=
at this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint St=
oerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 pa=
sses for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seve=
n times for 23 yards and a score in Sun! da! y's game against Arizona. Thes=
e numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak =
Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on th=
is outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunda=
y's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injur=
y after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated s=
hortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left=
 Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was ta=
ken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by =
