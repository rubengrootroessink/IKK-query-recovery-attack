, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/26/01 Brookins is expected to miss the rest =
of the season with a broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimo=
re's No. 1 RB now, and the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the=
 next few days.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/26/01 Bar=
low dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not b=
een determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/0=
1 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is d=
ay to day.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Snake Pit Updated 11/26/01 Jackson=
 re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day=
.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The Executioners Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is li=
sted as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken=
 for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's W=
eek 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 8=
0 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in=
 recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opp=
onents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kil=
l Cult Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three c=
atches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail rema=
ins a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complet=
e and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So Ni=
ce Machine Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jac=
ksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too errat=
ic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - N=
ot So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball ! si! x times fo=
r 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the=
 remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Executioners Updated =
11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught f=
ive passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners w=
ould still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tom=
linson , RB SD - The Executioners Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o=
f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook=
ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'=
s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Flu=
tie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Ari=
zona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantag=
e.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/25/01 Plummer =
had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against! S=
! an Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy qu=
arterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25=
/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards =
and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy re=
ceivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Ja=
ckson , WR NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing=
 against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. H=
e may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting=
 in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 11/25/01 Hor=
n had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New E=
ngland. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth s=
tarting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated=
 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball fi! v=
e! times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage p=
ackages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy t=
eam in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able t=
o take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - The=
 Guzzlers Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two tou=
chdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty =
good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - The Executi=
oners Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posti=
ng 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fan=
tasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patri=
ots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Executioners Updat=
ed 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions agai=
nst the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look li=
ke the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Nort=
h Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 Sanders l! ef! t Sunday's game against =
San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTa=
y Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Who's Yo=
 Daddy Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catc=
hing six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fum=
ble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disapp=
ointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best ou=
ting of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 y=
ards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantas=
y consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde=
 Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight =
passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lo=
st a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in t=
hese important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/=
25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards! , ! three TDs and no interceptions at Bu=
ffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedl=
er is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb=
 , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNab=
b to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. E=
xpect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.=
  James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught f=
our passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a =
starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , W=
R WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for=
 only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the pa=
st few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   M=
