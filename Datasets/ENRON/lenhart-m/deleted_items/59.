hey there- how's it goin?

4th st. is sort-of away from all the college
crowd...it's pretty cool, i like it.  if you were to go
to 6th. 'the library' & 'the aquarium' are good
places. 'touche' is also pretty cool (flaming dr.pepper
gimick).
i work at 'lbjs broadcasting' there are six radio
stations in the building. i work specifically for
101X.  it is an alternative rock station.  i also make
some commercials; if you listen to the radio here-
that's me talking on the 'showpalace' & 'expose'
commercials.- yes- they are strip clubs.(no
affiliation) it also airs on 93.7fm.
how's it goin in the arm-pit of america?
-cori:)
