Natural Gas Futures and Cash Continue Lower
Natural gas futures on the NYMEX dropped lower after the AGA announced natu=
ral gas inventories jumped 117 Bcf last week, well above market expectation=
s. The July contract fell $0.091 to $3.801 per MMBtu and August dipped $0.0=
87 to $3.888 per MMBtu. The AGA reported storage levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtu=
ally identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more than a year ago. Last=
 years injection was 78 Bcf and the 5-year average injection of 81 Bcf for =
the comparable weeks. The large build was driven by a lack of demand on Mem=
orial Day and mild weather. Warmer weather is expected to affect much of th=
e nation over the next several days, limiting the upside reaction. The hot =
weather in the southwestern states will begin to expand into Texas and the =
central Plains this weekend extending into the Southeast next week. Look fo=
r the market to continue lower today under the weight of the 117 Bcf inject=
ion. But, with the summer heat and the hurricanes beginning to show up, it =
is becoming increasingly dangerous to short the market. The next key level =
of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00 and $4.20 offering resistance. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery across the US dropped $0.15 $0.25 per MMBtu=
, except out west where prices tumbled over $1.00. Canadian spot prices tum=
bled about $0.50 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry =
hub lost $0.23 to $3.76 per MMBtu.

BPA Power Contract Rates Up
The BPA says wholesale power rates will be offered at a 150% or greater pre=
mium in October, and that it has achieved 51% of its goal to lower demand f=
or its power. For aluminum producers, that means they would have to pay abo=
ut $50 per MWh for BPA power once their new five-year contract takes effect=
 on October 1st. That is a substantial increase over the $24 per MWh smelte=
rs in the Pacific Northwest were used to paying under their expiring five-y=
ear contracts, but much less than the 250% to 300% increase BPA anticipated=
 last April. The BPA has been negotiating with industrial customers to redu=
ce their power demand. In return, BPA agrees to pay their employees' wages.=
 Most aluminum smelters in the Northwest have already curtailed or stopped =
operating to comply with BPA's request. Customers have until June 22nd to c=
omplete their negotiations for power contracts. On June 29th, BPA will subm=
it power rates to the FERC.

New Coal Fired Power Plants Making Comeback
New coal-fired power plants are now being planned after a decade in which a=
lmost none were built in the US. But, now 34 coal plants are being planned =
to meet ever increasing power needs across the nation. Energy Secretary Abr=
aham has called for 1,300 new power plants over the next 20 years to meet p=
rojected demand. Electricity demand has more than doubled over the last 20 =
years. Coal currently fires more than half of US electricity production. Th=
e expansion of coal power plants has been put off pollution concerns. Clean=
er burning natural gas produces only 15% of the nation's power, but increas=
ing quickly. Natural gas emits 43% less carbon dioxide than conventional co=
al burning. As a result, 90% of planned power plants are natural gas fired.=
 But, now scrubbers that cut up to 90% of sulfur dioxide emissions and grow=
ing amounts of nitrogen oxide. Peabody Group, the largest coal company in t=
he world, is planning a $1.5 billion 1,500 MW Thoroughbred plant slated to =
come online in 2005 in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. That plant, which Peabo=
dy plans to make an environmental showcase, will be built beside a coal min=
e. Illinois plans to build three coal-fired plants. Last week the state leg=
islature approved a $3.5 billion package of tax incentives and low-cost loa=
ns for the construction of new power plants that can burn high sulfur coal =
from Illinois.

California Power Bill Dead
House Republicans have declared dead a proposed bill to help California avo=
id summer power outages, after Democrats refused to drop demands for wholes=
ale price caps opposed by President Bush. But as power shifts from Republic=
ans to Democrats in the Senate, there is a continued battle over price cont=
rols. The FERC, which has authority to cap prices, also opposes them. Repub=
licans, without more support, simply ran out of time to help California, wh=
ich faces many hours of blackouts this summer. The proposed legislation wou=
ld have also waived some clean air regulations to allow power plants to ope=
rate during peak times, relieved transmission congestion with new lines and=
 forced the federal government to cut energy use in its California offices =
20%. The bill-writing session collapsed after California Rep. Waxman sought=
 an amendment to stop what he called price-gouging by wholesale power selle=
rs.

Study Says More Natural Gas Drilling Restricted
More of the recoverable natural gas in the Rocky Mountains is off-limits to=
 drilling than previously thought, according to a new DOE study. A review f=
ound that about 68% of the recoverable supplies in the Greater Green River =
Basin in southern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado, up to 79 Tcf, is eithe=
r closed to drilling or under significant access restrictions. The conclusi=
ons are much higher than a similar 1999 study which said 40% was off limits=
. The US consumes about 23 Tcf of natural gas per year. The studied area co=
vered almost 29 million acres of land with almost 160 Tcf of gas, of which =
16 million acres with 117 Tcf was under federal ownership. Slightly over tw=
o-thirds of the recoverable federal natural gas in the study was either clo=
sed to development or available with restrictions.

PUC Delay Pushes SCE Toward Bankruptcy
A delay by the California PUC in implementing parts of a state-sponsored $2=
.76 billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison may lead the utility=
 into bankruptcy. The PUC will meet today, but had not put on its agenda th=
e regulatory changes which were agreed upon last April by the utility and t=
he governor. If the PUC doesn't implement the changes by Friday, the state =
or the utility could back out of the plan. The political reality is that Ed=
ison is likely going to slouch toward Chapter 11. The legislature has 120 d=
ays to approve the plan which has been faulted as too generous to SCE and o=
f little use to consumers and creditors, while throwing California into the=
 power generation business. SCE has a long line of creditors awaiting back =
payments, including at least 30 power generators that have sued it. It only=
 takes three to throw the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. Some analyst=
s think that risk is already very high.

Wednesday June 6 2001
Nye thinks Bush may
lead US to retail
power competition
-
But when will Texas
link with North
American grid?
First of several articles
Erle Nye, TXU CEO, has taken over the reins at EEI from John Rowe, the Exel=
on co-CEO.  The two spoke to the press at EEI's annual meeting in New Orlea=
ns yesterday.
They had briefed the vice president when he was putting together the White =
House's new energy policy.=20
Does Nye think Bush will lead a national switch from monopoly to competitio=
n in electricity as he did in Texas.
Bush believes in it and led the move to open up Texas, Nye said, and when t=
he time is right, he expects the president to take the leadership to open u=
p retail markets.=20
Nye speaks for the investor owned electric industry but as a Texas grid own=
er at TXU he knows a lot about ERCOT.
We asked him when Texas (ERCOT) will hook up to the North American grid.  =
=09It's already connected for up to 600 mw, Nye replied, but it's a DC tie =
and the power is easy to control.=20
His short answer was that ERCOT will build more ties to the east and west w=
hen it's worth doing.  It won't happen until there's a strong financial dri=
ver.  The grid grew up around load, he reminded, and between the huge easte=
rn and western interties exists a large nothingness where load is small or =
non-existent.
If a need arises for another connection between ERCOT and SPP he knows exac=
tly how much it will cost for another DC line because they've done that.
If someone has to build six 345 or higher kv lines at major interconnection=
 points, then Nye has to ask what the investor gets in return.=20
The president talks of it like the Interstate Highway system, Nye noted wit=
h some skepticism.
Is not Nye's view based on fear of FERC jurisdiction?=20
"We're all going to be subject to FERC anyway," Nye asserted.=20
"If you want to make it subject to FERC, pass a law," Nye advised.=20
Will FERC favor the connection, he asked rhetorically.
Nye predicts FERC would look at a connection proposal "under today's circum=
stances" and determine that a lump of investment that large can be better s=
pent somewhere else.=20
At the bottom line on the question of connecting the East and West there ha=
s to be a way to make some money, Nye reminded.  And any time would be DC, =
he assumes, since AC power flow is too hard to control.=20
"The idea of a national grid is premature," he predicted, but it will happe=
n when the economics justify it.
"... when the rate of return justifies it."
We asked Nye what is a good rate of return in today's world.
For transmission, what is a return that would motivate investment in the gr=
id?
"North of 11.5-12% to do what's important and it would need to be more in a=
 more challenging environment.=20
"If it's real easy to do and anybody can do it, you can get by with the low=
er return," Nye added.=20
Williams' CEO Keith Bailey asks why he should invest for a small return whe=
n he can get 20+% in broadband, we noted.=20
Nye noted that broadband has more risk too.=20
Nye respects departing EEI chairman John Rowe and intends little change in =
management style at EEI.  He shares Rowe's positive view of where the indus=
try is headed and should go, he said.  Rowe is more competition minded than=
 earlier EEI top leaders and Nye is even more pro-competition than Rowe.
Nye believes in the Texas retail power competition bill and is keyed up to =
do well when the market really opens for all Jan 1.  Nye tells us he'll be =
active on behalf of EEI members and will be "accessible."
He expects "to lead the industry in those areas where we are collectively t=
ogether and hopefully compromise on those areas where we may have some diff=
erent views."=20
EEI has come a long way over the decade or so that we've been writing about=
 it.=20
How does Nye perceive that difference?
He finds Tom Kuhn and staff sensitive to changes in the industry and in the=
 views of members, Nye replied.
"The industry is obviously going through a remarkable transition ... and ge=
nerally speaking it's all positive, positive for the nation, for the consum=
ers and for our shareholders," Nye observed of the growing competition.
EEI has been "very progressive in moving staff into the areas that are more=
 important and in reducing efforts in those areas that are less important, =
less valuable to the membership and being responsive, he added.
Nye has seen large members drop out of EEI - especially in California where=
 some members have said:
"We've sold the generation and are not doing marketing, so EEI isn't quite =
the organization for us."
The association has set up a dues structure to lure transmission only and g=
eneration only companies.=20
Does Nye see the investor-owned electric utilities breaking up over the yea=
rs to come?
He expects various firms to take different paths --  with "some disaggregat=
ion of the traditional integrated form."
Nye knows EEI members represent a spectrum of views but views can be consis=
tent if not identical.=20
EEI members have always had differences based on differing business plans a=
nd asset configurations.
But the industry has "an absolute need for an industry association to repre=
sent those critical views.
"At the end of the day we all recognize that we have much in common and the=
refore we need to speak collectively and with one voice," Nye added.
Tauzin's attempt at
Calif price cap
compromise fails
---
Barton drops action
on Calif help bill
House Energy & Commerce Committee, Billy Tauzin, R-La, was to bring his hig=
hly divided committee back together this morning to win support for HR 1647=
, the Electricity Emergency Relief Act to help California.=20
The measure has been blocked by partisan differences on wholesale price con=
trols.  Thus, Tauzin canceled the meeting before it started.
A bit later Joe Barton, R-Tex, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy & Air=
 Quality, announced a switch in strategy, dropping the subcommittee-adopted=
 measure.=20
The Democrats assumption of power in the Senate may have been a key factor =
in his decision since Chairman Jeff Bingagman, D-NM, could prevent action o=
n the bill Barton had gotten through his subcommittee.=20
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt has been chilly to the bill without price =
controls.  Some provisions have been adopted by the feds and the California=
 government, Barton added, citing fixing Path 15, boosting financial help f=
or the poor and better treatment of QFs.=20
Barton opined that by the time he could get a compromise adopted it would b=
e too late for any benefit this summer.=20
His strategy now is to focus on the longterm provisions in the Bush nationa=
l energy policy.
Bingaman, the new Democratic chairman of the Energy & Natural Resources Com=
mittee, intends to block the Bush energy and environment program and start =
afresh.=20
Bingaman is hotly in favor of wholesale energy price caps in California and=
 is co-sponsor of a bill to impose them.
But he cautions that he'd rather see FERC put them in place.  Bingaman is c=
autious about Bush's interest in easing regulations on power plants.
He has introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming.
The 57-year-old Senator says he's going to try to sit with Republicans and =
work out some middle ground.=20
He's already reportedly made some progress on renewables, wind power and en=
ergy production tax credits.
Can we double energy
efficiency by 2010?
The Assn of Energy Engineers (AEE) favors a comprehensive energy technology=
 strategy and the one they want could double the energy efficiency of build=
ings by 2010, slash carbon emissions in half, and save $100 billion a year,=
 said Albert Thumann, the group's executive director.
You can see their energy policy at www.aeecenter.org.
AEE asked its 8,000 members whether the administration's national energy po=
licy would encourage new supply and 98% said it should.
Then 69% said environmental regulations shouldn't be eased to build new pla=
nts, though.
While 75% of the non-profit's members felt nuclear power should be encourag=
ed, the report criticized the Bush plan for not promoting conservation and =
energy efficiency.
The White House energy plan cuts R&D funding for energy efficiency technolo=
gies by $160 million and relies heavily on oil and gas exploration and buil=
ding new power generation stations at the expense of the environment, AEE s=
aid.
Tauzin pictures
wide-spread
blackouts
Rep Billy Tauzin, chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee dramatically =
warned EEI of a looming energy crisis larger than almost anyone's envisione=
d so far.
The entire US may be in for California-scale blackouts if natural gas produ=
ction isn't increased and new electric plants aren't built fast.
The country is "very close" to the beginning of a national energy crisis th=
at endangers, among other things, the nation's high-tech infrastructure.
He echoed dire warnings sounded earlier by the administration, saying that =
the country needs "1,300 to 1,900" new power plants just to stay even with =
a projected 45% rise in electric demand over the next two decades.
Democratic Sen Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said she's bullish on continued e=
nergy deregulation in the states, despite California's woes.
She called for new investment in renewable energy.  An advocate of nuclear =
power, she expressed disappointment of incoming Democratic Senate leaders w=
ho oppose the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository.
Use DG as risk
management tool?
XENERGY sees distributed generation as a growing risk management tool, a sa=
fety net to protect against wholesale price spikes, rolling blackouts and i=
ntermittent power quality issues.  They really studied DG to the point wher=
e they're selling the study for $10,000.=20
It's Distributed Power Technology Markets 2000.  It lists barriers to the n=
ew technology such as inability of some customers to get into load manageme=
nt programs, lack of understanding of load management benefits, lack of nee=
ded metering.
With it comes a database of 100 companies with interests in DG and load man=
agement, including utilities, manufacturers, technology companies and other=
s.  Contact is Francis Cummings at 781-273-5700.
PG&E gets time to
negotiate deals
with QF creditors
Judge Dennis Montali has granted Calpine's request to postpone until July 5=
 a hearing to decide whether the state's largest QF generator can be releas=
ed from its contract with Pacific Gas & Electric so it can sell at market p=
rices.=20
PG&E has three weeks to negotiate QF contracts before the federal bankruptc=
y judge decides whether to let small generators out of their long-term cont=
racts at prices that once were above market but now are below.
Bankruptcy law provides for the bankrupt to review its contracts and persua=
de the judge to let it do what it would like to do with each.
PG&E has thousands of contracts.  If the utility keeps the contract, it fac=
es paying the QF a court approved amount going forward and a settlement on =
past debts.=20
The total owed may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Montali deni=
ed a QF creditor's committee motion for an immediate decision.
Avoiding cascading
failure at TVA
If the security grid coordinators around the country can't share informatio=
n about what's happening on the transmission networks, congestion problems =
will worsen, predicted Vikram Budhraja, CEO of Electric Power Group.
One of the most seriously congested pathway in America last summer was disc=
overed running north to south through TVA.
Over 1,000 transactions were cancelled from May to September last year and =
even more are expected this year.
If that load isn't controlled, Budhraja warned the eastern interconnection =
is vulnerable to a cascading network failure.=20
Budhraja chairs CERTS (Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solut=
ions) and the group has just put the finishing touches on software that can=
 track congestion on the TVA path and NERC will be installing it within the=
 next few days.
The 1996 WSCC outage could have been prevented if information had been trad=
ed between control areas better, he said.=20
Murkowski vows to
fight electricity
price caps policy
It was Frank Murkowski's last day as chairman -- for now -- of the Energy &=
 Natural Resources Committee.
His final message as the chairman yesterday was that the minority Republica=
ns will not supports caps for electricity prices in California.
The Alaska Republican may now seem to fade into the background but for all =
we know, control of the Senate may bounce back and forth as members come an=
d go during this session of Congress.=20
Republicans, vowed Murkowski, will fight any effort to include price contro=
ls in the comprehensive energy policy engendered by the president and now b=
eing hashed out in committee.=20
Sen Jeff Bingaman, D-NM, the incoming chairman, will allow dozens of new am=
endments to come before the committee, prompting Murkowski to call the Demo=
crats approach to an energy policy "piecemeal."=20
Democrats don't plan to boost production.
For Murkowski that's a mistake made in the 1992 Energy Policy Act and an er=
ror in judgement about to be repeated, Murkowski argued.=20
The elements pushing production were stricken from the 1992 law but mandati=
ng low flush toilets did get included, the senator reminded.=20
Bush's energy plan had "a lack of balance'' with not enough emphasis promot=
ing conservation, energy efficiency and development of renewable wind, sola=
r and geothermal energy sources, Democrats charged Monday.
The majority members don't want to deal with the nuclear waste issue and th=
at kills any hope to spur new nuclear plant construction, Murkowski groused=
.
Setting the tone for the new committee makeup, the ex-chairman passionately=
 argued against wholesale price caps claiming they nix new investment by se=
verely limiting return on investment.  If the controls are high enough -- l=
ike a $1,000 -- maybe that would be acceptable but nothing as low as what t=
he Democrats want, he said.
Now that the "Bush FERC" is in place, Congress isn't needed to tinker with =
price controls, he concluded.=20
The current energy bill is a good legacy for Chairman Bingaman to use in cr=
afting "meaningful" legislation, Murkowski suggested.=20
Texas residents
may be staying away from electric choice.  IOUs have signed up only about 6=
0,000 residentials so far while 265,000 are eligible for the pilot.  Busine=
ss customers have flocked into the pilot totaling 839,053 of an eligible 1,=
329,259 -- 63%.
Selling stable prices
works for NewPower
in California
Yes, the California market is open for retail gas competition.  It's been o=
pen for maybe a decade but few have found the market attractive until now.=
=20
NewPower is going in selling a two-year fixed price package that really app=
eals in today's world of price spiking.=20
The fixed price insulates customers from price spikes in the volatile Calif=
ornia marketplace.
NewPower's Terry Cohen relates that the firm expects to sign up 16,000 cust=
omers.  They'll have the opportunity to lock in gas at 98? a therm, compare=
d to an average PG&E price last January of $1.40 a therm.
The LDCs change their price monthly with a filing to the PUC=20
based on what their costs have been.
NewPower's deal is available to retail customers in 37 northern California =
counties, including San Francisco and Sacramento.
Before the announcement, New Power already had 600,000 gas and electric cus=
tomers in 19 markets.=20
5 stories in 1 minute:
Pat Wood to chair
FERC now:  Patrick Henry Wood was sworn in as a FERC member in Texas yester=
day.  Vice President Dick Cheney told Fortune magazine that Wood will be de=
signated chairman by the president.=20
Gas competition
ends in Wisc:  Wisconsin Gas found out what it wanted to know about retail =
competition by way of a five-year pilot program and is now going back to be=
ing a conventional regulated monopoly.  The 1,838 residentials and 1,647 co=
mmercial customers revert to the utility after having been served at one po=
int by nine suppliers and now four as the program ends.  The biggest findin=
g we assume was that you lose customers.  Costs of the program were subsidi=
zed.  Had they been passed on to consumers, prices would have been higher, =
the gas company figures, and we seriously question.
Mark Dempsey has been named West Virginia president for American Electric P=
ower. The former AEP public policy vice president has been with AEP for 25 =
years.
Energy views cost
Bush bigtime:  Voter doubts over President Bush's environmental and energy =
policies is hurting his approval rating, down eight points to 55% in May. H=
