I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you and I
didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first half
to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
stripper to go back to your place with you?

Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
8:00p.

Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are staying
here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel
