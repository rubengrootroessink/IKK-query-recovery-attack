RB SEA - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected t=
o miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of=
 many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He shou=
ld roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB =
NE - The Executioners Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=
or now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any =
changes ! th! is week," coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy=
 starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy i=
f you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may=
 have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brune=
ll's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - N=
orth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficient=
ly healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not ex=
pected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander wi=
ll continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason =
comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 M=
ike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy invol=
ving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," h=
e said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none wit=
hin this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the=
 next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to sati=
sfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injur=
y. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener=
 is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone=
 Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra=
-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to=
 play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/! 01!  K=
inney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected =
to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd=
 Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice th=
is week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - North=
 Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was so=
re when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher n=
ow says he doesn't expect him to miss any prac! ti! ce time this week.   De=
rrick Alexander , WR KC - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) =
has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin =
Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is =
listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his=
 place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Meximullets Updated! 1! 1/20/01 Wayne has =
a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orl=
eans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR =
IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. =
He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, mea=
ning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.=
   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told =
the Miami Herald there is no QB con! tr! oversy surrounding Fielder and bac=
kup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the s=
tarter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play =
turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - oops, I did it again Update=
d 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be suf=
ficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get=
 a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denv=
er Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situat=
ion where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, th=
en we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - =
Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won=
't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get hi=
m involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett =
, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury l=
ast weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia.=
 However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this p=
oint.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setba=
cks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffer=
ed a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effe=
cts of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gree=
n , WR TB - The Guzzlers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to re=
turn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this=
 season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , =
WR SF - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee an=
d ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina=
. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to=
 be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI =
- One Man Show Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during S=
unday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expe=
cted to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real =
value as a Fantasy playe! r,! but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    G=
iants , DT NYG - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/20/01 According to the N=
ew York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee bega=
n giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure=
 that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday nigh=
t, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should=
 consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   =
Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun =
says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's start=
ing QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy t=
eams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still =
dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game agains=
t Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at thi=
s point.    Ravens , DT BAL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end =
Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surg=
ery. ! Hi! s loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore def=
ense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    C=
owboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, wh=
o was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get th=
e start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denv=
er's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' d=
efense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - The Snake =
Pit Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Den=
ver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told=
 the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due =
to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. =
    Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Meximullets Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bru=
ised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some prac=
tice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta=
. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could t=
urn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after =
missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to p=
lay on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Co=
