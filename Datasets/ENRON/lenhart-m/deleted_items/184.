   no, that's wrong.  you just kept saying one rude thing after another
   which
   bothered me.  it doesn't matter.  the point is that it should not be so
   difficult for you to not be rude.

    only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you
   wouldn't
   let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just
   venting
   frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober.

      i only rolled back over once.  i said i was sorry for saying i wished
      you
      were dead, i was just kidding, and i wouldn't have to vent for so
   long
      if
      you wouldn't give me reasons to.  some of the things you said last
   night
      were pretty rude.

      you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who
   said
      you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.
   you
      were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours.

         i was not going nuts.  i was trying to go to sleep and you kept
      bringing
         it
         up.  you're nice, but you have an attitude.  very cocky.
