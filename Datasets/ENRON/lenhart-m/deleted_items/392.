 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs =
Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting h=
im on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go u=
p against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him out=
side of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt =
continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only th=
ree touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t! hi!=
 s weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his=
 potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart U=
pdated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, bu=
t he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law=
 and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting ba=
sed on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Nea=
l Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he =
is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every wee=
k, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Co=
nwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down wee=
ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the =
lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is =
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Hunt=
ley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 ! Hu! ntley will be the likely s=
tarter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he spl=
its carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at a=
ll possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had=
 only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been un=
reliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble. =
   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been =
held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better t=
ight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the=
 past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six =
passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past ag=
ainst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move=
.   Brett Favre , QB GB - The Klap Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of t=
he best F! an! tasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an A=
tlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start=
 Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Fran=
ks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight g=
ames makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option o=
n your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekl=
y basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankl=
e) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sund=
ay against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose seco=
ndary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Drough=
ns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time w=
ith Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's ab=
sence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and s=
tarting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart o=
n Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is o=
nly worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   Charlie Ba=
tch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Batch will again lose playing time to=
 Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will be the No. 2 QB again, but will see p=
laying time as the Lions continue to use two quarterbacks. As a result, you=
 may want to look for another signal-caller to start on your Fantasy team. =
   David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sloan is an unreliabl=
e tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for minus-2 yard performance=
 in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Sloan isn't adv=
isable.   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/01 Dayne has bee=
n a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He may score=
 a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fantasy own=
ers overall.   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Colli=
ns has been inconsistent this season, but the matchup this week! a! gainst =
Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 381 yards passing an=
d five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, and is worth taking=
 a chance on in Week 10.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/=
16/01 Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy numbers in certain games thi=
s season, but he's been inconsistent overall. However, facing a porous Minn=
esota secondary on Monday makes him worth considering in larger Fantasy lea=
gues.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Wycheck sat ou=
t practice Thursday to rest his injured ankle. He is listed as questionable=
 for Sunday's game. Don't expect him to be too reliable if he plays.   Ike =
Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Hilliard has caught th=
ree touchdowns in his last three games, so starting him against Minnesota i=
s advisable. The Vikings' secondary is questionable at best, so look for Hi=
lliard to be productive.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/16=
/01 Toomer could find some real success on Monday night against Minnesota. =
The Viking! s ! sport one of the worst secondaries in the league, so starti=
ng Toomer based on the matchup is a wise move.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - T=
he Klap Updated 11/16/01 Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will re=
main the starter in Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated =
that Olandis Gary would start in his place.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Bennett is expected to return to action after miss=
ing three game with a high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Do=
ug Chapman on Monday night against the Giants, making him a risky start on =
your Fantasy team.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/16/0=
1 Pathon (foot) is now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie =
Wayne should start in his place.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/16/01 Alexander (ankle) did not practice on Thursday, and is doub=
tful for Sunday's game against Denver. William ! Ra! sby and Zeron Flemiste=
r will likely split time at tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither p=
layer has any real Fantasy value.   Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 11/16=
/01 Linebacker Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday agains=
t Denver. "We wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective," Re=
dskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. "I think he'll =
be effective." He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle a few weeks=
 ago.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Wheatle=
y has strep throat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now questionable=
 for Sunday's game as he also makes his way back from a knee injury.   Eagl=
es , DT PHI - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed pr=
actice on Wednesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to p=
ractice, however, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dal=
las.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kinney missed pr=
actice Thursday and is not expected to play. He has been hindered by a calf=
 injury for over ! a ! month.  More Updates  NFL Reports, Transactions  [IM=
