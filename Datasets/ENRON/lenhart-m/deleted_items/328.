layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/=
21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptio=
ns was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six g=
ames this year and has become a major s! co! ring threat even though he is =
not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Wh=
o's Yo Daddy Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 =
yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for t=
he most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it=
 tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updated 10/21/01 G=
reen threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Gre=
en has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a sta=
rting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/21/=
01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbe=
rs were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been =
so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett can=
not stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat=
 Bastards Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posti=
ng seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the =
best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic=
hael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great ou=
ting on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and =
a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but =
he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD =
- oops, I did it again Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego o=
n Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver=
. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's cert=
ainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Executioners=
 Updated! 1! 0/21/01 Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this se=
ason by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on t=
he day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desm=
ond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Su=
nday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's =
been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so contin=
ue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Nice Machi=
ne Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st! ar! ted Sunday's game against San=
 Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown an=
d two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - The =
Executioners Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards agai=
nst Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, b=
ecause he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Who's=
 Yo Daddy Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 car=
ries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performanc=
e very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - One Man Show Updated 10/21/01 Ter=
rell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robin=
son injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago pas=
sing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/21/=
01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establi=
shing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured bac=
k for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nutwhacker=
s Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes fo! r ! 100 yards and a TD a=
t Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-not=
ch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receive=
r.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - The Guzzlers Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for=
 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batc=
h has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fa=
ntasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD =
and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, =
and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might =
be bothered by shoulder problem! s.!   Eddie George , RB TEN - Thrill Kill =
Cult Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit.=
 The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered hi=
s production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saint=
s. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect =
good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New =
Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder=
 of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - The Executioners Updated 10/21/01 C=
onnell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitel=
y time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - T=
he Fat Bastards Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving ya=
rds on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against t! he! lo=
w-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owne=
rs with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Thrill Kill Cult Up=
dated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. =
Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy=
 appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score =
in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/21/01 Dunn play=
ed despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was =
limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthon=
y Becht  , TE NYJ - The Nice Machine Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game=
 against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's =
been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numb=
ers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keysh=
awn Johnson , WR TB - The Lie Downs Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 pass=
es for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relat=
ionship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post h=
igh-quality numbers on a regular basis.  ! Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Who's Y=
o Daddy Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries=
 against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves=
 Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB =
STL - The Executioners Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against th=
e New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His rol=
e as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the =
health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Nice Machi=
ne Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches =
for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Mich=
ael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a r=
oster spot from a Fantasy perspective.   More Updates  View Transactions  [=
