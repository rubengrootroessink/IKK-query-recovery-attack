   I don't know if you've seen it yet, but one of the programmers that
   works
   for me burned me a copy of XP a couple of weeks ago . . . don't really
   know
   how he got his hands on it, but it's pretty cool . . . I have to upgrade
   my
   burner software due to compatibility issues . . . is your burner
   software
   Roxio?  If so, I need you to burn me a copy . . . I'll burn you a copy
   of
   XP if you're interested . . . the first 64 byte OS
