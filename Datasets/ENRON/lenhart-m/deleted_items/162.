I think I will be visiting Rhett in Turkey this year for New Years. It is
a camoflouge theme and they will be serving MRE's buffet style. Rhett will
be the guest of honor since he is the oldest peice of shit still in the
gaurd! Let me know who is in!

Naquin

I am out for Chateau Porteous, I would rather have a terrible time like I
always do for New Years without the $250.00 plus tuxedo overhead.
