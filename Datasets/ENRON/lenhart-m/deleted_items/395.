 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Michael Vick , QB ATL - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/16/01 Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against =
Green Bay. He may see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not=
 worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him vi=
rtaully worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper le=
ague, continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting! n! od.  =
 Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kelly is doubtful for =
Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury. He'll be replaced by =
Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from Kelly from this poin=
t on.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Martin hasn't be=
en a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't change this week=
end against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass defense, so star=
ting Martin isn't advisable.    Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15=
/01 According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starti=
ng spor this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike Ande=
rson.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/15/01 According to pub=
lished reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday. There is still no o=
ffical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.  James Stewart ,! R! B DET - H=
unter Updated 11/15/01 Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. =
He may miss Sunday's game against the Cardinals.   Edgerrin James , RB IND =
- JWillie Updated 11/15/01 According to published reports, it has been conf=
irmed that James will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. He wi=
ll need surgery to repair a torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for t=
he rest of the year, and Kevin McDougal should be his backup.  Jeff Graham =
, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Graham may post good numbers at Oakla=
nd. San Diego will look to the air often if the Raiders concentrate on stop=
ping the run.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Tomlin=
son may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will be fi=
red up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.  Jerry Ri=
ce , WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/15/01 Rice has not helped his Fantasy o=
wners much in recent weeks. But he is still worth a start against the incon=
sistent San Diego secondary. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 B=
rown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his b=
est in intradivisional matchups.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated=
 11/15/01 Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. A returning Tyro=
ne Wheatley will steal some of his carries against the tough San Diego run =
defense.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles  Updated 11/15/01 Wheatley is =
now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He is a risky s=
tart because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the San Diego def=
ense.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01 Gannon should rebound=
 from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an important home game with San =
Diego.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Gary was inactive fo=
r the last two games, but he will now see carries again because Terrell Dav=
is is inj! ur! ed. He still may not play enough to help most Fantasy teams.=
  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Clark will continue =
to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB will now lean heavily=
 on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have crippled the Broncos a=
t wideout.  Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Expect C=
arswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries at WR w=
ill make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.  Donovan McNabb=
 , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/15/01 McNabb had a huge game against Minneso=
ta last weekend, and should have more success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a t=
op-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of a weekly spot in your starting lineu=
p.   Freddie Mitchell , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Mitchell sprai=
ned his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this weekend against Dal=
las. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with a few more good ou=
tings, and is worth stashing away on your roster.   Keith Poole , WR DEN - =
Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for th=
e Broncos this week. Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole=
 into extra playing time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in t=
he past, so don't use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's =
passing game.  Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Pinkston ha=
s fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start to the seaso=
n. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't even worth a =
roster spot at this point.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15=
/01 Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one=
 of the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dall=
as earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10.   James Thrash , =
WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/15/01 Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in =
his last two games, and is worth starting this week against Dallas. He may =
be inconsistent at times, but when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting=
 up solid Fantasy numbers.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 11/15/01=
 Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by in=
juries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers downf=
ield.  Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01 Galloway was te=
rrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan Leaf's inability t=
o get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in a deeper league, G=
alloway isn't worth starting in Week 10.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/15/01 Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown=
 last weekend, but he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deepe=
r Fantasy league, Harris isn't worth a roster spot.   Darrell Jackson , WR =
SEA - Hunter Updated 11/15/01 Jackson has performed well this season, and h=
e is a good start again this week. Expect him to challenge the Buffalo seco=
ndary throughout the day.  Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/1=
5/01 Ismail has been Dallas' most reliable reciever this season, which isn'=
t saying much. Unless you play in a very deep league, the "Rocket" is bette=
r left on the waiver wire.   Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/=
15/01 Alexander should have another standout game at Buffalo. It is doubtfu=
l the Bills' defense will be able to handle him, and he should be good for =
100-plus yards and at least one TD.  More Updates   NFL Reports, Transactio=
