, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams du=
ring their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers agai=
nst the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain th=
e team's No. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach B! il! l Beli=
chick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to =
your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell=
 (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday=
's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder=
 has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle T=
imes . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning=
 Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams=
 as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated=
 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB contro=
versy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quar=
terback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there =
is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will=
 get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enou=
ght to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing sho=
ulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, beca=
use Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in footba=
ll.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley t=
old the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury.=
 He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated =
11/20/01! Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He wa=
s expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice thi=
s week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks =
Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived=
 at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't=
 expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR K=
C - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practic=
e. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's gam=
e. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doub=
tful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to st=
art in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 =
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Re=
ggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to b=
e moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal =
Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB contro=
versy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray ri! gh! t now. ``That's kind of hy=
pothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're g=
oing to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith ,=
 WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smit=
h (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against th=
e Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," S=
hanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play=
. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think =
can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in."   Ben=
jamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer=
 says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future.=
 "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll s=
ee."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who su=
ffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday =
against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fan=
tasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updat! ed! =
11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Phila=
delphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't b=
een feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for =
the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 11/20/01 Green=
 (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength.=
 He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is f=
avorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/20/01 Owens su=
ffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last w=
eekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, how=
ever, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianap=
olis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered=
 a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few d=
ays of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Was=
hington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key bloc=
ker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Upd! at! ed 11/20/01 A=
ccording to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaire=
d right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, th=
e team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Cart=
er on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad =
wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest =
of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 The Balt=
imore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the te=
am's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most=
 Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver=
 is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's g=
ame against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy pla=
yer at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Defensiv=
e end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing kne=
e surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore d=
efense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.   =
 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, =
who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get =
the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep De=
nver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas'=
 defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Up=
dated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. "=
I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told the D=
allas Morning Star . He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Da=
llas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     D=
onald Hayes , WR CAR - Eric Bass Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ri=
bs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice ti=
me this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The F=
alcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn int=
o a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return t! o! practice this week after miss=
ing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play =
on Sunday against San Diego.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis=
