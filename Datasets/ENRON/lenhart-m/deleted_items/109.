Please forward to Suzanne as well.  Will you review this spreadsheet for April penalties associated with Texaco?  The volumes and prices did not look correct to me.  Let me know and I will have Anne change the value.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the possible penalties we will be charging on the six PG&E Topock April Baseload load purchases that were severely cut throughout the month.  If we use the Gas Daily High Price plus $0.15, then the total penalties will be $2,032,902, but if we use the methodology described in the contract (Gas Daily), the total penalties will be $889,377.

I spoke to Phillip while you were out to see which method we should use. He said to wait until you returned.  I also verified with Darron that from a settlements perspective, we can send penalty invoices at any time.  Let's discuss when you return.  I have copies of all of the pertinent information.

Thanks

Anne
