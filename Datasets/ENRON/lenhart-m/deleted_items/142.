I got a response on the same day you sent it to them.  I think it is automatically generated.  Thanks again for passing it on.  I will be busting my ass to find a job after my vacation and will be much more proactive.  It's hard to try too hard knowing you will be out of the country for two weeks.   I will keep you posted.  I will have access to this shitty email account overseas.  Talk to you later.  By the way, this is what they sent me.

   Matt,
   To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing
   independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability
   is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me
   get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My
   resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.

   P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure
   how I feel about that.
