 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill K=
ill Cult Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so s=
tarting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. H=
e'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid usin=
g him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's on=
ly scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New ! En! g=
land secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy =
team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL=
 - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy total=
s this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'=
ll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still =
worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , R=
B STL - oops, I did it again Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against=
 Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. =
He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 agai=
nst New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/=
01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team i=
s somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the leag=
ue, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no=
 choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - The Fat Bastards Updated 11=
/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisc=
o, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid star=
ting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - M=
eximullets Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last we=
ekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this seaso=
n, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Snake P=
it Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks,=
 but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some s=
uccess against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   M=
uhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad fin=
ally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards again=
st St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponen=
t, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB -=
 The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Favre h! as! been one of the best Fantas=
y quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sun=
day with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week. =
  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put=
 up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him=
 a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster,=
 Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bi=
ll Schroeder , WR GB - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankl=
e) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sund=
ay against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose seco=
ndary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Drough=
ns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time w=
ith Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's ab=
sence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and s=
tarting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Update=
d 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart o=
n Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is o=
nly worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   Charlie Ba=
tch , QB DET - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/01 Batch will again lose playing =
time to Mike McMahon this week. McMahon will be the No. 2 QB again, but wil=
l see playing time as the Lions continue to use two quarterbacks. As a resu=
lt, you may want to look for another signal-caller to start on your Fantasy=
 team.    David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/01 Sloan is an=
 unreliable tight end, which was proven in his one-catch for minus-2 yard p=
erformance in Week Nine. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Sloan=
 isn't advisable.   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/16/=
01 Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent wee=
ks. He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick=
 for Fantasy owners overall.   Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Who's Yo Daddy Upda=
ted 11/16/01 Collins has been inconsisten! t ! this season, but the matchup=
 this week against Minnesota is very favorable. He lit up the Vikings for 3=
81 yards passing and five touchdowns in last year's NFC Championship game, =
and is worth taking a chance on in Week 10.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Thr=
ill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/01 Jurevicius has put up some solid Fantasy num=
bers in certain games this season, but he's been inconsistent overall. Howe=
ver, facing a porous Minnesota secondary on Monday makes him worth consider=
ing in larger Fantasy leagues.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - North Blvd Nutwha=
ckers Updated 11/16/01 Wycheck sat out practice Thursday to rest his injure=
d ankle. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Don't expect him t=
o be too reliable if he plays.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - oops, I did it aga=
in Updated 11/16/01 Hilliard has caught three touchdowns in his last three =
games, so starting him against Minnesota is advisable. The Vikings' seconda=
ry is questionable at best, so look for Hilliard to be productive.   Amani =
Toomer , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/01 Toomer could find some =
real success on Monday night aga! in! st Minnesota. The Vikings sport one o=
f the worst secondaries in the league, so starting Toomer based on the matc=
hup is a wise move.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 11/16/0=
1 Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in Den=
ver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would=
 start in his place.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 1=
1/16/01 Bennett is expected to return to action after missing three game wi=
th a high ankle sprain. He'll likely split carries with Doug Chapman on Mon=
day night against the Giants, making him a risky start on your Fantasy team=
.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/01 Pathon (foot) i=
s now listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Rookie Reggie Wayne should star=
t in his place.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 A=
lexander (ankle) did not practice on Thursday, and is doubtful for Sunday's=
 game against Denver. Willia! m ! Rasby and Zeron Flemister will likely spl=
it time at tight end in Alexander's absence, but neither player has any rea=
l Fantasy value.   Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Lineback=
er Lavar Arrington (ankle) is expected to play on Sunday against Denver. "W=
e wouldn't play him if we thought he wouldn't be effective," Redskins Coach=
 Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. "I think he'll be effective=
." He suffered the injury in a game against Seattle a few weeks ago.   Tyro=
ne Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 11/16/01  Wheatley has strep th=
roat, and missed practice on Thursday. He is now questionable for Sunday's =
game as he also makes his way back from a knee injury.   Eagles , DT PHI - =
One Man Show Updated 11/16/01 Cornerback Bobby Taylor missed practice on We=
dnesday with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to return to practice, how=
ever, and should be ready in time for Sunday's game against Dallas.   Erron=
 Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Kinney missed practice Thurs=
