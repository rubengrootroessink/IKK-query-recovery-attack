what's his new job . . . table cloth ironer?  Kennison turned out to be a
real disaster.  I'm beginning to think that many of our recent free agents
are turning out to be other team's trash.  I guess the Tractor Traylor is
not washed up, and he's a big reason why Chicago has turned it around.
Though he did get on Shanny's bad side during Pryce's holdout with some
things he said.  We used to have this guy named Shannon Sharpe.  He's pretty
good too.  If only i could say fuck it all and just  go skiing, but it's
been 70 degrees here for 5 weeks.  It's time Shanny hires me to help him
out.
