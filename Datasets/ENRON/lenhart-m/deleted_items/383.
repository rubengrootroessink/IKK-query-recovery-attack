 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilita! te! =
with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work to=
ward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - =
Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game w=
ith the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.=
 Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is e=
xpected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a =
risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Upda=
ted 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against=
 Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individ=
ual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play de=
spite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a resul=
t.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Smit! h ! will return to=
 the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a spra=
ined right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice=
 that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return b=
umps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either ba=
ck against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja U=
pdated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on F=
riday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit. =
 However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league t=
his week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth =
considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free A=
gent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the st=
arting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's n=
ot worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunte=
r Shively Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season =
despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's on=
e of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and =
should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN=
 - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this=
 season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has=
 a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rook=
ie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , =
WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Mon=
day's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been undera=
chieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his =
potential to post solid Fantasy num! be! rs.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the=
 league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an India=
napolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams i=
s a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Broo=
ks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yard=
s and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potenti=
al to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a v=
ulne! ra! ble Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last week=
end, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable =
Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting J=
ackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart=
 Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season =
slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is on=
ce again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week =
10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Ton=
y Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of l=
ate, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matc=
hup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, =
but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Wes=
tbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsiste=
nt this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four g=
ames. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best=
, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , W=
R WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his l=
ast two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favo=
rable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a go=
od move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has be=
en inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a =
gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England=
 secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Tor=
ry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consisten=
t yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. H=
e'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth =
starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid number=
s.   Isaac Br! uc!  , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't p=
ut up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better=
 wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New Englan=
d secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big n=
umbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a=
 huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy play=
er in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbe=
rs in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie! C! onwell  , TE STL - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on you=
r Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end=
 around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy own=
ers will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent =
Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against Sa=
n Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. =
Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , =
WR ! CA! R - Eric Bass Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 y=
ards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owner=
s this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR -=
 Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the las=
t three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. H=
e's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is =
advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad fina=
lly had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards agains=
t St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent=
, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - =
The Klap Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbac=
ks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a v=
ery vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Fran=
ks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage=
 numbers,! b! ut his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable F=
antasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is th=
e type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder =
, WR GB - Rocks Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL=
 injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a =
solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to stro=
