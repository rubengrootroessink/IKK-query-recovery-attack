o back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennesse=
an . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team an=
d won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB =
OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday b=
ecause of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Con=

1   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired foot, acc=
ording to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Giants gam=
e against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep an eye =
on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidelines if =
it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   J=
ones' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida=
 Times-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury=

k a lot of snaps in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the t=
hird-down back, according to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have mu=

urn from his hamstring injury sooner than what was originally expected, acc=
ording to published reports. He might begin practicing next week and will a=
lmost certainly be activated before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis =
has been sidelined since August because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless,=
 he will be the No. 2 tight end when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL =
- Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/25/01   Grbac will likely be a game-time deci=
sion for Sunday's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . He threw very litt=
le in practice and is still suffering from a sore chest. Randall Cunningham=
 will start if Grbac is unable to play.      Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Meximul=
lets Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis in his left Achil=
les tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed practice Wednesday=
 but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR ATL - The Snake P=
it Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resume=
 their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games =
because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution reports=
 that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity =
 , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, =
who was released by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used =
mostly on returns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' re=
gular rotation of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL - The Snake Pit Updat=
ed 10/25/01   Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kick=
ing off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published rep=

eve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Met=

ed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be used mostly as a returner and has minim=

25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fractur=
e and other structural damage to his right foot. "He's not going to be real=
ly ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer," =
coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "Basically, it just separated," Seifer=
t said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. "The ligaments, tendons and b=
one broke, so it all had to be put back together." Richard Huntley, who wil=
l replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the h=
ospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and=
 he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.        James Stewart  , RB DE=
T - The Lie Downs Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on Sunday a=
gainst the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury ha=
s now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  =
, WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' to=
p receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was =
hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday=
 and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive =
week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' =
win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards describe=
d Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be ext=
ra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=
 and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his a=
bsence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrel=
l Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors th=
at he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the seaso=
n. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday," Davis said=
. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted th=
at his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the =
scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as t=
he Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. =
Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother =
to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        =
Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterba=
ck Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right k=
nee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would s=
tart ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in y=
our starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player f=
rom Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three gam=
es, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two app=
earances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right kn=
ee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright e=
xpected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't=
 make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona =
game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan =
Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chan=
ce that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't b=
een with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell =
Davis  , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/24/01   Davis is sufficiently heal=
ed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems an=
d will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress=
 fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderso=
n will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which see=
ms unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - The Fat B=
astards Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be =
benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if=
 Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against th=
e Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Ji=
m Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayn=
e Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss S=
unday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described=
 Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted to be extr=
a cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests=
 and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-yea=
r-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the pas=
t year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one =
catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be r=
e-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Mo=
