al Members:     [IMAGE] Market Comment [IMAGE]  We are in a very listless m=
arket right now. The NASDAQ has given back the 300 point gain it enjoyed fr=
om the last 1/2 point surprise rate cut from the FED. Every time the NASDAQ=
 looks at 2000, it runs back up like a hooked fish when it first sees the f=
isherman's boat. Many technicians believe the NASDAQ needs to trade into th=
e 1900 to 1950 range before it can move on to higher ground.   Microcaps ar=
e drifting down on light volume, reaching low risk entry points which will =
seem cheap when the next volume surge takes them back up. We are entering E=
arnings Pre-Warning season, a new 21st century phenomenon created by our li=
tigious society.   Many fund managers are waiting to pounce on beaten down =
technology stocks as they sell off when earnings warnings are issued. Every=
one's buying cheap now, positioning for what might be one of the most proli=
fic 4th quarters of all time in stocks.   Now would be a great time to revi=
ew the trading strategies for accumulating on dips we shared with you in ou=
r May 12th edition . Click Here , and read the first section.   Two of our =
featured companies have been in the news this week, and here's an update fo=
r you on both:      [IMAGE] XML Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Featured=
 in Investor's Business Daily   Thusday, May 12th's edition of the venerabl=
e Investor's Business Daily carried an article in the Internet & Technology=
 Section, authored by Sarah Z. Sleeper entitled "U.N Group OKs 'Language' T=
hat Could Spur E-Business".   The article mentions that the U.N.'s group OA=
SIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) =
has announced the specific International standards for programming with ebX=
ML.   Long term readers know one of our featured companies, XML Global Tech=
nologies has been developing programming tools for this new and revolutiona=
ry programming language which is expected to become the new International S=
tandard by which all computer systems communicate with each other.   XML Gl=
obal is mentioned in the article along with Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Orac=
le. Here are several excerpts:   "With little fanfare, the e-conomy receive=
d what might prove to have been a pretty good jolt."  (first paragraph) "It=
's backed (ebXML) by a bevy of tech heavy-hitters. They include Sun Microsy=
stems, Inc., IBM Corp. and Oracle Corp." (5th paragraph) "The biggest win i=
s going to be for the average consumer, said David Weber, as vice president=
 at Vancouver B.C.- based software firm XML Global Technologies, Inc. EbXML=
 will reduce costs for companies." (11th paragraph)  The article goes on to=
 describe recent international demonstrations of the product where XML Glob=
al participated along with Bea Systems, Commerce One, and Sun Microsystems.=
   Clearly XML Global Technologies has placed itself directly in the path o=
n an oncoming tidal wave of new programming opportunities, and is the David=
 in a team of Goliaths headed towards the adoption of ebXML.    Rarely are =
microcap stocks prominently mentioned in the company of such huge success s=
tories. XML Global has a tiger by the tail.   The stock has drifted back on=
 light volume to the $.90 range. You should have a look at it down here.   =

it of our members. We may have it in PDF Format by the middle of next week.=

Investors should note that the company's sales were up 57% over the same qu=
arter the previous year to $20,430,030. Real, after tax cash earnings incre=
ased 49% to $1,282,121. EPS stays the same due primarily to non-cash expens=
es. The accounting standards for these non-cash expenses are changing this =
summer to accurately reflect the company's financial performance.   The edi=
tors of the OTC Journal continue to believe this stock is worth $5 per shar=
e US. Yet, it continues to languish in the high $2 range due to complete la=
ck of sponsorship from Wall Street. The OTC Journal is the only substantive=
 forum for investment ideas that follows this company.   Now that the marke=
t is turning, management recognizes it is time to go to Wall Street and pre=
sent itself to the institutional community if it ever hopes to create a sig=
nificant result on behalf of long suffering shareholders.   Patience should=
 pay off for investors. Wall Street will eventually discover this company b=
ecause Wall Street loves profits again. This is a low risk growth stock to =
accumulate on dips. Their history of profitability mitigates many of the ri=
sk factors associated with micro cap investing, and investors will eventual=
ly come along that want this stock.    The OTC Journal is a proud partner o=
