 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Moss made his pro debut on Sunday, but did not catch a pa=
ss and was stopped for a six-yard loss on his one carry. The rookie has mis=
sed too much time to make a Fantasy impact this season.   Richard Huntley ,=
 RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Huntley actually had a good outing ag=
ainst San Francisco, posting 94 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. However, h=
e's far too inconsistent to start on a weekly basis.  ! Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Weinke started Sunday's game against San F=
rancisco after missing last week's game due to a shoulder injury. He put up=
 decent numbers, throwing for 177 yards and two touchdowns in Carolina's 25=
-22 OT loss.   Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/18/01 Chrebet did n=
ot catch a pass at Miami. The Jets' wideout is no longer worthy of a starti=
ng spot on Fantasy teams.   Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11=
/18/01 Hearst had another strong game, posting 113 scrimmage yards against =
Carolina. His comeback from a serious ankle condition is nothing short of m=
iraculous, and he's actually been a reliable Fantasy player over the last t=
wo weeks.   Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Van Pelt t=
hrew for 316 yards, two TDs and no interceptions against the Seahawks. He d=
id lose a fumble, but Van Pelt got solid protection for most of the game an=
d will be a respectable Fantasy backup while he fills in for the injured Ro=
b Johnson.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/18/01 Garcia had=
 another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns against Carolina=
. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this season, and may =
even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point.   Peerless Price ,=
 WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/01 Price caught 10 passes for 138 yard=
s and a TD against Seattle. He has clearly become Buffalo's best Fantasy pl=
ayer this season.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent  Updated 11/18/01 =
Hasselbeck threw for 134 yards, one TD and no interceptions at Buffalo. The=
 Seattle QB is making less mistakes, yet he doesn't help Fantasy teams much=
, either.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Kitna put up 23=
4 yards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two interceptions ma=
de his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player a=
t this point, best used when the matchup is right in a deeper league.   Kor=
en Robinson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two pass=
es for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. =
Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not produce enough to be a rel=
iable Fantasy player.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/18/0=
1 Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunda=
y. However, with all the injured running backs around the league this seaso=
n, Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.   Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- Rocks Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 1=
72 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantas=
y player this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right.=
   Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive on=
ce again, posting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati. He =
just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge Fant=
asy disappointment.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for ! 12! 0 yards and a touchdow=
n against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player=
, and is a must-start ever week.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Update=
d 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing fo=
r 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games,=
 and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was c=
apable of.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/18/01 Man=
ning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and=
 a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, bu=
t he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching.   Marcus Pollard ,=
 TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Pollard had a huge game on Sunday, ca=
tching three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He m=
ay not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end dep=
th around the league makes him a valuable commodity.   Donovan McNabb , QB =
PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compili=
ng only 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the med=
iocre performance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in =
the league.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was hor=
rible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two in=
terceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas =
fell to Philadelphia, 36-3.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/18/0=
1 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an =
apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day w=
ith 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuyk=
endall Updated 11/18/01 Wheatley (knee) had been declared inactive for Sund=
ay's game against San Diego. Zack Crockett will spell starter Charlie Garne=
r in Wheatley's absence.   Tim Dwight , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01=
 Dwight (lung) was declared inactive for Sunday's game against Oakland.  Fr=
eddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Jones (ankle) has been dec=
lared inactive for Sunday's game. He has been advised not to play for two w=
eeks.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin=
) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Stacey M=
ack will make the start in his absence, with Elvis Joseph seeing some actio=
n as well.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs! Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (qu=
adriceps) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. Jonathan Quinn will=
 start in his place.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/18/0=
1 Cleeland (ankle) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Ind=
ianapolis. Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time at tight end in his=
 absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 White (ankle) =
will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much against the Tampa Bay de=
fense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankl=
e) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against the Ravens. =
  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/18/01 McNair will start Sunday's=
 game against Cincinnati as long after taking pre-game snaps without any pr=
oblems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb injury, isn't worth starting on=
