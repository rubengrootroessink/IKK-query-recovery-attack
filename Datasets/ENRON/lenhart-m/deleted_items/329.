layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0=
1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w=
as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=
 this year and has become a major scoring! t! hreat even though he is not v=
ery effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Martin =
Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards =
receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the mos=
t part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough=
 to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - The Klap Updated 10/21/01 Green thre=
w for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has be=
en inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod=
 every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman=
 rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were no=
t great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Ch=
apman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay h=
ealthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Klap Updated =
10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven reception=
s for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in =
the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic! ha! el Pittman ,=
 RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cui=
lla Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching =
seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not re=
liable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roste=
r spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Tomlins=
on was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. Th=
e rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one o=
f the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes fo=
r 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tigh=
t ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly =
basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) st=
arted Sunday's! g! ame against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted=
 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 los=
s.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eigh=
t passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideou=
t is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Cor=
ey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to=
 just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from=
 such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinn=
ati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent r=
ole in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clear=
ly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' fe=
atured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent =
Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at De! =
tr! oit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch=
 Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.=
   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rocks Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yard=
s, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has sta=
cked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy ris=
k because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks U=
pdated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice =
at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws wer=
e inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder pr=
oblems.  Eddie George, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51=
 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Ten=
nessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson ,=
 WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 =
yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of=
 inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Cru=
mpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01  Crumpler caught five passes f=
or 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, =
quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards again=
st Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout. =
 Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with=
 only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numb=
ers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa!=
 ble of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT =
- Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches=
 by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, =
but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to cons=
istently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 1=
0/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the =
week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh=
 defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had =
a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two sc=
ores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to pos=
t good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality playe=
rs.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 1=
0 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field=
 relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to =
post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bet! ti!  , RB PIT - =
Fear Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries ag=
ainst Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Be=
ttis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New Yor=
k Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the =
Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of=
 stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
1/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, po! st! ing six catches for 208 yar=
ds and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbro=
ok as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot =
