dated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His curren=
t status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Up! da! ted 11/2=
6/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccan=
eers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter=
 of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despit=
e being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineff=
ective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game=
. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  K=
eenan McCardell  , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs a=
nd caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good out=
ing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Isma=
il , WR BAL - McKay Neal Upd! at! ed 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to th=
ree catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail=
 remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most co=
mplete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jackson=
ville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic t=
o be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Marti=
n Cuilla Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards aga=
inst Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of =
the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed=
 for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yard=
s. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see=
 him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free =
Agent Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a=
 good day against Arizona nonetheless! . ! The rookie tailback had 145 scri=
mmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flu=
tie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing f=
or 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth s=
tarting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baj=
a Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is o=
nly a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Kl=
ap Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passe=
s for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most rel=
iable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly ba=
sis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a g=
ood outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a to=
uchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is wort=
h starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/=
01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against=
 New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is w=
orth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendal=
l Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the b=
all five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yar=
dage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fan=
tasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be =
able to take many carries away from Charli! e ! Garner.   Antowain Smith , =
RB NE - Baja Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two =
touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pret=
ty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting =
258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantas=
y player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots=
' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/=
01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the G=
iants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the mo=
st reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updated =
11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating =
a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return t=
o the game.  Eric Moulds  , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/25/01 Moulds f=
inally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards an=
d two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should s=
till remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. D=
on't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre=
 performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pel=
t had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one intercep=
tion. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he re=
mains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Updated=
 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not =
catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to st=
art for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , Q=
B MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs =
and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a=
 QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable F=
antasy QB.  ! Donovan McNabb  , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/01 The Red=
skins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or =
interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a qu=
iet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Thras=
h caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsisten=
t to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod G=
ardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caugh! t ! four passe=
s for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in t=
he past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch=
.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extens=
ive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carr=
ied 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your=
 Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac=
 Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the i=
njured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muham=
mad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to=
