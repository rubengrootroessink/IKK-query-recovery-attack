layer News  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/18/01 According =
to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football =
until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a=
 sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. How=
ever, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 again=
st Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Price=
 might post respectable numbers against ! th! e Jaguars. Jacksonville's sec=
ondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Up=
dated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look =
for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars s=
econdary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Centers has=
 been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change =
against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguar=
s secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bl=
edsoe , QB NE - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 There's a very slim chance Bledsoe=
 will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week .     Bledsoe wa=
s upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 =
pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a st=
ationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No.=
 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's progress has been slo=
wer than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return.     Tyrone Wheat=
ley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice dur=
ing the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an=
 injured right knee.          "Tyrone Wheatley has a second degre! e ! - I =
don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said=
 Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at P=
hiladelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progr=
essed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   "I wo=
uld not agree with that at this time," Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's=
 uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh =
injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifer=
t said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to prac=
tice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursd=
ay. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.  Brian Griese , QB DE=
N - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has impro=
ved and! h! e's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese com=
plained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on =
Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf b=
y Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no struc=
tural damage to his shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS - Rocks Updated 10/17/0=
1 Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained an=
kle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in =
danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green wo=
uld replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=
gainst Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don'=
t be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two day! s.!   Pat=
rick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw ext=
ensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against=
 New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspec=
tive.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Fear Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs ar=
e still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orle=
ans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limit=
ed. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may w=
ant to consider benching Muhammad if at a! ll! possible.   Chris Weinke , Q=
B CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due=
 to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie q=
uarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback=
 this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   =
Terance Mathis , WR ATL - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returne=
d to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New O=
rleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy persp=
ective.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson=
 (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the start=
ing lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fa=
ntasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked =
with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in =
for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right kne=
e. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has =
no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is ex=
pected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brillianc=
e at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this poin=
t.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is list=
ed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle inj=
ury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as =
his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shiv=
ely Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game again=
st Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start=
 him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it=
 becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to=
 his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terr=
ell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/17/01 According to published repo=
rts, Davis would like to return to the lineup! S! unday at San Diego. He ha=
s recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants =
him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, al=
though this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Bron=
cos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Mack=
 will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too product=
ive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Ke=
enan McCardell , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 McCardell strugg=
led in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self i=
n the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a =
lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 D=
awkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of c=
ouple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , =
QB JAC - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by h=
eadaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ove=
r 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17=
/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and=
 is listed as probable. He w! on! 't be too productive if he does play. Bra=
dy only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated=
 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch=
 several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR D=
ET - McKay Neal Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the seaso=
n after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We'=
re disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach=
 Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showe=
d a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy t=
eam. Larr! y ! Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wh=
eatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/17/01 According to published r=
eports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. Th=
e veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he wa=
s hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 10/17/01 The Cont=
ra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley =
as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was =
reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  More Updates  Pla=
yer News Teams  [IMAGE]  Matt Lenhart Player News  Eric Moulds , Active WR =
Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Loo=
k for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars=
 secondary.  Peerless Price , Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 Price might post =
respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin b=
ecause of injuries.  Kerry Collins , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Collins co=
mpleted 18-of-32 passes for 250 yards and a touchdown on Sunday against St.=
 Louis. However, he's still not a reliable starter Fantasy-wise despite his=
 decent numbers against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , Active RB Updated 10/14=
/01 According to the Washington Post, coach Marty Schottenheimer will give =
Davis more carries on Monday against Dallas. Davis has struggled thus far, =
but it's been less about him and more about the Redskins tendency to fall b=
ehind the opposition early in games. If ever there was a week to start Davi=
s, this is it.   Johnnie Morton , Reserve WR Updated 10/12/01 Morton has de=
veloped into the Lions' No. 1 receiver this season, and is worth taking a c=
hance on against Minnesota's mediocre secondary. If you pay in a deeper lea=
gue and don't have more reliable options, Morton is definittly worth consid=
ering this week.   Cris Carter , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Carter has stru=
ggled, but he's too good not to start on a weekly basis. Look for him to fi=
nd the end zone against Detroit on Sunday.   Isaac Bruce , Active WR Update=
d 10/12/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too tal=
ented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against=
 CB Jason Sehorn and the questionable N.Y. Giants secondary.   Corey Dillon=
 , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this we=
ek. The Browns defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a re=
ceiver will be enough to give him a productive week.   Rickey Dudley , Rese=
rve TE Updated 10/09/01 The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve wi=
th a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your =
Fantasy roster.  Tony Banks , Reserve QB Updated 10/07/01 Banks was horribl=
e against the N.Y. Giants, completing 13-of-31 for only 151 yards and two i=
nterceptions. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside o=
f deeper leagues.   Steve Beuerlein , Active QB Updated 10/05/01 The Bronco=
s placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his season. He has =
been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't worth holding=
 on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your league.  Dolphin=
s , Active DT Updated 10/02/01 Linebacker Zach Thomas suffered a partially =
torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during Sunday's loss to St=
. Louis. "It's just real sore," Thomas told the Miami Herald. "I'm going to=
 try to play [Sunday]." His knee is very stiff right now, however, so don't=
 be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East contest against New =
England.   Raiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE T=
race Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendo=
n in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be pla=
ced on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roder=
ick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after =
sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sun=
day after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Matt Stover , Acti=
ve K Updated 12/08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the fina=
l three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Ol=
indo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on =
Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IM=
