Fellow Houston Tigers:

Come watch the Tigers beat up on the Bulldogs!
LSU at Mississippi State - October 20, 2001 @ 8:00pm
Chapter game watch at Woodrow's under the big tent!
(Note that parking will be available in the office building next door as
well as the normal areas - coming from Richmond, go past the office
building next to Woodrow's and take a right to get to the parking garage.
Parking is available for cars and small SUV's - due to clearance
restrictions, large vehicles are not allowed to park in the garage)

See you all there!  Geaux Tigers!
Your Greater Houston LSU Alumni Chapter

P.S. - For those who can't make Woodrow's, Nick's place will be showing the
game as well.
