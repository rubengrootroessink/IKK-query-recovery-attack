Shively Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn'=
t have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice =
until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday again=
st Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Staley s=
tarted Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Stal=
ey carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late ! i=
n! the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries=
 late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post co=
nsistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows f=
or a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/23/01 N=
edney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this =
week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be =
listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expect=
ed to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play i=
n Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in prac=
tice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thum=
b injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   St=
eve McNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sor=
e ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to =
play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10=
/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. =
The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment o=
ptions consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to p=
lay anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jon=
es , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pract=
icing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not=
 require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/23/01 =
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status=
 for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to =
week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom =
Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred wil=
l be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week,=
 then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next =
week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 2=
3.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt le=
ft Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the B=
rowns return to action next week.   Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Update=
d 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The B=
altimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game=
. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankl=
e.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left aft=
er the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable f=
or this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is =
inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Upda! te! d 10/23/01 Coach Bri=
an Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville=
, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty s=
ore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going =
on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'l=
l just have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he i=
s unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 10/23/01 Ha=
kim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Je=
ts. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against=
 New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Accor=
ding to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place=
 of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Mar=
shall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 p=
ercent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if h=
e's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replace=
ment last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy pe=
rspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/=
23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is=
 close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early.=
 It was a blessing for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day=
," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't=
 say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocr=
e, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself =
to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/2=
3/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants=
' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on =
Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repa=
ired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Ea=
gles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall=
 Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike =
Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm ju=
st taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would no=
t expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 perce=
nt before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate=
 would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    Anthony=
 Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent ! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to star=
t Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Le=
af could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fa=
ntasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Update=
d 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of=
 the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching ab=
ilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper league=
s.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Terrel! l ! will =
not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was =
reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White w=
ill start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third=
 receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin will=
 have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels con=
fident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas,=
 so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore , WR =
ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinni=
s, Moore may not play a regular season gam! e ! this season. Moore, who has=
 been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re=
covery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ=
ic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace=
d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h=
e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi=
m." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go=
.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probabl=
e with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philade=
lphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get=
 the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting =
job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - F=
ree Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday t=
hat Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He has =
progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "Here=
's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your league,=
 as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina star=
ting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Hunter Shively Updated 10/22/01 Green=
 suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The in=
jury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him ou=
t of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during =
the week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Joh=
nson , WR TB - Top Dogs Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the fina=
l minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor str=
ain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's =
game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you =
prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively =
Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's g=
ame against Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to=
 be in," Bucs Head Coach Tony Dung! y ! told the St. Petersburg Times . "Wa=
rrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know wh=
o it'll be carrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injure=
d, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week S=
even.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and Sports=
