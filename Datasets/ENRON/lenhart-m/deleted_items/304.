 NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is ex=
pected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
3/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. H=
owever, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson, WR TEN -=
 Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is e=
xpected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to pa=
rticipate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George=
 suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this w=
eek's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suf=
fering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, h=
e is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc prob=
lem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this =
week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't ex=
pect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his abs=
ence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expecte=
d to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his=
 injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated =
10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and h=
is status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from=
 week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head c=
oach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when=
 Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well t=
his week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return da=
te] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin =
on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nor=
thcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play w=
hen the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agen=
t Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick to=
ld The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this wee=
k's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprai=
ned ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left a=
fter the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable=
 for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen i=
s inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Bill=
ick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but t=
he quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in =
the chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with=
 the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just =
have to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unabl=
e to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim =
suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. =
However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New=
 Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to=
 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Mar=
shall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall t=
o be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent =
before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not=
, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement la=
st Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspecti=
ve again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes=
 spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to be=
ing completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a bl=
essing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day," Stokes to=
ld the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100=
 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, =
so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more r=
eliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard contin=
ues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup =
within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 y=
ards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgica=
lly-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free =
Agent Updated 10/23/! 0!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Phil=
adelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.=
   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach=
 Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "=
I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I wo=
uld not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100=
 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Ca=
nidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    A=
nthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Age! nt! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected =
to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. =
Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright fr=
om a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in p=
lace of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catc=
hing abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper=
 leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Terrell =
will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as=
 was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez Wh=
ite will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's =
third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin=
 will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feel=
s confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Da=
llas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore =
, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinn=
is, Moore may not play a regular season! g! ame this season. Moore, who has=
 been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his re=
covery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republ=
ic. "That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we pace=
d him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when h=
e'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have hi=
m." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go=
.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is proba=
ble with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Phila=
delphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to g=
et the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the startin=
g job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR -=
 Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday=
 that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. "He ha=
s progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy," said Seifert. "He=
re's a golden opportunity." See if Huntley is still available in your leagu=
e, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina st=
arting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green s=
uffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The inju=
ry will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out =
of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during th=
e week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.  Keyshawn Johns=
on , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final m=
inutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain=
. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's gam=
e against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you pre=
pare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/=
22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against=
 Pittsburgh. "I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in," Bu=
cs Head Coach Tony Dungy! t! old the St. Petersburg Times . "Warrick pulled=
 a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be c=
arrying the load." Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be car=
eful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett=
 Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in th=
e final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers hav=
e a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. "It'll be OK=
," Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "Thank goodness I have a week=
 to relax. I think that will help."  James Stewart , RB DET ! -! Hunter Upd=
ated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth qu=
arter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont W=
arren finished the game in his absence.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=
