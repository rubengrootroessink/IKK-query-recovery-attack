If I stay, I may go look at property. Maybe an afternoon tee time since the
game isn't until 8p.

   I'd like to go to the game, but I'm scheduled to be here on Sunday
   afternoon
   to finish a project that goes live on Tuesday morning. I don't know if I
   want to chance it with a deadline. I'd have to leave right after the
   game
   and leave crowley early the next morning. Also, a shitload of
   construction
   went up on i-10 this weekend b/w Lake Charles and Crowley. traffic would
   be
   bad again. fuch it, it's on the deuce anyway.

      I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to
   you
      and I
      didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire
   first
      half
      to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get
   a
      stripper to go back to your place with you?

      Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night
   until
      8:00p.

      Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are
      staying
      here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

      Thanks,

      Mitch Marcantel
