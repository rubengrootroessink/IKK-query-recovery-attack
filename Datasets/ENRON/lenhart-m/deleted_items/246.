kabutuka  , RB CAR - Baja Updated 10/25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until =
at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his r=
ight foot. "He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be =
football related until next summer," coach George Seifert said Wednesday. "=
Basically, it just separated," Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka'=
s foot. "The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put bac=
k together." Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting =
lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the inju=
ry was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play=
 again.        James Stewart  , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/25/01  =
 Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free=
 Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruis=
e and not a sprain.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/25/01   C=
hrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolin=
a with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive=
 tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. I=
t was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of=
 the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. =
Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines"=
 and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.  Edwards said Chr=
ebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will=
 be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the =
starting lineup.       Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/25/01=
   Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and =
could be lost for the season. "At this point in time, I'm on schedule to pl=
ay this Sunday," Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and=
 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been =
well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on th=
e scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against=
 the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly i=
njury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if h=
e does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday beca=
use of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave =
Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready t=
o play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoer=
ner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He h=
as played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and tw=
o touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Anthony Wright  , QB=
 DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday becau=
se of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might =
not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday,=
 and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's play=
ing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner=
 would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo=
 said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunda=
y. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a startin=
g spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   D=
avis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg =
is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. =
X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg i=
s throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis i=
s able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Too=
mer  , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   According to published report=
s, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will=
 join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Mond=
ay night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 y=
ards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to mot=
ivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet wi=
ll miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards =
described Chrebet's ailment as "post-trauma migraines" and said he wanted t=
o be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the vari=
ous tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne,=
 a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL durin=
g the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and=
 has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He =
will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is uncle=
ar.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - McKay Neal Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed=
 with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a rec=
eiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Cr=
owell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking h=
im up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day =
to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game aga=
inst Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - FIBSABs Updated 10/24/01   T=
he Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn p=
atella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , W=
R NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is=
 still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery.=
 The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB=
 GB - The Klap Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to g=
eneral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be full=
y recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent =
Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to =
the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still w=
orking with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which =
player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET =
- Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foste=
r is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati=
. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy le=
agues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Ro=
binson  , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson o=
n injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectiv=
ely ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil=
 Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinna=
ti Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. R=
ackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of hi=
s erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   =
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He =
will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle.=
 He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jure=
vicius  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his =
starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Ju=
revicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he wil=
l be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return =
to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent t=
his season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's ga=
me while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and =
is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked wit=
h the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to sa=
y for sure he will be available," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiave=
rini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey =
Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as qu=
estionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are =
optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained f=
oot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is =
questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the=
 next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaveri=
ni  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday an=
d is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is reco=
vering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Rocks Updated=
 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday witho=
ut any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky W=
atters  , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tr=
ibune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to =
the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month o=
r longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I w=
ould be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our=
 best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played wel=
l. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you =
have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your t=
eam to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down=
 the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dil=
fer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the=
 starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy roster=
s at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01=
   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game =
against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Tr=
ent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled g=
roin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy per=
spective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Fear Upd=
ated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunda=
y's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the exten=
t of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    More Updates   =
 Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Matt Lenhart Player News    Isaac Bruce  , A=
ctive WR Updated 10/22/01  Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunda=
y, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to r=
un the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. L=
ook for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.    Tony Banks  , R=
eserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Banks finally had a somewhat productive game on=
 Sunday, throwing for 346 yards and a score against Carolina. His performan=
ce doesn't make him any more valuable from a Fantasy perspective, however, =
so don't consider him any better than a reserve.    Corey Dillon  , Active =
RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. =
Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very=
 quickly.    Johnnie Morton  , Reserve WR Updated 10/19/01  Morton could ha=
ve a big game this weekend against Tennessee. The Titans' secondary has bee=
n shaky at best, so the positive matchup makes Morton a good start from a F=
antasy perspective.    Cris Carter  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Expect go=
od numbers from Carter this week. He is a big-game player who will not be f=
lustered by the improved Green Bay defense.    Kerry Collins  , Reserve QB =
Updated 10/18/01  Collins has been mediocre at best this season, but his nu=
mbers against Philadelphia were respectable in 2000. He's not the best opti=
on Fantasy-wise, but you could do worse if you're desperate for a quarterba=
ck.    Eric Moulds  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Moulds might get in the e=
nd zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often a=
gainst the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.    Peerless Price  , Reserve W=
R Updated 10/18/01  Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguar=
s. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.    Stephen Davis  =
, Active RB Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent game of the season=
 on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due t=
o Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup=
, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.    Rickey Du=
dley  , Reserve TE Updated 10/09/01  The Browns have placed Dudley on injur=
ed reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he=
 was on your Fantasy roster.    Steve Beuerlein  , Active QB Updated 10/05/=
01  The Broncos placed Beuerlein on injured reserve on Friday, ending his s=
eason. He has been healing slowly from an offseason elbow injury, and isn't=
 worth holding on to if you had him as insurance to Brian Griese in your le=
ague.    Dolphins  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  Linebacker Zach Thomas suf=
fered a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee during S=
unday's loss to St. Louis. "It's just real sore," Thomas told the Miami Her=
ald . "I'm going to try to play [Sunday]." His knee is very stiff right now=
, however, so don't be surprised if Thomas misses this weekend's AFC East c=
ontest against New England.    Raiders  , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01  The =
Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he to=
re his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surger=
y this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. I=
n other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the=
 Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson i=
s questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder=
.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover needs just nine more =
field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL singl=
e-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chan=
ces against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playof=
f lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and Spor=
