Watch the Tigers Wreck the Rebels!
LSU vs. Ole Miss - October 27, 2001 @ 8:00pm
Come watch at Woodrow's under the big tent!

(Note that parking will be available in the office building next door as
well as the normal areas - coming from Richmond, go past the office
building next to Woodrow's and take a right to get to the parking garage.
Parking is available for cars and small SUV's - due to clearance
restrictions, large vehicles are not allowed to park in the garage)

For those unable to make it to Woodrow's, Nick's Place will be showing the
game as well.

Also, for our travelling Tigers, note the following construction update
from La. DOTD:

DOTD is doing roadwork on I-10 around the Hwy 165 area in Jeff Davis
Parish.
Houston-area Tiger fans should be advised to take evasive manuevers....i.e.
exit Iowa and head south to Hwy 90....go east on 90 to Welsh, and then back
to I-10.  See the link:
