 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 wi=
n over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is e=
xpected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , Q=
B TEN - Rocks Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to hi=
s right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice =
time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next g! am! e=
.   Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffe=
red a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. H=
e is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Aki=
ns will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve M=
cNair , QB TEN - Rocks Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an inj=
ury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some =
practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next=
 game.!  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sund=
ay's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, a=
nd Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status i=
s day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/19/01 ! Sm! ith (ankle)=
 could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dal=
las is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - McKay Neal Updated 11/19/01 Math=
is has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yar=
ds against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's e=
xpected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris =
, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right ham=
string during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the =
contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updat=
ed 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching sev=
en passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the ga=
me, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free A=
gent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enoug=
h that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys wil! l ! start =
Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. Th=
e team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he=
'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Free =
Agent Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coa=
ch's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering=
 from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might=
 have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson=
's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent  Upda=
ted 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas =
Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback=
 for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fan=
tasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Locke=
tt left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib inju=
ry. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at th=
is time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who s=
uffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washingt=
on Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be ready in time for=
 next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks=
 is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against =
the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Rocks Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sun=
day's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expect=
ed to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgiving Da=
y.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent  Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered a=
n apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as=
 day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard =
suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not ret=
urn to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - McK=
ay Neal Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's gam=
e against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR -=
 Fear Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game=
 against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is uncl=
ear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - The Klap Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed fo=
r only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th=
e ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy o=
f a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work=
 at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing def=
enses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open oft=
en after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baja Updated 11=
/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by De=
troit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a b=
etter game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Martin Cuilla Updated 1=
1/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23=
 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is ver=
y thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan ca=
ught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desper=
ate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Char=
lie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rus=
hed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and =
a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near =
the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest =
of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 11/18/01 Dunn c=
aught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 =
yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy =
numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erra=
tic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Top Do! gs! Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caugh=
t 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end=
 zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is v=
ery thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 =
Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is no=
t consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and=
 three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fa=
ntasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what mat=
chup he faces.   More Updates  Transactions, View  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE] Warn=
