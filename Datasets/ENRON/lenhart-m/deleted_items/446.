 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has=
 not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times=
. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shau=
n Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as t=
he postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20=
/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy =
involving Fl! ut! ie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarte=
rback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is=
 none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will g=
et us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enough=
t to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoul=
der injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, becaus=
e Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football=
.  Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the C=
ontra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expec=
ts to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected=
 to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Upd=
ated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may =
be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the te=
am's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect hi=
m to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWilli=
e Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expecte=
d to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker=

1/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jo=
nathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC=
 - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game a=
gainst Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play!   =
Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained kn=
ee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrenc=
e Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Up=
dated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on inju=
red reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins =
might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MI=
A - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no =
QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind =
of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we=
're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Sm=
ith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know i=
f Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game agai=
nst the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and s=
ee," Shanah! an! told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, h=
e'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that =
we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else i=
n."   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Pla=
in-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the nea=
r future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said.=
 "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Locket=
t, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play o=
n Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value=
 as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Upda=
ted 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against P=
hiladelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn=
't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center =
for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green=
 (abdomen) ! is! expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full streng=
th. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup i=
s favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffer=
ed a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weeke=
nd's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however=
, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis=
.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a h=
amstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days =
of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washing=
ton. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants =
, DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerbac=
k Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems a=
gain this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to c=
over either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway=
. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any =
receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - =
Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication t=
hat Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not perf=
orming well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB =
- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, =
and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideou=
t has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens  , DT BAL =
- Russell Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest=
 of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower=
 the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow =
more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due t=
o a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out fo=
r just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't =
expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.=
   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will sta=
rt on Thursday's game against Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy=
 enough to do my job," Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle t=
o post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench h=
im this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated=
 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Fran=
cisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play =
this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in =
the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terr=
y Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return =
to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. How=
ever, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harri=
s , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game =
against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fan=
tasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updat=
