layer News  Trent Green , QB KC - Meximullets Updated 10/18/01 Green should=
 move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs mi=
ght depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND =
- Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapo=
lis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated=
 New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cul=
t Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight =
end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New Eng=
land this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 1=
0/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against N=
ew England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this w=
eek.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected=
 ! to! start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecuti=
ve week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy line=
up.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Snake Pit Updated 10/18/01 Harrison su=
ually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty L=
aw in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Pe=
yton Manning , QB IND - One Man Show Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perfo=
rm well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patr=
iots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.=
  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participa=
te in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to =
practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off decidi=
ng on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play. =
 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder misse=
d practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and sh=
ould play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use h=
im this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - The Fat Bastards Upda! te! d 10/18/01 =
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might=
 have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff=
 didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - The Guzzlers Updated =
10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the =
Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week,=
 in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Who's Y=
o Daddy Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so =
far. He could have a g! oo! d week if the Jets engage in a shootout with th=
e Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gamepla=
n around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - oops, I did it again =
Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but mi=
ght be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able t=
o match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - The Snake Pit Update=
d 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week=
. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   S=
tephen Davis , RB WAS - The Executioners Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his fir=
st decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a ver=
y risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolin=
a is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants=
 consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks w=
as very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes=
 for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even wort=
h a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - T=
he Snake Pit Up! da! ted 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre thi=
s season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some=
 success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starti=
ng in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Fat Bastards Update=
d 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis de=
fense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his =
first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tigh! t ! end now that =
Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideratio=
n at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01=
 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary=
 on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in l=
arger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - One Man Show Updated 10/18/01 Holt h=
as the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on=
 Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lin=
eup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 10/18/=
01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to=
 ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the que=
stionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - The Fat Bastards =
Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy persp=
ective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have =
a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - The E=
xecutioners Updated 10/18/01 C! anidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk =
as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a go=
od knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week fr=
om a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warn=
er is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the Ne=
w York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhal=
ter , RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to =
start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Mon=
day night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the=
 backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more p! ro! ductive of the tw=
o backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/18/0=
1 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth star=
ting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around=
 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd =
Pinkston , WR PHI - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly be=
coming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth sta=
rting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.  =
 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa =
Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in =
his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four we=
eks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware o=
f any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Thrill Kill Cult Update=
d 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numb=
ers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight e=
nds and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   More Updates=
