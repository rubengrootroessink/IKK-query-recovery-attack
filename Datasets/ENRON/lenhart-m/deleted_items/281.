layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According =
to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Wat=
ters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which coul=
d be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"=
 Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into th=
e lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has co=
me in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll =
play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash =
both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back=
 from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injur=
y. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on =
any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Up=
dated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Su=
nday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He =
replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with=
 a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om!=
 a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ=
 - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable fo=
r next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determi=
ne the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedri=
c Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice=
 due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and=
 isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , =
RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a=
n ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=
 afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start =
ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't rec=
ommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary i=
s hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this w=
eek.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss =
his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foo=
t. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to=
 broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.=
  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targetin=
g Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic =
knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h=
! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by =
Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fan=
tasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running b=
ack and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/=
23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring =
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the w=
eek, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duc=
e Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game a=
gainst the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball ju=
st three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Cor=
rell Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At=
 this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numb=
ers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacemen=
t.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a nec=
k injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney=
 , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury=
 report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this w=
eek's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is r=
ecovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game agai=
nst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George =
, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's=
 game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN =
- Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result=
 of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's=
 game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennesse=
an reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receive=
r is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of r=
est, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. R=
ookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free =
Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday.=
 An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  =
 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out o=
f Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remai=
ns uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exe=
rcises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida T=
imes-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress=
 is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind=
 of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inac=
tive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , W=
R CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of=
 a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next=
 week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play=
 Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimisti=
c that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for=
 the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - =
Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game=
 with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookin=
s will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -=
 Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Su=
nday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm =
day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area," Grbac said Monday. =
"There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up =
a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see." Randall Cunni=
ngham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR S=
TL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday=
's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be availa=
ble for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL =
- Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canida=
te is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New=
 Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike M=
artz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we'=
ve got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate pr=
oved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and shou=
ld be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes =
, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending =
to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully =
the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! =
to get treatment every day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practi=
ced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes =
has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter=
 unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Ru=
ssell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now =
back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catche=
s for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though h=
is surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR N=
YG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to t=
he Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-=
to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Hea=
d Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orl=
eans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago," Martz said=
. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to=
 be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play." T=
