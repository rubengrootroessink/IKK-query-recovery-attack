 Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's ga=
me against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the ga=
me. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis =
, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewi=
s has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into =
effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or reha! bi! litate=
 with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work t=
oward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK -=
 Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the=
 Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack C=
rockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matt=
y Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=
lay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =
from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/=
16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin=
nati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri=
lls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n=
ot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm=
itt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the li=
neup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained ri=
ght knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that S=
mith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return bumps Tr=
oy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back agai=
nst the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Fr=
iday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  =
However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league th=
is week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth c=
onsidering as long as he's able to play.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Upd=
ated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting q=
uarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth=
 starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lac=
k of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better=
 quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in yo=
ur starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated=
 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still=
 too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding th=
e end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and th=
e Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Update=
d 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Gi=
ants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's=
 almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantas=
y numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams i=
s one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to us=
e on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been under=
achieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , =
QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco =
last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit incons=
istent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough t=
o bench him, especially against a vulnerable In! di! anapolis defense.    W=
illie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game =
against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiv=
ing. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the=
 pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephe=
n Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play=
 after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over hi=
s last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.=
 Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable =
to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 =
Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three g=
ames. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can b=
e beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fant=
asy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent ! Updated 11/16/01 W=
estbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdo=
wn passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weeken=
d that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth co=
nsidering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has=
 been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 3=
8 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, howe=
ver, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKa!=
 y ! Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so start=
ing him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll=
 go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using hi=
m outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 =
Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored on=
ly three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary t=
his weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on hi=
s potential to put up solid numbers.   Is! aa! c Bruce , WR STL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but =
he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law a=
nd the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting base=
d on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is stil=
l the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and =
should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie! C! onwel=
l  , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks,=
 so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lac=
k of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is som=
ething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley=
 , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter thi=
s weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carrie=
s with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possibl=
e.   Donald Hayes , ! WR! CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two =
catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable f=
or Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley =
Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check o=
ver the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in th=
e league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so start=
ing him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 =
Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75=
 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this we=
ek's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Fav=
re , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy =
quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunda=
y with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   =
Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up hu=
ge ! ya! rdage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a=
 valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, F=
ranks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill=
 Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed=
 on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlan=
ta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnera=
ble to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  Schedule, Break=
