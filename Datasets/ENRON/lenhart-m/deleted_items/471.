, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thu=
rsday against Dallas, but we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy sta=
ts. The Cowboys will probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and M=
ike Anderson risky starts this week since they have been splitting time.  B=
rian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 11/21/01 With favorite target Rod Smith=
 likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to wor=
k w! it! h Thursday against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will prob=
ably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He sho=
uld provide your team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Mars=
hall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage y=
ards and a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player=
 in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Jamel Whi=
te , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Browns may use White as a cha=
nge-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense. You might w=
ant to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you're l=
acking in starting options.  Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11=
/21/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy te=
am is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the =
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will hav=
e no choice but to do.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/21/01 Warne=
r had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards =
and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will thr=
ow at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   O.=
J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Santiago catches the occ=
asional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then. =
He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one=
 of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a t=
ight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.  Kevin Johnson  ,=
 WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson has been a prime target for Tim=
 Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliabl=
e No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a go=
od career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get hi=
m into your lineup.  Tim Couch , QB CLE - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Couch has =
a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), wh=
om he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could ch=
oose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week, give him a lo=
ok.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Warrick has been ca=
tching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't provided stats worth=
y of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league. His matchup against C=
leveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.  Darnay =
Scott , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Although Scott has caught a to=
uchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he play=
s Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inc=
onsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.  Jon Kitna =
, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 We can't advise you use Kitna as he =
goes up against the Browns' secondary this week. Cleveland has been very st=
ingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ran=
king ninth overall in sacks.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up agains=
t the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678=
 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in yo=
ur active lineup week in and week ! ou! t in any league.  Larry Centers , R=
B BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Centers has been a great pass-catching =
back for the Bills this season, but he will face a Miami defense on Sunday =
that will likely be able to contain him. Only use him if you have no other =
alternative on your bench.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recen=
t weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a =
bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reservin=
g him.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/01 There's a good=
 chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Mi=
ami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the=
 Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history a=
gainst the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth usi=
ng as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.  Eric Johnson , TE SF - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/21/01 Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend again=
st Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't real=
ly worth starting at this point.    J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Update=
d 11/21/01 Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for =
72 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable ove=
rall, however, so starting him is still a risky move.   Travis Henry , RB B=
UF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Henry had a very disappointing game agains=
t the Seahawks in Week 10, and will likely struggle again against the far-b=
etter Dolphins defense on Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit=
 using this week.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Van=
 Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a strong D=
olphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawk=
s, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week d=
espite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the bench fo=
r Week 11.  ! Travis Taylor , WR BAL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/01 Afte=
r a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self. We d=
on't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so don't us=
e him this week.  Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Sharpe h=
as been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdo=
wn on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville,=
 and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe into your acti=
ve lineup every week.  Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01Is=
mail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly devel=
oping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot strea=
k and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get =
Ismail into your starting lineup this week. Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/21/01 Buckhalter will return from suspension this week=
end, and will be available for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Stale=
y has established himself as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhal=
ter is a gamble.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Stale=
y had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in Philadelp=
hia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes him worth =
starting in Week 11 against Washington.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/21/01 Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two c=
atches for 17 yards like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will st=
ill be in the starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gambl=
e nonetheless.   Ron Dayne  , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/21/01 Dayne=
 has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He m=
ay score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fan=
tasy owners overall.      Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/21/01 =
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a touchd=
own in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run this seas=
on, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their offense in We=
ek 11.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall! Updated 11/21/01 Hilliard=
 continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a sore toe. H=
e may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary, however, es=
pecially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play.   Amani Toomer , WR =
NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards aga=
inst Minnesota on Monday night, but he'll struggle to post similar numbers =
vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in=
 smaller Fantasy leagues is a wise move.   More Updates   Teams, Rosters  [=
