.      Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Wat=
ters , RB SEA - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/23/01 According to the Ta=
coma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will=
 return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be anot=
her month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren=
 said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup.=
 He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and=
 played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play agai=
n." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both back=
s on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Ale=
xander dow! n ! the stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10=
/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He ha=
s lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fant=
asy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 1=
0/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's =
game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replace=
s Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pull=
ed groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fro! m ! a Fan=
tasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Who=
's Yo Daddy Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable f=
or next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determ=
ine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedr=
ic Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practic=
e due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, an=
d isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith ,=
 RB MIA - The Lie Downs Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due =
to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don'=
t be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - North Blvd Nutwh=
ackers Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Min=
nis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapol=
is. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Co=
lts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cu=
t starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - The Snake! P! it Updated 10/=
23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due=
 to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR =
IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's ga=
me at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a F=
antasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/2=
3/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his come=
back game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided =
whether they will activate! h! im. He will work in practice this week and t=
he Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recom=
mend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's =
Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn ,=
 RB TB - One Man Show Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Time=
s, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn w=
on't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play o=
n Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updat=
ed 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he di=
dn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and =
was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 ya=
rds on! 1! 1 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend =
on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if =
your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is e=
xpected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/=
23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. =
However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN=
 - Meximullets Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury bu=
t is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected=
 to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult Upda=
ted 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expecte=
d to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhac=
kers Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of =
a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's gam=
e.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean re=
ports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is =
expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, =
an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie=
 Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent=
 Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An M=
RI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred=
 Taylor , RB! J! AC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been rul=
ed out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's ga=
me remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase=
 his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The F=
lorida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. =
Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make s=
ome kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has b=
een inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis North=
cutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game be=
cause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to act=
ion next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did =
not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is o=
ptimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inac=
tive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , R=
B BAL - The Guzzlers Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play =
of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's gam=
e. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Thrill K! il! l Cult Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick =
expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the q=
uarterback wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the =
chest area," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the=
 cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have=
 to wait and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to=
 play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/23/01 Haki=
m suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets=
. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against N=
ew Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - The Executioners Updated 10/23/01 A=
ccording to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in p=
lace of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect=
 Marshall to be up for this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 1=
00 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And =
if he's not, then he doesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy rep=
lacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantas=
y perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Who's Yo Daddy Upd=
ated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs=
, and is close to being completely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came s=
o early. It was a blessing for me because ! I ! was able to get treatment e=
very day," Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I =
wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than=
 mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves =
himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - oops, I did it again=
 Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back =
in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for=
 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his su=
rgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - =
Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the P=
hiladelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-d=
ay.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - oops, I did it again Updated 10/23/01 Accor=
ding to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game agai=
nst New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"=
 Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. =
He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let h=
im play." Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's =
unable to go.    More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc =
