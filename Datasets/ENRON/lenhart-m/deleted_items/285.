Yo Smokey- wait no, let me correct, Smoke-free:

Count me in on that bro.  I'll be there with bells on.  I want to reserve my
spot in the "Married Dorm" with hopes of getting cool make out with Tanya
and maybe engage in some naughty conversation (one word or two) with Shawna.
(Sorry Myers, she is tired of hearing that Mike Foster and Cleo Fields are
in your study group)

Don't bother in booking me a flight, I'll just ride my motorbike straight to
the slope.  I hear the ride to BR is a bitch but clears up shortly after.  I
would ask the lovely Gooch to accompany me on the glorious journey but don't
currenly have a side car for my nut-rocket.  Don, if work is a little slow,
maybe you can work me up a bid on a matching yellow/black side car. Or,
perhaps Ross can calculate the cost of renting a Harley to Colorado (the one
with the side car, please)

Anyways, hope this trip materializes. Sounds like a kick ass time.
