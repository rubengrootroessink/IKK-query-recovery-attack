I have a couple of exciting things to tell you about.
First, my website is up and running.  Please take a moment to check it out.   The link is at the bottom of this letter.  Many thanks to Sarah Powell at Compose Digital Design for her work.
Second, be sure to watch "American Roots Music" beginning Oct. 29 at 10PM ET on PBS.  It is a 4-part series I had the pleasure to work on.  I was the Director of Photography and shot interviews and performances in San Antonio, Austin and Gruene, TX, Mardi Gras in south Louisiana and Gospel in New Orleans, blues music in Helena, Arkansas, the Mississippi Delta and Memphis, and country and bluegrass in Nashville.
Here is an excerpt from the press release about the show:

~~New York (September 24, 2001) -Filmed at locations such as the Cajun Mardi Gras in southwest Louisiana, the Lakota Reservation in South Dakota and the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee, the series captures the essence and storied history of early American song. The series will be the first to trace the evolution of Native American, country, blues, gospel, western swing, Cajun, zydeco and tejano music using archival footage interwoven with interviews, performances, recordings and photographs of contemporary musicians like Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Marc Savoy, Gillian Welch and Robbie Robertson that will re-create the journey of American roots music from the past to its present incarnations. 
Four part ?American Roots Music? Series to Air on PBS Beginning October 29, 2001 Palm Pictures to release companion 4 CD box set, DVD/VHS and ?Highlights? CD on Oct. 30th Comprehensive Companion Book by Harry N. Abrams Inc. In Stores Now~~
