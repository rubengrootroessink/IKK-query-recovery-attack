layer News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford s=
tarted in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnes=
ota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove hims=
elf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/0=
1 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions w=
as good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games=
 this year and has become a major sco! ri! ng threat even though he is not =
very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWilli=
e Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards recei=
ving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most par=
t, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to b=
ench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw fo=
r 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been i=
nconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod eve=
ry week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rus=
hed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not gr=
eat, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapma=
n may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healt=
hy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/=
21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions f=
or 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the=
 league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Michael Pittman , RB A=
RI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Ka=
nsas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won'=
t post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable pla=
yer to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
1/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for=
 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to=
 start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDain=
ian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in che=
ck for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback =
rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy =
players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/=
01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a s=
core against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a F=
antasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Gri=
ese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sun! da! y'=
s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passi=
ng, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warri=
ck , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 y=
ards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his =
owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CI=
N - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 car=
ries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performanc=
e very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terre=
ll caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinso=
n injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passi=
ng game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed f=
or 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as C=
hicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of =
the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught s=
even passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit! . ! Despite some quiet outin=
gs until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the =
Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free =
Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was interce=
pted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two =
consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of =
inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair thre=
w for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed on=
ly 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indi=
cating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George , RB=
 TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by D=
etroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hind=
ered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against th=
e Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't =
expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD again=
st New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the re=
mainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 =
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definite=
ly time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - =
Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on fi=
ve catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality At=
lanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa! ble of providing owners with =
regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 Ward w=
as limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making =
important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited be=
cause of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick =
Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury th=
at had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 c=
arries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five c=
atches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, how=
ever, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a =
position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Upda=
ted 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He =
has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The vetera=
n wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis. =
 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 ya=
rds and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pa=
ss. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defe=
nse.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a hug=
e game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and tw=
o scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, =
depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, p! os! ti=
ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have=
 overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, a=
nd is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.   More Updates  View =
