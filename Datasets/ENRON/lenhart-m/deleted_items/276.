layer News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 10/23/01 According to th=
e Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters =
will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be =
another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holm=
gren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lin=
eup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in=
 and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play =
again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both =
backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from=
 Alexander down the stretch.!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated =
10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He =
has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fa=
ntasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated=
 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday'=
s game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He repla=
ces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pu=
lled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a ! Fa!=
 ntasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - F=
ear Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next =
Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the =
extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward =
, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to=
 a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't =
a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA =
- Fear Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injur=
y. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to us=
e him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chief=
s Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chri=
s Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you us=
e either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly impo=
sing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome =
Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/23/01! Pathon might miss his thi=
rd straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don'=
t use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 10/23/01=
 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken r=
ibs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell=
 Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunda=
y's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee su=
rgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He!=
 w! ill work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesda=
y whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy lea=
gue unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and =
is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Hunter Shively Updated 10/=
23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring =
strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the w=
eek, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duc=
e Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's gam=
e against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball=
 just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie =
Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carr! ie! s late in the game.=
 At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy n=
umbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replace=
ment.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Eric Bass Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a n=
eck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinn=
ey , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the inju=
ry report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this=
 week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is=
 recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game ag=
ainst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie Georg=
e , RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday=
's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TE=
N - Rocks Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a resul=
t of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week'=
s game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tenness=
ean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiv=
er is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of =
rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. =
Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free=
 Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday=
. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. =
  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ru=
led out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's g=
ame remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increas=
e his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The =
Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play.=
 Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make =
some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has =
been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Nort=
hcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game b=
ecause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to ac=
tion next week.   Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap di=
d not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is=
 optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been in=
active for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen ,=
 RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play =
of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's gam=
e. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis =
Grbac , QB BAL - Eric Bass Upda! te! d 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects=
 Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterb=
ack wasn't so sure. "I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest a=
rea," Grbac said Monday. "There could be something going on with the cartil=
age. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wai=
t and see." Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. =
    Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a cal=
f injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is=
 expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Tr=
ung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Lo=
uis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk=
 this weekend against New Orleans. "I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for=
 this game," coach Mike Martz said. "He's got to be 100 percent before I wo=
uld be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he d=
oesn't play." Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday a=
gainst the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again th=
is week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent=
 much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being co=
mpletely healthy. "Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing=
 for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day," Stokes told the=
 Contra Costa Times . "I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 perce=
nt but I'm darn close." Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don=
't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliabl=
e.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard cont=
inues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup.=
 Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night again=
st Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almos=
t completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dix=
on missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a spra=
ined ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - =
McKay Neal Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is qu=
estionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. "I'm just taking the same=
 posture that we did a week ago," Martz said. "I would not expect Marshall =
to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be =
convinced that we've got to let him play." Trung Canidate would once again =
