Stephanie-

I manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.  If you could notify me when they have been added I would appreciate it. 

Thank you, 

Matt Lenhart
