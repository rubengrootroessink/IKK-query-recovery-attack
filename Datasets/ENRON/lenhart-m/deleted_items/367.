 Wednesday but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve=
 Heap on your roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until=
 he is effective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - The Guzzlers Updated 10=
/18/01 According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pi=
ck up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia =
is dealing with a sore throwing elbow,! a! s well as a few other nagging bu=

ame on Oct. 28 against Chicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Lie Downs U=
pdated 10/18/01 Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. J=
acksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF =
- Who's Yo Daddy Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in the end zone against =
Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injur=
y-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF -! T! he Guzzlers Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but =
that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack =
an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE=
 Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - The Executioners Updated 10/18/01 T=
here's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quart=
erback this week .     Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the=
 injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, thr=
ow or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just h=
and off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. =
  Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable=
 for his return.   !   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 10/1=
8/01 Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly =
miss the next game because of an injured right knee.          "Tyrone Wheat=
ley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his =
MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionab=
le for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about =
the injury as the week progressed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley woul=
d be out four weeks.   "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden s=
aid.     Chris Weinke , QB CAR - The Lie Downs Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat =
out practice Wednesday and it's uncert! ai! n whether he will play in Washi=
ngton on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than =
the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thi=
gh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't k=
now if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke=
 cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Nice Machine Updated 10/18/01 G=
riese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'l=
l play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of shoulder soreness a=
fter a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggrav=
ated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive e=
nd Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. =
    Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Bailey=
 missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprai! ne! d ankle, but he's expecte=
d to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing thi=
s weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if =
he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore=
 (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. H=
e hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his=
 status is downgraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - =
oops, I did it again Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in=
 practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. =
However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin=
 Muhammad , WR CAR - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are =
still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orlean=
s. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited=
. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may wan=
t to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR=
 - The Lie Downs Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due t=
o a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie qua=
rterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback t=
his week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. !  T=
erance Mathis , WR ATL - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (ha=
nd) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday ag=
ainst New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fa=
ntasy perspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01=
 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in=
 the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable=
 to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01!  =
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was=
 filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swoll=
en right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas,=
 but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - =
Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Ha=
mbrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes =
of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal =
at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 10! /1=
! 7/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay du=
e to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travi=
s Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss =
, WR MIN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for =
Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normall=
y tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activat=
e him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews=
 , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tue=
sday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fa=
ntasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 10/17/01 Accord=
ing to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday a=
t San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mi=
ke Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use D=
avis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend =
you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kill Cul=
t Updated 10/17/01  Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expe=
ct him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the=
 Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 10/1=
7/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looke=
d like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well t=
his week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. H=
e will catch of couple of passes but won't! f! ind his way into the end zon=
e.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - The Nice Machine Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is n=
o longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. L=
ook for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JA=
C - One Man Show Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's =
game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ=
ctive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smi=
th , WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very c=
onsistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a tou=
chdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/0=
1 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his=
 hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is m=
uch worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We bel=
ieved it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the mus=
cle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the N=
o. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  ! Ty! rone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show =
Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three t=
o four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lo=
