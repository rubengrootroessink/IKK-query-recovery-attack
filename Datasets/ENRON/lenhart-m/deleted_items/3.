t: Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PETP)   We were first asked to look at t=
his company over two months ago and were fascinated by the potential. You m=
ight not be familiar with the company, but unless you live in a vacuum you =
should be familiar with the issues surrounding their technology.   Petapeer=
 Holdings, Inc owns the commercial rights to market the Gnottella Network t=
echnology, which many see as the replacement for the highly publicized demi=
se of the on-line Napster Music Community.   You can visit http://gnotella.=
com  to learn more about P2P (Peer to Peer) file sharing for which Gnotella=
 provides technology.   The Gnotella network provides technology which allo=
ws simultaneous users to look directly into other user's computers, and tra=
nsfer files directly. Files are not limited to MP3 flies, as is the case wi=
th Napster. You can exchange anything from the most complex software to a r=
ecipe for fried chicken.   More importantly, management at Petapeer Holding=
s claims their technology does not infringe on copyright laws. Whereas Naps=
ter provides the ability to share files directly through Napster's server, =
Gnotella does not. Gnotella simply provides software which allows computers=
 to interface over the internet, and has no control over the exchange of fi=
les. Therefore, any violations would be the responsibility of the user, not=
 the software provider.   Today, after the market closed, Petapeer Holdings=
 issued a very significant press release which has the potential to push th=
is virtually unknown stock much higher.   Petapeer Holdings announced it ha=
s filed a Provisional Patent Application for a "new proprietary technology =
that will implement systems and methods for bolstering the Gnutella Network=
 while generating revenue for Petapeer".   We believe this stock has the po=
tential to become high profile when one considers all the press which surro=
unded the Napster demise. Furthermore, the company has come up with a revol=
utionary way to make money off the technology, and will be filing a patent =
on it.   The stock surged nicely two weeks ago, and has since retraced 50% =
of its previous gain, providing a low risk entry point.     [IMAGE] Trading=
 Alert Details [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PETP) trad=
ed as high as $1.70 on May 14th. Today the stock closed at $1.15.   Here ar=
e our thoughts on this Trading Alert on Petapeer Holdings, Inc (OTC BB: PET=
P):   As depicted in the chart, the nearest line of support is $1.06. The s=
tock has retraced about 50% of its gain the run made from late April to mid=
 May. Today's news after the close should create a great deal of interest a=
nd volume. Here is our recommendation:   *Buy up to $1.30 which gives you r=
oom to make money if the stock trades in our favor. *Set your Stop Loss at =
$1.06 ( Next Support Level as depicted in the chart) or what ever your risk=
 tolerance is. *If the stock can get through $1.75 in the next couple of da=
ys it should go higher it could find its way to nearly $2.  We view this st=
ock as highly risky, and this is not a long term recommendation. Don't be a=
fraid to take profits quickly if the market provides a gain, and don't be a=
fraid to sell quickly if the stock trades against you.   This newsletter is=
 our opinion only, and not a solicitation to buy this stock. Make up your o=
wn mind. If you are looking for a short term trade limit your loss if the s=
tock goes against you. As always, we remind you to review the section on ou=
r home page on Trading Alerts,  paying particular attention to the section =
on trading rules. The track record on our previous alerts can be obtained b=
y clicking here.    Here is the complete text of the news release for your =
review:     Petapeer Holdings Inc. Files Provisional Patent Application Wit=
h US Patent and Trademark Office for Revenue Model With US Patent and Trade=
mark Office for Revenue Model      NEW YORK, May 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Petapee=
r Holdings, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: PETP), announced today it has recentl=
y developed a new  proprietary technology that will implement systems and m=
ethods for bolstering the Gnutella Network while generating revenue for Pet=
apeer.  Petapeer has filed a provisional patent application covering the te=
chnology with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.        The new=
 technology covered by the application shall be used by Petapeer as a centr=
al part of its revenue model, and is intended to work with Petapeer's "Gnot=
ella" peer-to-peer file sharing software described below.  As the regular p=
atent application has not yet been filed and the technology and process not=
 yet disclosed, no further details can be revealed at the moment, except th=
at, like Gnotella, the new technology does not rely on advertiser-support o=
r "stealth" advertising components, known as "spyware" or "adware".  In acc=
ordance with United States patent practice, the invention now has an effect=
ive filing date that can be used in a later regular US patent application, =
provided that it is filed before the United States Patent and Trademark Off=
ice within 12 months of the provisional application.  This regular US paten=
t application is currently being drafted and is scheduled to be filed short=
ly.  Corresponding foreign patent applications may be filed under conventio=
nal priority within the same 12-month period, which the Company is consider=
ing.       Petapeer Holdings Inc.'s "Gnotella" peer-to-peer file sharing so=
ftware does not employ or support background or "stealth" advertising compo=
nents, known as "spyware" or "adware".  Spyware is sometimes employed to ge=
nerate revenue for providers of free software by installing itself into use=
rs'  computers and collecting personal information about those users, and t=
hen transmitting it to the providers of the spyware, sometimes without user=
s' knowledge or consent.   Recent reports have revealed that "spyware" and =
"adware" are contained in some software used to access the Gnutella Network=
. Petapeer's "Gnotella" software does not contain, nor has it ever containe=
d or employed "spyware" or "adware".       "We are pleased to be the very f=
irst to develop this technology, which will be available to our users if --=
 and only if -- they want to use it," said Stephane Chouinard, interim CEO =
of Petapeer Holdings Inc.  "The technology should provide us with an innova=
tive revenue model that promotes and strengthens the Gnutella Network witho=
ut the need for 'spyware' or 'adware', and thus propels legitimate P2P file=
 sharing to the next level.  While it will be up to each user to choose whe=
ther or not to use it, we hope it will be a hit."       Petapeer Holdings I=
nc. identifies and commercializes market-ready peer-to-peer (P2P) technolog=
ies.  Its first licensed technology, Gnotella, is  an application of the op=
en Gnutella Network that allows users to quickly and accurately search and =
share files anytime, anywhere with anyone in the network.  Created for Wind=
ows, users can download any type of file, including text, audio, video, spr=
eadsheets, word processing, software and more, through the Gnutella Network=
.       Petapeer Holdings Inc. urges its users to obey copyright laws and r=
ights of third parties, but does not and cannot monitor user activity.  Nei=
ther does it collect or sell user information.        Gnotella is available=
 for free download at http://gnotella.com .       This news release contain=
s forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Secur=
ities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  =
Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-=
looking statements if assumptions upon which the forward-looking statements=
 are based do not turn out to be true.  Assumptions upon which the forward-=
looking statements are based include, without limitation, the following:   =
    -- That the U.S. Patent on the technology will be granted;      -- That=
 the technology will not infringe previously patented technology;      -- T=
hat the revenue models will function as anticipated;      -- That the reven=
ue models will be accepted by users of Petapeer's         Gnotella software=
; and      -- That the revenue models will not interfere with the current p=
opularity         and use of Petapeer's Gnotella software.     SOURCE  Peta=
