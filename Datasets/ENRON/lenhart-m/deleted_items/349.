atest NFL Player News  Trent Green , QB KC - The Klap Updated 10/18/01 Gree=
n should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the C=
hiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger ,=
 TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the I=
ndianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the un=
derrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tigh=
t end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New E=
ngland this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 10/18/01=
 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New Engl=
and this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  R=
eggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to sta=
rt in place! o! f the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week=
. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   M=
arvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually perfo=
rms well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the p=
ast. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Mannin=
g , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well =
the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots thr=
ee times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy =
Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in=
 practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to pract=
ice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on=
 whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill=
 Schroeder , WR GB - Rocks Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wedne=
sday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday=
, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  T=
erry Glenn , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have anot=
her good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handlin=
g Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last=
 week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 =
yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him t=
o get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with I=
ndianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numb=
ers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the J=
ets! e! ngage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, becau=
se New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Col=
es , WR NYJ - Hunter Shively Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to =
receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis de=
fenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , =
RB NYJ - FIBSABs Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New=
 York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the cloc=
k against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/0=
1 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, b=
ut he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offe=
nse. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis=
 this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Upd=
ated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, compl=
eting 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, =
Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael W=
estbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updat! ed! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less =
than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Caroli=
na. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still =
only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Fear U=
pdated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Lou=
is defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw=
 his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that=
! S! tephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consider=
ation at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 G=
ardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary o=
n Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in lar=
ger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Fear Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the pot=
ential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. H=
e's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a w=
eekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 10/18/01 Bruce h=
asn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever cons=
ider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable =
N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01=
 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this seas=
on. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable =
tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10=
/18/01 Canidate will likely replace Marshall Fa! ul! k as St. Louis' featur=
ed back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the =
Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspec=
tive.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge n=
umbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every wee=
k. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be s=
ure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Upda=
ted 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if =
he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coa=
ch Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will l=
ikely be the more productive of th! e ! two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PH=
I - Eric Bass Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in =
the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Gia=
nts for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get =
him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/0=
1 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this=
 season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit s=
uspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated=
 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained med=
ial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatl=
ey will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable fo=
r Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PH=
I - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing so=
me solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the=
 league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly =
basis.   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE] 10/19 =
