   Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn John=
son , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of T=
ampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee=
 bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sor=
e right hip that limited him in practice last week. "I will get an MRI in t=
he morning and go from there," Johnson said. "Right now, they are saying th=
at it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not h=
ave played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."   Emmitt Smith =
, RB! D! AL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despit=
e having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over=
 Arizona on Sunday. "It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all=
 right," Smith said. "I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degr=
ee the injury was. It worried me a bit."   But Smith was able to walk off t=
he field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the Ne=
w York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday,=
 but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpe=
pper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Cu=
lpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is no=
t expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent U=
pdated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, =
and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statist=
ical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN=
 - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carr=
ies against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard r! un! , but the Br=
oncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver ap=
pears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , W=
R NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he =
remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/=
Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Den=
ver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a=
 big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedu=
le.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine pa=
sses for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment=
, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway i=
s finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jone=
s , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle=
 to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of hi=
s catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his num=
bers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the=
 tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB =
BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya=
rds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do=
wnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f=
rom Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/2=
8/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While P=
rice is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for=
 Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated =
10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two=
 TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completin=
g key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alex=
ander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87=
 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexan=
der's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seat=
tle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better =
defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty U=
pdated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami=
's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fant=
asy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28! /0!  McKni=
ght caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a f=
umble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally producti=
ve.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to jus=
t 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistentl=
y good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Ama=
ni Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He rem! ai! ns a must-start Fantasy pl=
ayer, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull=
 Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was he=
ld out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the=
 Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the bal=
l.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 y=
ards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic=
 QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , =
RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but =
was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for=
 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and shoul=
d post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll =
Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither b=
ack is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charli=
e Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 =
yards and a touchdown Su! nd! ay at Philadelphia. This outing could put him=
 firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remain=
s sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed =
for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at =
Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and =
we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNab=
b , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and =
no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either.=
 It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defen=
se, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump righ=
t now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback ov=
er the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated=
 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He ha=
sn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think eit=
her player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.=
  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine pas=
ses for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been a=
n inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a =
worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game=
. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - =
Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two =
interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsiste=
nt he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on =
him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Upd=
ated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and re=
corded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has bee=
n somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don'=
t let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you=
 consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Age=
nt Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touc=
hdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a=
 scor! e ! in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for=
 the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We d=
on't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith ,=
 RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizo=
na late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 8=
3 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson ,=
 QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third =
quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for f=
urther examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he retu=
