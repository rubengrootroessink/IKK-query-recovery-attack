It looks like Chuck (tulane) has moved from Cajun JR. to Cajun SR. and Val
(lsu) has been relegated to Cajun JR. from his previous Cajun SR. status on
the eDownstream project.

I think Val had sent me this image (attached) last week.
It is appropriate to send it back to him, because the image is garbage now.
Just like the Tigers baseball team - tossed aside like garbage.
