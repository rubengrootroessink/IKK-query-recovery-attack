Next weekend would be better for me. I was looking forward to stretching
this weekend out as much as possible... and not being in a car for 6 hours.

Boone will be pissed if we take off. He wants to booze on Saturday and
Sunday.


Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel
