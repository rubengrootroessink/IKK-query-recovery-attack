Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.
