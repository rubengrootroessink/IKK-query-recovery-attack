So buddy...what is up? WI am just getting ready to leave work and head home to
Denver tomorrow morning for the week. My oldest bro had a baby last week and 
my
other bro got engaged and there is a huge party for them tomorrow. i am super
excited because it fall on the long weekend. I will be skiing in Steambost 
this
weekend . However Tahoe has been getting dumped on. I am too broke to even go
skiing out here....the gas bill is Killing me. (tee hee) Actually, we do not
even turn on our heat because our place is very hard to keep warm...the hard
wood floors and the tall ceilings. As for SF.. everything is great. i love it
but I need to get a better paying job because I am broke. Oh well, I need to 
do
it while I am young and fins some rich guy. (just kidding) Anyway, How are you
doing? Any ladies strikin your fancy this valentine's day?

did you go and sign up on that website?  there are a lot of people from our
class on there.  what is going on?  how is san francisco?  can you pay your
gas bill.  i trade energy in that area.  how is the nightlife?  are you
dating at all?  life here is hectic.  i have just been working and going
out.  when are you going home again?  i don't know when i will get back
there, but i wish i was going back to ski.  shoot me an email when you get
a chance.
