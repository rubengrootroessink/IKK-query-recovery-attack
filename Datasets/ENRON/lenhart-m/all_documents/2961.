i just came in early to catch up.  i was out half day friday and all day 
yesterday.  i am up for whatever, but i dont want to get totally trashed on 
thursday and not be able to go out friday or saturday.  

dc is such a great city.  i could definitely live there. my friend works for 
the Speaker of the House so saturday he took me to the capitol and i got to 
see the speakers office and his private balcony that overlooks the washington 
monument and a lot of other offices and rooms that are off-limits to the 
public.  the weather was unbelievable - during the day not a cloud in the 
sky, high of 70 and at night 50. it was awesome.  we went out in georgetown 
friday and saturday.  matt, you would totally love this place. there was 
about 4 bars outdoors right on the Potomac with Watergate in the background 
and this huge fountain.  we should all take a trip there for a weekend - or 
boston, thats the next place i want to go.  i need to move out of this city, 
but then i would miss all of y'all.  so.... anyway, what are we doing this 
weekend?

what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this 
weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing 
shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty 
discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was 
dc?  i heard that place is a blast.
