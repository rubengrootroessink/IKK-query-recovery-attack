i will only say it is our party if it is fun.  if it sucks it is all you.    
i am not going out tonight.  game is on at 8:30 and i will just watch it at 
home.  i need my beauty sleep before the cruise.  my security guard 
girlfriend doesn't have an email address (she doesn't have a computer), but 
she does have an instant message pager.  you should try to buy some new cd's 
before your party.
