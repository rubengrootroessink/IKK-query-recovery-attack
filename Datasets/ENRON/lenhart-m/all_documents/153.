you must be on this "best conference" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a 
down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good 
georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i 
don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will 
pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that 
smoked you guys in dallas.
