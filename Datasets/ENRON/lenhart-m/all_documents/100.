> 1. Cleveland Steamer: an act in which one partner hovers above the
> other, and shits on his/her chest.
>
> 2. Tossing Salad: eating out a man or woman's ass. The term was used in
> a segment of an HBO prison documentary.
>
> 3. Rusty Trombone: the process by which one person is tossing a guy's
> salad, and then reaches around and gives them a hand job.
>
> 4. Dirty Sanchez: while fucking a girl doggy style, insert a finger in
> her ass and get it all shitty. Then, reach around to her face and give
> her a shit moustache, a "shitstache" if you will.
>
> 5. Slimy Snatchita: it's basically the same concept as the Dirty
> Sanchez. Instead of shit, get your finger all bloody and she won't know
> anything is wrong until the morning when she awakes with a crusty
> dry-blood moustache.
>
> 6. Dirty Schultz: same as Dirty Sanchez, except you give yourself the
> shitstache.
>
> 7. Dog In a Bathtub: when a man attempts to insert his nuts into a girls
> ass (why anyone would WANT to do this is mind-boggling).  Apparently,
> it's about as difficult to keep them there as it is to keep a dog in a
> bathtub.
>
> 8. Samoan Pile Driver: a sexual position that occurs when a woman's
> back and the bed are perpendicular, but she is upside down. The man
> stands above the woman and points his gig due south, simply bending his
> knees for repeated stroking.
>
> 9. Whale's eye: a Woman's privates.  Ever see the eyes on a blue whale,
> humpback whale, sperm whale, killer whale, etc? If not, check out an
> issue of National Geographic.
>
> 10. Balloon Knot: the Backdoor. The anus. The poop-chute.  The "fudge
> factory", if you will. You know, the asshole.
>
> 11. Coney Island Whitefish: a used condom, usually found floating in the
> water.
>
> 12. New Jersey Meathook: when a man inserts his finger in the ass of his
> partner while screwing her, and feeling her cervix. Most effective from
> behind.
>
> 13. Boston Shocker: when a man sticks his penis in the woman's anus and
> then puts it in her mouth then back to her ass.
>
> 14. Snowballing: when a man comes in a girl*s mouth then she spits it
> back into his mouth or it can be into another girls mouth.
>
> 15. Teabagging: when a man stands above the woman then dips his balls in
> her mouth.
>
> 16. Fanny Batter: in Britain they call a woman's vagina  the FANNY and
> of course all the beautiful homemade lubricant is the BATTER.  It always
> gets the Limeys rolling, when ordering fish & chips, if you ask for the
> haddock with EXTRA fanny batter.
>
> 17. Brushback Pitch: when you're getting head, yell "Batter Up!" Then,
> quickly pull out and give her a dick in the ear.
>
> 18. Cropduster: when spooning with your woman, and you are in front with
> your back to her front, if a fart accidentally sneaks out into her bush,
> it's called crop-dusting.
>
> 19. Dutch Oven: entrapping an unsuspecting sleeping partner in a world
> of ass odor by farting under the covers and pulling them over her head
> (and yours as well if you're into that sort of thing).
>
> 20. Dutch Treat: the unexpected result of a Dutch Oven gone terribly
> wrong. Very messy indeed.
>
> 21. Fountain of Youth: while sitting on her face and having her eat your
> ass, jerk off like a madman.
>
> 22. Tupperware Party: when three guys are triple-teaming a chick: one
> with his penis in her mouth, another in her vagina, and the third in her
> anus. So named because he is air-tight.
>
> 23. Arabian Goggles: a seldom-seen maneuver involving the testicles
> where the satchel is spread wide and placed on the face of the "ride",
> thus resting the balls in the gogglee's eye sockets.
>
> 24. Beef Curtain: The shanked out remains of the labia after being
> stretched like Play-doh from an hour or so of jimmy-jam (a.k.a. Beef
> Drapes, Meat Tarp, Piss Flappers, Quim Nuts, Vertical Bacon Sandwich)
>
>
> Letter to the editor,
> I've heard stories from various people about foods and liquids that can
> affect the taste of semen, some of them with reasons, others without.
> One no-no, is beer.  Beer apparently causes semen to have a bad taste.
> On the plus side though, pineapple juice (while not only tasting good)
> makes semen taste sweet.  Also, 'fake' sugar like NutraSweet and Equal,
> and the sweeteners found in drinks like diet coke, apparently pass
> through the body unprocessed, and will come out of the body in their
> original form.  This can make semen have a sweet taste also.
