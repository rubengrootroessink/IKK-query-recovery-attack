Matt-

     We will be around Sunday & sunday night, so call then.. I won a night
at the Hotel Monaco downtown at a bridal show, so I didn't tell Max & I
upgraded it to a suite with hot tub & all, so we are staying there Sat. &
sat. nite, getting massages and I made reserv. at Panzano's for
dinner...that will be our Valentine's day, since we were both exhausted
last nite.  Hope he likes it...he bought "the ring"...so he has "get out of
jail card" for every holiday this year, i told him...:)
  What did you do to piss off your girlfriend at dinner? Nothing a few
flowers & back massage can't take care of,...
Take care-
jen
