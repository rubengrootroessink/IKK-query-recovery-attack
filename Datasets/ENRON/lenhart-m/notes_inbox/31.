what kind of books are you looking to read?  

the line was this: "those pants are making me hungry."  and unfortunately my 
witty come-back came the next morning when i remembered the dipshit telling 
me this. too little, too late! it would have been nice to embarrass him in 
front of his friends.  i hope i dont need to tell you not to use this.
