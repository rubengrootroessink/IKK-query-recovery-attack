i am sure they are.  houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.  economy should be good here.

hopefully she doesn't hose you.

I'll probably start looking next weekend. I heard that more may be going up
for sale in the next month or do. Someone told me that Chase is planning a
shitload of layoffs. I am not sure how reliable that is, though.

      Are you going in or stay here? May not be bad to save a trip since it
   is
      supposed to rain (50%) during the game. Then again, if we win, it
   would
      be
      one that I'd be pissed for missing. If you drive in, my mom will have
      some
      gumbo for us on Sunday.

      Thanks,

      Mitch Marcantel
