sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon.

Monday was a complete wash.  I got there at 12:00 and only 2 others were there.  When I talked to you and you said you were on your way, we hung up and my phone died.  I tried to remember any number I could to try and get a hold of you, but I always use speed dial and don't know any numbers.  Boone has a private number.  I got your message on my voice mail at 12:30, but you didn't leave a number.  I think I know where you guys went wrong with the directions.  I bet you went south on JFK instead of north.  The first light you come to on the north side is Greens.  Then you take a right and it's a 1/4 mile on the right.  We will plan another outing, but at a course you know how to get to.

By the way, I shot a 92.  I was so hung over I was sweating scotch.  I did drive a par 4.  Was about 340 yards (missed the eagle, got the par).
