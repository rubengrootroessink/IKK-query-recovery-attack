Subject:=09Re: Blanchard


As we all know, Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU.  While livin=
g in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h=
e was hanging out with say "Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!"  Blanchard,=
 being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of =
the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant "All greek girl=
s are good in bed."  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the f=
irst GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant y=
ears, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and =
his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advi=
ce (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with=
 the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to=
 start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al=
l give it up like it was going out o! f style. =20
=20
Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of yo=
u who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that i=
s Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wed=
ding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of =
town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot=
her on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd=
ing, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s=
peak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mo=
m asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half Engli=
sh and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded "I do not care.  I will be=
 listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway."  I know what some of y=
ou are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only w=
eekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been =
to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orlea=
ns have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a don=
e deal, and we are all happy for the couple.

The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have=
 it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a w=
edding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fes=
t!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would =
leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw'=
 Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hittin=
g, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Pan=
ama Jack hat, his         "Geaux Dinar-deaux" T-shirt, his jams, and his bl=
ack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is s=
tuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.=
99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)
The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.) =
 Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, mayb=
e play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing fo=
r an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go "clubbin'", as I am sure =
The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Sat=
urday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, =
drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch a=
nd bet on College Football all day.
Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not =
doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find=
 out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instea=
d, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be de=
termined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im=
pression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore=
, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us=
 have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart =
will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl=
ow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered ch=
eating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.
This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with w=
hen you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until the=
n.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September wil=
l be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that m=
y boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if deb=
auchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for=
 him periodically throughout the weekend.
For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for=
 you.  "Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do i=
s return the favor."
For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an exc=
use. "Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want oth=
er people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs." =
 For all of you single guys, no excuse.
Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see y=
a'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to=
 send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to al=
l'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message. =
 I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Busines=
s School, but I think you could learn from some of our lessons, such as it =
is better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mo=
uth and remove all doubt.)
=20
Hope this e-mail finds you doing well.
