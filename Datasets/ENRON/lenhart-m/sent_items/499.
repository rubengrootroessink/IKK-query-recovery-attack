Matt-

 Hey there!  Have you recovered from the Big Bash yet??  Heard you put on a
kickass party...I heard ALL the details..:)  Anyway,  as it is now close to
January, Max wants me to send an email to you to pass on to all the ushers
(Peder, Ryan, Scott &  Merlin) since you have their email addresses.
Florida in January is pretty busy, so you definately want to book your
hotel reservations NOW...you don't need a deposit yet, I don't think, you
just need to hold a room.  Here is the info. on the hotel where everyone is
staying (where we got group rates), also this is where the Rehearsal Dinner
& the Sunday brunch are...the wedding is down the street, so you guys may
just want one rental car for all of you.  I think Thursday afternoon  is
when you will all go to the Tux place in North Miami to try on your tuxes &
make sure that the measurments are right when they still have enough time
to make any adjustments.  Friday, during the day, Max will have something
planned for you guys...

Please start getting your measurements now & we will send you another email
when we find the place for you to call in your measurements in Miami.  Call
with any questions (303) 832-8160....The hotties in Miami are waiting for
you...

The Miami Beach Ocean Resort
3025 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach
1-800-550-0505

*Say you are with the Harris/Schrutt wedding for group rates of:
$160/night - city view      $200/night - ocean view


If you need a travel agent, we have used June Schram with Young Travel
previously at 1-800-426-9968 & again,  say you are with our wedding
party...

Take care & be safe.....Jen
