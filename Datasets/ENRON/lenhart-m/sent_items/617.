      i think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get their

      kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were
      shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel.

            it depends what type you get.  if you get one of those little
      furry
         dogs
            that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that
      dog.
         if
            you
            get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my
   place.
         those
            little furry dogs act like cats.
