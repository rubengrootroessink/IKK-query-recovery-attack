i just don't know if they can ever handle that defense.  they didn't make any good adjustments in the 3rd period.

I don't think the Avs are done. They looked shitty last night, as soon as
the Devils got that 2nd goal they played the trap defense. The Avs could
barely handle the puck all night. If they were at the top of their game they
could have scored at least one more goal against that defense. We'll see.

   I am going to work on site at a conversion building. It should be a good
   pay
   increase and I will get a ton of experience. I only have to work 11-6.
   I'll
   have to work weekends but have a couple of days off during the week. I
   have
   to work the Bronco games this year, Damon said he had to work them last
   year
   on another project so it is my turn. I'll just bring a little TV in to
   watch. It should be pretty cool. Are you going to N. Dakota in a couple
   of
   weeks?

      They looked unbeatable. The Devils looked like shit but if the Avs
   play
      like
      that, there is no way they will be beat. Tonight will be a big game.
