my friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street.

reason, i can't remember.
