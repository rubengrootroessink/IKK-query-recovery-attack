I'd like to go to the game, but I'm scheduled to be here on Sunday afternoon
to finish a project that goes live on Tuesday morning. I don't know if I
want to chance it with a deadline. I'd have to leave right after the game
and leave crowley early the next morning. Also, a shitload of construction
went up on i-10 this weekend b/w Lake Charles and Crowley. traffic would be
bad again. fuch it, it's on the deuce anyway.

   I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you
   and I
   didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first
   half
   to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
   stripper to go back to your place with you?

   Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
   8:00p.

   Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are
   staying
   here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

   Thanks,

   Mitch Marcantel
