Matt,
To refresh your memory from Friday night, I got laid off and am doing independent work right now.  Although the money is good, the stability is a factor. So, if there is anyone you might know at Enron to help me get an interview for that associate program, I would appreciate it.  My resume is attached.  Thanks for helping me out.  Take care.

P.S.  LSU preseason ranked #8 in CBS Sportsline power poll.  Not sure how I feel about that.
