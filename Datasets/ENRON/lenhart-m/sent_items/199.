i tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look?  st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time.
