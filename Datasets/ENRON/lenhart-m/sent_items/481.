Please trade smaller in the future.  You are doing a great job making the markets  PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.  Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.  Make a move to get closer to your VAR.

You are the King.
