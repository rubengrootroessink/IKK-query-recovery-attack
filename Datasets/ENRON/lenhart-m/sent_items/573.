                           that's your fault.  you were taking up over half

               i
                  had

                           you to move over.  and then you kept coughing in

                           and
                           waking me up. so, i did not sleep well. you
      probably
            slept
                  better
                        than
                           me, i
                           don't know what you're complaining about.
