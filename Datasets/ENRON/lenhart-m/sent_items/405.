 only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you wouldn't let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just venting frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober.

i only rolled back over once.  i said i was sorry for saying i wished you
were dead, i was just kidding, and i wouldn't have to vent for so long if
you wouldn't give me reasons to.  some of the things you said last night
were pretty rude.

you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who said
you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.  you
were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours.
