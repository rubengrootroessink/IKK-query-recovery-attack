Watch the Tigers Maul Middle Tennessee State!
LSU vs. Middle Tennessee State - November 10th, 2001 @ 7:00pm
Since the game is only available via satellite, come out and watch the game
at Woodrow's!

(For those who can't make Woodrow's, Nick's Place will also show the game)

(Note that parking will be available in the office building next door as
well as the normal areas - coming from Richmond, go past the office
building next to Woodrow's and take a right to get to the parking garage.
Parking is available for cars and small SUV's - due to clearance
restrictions, large vehicles are not allowed to park in the garage)
