what, did you not mean to cc: me on that?  

anyway, about the girl.  i dont know why i dont think she is your type.  the more i think about it the more i notice that you really dont have a type - so who knows.  the game was good, we lost 6-2.  4 of the padres runs were homeruns. we suck.

Lets try to replay MLK day at Front Porch Sunday night.  Unfortunately it will probably be crowded since everyone has Memorial Day off.
