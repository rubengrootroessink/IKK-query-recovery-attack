i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip?

Funny Ross,

Hey I saw that Lenhart has made his way to our email bullshit, thanks for
giving us a call this weekend when you were in town. By the way can we all
stay at your house when we are in Denver!
I promise to have Robicheaux tested before your Maw gets hit by the banjo!
