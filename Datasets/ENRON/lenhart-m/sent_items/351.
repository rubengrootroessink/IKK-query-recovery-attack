i was kidding about your friends...besides- i
definately do not have room to talk.
i guess you didn't remember, i have a "wedding" on
saturday?  i have to be in h-town on fri. for the
rehearsal.  sucks. you'll have fun though- do you come
to austin a lot?  next time i'm in houston will
probably be father's day.

i've had just about enough of this place for one day,
so i'm going home now...
have a good day
