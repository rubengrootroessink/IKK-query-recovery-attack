      nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be at
   a
      resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque
   dance
      clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay
   back
      in
      the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

      does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans
   and
      they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either
      place
      will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.

         I'd rather go to the caymans personally.  Miami sucks.

         she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans
   on
         the
         plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would
      spend
         over a grand each.    miami will rock.
