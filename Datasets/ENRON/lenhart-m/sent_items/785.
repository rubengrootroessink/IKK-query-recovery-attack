         no problem.  instead of a golf allowance though, i think i'll just
      get
         you a
         membership somewhere.  wouldn't that be better?  just let me know
   so
      i
         can
         arrange it.

         sweet.  i need a golf allowance then.   i can drink beer every
   night
      and
         golf all day while you work.  that would be so sweet of you.  i
   cant
         wait
         to do that.

            you don't need to work at denny's.  you know, i make a lot of
      money,
            more
            than i can spend, so there's really no reason why you can't
   just
      live
            off of
            my salary for a while.  shouldn't be a problem, i usually just
      give
         half
            of
            it away to charity anyway.
