As gameday approaches I'm seriously considering driving in for the game Sat
morning . . . Everyone I know is gonna be in BR this weekend . . . It's
going to be an awesome game and BR will be fun as hell sat night . . . I
think Hull is leaning toward doing that as well . . . why don't you suck it
up and come along for the ride . . . we've got 4 tix between Mitch, You,
Hull, and me, so we're covered there . . . we can stay at my buddy's house
who lives right off Acadian . . . There will be a ton of hot ass out  in BR
. . .
