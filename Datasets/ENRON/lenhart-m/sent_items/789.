daily dose on enron - 

we are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.

Since work has gone to hell, I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl (if Rohan "Alabama" Davey shows up for
the next 3 games.)  However, do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season.
