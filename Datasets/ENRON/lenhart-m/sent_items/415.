who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls.

Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

cjrob
