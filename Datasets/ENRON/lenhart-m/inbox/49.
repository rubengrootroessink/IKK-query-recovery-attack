E] TOTALS       38.0  NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player=
 News  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Brunell is question=
able for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his statu=
s has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He w=
ill be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him=
 on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie U=
pdated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surge=
ry in time for Sunday's game agai! ns! t Miami. He will practice this week =
before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have=
 him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy value=
s.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole has bruised ri=
bs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Mia=
mi. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver=
 passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/=
27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's g=
ame against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start K=
evin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery =
from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Jackso=
n's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine =
his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel Whit=
e would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CI=
N - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday =
he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two fie=
ld-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jare=
t Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely r=
etain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fa=
ntasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might =
be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . "I=
f that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,=
" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. H=
e's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that =
he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry Allen , RB BAL =
- Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could re=
turn to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an =
injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once health=
y. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a dee=
per league.  ! Moe Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams=
 becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If y=
ou play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider pi=
cking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats un=
less the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated=
 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone=
 in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and poss=
ibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting runn=
ing back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.  Way=
ne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Mo=
nday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports th=
at he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Ag=
ent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has sig=
ned Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updat=
ed 1! 1/! 27/01 Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn l=
igament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he re=
ceived the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician=
. "I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well," Mora said. =
James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tack=
led awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on in=
jured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven mo=
nths. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason mini=
camps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready =
for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 11/=
27/01  Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a h=
amstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps th=
e end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill Belich=
ick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be=
 better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes by, it get=
s a little bit closer."      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/=
27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after =
Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami D=
olphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start =
of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 A=
lexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Su=
nday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Ra=
sby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a de=
eper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ne=
al/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, playe=
d in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 ya=
rds in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suff=
ered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "It's thr=
obbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't really sleep last =
night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtf=
ul for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.  =
   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a spraine=
d right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays wer=
e negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a prot! ec! tive boot as a precau=
tion. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be i=
n the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomas=
on , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended=
 knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and=
 is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has=
 very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks d=
ue to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 1=
2 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any =
event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has =
been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his =
status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the tea=
m will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogeh=
ter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Stewart, who suffer=
ed a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to=
 be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy num=
bers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running =
back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - =
Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is =
expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "Th=
is is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a litt=
le bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would=
 expect him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose snaps to rook=
ie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Ja=
ckie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week'=
s game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is l=
isted as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Up! da! ted 11/27/0=
1 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncer=
tain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing wit=
h a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoo=
ver , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be hel=
d out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll b=
e available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR =
- Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions,=
 Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "There've been qua=
rterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through tim=
es like this," coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. "Even thou=
gh there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have=
 been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more benefic=
ial than not." While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke=
 isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR AR=
I - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San=
 Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' We=
ek 12 matchup at Oakland. However! , ! he is optimistic that he'll be avail=
able for the game. "I'll be there," Sanders told the Arizona Republic. "The=
y're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear a=
nd tear." In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea ag=
ainst the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 11=
/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week=
, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progr=
ess," coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. "We're going to come t=
o a point where we're going to have to make a decision." Moore, who has mis=
sed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve=
 list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM In=
