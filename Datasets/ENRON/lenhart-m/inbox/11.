Dear MATTHEW LENHART:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot program.
NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC)
that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly over the summer months.
A more gradual timetable for processing switches from your local utility to
energy service providers, such as NewPower, will help to ensure a seamless
transition between energy suppliers for the thousands of Texans who have
enrolled in the program.

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up. Better yet, to thank you for your patience,
we're sending your enrollment incentive early! Instead of processing it
upon receipt of your first bill payment, we're processing it immediately.
You should receive it within the next few weeks.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th. In the meantime, NewPower
will send a welcome letter notifying you of the effective date of your
NewPower service.  If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the
Public Utility Commission's website at http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_49_6425
or call NewPower at 1-877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call
1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

Nick Utton
Chief Marketing Officer
