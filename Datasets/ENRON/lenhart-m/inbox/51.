ated 11/27/01 San Diego Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he is optimi=
stic Jones will be able to play Sunday. He has been sidelined by an ankle i=
njury.  Wade Richey , K SD - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Richey is likely t=
o lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if they sign Steve C=
hristie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after=
 he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-30 on the ! se! a=
son. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.  Steve Christie=
 , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/27/01 The Chargers are expected to sig=
n Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a physical, according to the San D=
iego Union-Tribune. He would handle the field-goal chores for the remainder=
 of the season, with Wade Richey shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey o=
wner and need a kicker, Christie might be worth a pickup based on past hist=
ory, but don't expect him to be one of the better kickers in the league eve=
n if he does get the starting job.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Top Dogs Update=
d 11/27/01 Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the=
 third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain =
in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's pr=
obably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terr=
ell Davis , RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to ret=
urn from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game against Miami.=
 He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skep=
tical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting=
 both players' Fantasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/27/01 Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines f=
or Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start =
in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith =
, WR DEN - Baja Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is =
questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Br=
oncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending=
 on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-ev=
aluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tenness=
ee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson=
 can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head=
 Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status=
 of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in fi=
eld goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad sinc=
e Nov. 1. Ra! ck! ers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against =
Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  A=
kili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick L=
eBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, accord=
ing to The Cincinnati Enquirer. "If that's what they're going to do, maybe =
the Bengals need to get rid of me," Smith said, citing a desire to be trade=
d if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, alt=
hough it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna=
 gets hurt.  Terry Allen  , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who=
 remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. Wit=
h the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Alle=
n takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the r=
oom on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.  Moe Williams , RB BAL=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back a=
fter the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are de=
sperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shou=
ldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable. =
 Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on=
 Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will =
sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. M=
oe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth a=
dding to your roster in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Fear Upd=
ated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury=
. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sund=
ay's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has b=
een released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.=
   Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/27/01 Colts coach Jim=
 Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was su=
ccessful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he received the news from orthopedic=
 surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke with him Saturday an=
d he told me it went very well," Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing=
 champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwa! rd! ly late in a gam=
e at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. Ja=
mes' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to=
 take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill =
Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training c=
amp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could=
 be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury so=
on. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patri=
ots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill Belichick said Monday wh=
en asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on s=
omeone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit clo=
ser! ."!   Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo =
Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was re=
leased following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham ha=
d been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season.   S=
tephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who has =
been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't st=
art, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flem=
ister for the rest of the season. Unless you! p! lay in a deeper league, dr=
opping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 1=
1/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night'=
s 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game.  =
 Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a dislo=
cated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Bar=
low told the Contra Costa Times . "I couldn't really sleep last night. I ha=
d to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sund=
ay's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.     Terrell =
Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a sprained ri=
ght foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were ne=
gative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a precaution. He=
 is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the st=
arting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE =
PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee du=
ring Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is stat=
us for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very li=
ttle value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Update=
d 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a =
thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remain=
s unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.  =
 Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Rocks Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all =
year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with t=
he Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either=
 activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter.   James =
Stewart , RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/27/01 Stewart, who suffered a=
 neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be =
available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers=
 against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back=
 in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Rock=
s Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press, Batch is expected t=
o start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "This is Char=
lie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a little bit tod=
ay...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect hi=
m close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike=
 McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Jackie Harri=
s , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week's game aga=
inst Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as d=
ay to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Accordin=
g to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In f=
act, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstr=
ing injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB C=
AR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of p=
ractice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be availabl=
e for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright=
