ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a
country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of
a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire
journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or
destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed
stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special
contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the
liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death
of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven
damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up
to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier.
The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and
costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is
made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum
of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers
traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey
not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of
America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers
is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.
The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at
all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a
private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the
carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of
carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance
company representative.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher
value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most
international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys)
the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and
$400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S.
points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to
be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on
certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile,
valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from
the carrier.

CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED
A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR
REGULATIONS
SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS

NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS
Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of
contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any
inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms
and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.
	Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S.
(including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the
individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein
incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage.
Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with
the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not
restricted to:
1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death.
2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods,
and availability of excess valuation coverage.
3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file
a claim or bring an action against the air carrier.
4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.
5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to
carry.
6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to
perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air
carriers or aircraft and rerouting.
You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S.
location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.
	You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air
carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the
right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the
applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air
carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms
is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.

NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
	Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that
a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there
are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in
accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions
persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The
complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.

RECONFIRMATION NOTICE
Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations.
Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.
