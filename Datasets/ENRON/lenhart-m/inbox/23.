> God is in our pledge, our National Anthem, nearly every patriotic song,

  as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis. If God offends

  home, because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him. 
> 
> We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our 
> freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and 
  Flag Day. We have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our 
  flag. 
> As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national anthem,

  choose.

  lifestyle.

> Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion

  griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,  I 
  highly encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom, the 
  right to leave.
