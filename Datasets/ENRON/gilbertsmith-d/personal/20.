Gentlemen,
    As you probably know, my  brother Rich is jumping on the matrimonial hand-grenade this August 25.  To  provide him with sage-like advice and help him prepare (in what may be called a  double-vision quest) for his day of reckoning, my brothers and I are planning to  take Rich on a pre-wedding retreat. In all likelihood this weekend will be the  last one of July (27-29), with the first one of August (3-5) as a backup  date.  The locale will probably be Lake Travis outside of Austin (see www.bartoncreek.com  for more information  about accommodations).  Early morning golf, swimming, evening entertainment  in Austin are the planned activities.
    Certainly more information  will be forth coming, but if joining Rich for this weekend is something you  would be interested in doing, then please contact me.  My home # is  860-435-1389.  My emails are tom_pastore@indianmountain.org   and pastore@discovernet.net   .   I hope to hear from you.
 
Tom Pastore
