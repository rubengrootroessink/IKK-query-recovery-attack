Frank-

Doug is actually out of the office today, but I wanted to check with you and see where we are at on the issue of revising his correlations in the VaR engine.  The VaR for the Ercot desk is $6 million today (limit of $5 million), so I know he is anxious to resolve this.

Thanks!

Andrea

Doug,
Is this the same function used in Enpower's port calc?  As an aside, Mike brought up a point that the correl excel function is using actual prices, similar to calc'ing pnl using price instead of price change?seems like "correl" should be operating off second layer of data, ie. log returns or price changes?(variance, covariance)  

Out of due diligence, we should confirm that this is not the same function/operation utilized by valuation engine?(let's cross fingers)

Please keep me posted.
Thanks,
Frank

Here are the correlations for selected term structures. Please feel free to ask for further info if necessary. Based on this, it looks like moving the correlations closer to 70-80% would be prudent while still being conservative.

Thanks,

Doug
