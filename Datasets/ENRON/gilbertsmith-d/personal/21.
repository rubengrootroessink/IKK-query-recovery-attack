Hi Doug-E-Gee,

I haven't chatted with you in a while and wanted to catch up.  How are thin=
gs back at the factory?  I heard about some changes over there - are they r=
eally not going to trade Southeast?  That sounds like a bunch of crap.  Wha=
t's the story there?  I can't say that I miss all that although I just have=
n't had a chance to get frustrated with things here.  I'm sure that will co=
me soon enough.  Actually things have been as good as could be expected (wo=
rk-wise).  I like the people in my group and have made some good progress i=
n getting everything in place.  The true test will come once the business r=
amps up, but at least in theory I'm on the right track (hopefully). =20
Enough about yucky work.  I think I've found a place in South Ken.  It's no=
t perfect (and very expensive), but it meets enough of my criteria to justi=
fy calling off the search.  It will be great to have that part of the move =
completely done.  I'm scheduled to move in on Monday provided I can get an =
advance in ?'s.  My first paycheck doesn't come until May 20, but I always =
assumed I would get my bonus right away.  Not the case.  I don't want to me=
ss with transferring dollars at this point.  Anyway, huge pain in the ass, =
but it should work out.  When do you think you might be able to join Killia=
n on a trip over?  I promise to be more fun than your grumpy little brother=
.  We're supposed to go out on Friday and were starting to plan the details=
.  Of course his new girlfriend freaked out and insisted on meeting us afte=
r dinner.  Based on my last (and only) experience, I can definitely do with=
out that.  I told Jamie that my weekends were too precious to deal with a b=
unch of shit like that.  Anyway, we may still have dinner, but I'm out afte=
r that.  I'm going to meet Stacey in Paris on Saturday.  Should be fun to t=
ake the train over (not in a hijacking way). =20
Tracey was in town last weekend.  She was so excited that I took her to a T=
ex-Mex place since she hasn't found anything good in NY.  Aren't you going =
there in mid-June?  Clark, Tori and Laura (as in Bubby and) are coming here=
 over Memorial Day.  We're going to fly to Venice for a few nights then com=
e back to London for the last night of their trip.  Laura forgot (hmmmm) ab=
out a charity event commitment she has scheduled for that weekend, so she m=
ay not make it after all.  Of course the tickets (purchased by moi) are non=
-refundable, non-transferrable.  Looks like a romantic weekend for three! =
=20
Hope all is going well.  Sorry you're not coming over with Killian although=
 we can be extra-naughty this way.  Jenny.
