I can get this moving as soon as we have the company identity and bank info in hand.  Bill Rust has all the forms in a file and a list of the items we will need to complete the forms.  Smith will work with ERCOT to get the testing started.  We also need a check for $500 to start.

Charles, 

Is this in your capable hands? Obviously I would like to get this up and running asap. 

Thanks,
