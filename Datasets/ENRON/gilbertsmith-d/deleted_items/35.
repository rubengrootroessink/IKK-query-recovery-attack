Since we have entered into a new year and new issues to address, TxSET will
be changing the day and time of the weekly change control conference calls.
The new time will be each Friday at 10AM. Any change controls are questions
will need to submitted no later than Mondays to be presented on the Friday
call. We appreciate all your input into the TxSET design.  Talk to ya'll
Friday February 1st.
