In an effort to determine any transaction changes that may be required to
support the Muni/Co-ops we are asking that you develop any questions that
you feel need to be answered.  This is especially important for the CRs.
Please submit your questions to Rita.Morales@exolink.com.  She will compile
the questions and send to the TxSET list serve.  Please have all questions
to Rita by Friday February 8th.  Thanks for your careful consideration of
the issues.
