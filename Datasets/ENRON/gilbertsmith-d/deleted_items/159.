Clint,

Not sure that is the right way to go about it as it is not what people are looking for off the bat. I would focus on the resume.

Hope you had a good New Year.

Take care,

Doug

Doug,
Would you be able to write a recommendation for me?  I want to have
something to attach to my resume that I am emailing out to companies.  I am
looking for something that will help me stand out from all the other
ex-Enron people out there looking for jobs in Houston.  Anything you could
provide would be very appreciated.  Thanks for your help.

Clint
