Kyle,

Hot topics make it even more important to reschedule this meeting.

We get into problems by rushing into making decisions when we are not
prepared.  We decide something without the correct information and then
later, after we spend resources on this, we make additional changes which
cost additional resources.

One week would not hurt us.  In my opinion, it makes sense to take an extra
week or so to have the information provided up front for review and get
prepared for a meeting.

Also, it is hard to rearrange a work schedule at the last minute.

Some people who might want to attend/participate may not be able to do so.
There may not be anyone from Entergy attending and participating.  And, as
you know, we do attend and participate.

Dave,
We have too many hot topics to let this get pushed.  Sorry about the
short notice, but I think SET really needs this meeting this week.  Just
my opinion though.
Thanks,
Kyle

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.

Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.

There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have
some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.

Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?
