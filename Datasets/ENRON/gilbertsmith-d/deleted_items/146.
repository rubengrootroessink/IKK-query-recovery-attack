Dave,

Johnny and I had some folks do some checking and, they retracted their
first statement about the premise type being in production.  It is not
being sent right now.

Subject:  Premise Type

Johnny/Paul, I followed up with IT to determine how quickly we could get
the Premise Type removed from the 814_04 and found out that Registration is
not sending the field on the 814_04.

CR #1176, which added the Premise Type to the 814_04 for Texas SET v1.4,
shows a status of complete.  However, the CR is not complete as
Registration is unable to send the field on the 814_04 until the 814_04
implementation guide is complete.

In short, we should not have to make any changes to remove functionality.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Paul
