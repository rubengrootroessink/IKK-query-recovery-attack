We have an issue.   Example:   A customer calls the CR and states that they
need to have their meter removed   ( temporary meter for construction).
The meter is the only meter on the ESI-ID.  So the CR needs to send a
move-out 814_24 request.  Originally, the market stated that the CR would
place remarks of "Please remove meter".  Problem is that the 814_24 does
not have an text segment for any type of remarks.   Version 1.5 should have
a remove-meter request segment.  However, in the mean time what should we
do.  I suggest that the CR send in the 814_24 move-out request and after
receipt of the 814_25 they call the TDSP and ask that the meter be removed.
