Also, there are bankruptcy issues associated with transferring something from Enron to Netco and the license may not be transferable.  Charles is going to check further as to exactly what would be transferred and what (software?) costs are associated with this.  Thanks.

A question, am I correct that the LSE status being referred to is NOT EPMI - if so, is it with EES?  or what entity?

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Thanks,

Doug

I am researching with ERCOT staff, the timing requirements for QSE, LSE and TCR registration.  They are not on the website.
