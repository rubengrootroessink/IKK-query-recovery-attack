Dave,
We have too many hot topics to let this get pushed.  Sorry about the
short notice, but I think SET really needs this meeting this week.  Just
my opinion though.
Thanks,
Kyle

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.

Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.

There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have
some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.

Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?
