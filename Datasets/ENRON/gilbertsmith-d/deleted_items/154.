Christi

Here is a compehensive list for TX power marketer, aggregator and REP registration.

Note - I spoke with Jan Bergan at the PUCT and got clarification that there is no official form or PUCT registration response time requirements to be a TX power marketer.  NETCO may operate as a power marketer without any PUCT approvals. Aggregator and REP certs are more stringent.
