RMS decided at its last meeting to select January 29th as the starting date for the 867.03 Contingency Plan.  One of the activities during the trail use of this plan was to conduct a conference call with MPs to kick-off this effort.  Late this afternoon, we were able to resolve some coordination miss-cues which resulted in this late meeting notice, and to that extent, I apologized to everyone. 
Tuesday, January 29th at  10am - 11am CDT will be the kick-off conference call.  The phone number is 1-800-373-0950 with an Access Code of 1014.  The suggested agenda is: 
Market Participant Roll Call; Don Bender 
Sign Off of Test Plan; Shirley Whyte 
Readiness of TDSPs to Implement; TDSPs 
CR Readiness to Receive 867.03's from TDSPs; CR 
CR Reconciliation of TDSP & ERCOT Information; Don Bender 
Next Call
