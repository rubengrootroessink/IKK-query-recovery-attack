Again I apologize for the sending the notice so late.  We just got our wires crossed.........hopefully this won't happen in the future.  Regardless, I beg that all will make an exception this time, since most of you knew that we were planning on these dates!

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.
Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.
There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss. 
Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?
