The tentative plan is to have me working in the Fundamentals Group.  Of course, as with most things of late, there are no guarantees.  On a different note, I spoke with Alex regarding the load aggregation/portfolio piece.  It was not intended to be part of pSim, but it's development was not completed, so that may not really matter.
