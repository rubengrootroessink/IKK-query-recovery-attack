In an earlier note this week, you receive information on Protocol Revision Subcommittee's (PRS) next meeting scheduled for January 28 -29, 2002 at ERCOT's Met Center.  Most of their two day agenda is to prioritize all the received system change requests.  RMS will have a number of  Texas SET representatives there and some companies are sending additional employees who are familiar with our Protocol Revision Requests (PRR).  Susan Neel, Texas SET Chair, will be our primary representative.  If you are sending additional representatives, please inform Susan who will be attending from your company. 
Subsequent to my earlier note, I received a request from the PRS Chair for RMS to collectively as a subcommittee, prioritized all RMS approved PRRs.  That list was to be submitted to PRS this afternoon.  I expressed my concerns to the PRS Chair of the short turn around time on this request (48 hours) and the challenges RMS voting members and RMS market participants will face in accomplishing this with such short notice.  Come to find out, PRS' see the PRR prioritization process as just getting started, with additional opportunities for RMS to provide input on our priorities.  Thus, no harm done for now by not prioritizing our PRRs.   
Susan Neel will provide us an update from this PRS meeting at our January 31st RMS meeting.  At that time, we may need to develop a process for RMS to prioritize its PRRs.
