Blair to let EU arrest Brits
By GEORGE -PASCOE-WATSON
Deputy Political Editor


TONY Blair was last night slammed for handing EU judges the power to arrest
British citizens on trumped-up charges over laws which do not EXIST in the
UK.

The PM will sign up to an EU-wide arrest warrant today - despite warnings
that it is open to abuse and a massive surrender of power.

It will mean that anyone can be seized and handed over to a EU country to
face trial, even if they have done nothing wrong under British laws.

Last night the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues said British
citizens will be at the mercy of third rate legal systems like Greece and
Portugal.

Vice President Michel Tubiana said: "It presupposes that all judicial
systems function well.

"All you can say with certainty is that NO system functions perfectly.

"One cannot rule out the possibility that the European arrest warrant could
be widened to other crimes, or abused.

"There is no guarantee preventing this."

Last night Downing Street brushed off the attack and insisted Mr Blair will
OK the deal.

It means that people can be arrested in Britain on any one of 32 measures at
the whim of foreign magistrates.
They include offences like xenophobia and swindling.

British police officers will be expected to arrest citizens on the orders of
the foreign courts - a huge change in the UK's constitution.

The idea is part of the international crackdown on global terrorism.

It ensures that suspects will be fast-tracked to justice and barred from
using the appeals system to stay ahead of the law.

But critics want to know why many crimes have been included which have
nothing to do with terrorism.

Rape is on the list - a crime easy to allege but often difficult to prove.

Yet under the plan, "suspects" would have NO right to challenge evidence put
forward for their extradition by a
foreign magistrate.

All 15 EU leaders will sign the pact during talks in Laeken, Belgium.

MPs here will not get a chance to debate the measure until it becomes part
of a new Extradition Bill in February.

   Doug:

   Here's a bit about something that's fairly scary.  I'm sure Bruce must
   have
   a few pointed words about this type of thing...

   Hang in there...


   Later,
   Rich
