Again I apologize for the sending the notice so late.  We just got  our wires crossed.........hopefully this won't happen in the future.   Regardless, I beg that all will make an exception this time, since most  of you knew that we were planning on these dates!

It is hard  to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.
Want to  attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.
There are a lot  of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material  which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.  
Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?
