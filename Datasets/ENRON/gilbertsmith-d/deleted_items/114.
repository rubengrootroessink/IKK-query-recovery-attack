Former Enron Executives Launch Celeren Corp.

PHILADELPHIA -(Dow Jones)- Several former Enron Corp. (ENE) executives launched Celeren Corp., a new company formed to provide risk management energy services through the sale of energy outsource products and independent power generation services. 
In a press release Monday, Celeren said it will guarantee long-term fixed costs rather than the traditional saving guarantees offered by most energy service companies in the market. It will focus on small- to mid-sized businesses and institutions where it sees the most growth. 
Thomas A. Brigger, formerly Mid-Atlantic regional manager for Enron Energy Services' energy outsource fulfillment operation, will serve as Celeren's president and chief executive. 
Donald S. Parker, previously Mid-Atlantic regional director, asset risk management, for Enron Energy Services, will serve as Celeren's chief operating officer and on the company's board. 
Brigger and Parker, along with other members of Celeren's executive team, left Enron in July to start Celeren. 
"We created Celeren Corp. as a nimble energy company that will serve the unique risk management and energy utilization challenges faced by today's small-and mid-sized businesses by offering a valuable financial instrument," Brigger said in a statement.
