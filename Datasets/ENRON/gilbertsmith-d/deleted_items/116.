RMS chair has expressed concerns over the number of calls he has been receiving on the confusion with the 867_03 contingency. 
If you have technical concerns or issues with the RMS approved 867_03 contingency plan, it is imperative that you email those concerns to me or Heidi (heidi.schrab@greenmountain.com) by close of business today! 
The texas Set group that is meeting in Austin tomorrow and Wednesday to begin data gathering for version 1.5, will  address your issues/concerns as the first agenda item for tomorrow. We will email the results of this discussion on Tuesday afternoon.
