I think the confusion begins with the fact that the contingency plan was developed before the 824 work group met to develop the plan.  Don Bender worked on the contingency plan and will bring this issue up at the RMS meeting tomorrow.

I agree that the Contingency Plan will need to be updated if this change
control is approved.

I have a clarification question.
As I understand this question relates to change control #2001-232 which is
to have all 824's for 867's go point-to-point instead of thru ERCOT.  The
notes say that it is hoped that this process will be implemented by
mid-January.
In some of the last notes I saw from the RMS 867 Contigency Plan - the plan
referenced that 824's for 867 rejects would go to ERCOT but 824's for
duplicates would not.
It seems the two are in conflict.  When the change control gets implemented
- is the plan to update the 867 Contigency plan so that no 824's will go to
ERCOT.
In developing our systems we are trying to determine if all 824's will be
point-to-point in the future.
Thanks for any clarification.
Jennifer

    So far, we have only heard from ESG and Reliant regarding their
    readiness.

    Please respond to Cary (careed@aep.com) and me, the results will be
    announced on the change control call next week.
