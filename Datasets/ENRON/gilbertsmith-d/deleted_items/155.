What's up then?
You gathered Bruce never made the connection - Friday's abort was due to
a plane crash in Birmingham backing everything up at Aberdeen and
everywhere else.
Delivered him Saturday night, he overnighted in Aberdeen, checked in for
his 10:35 y/day a.m. and by 3:00 it still hadn't left, so he would have
missed yet another connection in Amsterdam. That was actually OK as I
spoke to the guy in Jordan who said Amman was snowed in!
The good bit is - he's got his appointment with the specialist on
Wednesday afternoon to discuss the knee. I've also booked him in with
the surgery to discuss depression etc.
Tomorrow we are down and up from Glasgow to renew a passport which is
too full to get a new Saudi visa - what a start to the year.
Anyway - let's have your news - thought you were having a meeting today?
lots of love
