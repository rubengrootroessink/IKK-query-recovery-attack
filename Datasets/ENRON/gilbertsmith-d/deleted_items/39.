Subject: PRS 1/28-29 Meeting  Agenda
This forwarded  note announces Protocol Revision Subcommittee's next meeting, which is  scheduled for January 28 - 19, 2002 at ERCOT Met Center.  The first 8  agenda items deal with pending Protocol Revision Requests.  Two PRR's  impact the Retail Market; 304 Unexecutable and 310 Estimating Usage Applied to  Profiles.  The ninth agenda item is for PRS to begin prioritizing systems  changes.  This is a critical activity in defining what changes will be in  v1.5 release. 
Brenda Crockett and  I are actively working on having RMS representation at this meeting.  We  hope to have information for you before the end of this week. This certainly  does not preclude any market participant attending this meeting.  Brenda  and I feel the coordination between PRS and RMS is very critical at this  junction that we what assigned representation at these meetings.
