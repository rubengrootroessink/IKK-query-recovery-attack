Pepco to Supply Electricity in  Maryland
Beginning in July of this year, Pepco Energy Services  will provide electri=
city to sixteen Maryland state agencies. The contract is  worth nearly $65 =
million for 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours, to be provided over a  two year per=
iod. Six percent of the total electricity supply will be generated  from re=
newable resources. This award from the State of Maryland is the latest of  =
$800 million worth of contracts for Pepco's services awarded within the  la=
st two years.
New Mexico Passes Electric Energy Policy
On  January 8th, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) passed=
 a  resolution adopting a new electric energy policy for the state, despite=
 the fact  that the New Mexico legislature had earlier postponed deregulati=
on until  2007. Principles of the NMPRC policy include requiring utilities =
to operate  adequate distribution infrastructure, requesting an in-depth an=
alysis of New  Mexico's transmission system, redesigning retail rates, and =
considering  alternative forms of regulation. Commission staff noted that "=
without  legislative intervention to repeal the restructuring act, the comm=
ission's  energy principles [can] be implemented only on a temporary basis.=

Seven New Power Plants for New Mexico
Five power  companies serving customers in New Mexico have committed to bui=
ld  seven new power plants in the state between now and the inception of  d=
eregulation. These seven plants are expected to generate 2,200 MW of new  e=
lectricity supply. The power companies include Duke Energy, Public Service =
 Company of New Mexico, Tri-State Generation and Transmission, Peabody Ener=
gy,  and Cobisa Corporation, all of which have begun construction or are st=
ill in the  planning stages.

Exelon CEO Supports Continued Deregulation  Efforts
Speaking at an energy conference at the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago, E=
xelon co-CEO John Rowe said that the nation cannot return to  the failed re=
gulatory structures of the past. Referring to Enron's  bankruptcy and Calif=
ornia's energy crisis, Rowe noted that "The grand experiment  has had some =
fairly substantial hiccups, [but] we can't go back to our  grandfather's Ol=
dsmobile." He also urged FERC to establish RTOs and disagreed  with the age=
ncy's November decision to give up price setting responsibility for  three =
large U.S. utilities.

Deregulation ad campaign denounced
The Ontario  government will launch a $2.3-million series of television ads=
 to publicize the  arrival of competition in the electricity market, but th=
e opposition denounces  the campaign as "propaganda." "This isn't about pub=
lic information; this is  about brainwashing," NDP Leader Howard Hampton sa=
id yesterday. "It's just  fundamentally wrong." Mr. Hampton said advertisin=
g industry sources told him the  government was planning five different tel=
evision spots to announce that private  companies will be allowed to sell e=
lectricity to consumers starting May 1. The  government responded that only=
 one ad was produced, as part of a broader  campaign to educate consumers a=
bout their choices under the new system. The  brief piece resembles many of=
 the other ads produced by the Progressive  Conservative government, some o=
f which have been criticized for trying to  bolster public support for cont=
roversial policies. Soft-focus pictures of  smiling people in everyday sett=
ings run underneath a voice track explaining why  deregulation of Ontario's=
 electricity is necessary. "As we grow, we're going to  need more electrici=
ty," says the advertisement's voice-over. "And more companies  generating e=
lectricity." "We're not trying to sell privatization," said Mike  Krizanc, =
a spokesman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology. He  noted t=
hat the ads are part of an education campaign for which the government  has=
 handed out almost a million eight-page pamphlets about changes to the  ele=
ctricity system. Ministry officials are also holding public meetings around=
  the province, particularly with seniors who might be confused about their=
 new  choices. "This is . . . a propaganda campaign to try to turn around p=
ublic  opinion," Mr. Hampton said.
New Requirements for ESCOs in New York
The New  York State Public Service Commission has approved new financial re=
quirements for  energy service companies, or ESCOs. ESCOs doing business in=
 New York will now  have to meet a minimum bond rating from an independent =
rating agency before  offering prepayment plans or requiring security depos=
its. ESCOs that do not earn  the minimum rating will have to put security d=
eposits in escrow or issue an  irrevocable letter of credit; they will not =
be allowed to offer prepayment  plans. PSC Chairwoman Maureen Helmer explai=
ned last week that, "the additional  consumer protections balance key inter=
ests in the energy markets. Specifically,  our administrative flexibility e=
nables us to balance vital consumer interests  with the interest in offerin=
g innovative competitive energy services."
Problems in Texas Leave Customers Without  Electricity
Recent reports of pitfalls in Texas' newly  deregulated electricity market =
note that some customers are being left without  electricity for several da=
ys. Reportedly, deregulation is complicating the way  that orders for new e=
lectricity service are placed and processed, in that  consumers may select =
from a number of retail electricity providers (REPs) when  they decide to o=
rder new service or switch to a different provider. After being  notified b=
y a customer, the provider must contact ERCOT, the Electric  Reliability Co=
uncil of Texas. ERCOT, which is responsible for managing the power  grid, t=
hen notifies the current utility that its customer has opted to change  ser=
vice. Before January 1, 2002, only the regulated utility needed to be  cont=
acted; now there are three different entities involved with the change. The=
  usual wait for a service change had been 24 to 48 hours. Now, it typicall=
y takes  two to five days. The Houston Chronicle is reporting that one Hous=
ton family  endured 10 days without electricity while waiting for power in =
their new  apartment. Tom Noel, ERCOT's president and chief executive offic=
er, explained  that "we've traded off reduced rates for a little less conve=
nience. In other  words, in the past when there was a monopoly utility in t=
his city, they  [consumers] made one phone call, and that was the only part=
y they needed to  call." This issue had impacted enough consumers to cause =
the state's Public  Utility Commission to place it on the agenda at last we=
ek's open meeting. Terry  Hadley, a spokesman for the Austin-based commissi=
on, said that the delays are of  concern to the commission and that it is l=
ooking to improve the process.
Cost of Ontario Hydro subsidies revealed
Fearful  that competition would lead to sharply higher electricity prices, =
a group of  Ontario industrial companies persuaded the province to give the=
m a subsidy  extension worth up to $197-million. Records on the size of the=
 subsidy were  obtained by Canadian newspaper "The Globe and Mail" through =
the  freedom-of-information legislation. It is the first time the amount of=
 the price  break given by the Progressive Conservative government has been=
 made public. The  records also indicate that the Ministry of Energy viewed=
 major  electricity-consuming companies as hypocrites, because they publicl=
y called for  power-market competition while privately demanding a continua=
tion of the subsidy  that allows them to buy electricity at below-market pr=
ices. Big companies, such  as Dofasco Inc., Bowater Pulp and Paper Canada I=
nc., and up to 79 other large  electricity users, will continue to receive =
the subsidy when the Ontario  electricity market opens for competition on M=
ay 1. The extension could last for  up to four years. Subsidized power was =
first offered by Ontario Hydro in 1993,  when the company was looking for w=
ays to increase demand through what were  termed "special rate" deals. Sinc=
e then, about 7 per cent of Ontario's  electricity has been covered by thes=
e deals, which were supposed to end when the  electricity market was opened=
 to competition. Companies receiving the subsidies  would suddenly face pri=
ce increases of up to 64 per cent, the records say. The  cost of the subsid=
ies will be carried by Ontario Power Generation, one of  Ontario Hydro's su=
ccessor companies, and Ontario Electricity Financial Corp.,  the body payin=
g off Ontario Hydro's debts, according to the records. The  documents show =
that senior executives at big companies began pressuring Premier  Mike Harr=
is, former finance minister Ernie Eves, and Energy Minister Jim Wilson  in =
1999, threatening that if the government didn't continue the subsidy, the  =
company's investments in the province would be at risk. In June of 2000, ca=
binet  approved continuing the subsidies through regulation, despite an ass=
essment by  the Ministry of Energy that said Ontario Power Generation could=
 lose up to  $190-million over four years, compared with selling the electr=
icity at market  prices. Ontario Electricity Financial Corp. would receive =
$7-million less in  dividends over that period.
"Price to Beat" Set in Virginia
The Virginia State  Corporation Commission announced this week that a "pric=
e to beat" electricity  rate has been set as a benchmark for cost compariso=
n in the state's developing  deregulated electricity market. The rate will =
be reset on a yearly basis.  Electricity suppliers wishing to compete in th=
e market must offer service at a  lower rate or provide a unique service su=
ch as a green power package. The actual  price to compare for a particular =
customer will vary depending on usage and the  rate schedule of the existin=
g electric company, but the average price to compare  is 3.3 cents per kilo=
watt-hour for residential customers. During the state's  pilot customer cho=
ice program, some Virginia Power customers chose to switch to  Dominion whi=
ch charges between 4.35 cents and 4.97 cents per kilowatt-hour for  electri=
city. At the time of the pilot, these rates were competitive with  rates of=
fered by other utilities serving customers in Virginia. The SCC is now  cau=
tioning those customers to reconsider their switch based on the new "price =
to  beat" rate. A spokesman from Dominion said last week that the company h=
as no  immediate plans to lower its rates, but is pleased that new rates ha=
ve been  announced, stating, "We have a number we can shoot at. We welcome =
 it." Customers who switch their electricity supplier in the new market mus=
t  also consider the transition charge they must pay for the next 5  years.=
 This charge was created to compensate utilities for losses on  investments=
 they made previously to serve those customers. Two licensed  competitors, =
Old Mill Power Company and AES New Energy Incorporated, have  requested tha=
t the charge be phased out. Some concern has been expressed that  the low b=
enchmark price makes it difficult for new retail electricity suppliers  to =
enter the market. Eric Matheson, AES New Energy's director of new  markets,=
 is arguing that the low price makes it "impossible" for his company to  co=
mpete with incumbent utilities in Virginia.
Efforts to Deregulate Electricity Will Be Slowed
A  top DOE official told reporters this week that efforts to deregulate the=
  electricity market in the United States will be slowed for years due to t=
he  collapse of Enron Corporation and the well-documented energy crisis in =
 California.  Vicky Bailey, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs  =
and Domestic Policy, said that the ramifications of California's crisis and=
 the  fall of Enron could slow the progress of electricity deregulation for=
 two to  three years.  She does not expect this to end further developments=
 in  deregulation throughout the country however. Bailey, a former Federal =
Energy  Regulatory Commission member, believes that Enron's absence may hur=
t the  industry's push toward deregulation, but competition will ultimately=
 prevail.  The restructuring issue she added is "larger than Enron" and too=
 much progress  has been made in support of restructuring to go back to reg=
ulated markets.
Long Island Opens to Retail Competition
The Long  Island Power Authority (LIPA) has announced that is has completel=
y opened the  island's electricity market to retail competition under the L=
IChoice  Program.  This achievement is seven years ahead of the schedule im=
posed by  the Public Authorities Control Board (PACB) in May 1998 and a yea=
r in advance of  LIPA's own 2003 deadline.  Under LIPA's retail competition=
 program, three  Energy Services Companies (ESCOs) have been certified to s=
upply electricity to  residential and commercial customers on Long Island. =
 Currently, 38,039  residential and commercial customers receive approximat=
ely 220.4 MW of  electricity from ConEd Solutions, NIMO Energy Marketing or=
 KeySpan Energy  Solutions.  LIPA has invited the Suffolk County Electrical=
 Agency (SCEA) to  formally participate in the customer choice program as w=
ell and hopes it will  sell as much electricity as it can obtain under its =
ESCO provisions. LIPA  Chairman Richard M. Kessel hopes that these efforts =
will encourage more ESCOs to  join the market.  LIPA has also increased the=
 Energy Bill Credit, or  shopping credit, from 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour =
to 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour  to further encourage competition within the=
 market.  This credit is equal  to the cost of generation-related energy an=
d capacity costs that LIPA avoids  when an ESCO takes over provision of ele=
ctric service.  The funds derived  from the credit are returned to the ESCO=
 to help cover its generation  costs.  It is hoped that the increase will p=
rovide ESCOs with a greater  incentive to supply competitively priced elect=
ricity to consumers.  Retail  deregulation in the state began in May 1998 w=
hen LIPA first reduced electric  rates by an average of 20%, resulting in s=
avings of $1.5 billion.  LIChoice  began its phased-in approach to deregula=
tion in April 1999, followed by a second  phase in May 2000.
Florida Loses Interest In Deregulation
Interest in  a deregulated electricity marketplace in Florida has waned con=
siderably over the  past few months.  Despite the findings of the Florida E=
nergy 2020 Study  Commission's December report that recommended initiation =
of a competitive  wholesale market, little additional discussion has occurr=
ed, and the state  Legislature is not expected to act on the recommendation=
s in the report.   The Orlando Sentinel reported last week that the Legisla=
ture has other, more  critical issues on its agenda, including the recessio=
n, reapportionment, and the  state's response to terrorism.  Sanford Berg, =
a 2020 Commission member who  directs the Public Utilities Research Center =
at the University of Florida,  explained that the Legislature is preoccupie=
d as well with congressional  redistricting and the state's budget crisis. =
 He also mentioned that the  Energy Commission's report will require substa=
ntial analysis which the  Legislature does not have time to do.  The bankru=
ptcy of Enron Corporation  has also contributed to a lack of interest in de=
regulation.  The company's  collapse has caused stakeholders in Florida to =
question the ability of  electricity generators and transmission and distri=
bution companies to supply  uninterrupted flows of power at an affordable p=
rice.  Despite the lack of  deregulation in Florida, the electricity market=
 in the state appears to be  stable and healthy.  The state's large power c=
ompanies are consistently  profitable and have been able to adjust customer=
 prices as compensation for  investments in new generating plants and fluct=
uations in fuel costs.  The  utilities do not expect wide variations in fue=
l costs in the coming year and  believe they have sufficient generating cap=
acity to cover the demand for  power.  Creation of a regional transmission =
organization (RTO) to serve the  state is not planned, regardless of collab=
orative efforts during 2001 to form a  statewide RTO, Grid Florida.  This p=
lan has been stalled due to the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's pre=
ference for interstate RTOs.
North Carolina Study Commission To Resume
The  Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service in North Carolina w=
ill resume  on February 6, 2002.  Deliberations on electric deregulation ar=
e not  expected to take center stage; rather, the Commission's work to reso=
lve the debt  burden of several towns and cities will likely be the focus o=
f discussion.   In April 2000, the Commission approved a set of recommendat=
ions that included  moving to a fee-market system for all power sales in th=
e state by 2006.   California's energy crisis, however, resulted in the Com=
mission's design to  delay these plans.  Commission Co-Chairman Senator Dav=
id Hoyle (D-Gaston)  told reporters this week that the he does not expect t=
he panel to make any major  recommendations before legislators convene May =
28th for the 2002 session.   He also noted that the Commission is expecting=
 updates from other states on  their electricity deregulation activities an=
d plans in addition to a report on  available power supplies for the state'=
s 4 million electric customers.   Senator Kay Hagan  (D-Guilford) agrees wi=
th Senator Hoyle and does not  expect the Commission to move forward with d=
eregulation plans.  "This is so  complex that it's not easy to even figure =
out what questions to ask," she said.  North Carolina regulators are expect=
ed to closely follow electricity  restructuring in the neighboring state of=
 Virginia.
Pennsylvania Utility Denies Market  Manipulation
PPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown,  Pennsylvania, has denied char=
ges that it set artificially high prices for  wholesale products in its ser=
vice territory.  The Pennsylvania Public  Utility Commission (PUC) is inves=
tigating PPL in the aftermath of charges  leveled at it from PJM Interconne=
ction LLC, the wholesale market operator, and  NewPower Holdings Incorporat=
ed.  PPL claims that a "readily foreseeable  increase in demand" resulted i=
n price increases during the first quarter of 2001  rather than an effort t=
o control prices.  The PUC is interested in the case  because these price c=
ontrol charges pose questions about the success of the  state's deregulated=
 electricity market.  PJM required that electric  companies under its juris=
diction have the ability to meet 119% of their expected  demand.  Therefore=
, PPL's high prices have a negative effect on competing  electric companies=
, which often purchase supplemental generating capacity from  the utility. =
 NewPower, which serves 192,000 Pennsylvania customers, called  last year's=
 market prices "unjust and unreasonable."  Other electric  companies and co=
nsumer advocates are following the case closely to judge its  potential con=
sequences for the future of electric competition.  John  Hanger, a former P=
UC commissioner and now head of PennFuture, a Harrisburg  consumer interest=
 group, said that "nobody believes that there wasn't market  manipulation g=
oing on."  PPL contests in its filing to the PUC that the  price increases =
did not prevent alternative electricity suppliers from competing  at the re=
tail level nor did they affect consumers negatively. Most consumers in  the=
 mid-Atlantic region are protected from price fluctuations by rate caps so =
 they did not directly feel the effects of higher wholesale prices.  Hanger=
  maintained that retail suppliers began leaving the market following the h=
igh  prices in March of 2001.  The PUC confirmed that only 72 of the origin=
al 97  electric companies operating in the Mid-Atlantic region last January=
 are still  in the market.
