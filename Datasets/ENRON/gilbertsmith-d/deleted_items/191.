at this time, pure retail will be less of a focus. We need to wait and see where that ends up for EES.

Doug,

I guess that you will need a replacement for Nancy if we continue to support these meetings.

Lance

In light of the current events at Enron, it is necessary for me to
resign my position as RMS Chair effective immediately.  I have enjoyed
working with everyone.  I am very grateful for the opportunities
afforded me by chairing RMS.  This position took a lot of work,
dedication and energy but it is one that also made me proud and gave me
a wonderful opportunity to work with so many fine people.    I am
confident that with all of your hard work and dedication the Texas
market will be successful and will be the hallmark for restructuring. 

My employment with Enron will be formally terminated tomorrow along with
service at this email address.  I am in the process of setting up a
personal email address which I will distribute as soon as it is
available.  My phone number listed below will stay in service
indefinitely.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or
require any information.  Thanks again to all of you and good luck.
