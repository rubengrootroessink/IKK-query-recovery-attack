Doug - I'll certainly keep you posted on the fate of our group.  Realistically, I don't us surviving too much longer.  Make sure to drop me an update if you punch out or if a group of you set up shop outside somewhere.

Good luck - Chris

Great.

Let me know what happens. I would imagine there should be some interest in what you guys do. My home email in case is, gilsmith@houston.rr.com

Take care.
