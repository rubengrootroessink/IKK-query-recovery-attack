Kyle,

My question on #8 had more to do with the wording of the minutes of the MIMO
meeting on Oct. 25.  I knew that Entergy's tariff allowed same day move ins.
The point of the question was that the way the minutes were worded, it
appeared impossible to handle.  Some SET members on the call last week
thought it might have been a typo in the minutes.   They said "According the
minutes of the move in/move out meeting on Oct. 25, under "Rejection of MIMO
for a Date in the Past", there was a 'strong
recommendation' that CR's not send move in dates less than current date +1
day."   Several people commented they thought it should have said "current
date -1 day."   That would allow you to request a same day move in.

This was supposed to be discussed in Austin today or tomorrow.

Thanks,
