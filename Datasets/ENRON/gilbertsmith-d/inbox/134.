Charles:

EPMI has established an ERCOT LSE account (agreement) on its own and separate from EES's.  There has been zero activity on the account.  As for the IT issues, we contracted with a company called ESG to facilitate all communication (software, etc) for the LSE account.  The ESG contract is assignable and the people at ESG are eager for that to happen.

A question, am I correct that the LSE status being referred to is NOT EPMI - if so, is it with EES?  or what entity?

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Thanks,

Doug

I am researching with ERCOT staff, the timing requirements for QSE, LSE and TCR registration.  They are not on the website.
