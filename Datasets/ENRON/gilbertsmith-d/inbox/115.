Doug -- would you let me (and Leslie) know your thoughts on the below.  The product descriptions Leslie is focussed on are attached, but I supspect we should explore what other product offerings you are hoping to put onto EOL, in the financial realm as well.  --David

Since ERCOT is non-FERC jurisdictional, can we release the ERCOT products prior to UBS obtaining a FERC power marketing license?
 
David, have there been any changes in ERCOT that require us to update the descriptions attached below?

Leslie, 

Please remember to get us any changes to the current long description for the East Power Phy Fwd LD products.  The current description is below.  Also, below is the current location language for the ERCOT North and South products.  Should these be updated as well?  Is it possible for these ERCOT products to be released before the necessary legal licenses have been required for the other east power products?

Thanks, 

Chris
