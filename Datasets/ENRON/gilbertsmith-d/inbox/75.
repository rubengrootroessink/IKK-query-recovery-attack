Dave:

I just spoke with Mark Patterson at ERCOT (he is Enron's Client rep.)  He will speak with Richard Howard to confirm but he believes that if you only wish to send QSE to QSE trades that a WAN agreement and connection is not necessary.  We would simply send the XML file via the internet using the tool that ERCOT devised for this.

As for item 4 the answer is no.  The portal does not have the capability of attaching a file and sending it to ERCOT but the tool referenced above would have the same function using the digital certificates.  This would save the $10,000 WAN connectivity and test fee as well with ERCOT.

Doug wants a cost associated with being a full service QSE for a generator.  This would mean setting up the WAN for UBS and licensing the ESCA MOS and other tools.  Steve was working on this.  Do we have an estimate?  Off hand Lloyd believes about $750,000.00.  Also we would have to bring in system operations personnel as ERCOT requires 24hr coverage for this.

As per our discussion.

Item 1.  Quick updates to the project plan

 << File: poston_ercot.mpp >> 
Item 2.  Example of another plan

 << File: Netco_unit_testing.mpp >> 

Item 3.  Question?  Is a thorough WAN setup and site survey required to submit QSE trade schedules
Response:  Based on the reading we have completed so far, it looks like for standard XML template submission, you only need DIGITAL certificates and an internet connect.  The digital certificates are issued by ERCOT and can be installed on the desktop.  I will follow-up with Pat Most to confirm this assumption.  So, in summary the WAN stuff will hopefully not be required.

Item 4.  Confirmation of an assumption
If we cannot complete the communication work required for ERCOT for initial scheduling (we are hoping we can), FSP will still provide an XML file output that can be uploaded through the ERCOT Portal.  Is this correct Smith?

Thanks,  Poston
