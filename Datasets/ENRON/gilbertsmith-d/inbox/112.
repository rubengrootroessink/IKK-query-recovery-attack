Doug and David:

Attached please find a document summarizing all on-line ERCOT product descriptions posted on EOL or otherwise in development to date.  The ERCOT products include:  (1) the Firm LD physical forward product; (2) the Firm LD spread product, and the (3) financial swap product.  These descriptions reflect the most current versions of all products as of November.  Please let me know if there have been any developments in the ERCOT market requiring further updates.  I have confirmed that the index language is up-to-date.

Also, please let me know if there are additional products not covered by this list.

Thanks,

Leslie
