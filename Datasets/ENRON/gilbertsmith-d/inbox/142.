Doug,

Thanks for the update, glad to know that I wasn't going completely crazy.

Lance,
You are correct. I had corrected the idevs that TXU had sent to leave
everything in area 51, but the old data was not being extracted
properly. Delete the raws that you had previously downloaded. They will
have extra busses and lines due to the error. TXU has a process to put
their data into the old areas for their internal use.

 I fixed the idevs to remove the old data and have sent them to our IT
department along with the new raw data (even included the line upratings
from TXU for the sum, fal, and win cases). The summer raw data is
attached.

have a good thanksgiving,
doug
