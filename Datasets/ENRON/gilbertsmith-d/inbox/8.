How convenient! With the latest new service from weather.com you can automatically receive the next 5-days' weather in your electronic calendar. There's no easier way to know what to wear tomorrow or what to plan for the weekend than always having the latest weather bulletin as a discrete entry at the top of your calendar.

Using Infuzer technology, a 5-day forecast for the cities of your choice is added to the top of your calendar as an "all day event" and updated every few hours. The system supports all leading electronic calendars and PDAs (Outlook, Lotus Notes, Palm, Pocket PC, Lotus Organizer and Act!).

You select once from 30,000 locations worldwide, including US cities, download a small plug-in and then just let weather.com and Infuzer do the work, bringing your 5-day forecast direct to your calendar.

Here's what our users say:

"Works as advertised! Automatically adds weather forecasts for 5 days into your Palm datebook. It's a no brainer. Just install and forget about it." PalmGear Web site 5 star rating

"I really enjoy Infuzer, it helps me when I don't have time to log onto the Internet to get a local forecast to help my kids to know what to wear in the morning for school."

"I really enjoy the free and accurate weather service."
