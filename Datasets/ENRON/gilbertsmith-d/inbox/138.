> Jerry,
>
> The subgroup of the Congestion Management Working Group (CMWG) which has
> been performing power flow studies and analyzing the zonal weighted
average
> shift factors, held a conference call this afternoon to review the work
> done by different members of the subgroup recently.  This conference call
> also included members of the TXU & Reliant TDSPs who have reviewed and
> offerred input into the process.
>
> During the conference call we reached a consensus of what values to use
for
> the 2002 summer on-peak TTC ratings for the CSCs in the direction of base
> flow (i.e. for West to North flow on the Graham to Parker CSC, for South
to
> North flow on the Temple to Sandow CSC, and for South to Houston flow on
> the STP to Dow CSC).  These TTC limits are shown in the PowerPoint
> presentation attached below.  Additionally, I have included a list of the
> Boundary Generators and restated the CREs for each CSC by which CREs are
> Closely Related Contingencies and which CREs are Closely Related Monitored
> Elements.
>
> With the work that was done by this subgroup recently, we now have a high
> degree of confidence that the CSC flows predicted by the Zonal Average
> Weighted Shift Factors match very closely what is observed by power flow
> software.  Therefore, the doubt that we had earlier on this issue has been
> resolved.
>
> One issue that was raised during today's conference call that needs the
> attention of the WMS is, will TCRs be sold in both directions on the CSCs?
> If so, then TTC limits in the opposite direction will need to be developed
> as well.  Ken Donohoo said that there has been some discussion on this
> issue by different stakeholders this week and that clarity is needed.
>
> One last note on the CREs shown in the PowerPoint presentation, please
> review it to determine if all changes that were discussed at Monday's CMWG
> meeting are reflected.  I know that the ones in the Austin area have been
> removed; however, Jose Conto thinks that a couple were agreed upon to be
> added at that meeting; however, he wasn't sure which ones they were.
> Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks
