Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change
Control Conference Call this Friday, 2/8/02.

We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.

The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.

Thank You,
Dave Odle
