Shelley, the market left the 814_PC transaction (Maintain customer Information request) in place so that the CR could notify the TDSP when changes like the one you mention were necessary.  It is a point to point transaction from the CR to the TDSP.

Is there a standard process for each TDSP on how CR's should handle notifying a TDSP if they are aware that a premise address needs to be changed? 
Couple of examples below. 
A customer is notified by the post office that the post office is changing their premise address and they call their CR to notify them in order to recieve their bill correctly. 
CR receives information from return mail processing, etc, that a premise address should be changed.   
The 814_20 is for communications from the TDSP to Ercot to the CR, but does not provide for communication back the other way.  Should the customer be directed to the TDSP phone centers or what is the best means to communicate these change requests?
