 Attached is a consolidated document that details specific issues the market
 is experiencing with the 820 payment and remittance advice process.  The
RMS
 meeting referenced below in Debbie McKeever's email will focus on this
 document and we will work to gain market consensus on resolution.  Please
 prepare by reviewing this document and bring a copy with you on the 11th.

 Thank you,
