Attached is the most recent version of the RMS 2002 planning calendar.  Thanks to all the working group chairs that  provided their standing working group meeting dates.  Working group chairs and ad hoc working chairs, should provide Larry Grimm and myself of any additions/changes to the calendar.  We are attempting for the first time, to have a planning calendar of the key system scheduled dates, standing meeting dates and other general RMS dates as the members wish.  The only dates that are not on the calendar are the ad hoc conference calls/meetings that do occur on a short notice basis. 
Larry Grimm will coordinate with the appropriate ERCOT resource to place this in RMS' Key Document folder on the ERCOT website.
