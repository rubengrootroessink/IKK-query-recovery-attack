Carey,

We have 7 change controls to review this week and 10 questions to address.
If we wait until next week, I'd be concerned we will not have enough time
to get through two weeks worth of changes and questions in a one hour
meeting.

Regards,

Ed

Susan, I have not had a chance  to look at what we have for this week, but
unless we have something that is pressing, I recommend that we postpone the
call until next week.

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change
Control Conference Call this Friday, 2/8/02.

We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.

The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.

Thank You,
Dave Odle
