Susan, I have not had a chance  to look at what we have for this week, but unless we have something that is pressing, I recommend that we postpone the call until next week.

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change
Control Conference Call this Friday, 2/8/02.
We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.
The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.
Thank You,
Dave Odle
