Guys,

This is different than my previous conversation with Thane....In my previous conversation, Thane indicated that we could do a 2 month contract (for example) and not have to pay the "LDs" for 60 days.  Point 2 indicates we WILL have to pay $20K ($10K monthly minimum * 2) if we cancel prior to 60 days' notice.

Jeff here is some additional information.

1)  Inside the APX QSE we offer a "short" facility/ or "long" facility that
allows you want to take a position up to 50 MW a zone.  This is our way of
allowing our clients two work within the balance schedule requirement in
ERCOT.

2)   For the no-term, there is a 60 day termination policy that cannot be
waived.  The short of it is that if you want service for only thirty days,
you would need to pay the monthly minimum for two month ($20,000) plus
whatever volumetric that you incurred while you were using the service.

3)  For the standard service there are 10 logins.  Additional logins are
$150 per login.

4)  For the ASP service, where your are your own QSE and we provide the
application and support, the minimum term is one year.  I have attached a
pricing sheet for the service.  Note that it compares the pricing for the
QSE service, one-year term ASP service without operations and one-year term
with operations.
