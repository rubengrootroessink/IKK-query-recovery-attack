Liz -- I've been unable to discuss this with Doug, as he's been out of the =
office. I'm not even sure if he's terribly interested in this product being=
 promulgated -- the UBSWenergy ERCOT products he will first offer are confi=
ned to specific zones.  This product definition would presumably be used to=
 support a "Seller's  choice" ERCOT-wide product spanning the four current =
zones, and the Market Clearing Price ("MCP") applicable would be in that zo=
ne the Seller specified day-ahead. (That is, there are several moving parts=
 to this.) The denomination 'Hourly Firm' was also a matter I wished to exp=
lore with him.  Attached is a markup with my thoughts on the draft product,=
 and this morning I'm going to talk to some other folks who might have a re=
ad on the operation of the MCP in relation to the LDs calcualtion.  Please =
note that if one specifies that the MCP is the cap on the Replacement Price=
, then a presumption is being made that no additional costs are being incur=
red in purchasing substitute product.  I think this is an acceptable assump=
tion but Doug may think different.   The corrections on the attachment incl=
ude some intended merely to use the defined terms actually stated in the Pr=
otocols.  The changes in the second paragraph are intended to reverse any i=
mplication that the settlement on LDs would be held open a month or even 6 =
months until a final MCP value is identified by ERCOT -- I'd confine the wi=
ndow for recalculation to one month. --DP
