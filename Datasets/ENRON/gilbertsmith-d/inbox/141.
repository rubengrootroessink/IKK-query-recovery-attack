Doug:
I sent you an e-mail message yesterday offering a phone conference as an
alternative to a meeting at the Commission and am awaiting your response.  I
am enclosing the data and charts we analyzed for the Enron QSE.  We strongly
encourage your QSE people to verify our data against their own data and
generate similar graphs from their own data so we can be sure that we are
looking at the same data when we talk.
Best regards,
