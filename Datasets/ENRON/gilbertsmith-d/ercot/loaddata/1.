The load percentages for the different seasons is shown below.  I haven't been able to get the winter season yet.  The reason that the totals do not add up to 100% is that I also used eth DC ties in the load analysis, it only introduces a very small error. 


% of total load						
	North	South	West	Reliant		
Spring Case	31.96%	26.93%	5.94%	34.74%	99.57%	
Summer Case	38.34%	24.70%	5.62%	31.03%	99.69%	
Fall Case	34.33%	26.93%	5.86%	32.50%	99.61%	
Winter Case
