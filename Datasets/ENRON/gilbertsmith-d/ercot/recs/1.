Doug,

Attached is a sample confirmation for a Texas REC transaction.

Please note the delivery terms.  ERCOT awards RECs on a quarterly basis.
They provide a 38 day period for the generators to finalize their
information, and ERCOT plans on awarding RECs on the 39th day.

Please let me know if there are any terms of the confirmation that you would
like amended.

Scott
