Here is a message that came in from ERCOT. Due to the size of the message, it seems to have choked the database. I will fix that problem but in the meantime, here is the text of the message in case it is important information for you guys.
 
The completion of the Limestone-Watermill 345 double circuit has made a significant change in the North/South interchange flows.  Previously a set of limits was calculated daily by ERCOT.  With the new transmission lines the old calculation is no longer valid.  ERCOT is now observing the South-North transfer as affected by the ATC calculator.  At this time we have adopted a set of not to exceed limits for the major 345 circuits in the transfer path.  These limits are:
 
Good Weather
 
Trading House-Venus 345 kv Double Circuit                         1260 MVA
Jewet-Big Brown 345 kv Double Circuit                             1200 MVA
Limestone-Watermill 345 kv Double Circuit                         1500 MVA
 

All Bad Weather & North  
 
Trading House-Venus 345 kv Double Circuit                          750 MVA
Jewet-Big Brown 345 kv Double Circuit                             1200 MVA
Limestone-Watermill 345 kv Double Circuit                         1400 MVA
