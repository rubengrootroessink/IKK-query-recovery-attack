We have been working with TXU behind the scenes on this issue.  We need a standard set contingencies and this would give us this.  The power point presentation is worth a quick review.

Subject:	ERCOT Subcommittee Information Request




Gentlemen,

The following attachment is a draft summary document that describes the need for
transmission system information that is in additional to the load flow base
cases and supporting information presently available through ERCOT (i.e. the
Steady State Load Flow Task Force etc.).

  (See attached file: draft - WMS presentation.doc)

Jerry Ward intends to present this issue to the Wholesale Market Subcommittee at
the April 19, 2001 meeting.  Since ROS action is key to assembling and
publishing the requested information,  it is our intention to obtain the
endorsement of the  WMS along with a WMS request to ROS for its assistance in
achieving the publication of the requested information.

Additionally,  TXU Energy Trading has prepared a detailed supporting
presentation that describes the nature of the required information and hopes to
make this presentation to the ROS at its May 8, 2001 meeting.   A draft of this
ROS presentation follows:

(See attached file: draft - ROS Presentation.ppt)

We are interested in any comments or feedback that you may have about either the
WMS or ROS presentation materials.  If you know of other market participants who
will be interested in these issues, please feel free to forward this information
to them as well.  Thanks

Shannon Caraway, P.E.
