There are two displays on the Portal: View Commercially Significant Constraints (display 1) and View Congestion Notification.  Whenever there is a CSC violation on the Commercially Significant Constraints display, the Congestion Notification display will specifically list  this violation. These two displays are consistent and updated hourly.
The MW loading on each CSC is calculated as 
MW loading from each zone = (Sum of Resources in the same zone - Sum of Scheduled Load in the same zone)* shift factor 
The sum of resources is calculated based on QSE's energy schedules and the sum of load is calculated based on the QSE's scheduled load for each zone.  
However, the real-time BES uses resource scheduled based on QSE's resource plan and ERCOT short-term load forecast.  Therefore what is posted on the Portal may be different from the CSC calculation from real-time balancing clearing.  That's why for interval ending 1:15 the different zonal MCPEs could not be explained by just using these two displays.  As you can see we still have a lot of work ahead of us, especially on the Portal postings.
Please let me know if you need anything else. 
Thanks.

Doug I do not have access to this screen or use this screen.  Suggest contacting your client rep for more info.  Jessica Bian knows these systems and can probably provide additional information.  The only problem is she is VERY busy using these new systems.  Thanks Ken D.

KEn, 
Had a couple of quick questions regarding the csc screens in the portal 
and was hoping you had time to walk me through them. I was looking at 
the results for off peak and saw negative prices with the csc showing no 
constraints. Looking at the csc grid, i show 546 MW of loading on the WN 
flow for the interval 1:15. Does this represent the actual flow or the 
planned flow? If it is the actual, how do we get a difference in price? 
I am trying to better understand this screen and it would be a great 
help if you could let me know what this value represents. 
Thanks for your time. Feel free to call me if this would be easier to 
explain over the phone. 
Thanks again, 
Doug Gilbert-Smith
