Doug, we will need to have this document along with the evaluation reviewed by legal prior to presenting to the employee.

Attached is a Performance Improvement Plan for your employee(s) who rated in the bottom cluster. The steps below outline the instructions for completing this form. If you have any questions, please contact your HR Representative

- Supervisors are encouraged to consider employee input before finalizing the PIP.
- The PIP should address the specific performance areas and examples provided in the employee's evaluation.
- All PIP's should be reviewed by your Human Resources generalist before being presented to the employee.

Performance/Development Area:
This is the specific area in which the employee's demonstrated performance needs to improve, or a significant area where additional development is needed. These should be stated in specific, objective, and behavioral terms. Common descriptors have been provided for the supervisor to copy/paste into the Performance Improvement Plan or to modify as needed. See attachment.

Specific Action Required:
The desired behavior or action of employee. This should usually be a goal or milestone that can be measured or evaluated. 

Completion Date:
Each specific action in the PIP will require varying time periods for completion. Some improvement areas may need to be immediate, such as reducing absenteeism or eliminating inappropriate comments. Other areas will take longer for the employee to complete, such as enhancing technical knowledge. Supervisors are encouraged to avoid lengthy completion dates, while giving the employee sufficient time to demonstrate improvement. The completion date should coincide with any key milestones or events that may be tied to the specific action required. A drop down window is provided with dates.

Person(s) Responsible:
In most cases the supervisor, the employee, or both will appear in this column. There are situations where another person is assisting the employee to reach a goal or milestone. For example, an employee who needs to strengthen his technical skills might shadow a team member; thus, that team member would be listed in this column along with the employee. This usually encompasses anyone that is critical in providing time, resources, or support for the employee to improve in that particular performance/development area.
