Kim,

Not sure what we need to do to resolve this. I calculated my overall coverage 
vs. cost at is was a palty 42%...

Please let me know where I need to head in trying to resolve this.

Thanks again,

Doug

Maybe I/you should complain to the benefits department regarding the dental
insurance situation. Serena (at Dr. Crowe's office) said she talked to a
Mary C. at Met Life in July, 2000. Mary said Met Life covered 80% of the
occlusal adjustment (code #9952). Then when I called yesterday they said it
has never been covered and MetLife has rejected the claim which means we
have to pay another $400. Let me know the benefits number and I will give
them a call.

Thanks!

Killian Gilbert-Smith
