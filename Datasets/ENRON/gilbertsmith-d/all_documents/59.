Subject: Update on Operating Guides re-write



Thanks to all of those who participated in this week's Operating Guides
review workshop.  If you put your name on the sign-in list, you've been
added to a new ERCOT e-mail distribution list. (Check below)  All future
notices concerning the NEW Operating Guides will be sent to this Operating
Guides list (ogr@ercot.com)  If you would like to be included, please
contact Kurt at ERCOT.

There will be a 2-day workshop to discuss comments on the next version of
the NEW Operating Guides on January 24-25 at the Holiday Inn - South in
Austin.  On Wednesday we'll run from 9:30 to 5:00 and Thursday from 8:30 to
4:00.  I intend to start by reviewing Emergency Operations (new Part 4),
then Parts 2 (ERCOT Operations) and 3 (Interface Operations / QSE and
TDSP).  We will then move through the Appendices, in order, and go back and
pick up Part 1 (Introduction) last.

Any comments you would like to have considered for inclusion in the next
version may be forwarded to Bob Brodie at rbrodie@kemaconsulting.com


Additionally, I have attached the presentation I made at today's TAC
meeting.
