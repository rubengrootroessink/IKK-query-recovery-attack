Doug,

Lots of traveling going on over here.  How about yourself?  We're still
producing bucket loads of CL2, but are always open to seeing what kind of
deals you have to offer.  I think I still owe you a beer.  Let's plan on
lunch one day.

Steve

Steve,

What is happening out there? Still busy producing bucket
loads of chlorine

Trust all is well,
