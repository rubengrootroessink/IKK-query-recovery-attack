Pursuant to my assignment from the last RUG meeting and for consideration at
the next RUG meeting, attached is a redline of Section 6 to include language
to allow IDR-metered loads in NOIEs to have the right to participate through
their respective NOIEs in the Balancing Up Load bids (BUL).

To make the current revisions easy to spot, the attached document is
redlined version of Floyd Trefny's draft of Section 6 with the OWG revisions
from 11/14/01 with all changes accepted.

There are four changes:
(1) pg. 28 -- language to define BUL participation requirements by a
dynamically scheduling QSE.
(2) pg. 50 -- language to account for BUL participation by a dynamically
scheduling QSE in the uninstructed deviation calculation.
(3) pg. 78 -- language to recognize that NOIE BUL loads will not have an ESI
Id, and providing and alternative form of identification.
(4) pg. 86 -- language to account for BUL participation by a dynamically
scheduling QSE in the SCE calculation.

Changes (1), (2), and (4) apply only to dynamically schedulings QSEs with
BULs.  Change (3) applies to all NOIE BULs.
