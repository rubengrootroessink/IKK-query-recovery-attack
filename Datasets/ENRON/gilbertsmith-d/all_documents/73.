Enron Wind has received report and is now getting RAC and Enron Board 
sign-off.  Should not be a problem to get sign-off before the Feb. 7th 
deadline in the condition precedent agreement.  See below for final report...

Subject: Garrad Hassan report on Indian Mesa II

Attached is the final Garrad Hassan analysis of the Indian Mesa II wind 
resource which has now been approved by Andrew Garrad and is acceptable to EW 
management.  In our opinion this report will meet the requirements described 
in the Enron Board resolutions relating to the debt financing of the project.

Karen, we are now prepared to complete the RAC review and would like to do so 
as soon as possible.  

Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.
