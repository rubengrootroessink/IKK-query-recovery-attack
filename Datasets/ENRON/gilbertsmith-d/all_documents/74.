Parviz, complete information to answer your
questions is not part of our current systems at
ERCOT.  The operational systems do not
archive/retain data.  We are looking into what
information we can gather but this may take some
time.

For the cost questions the only available data is
redispatch for unplanned and planned service.  It
is posted in accounting reports and is available
on the Internet at the following address:

ftp://ftp.ercot.com/unplannd/redispth/uredispt.htm
l
ftp://ftp.ercot.com/planned/redispth/redispth.html

Realignment is at owner's cost and ERCOT does not
receive/collect this information.  It will be very
hard to determine total impact without this
information.

Steve Myers, Security Operations Manager and his
staff are looking into available data to answer
the operational questions.

Some information relating to unplanned
transactions is available in the "Monthly
Transmission Market Operations Reports"  available
on the Internet at the following address:

ftp://ftp.ercot.com/unplannd/mtmorept/mtmorept.htm

In addition, past performance of the system does
not denote future performance.  Generation and
transmission are changing on the system every
year. Traditional methods of analysis using known
generation resources and pairing them with known
load are no longer possible.  There is significant
uncertainty in the existing generation that will
be displaced by the addition of new generation.
There is significant uncertainty regarding  how
their operation affects existing resources and the
transmission system.  The CSC calculations we
provided are trying to simulate these possible
transactions and determine the limitations with
the ERCOT stakeholders.

Hope this helps.  Thanks Ken D.

Thanks Ken.  Is it possible for you, please, to
have certain information
when you come for this meeting.  At this time, I
have the following
questions.  If I come up with more, I will forward
them to you in advance of
the meeting.

On a historical bases covering 1997 through 1999,
and 2000 (if data is
available), could you please provide the following
annual information for
ERCOT:

1. The total cost ($) impact of realignment
(or redispatch)
2. The total cost ($) impact of realignment
(or redispatch) by each of
ten Control Areas
3. The total MW (or MWH) impact of
realignment (or redispatch)
4. The total MW (or MWH) impact of
realignment (or redispatch) by each
of ten Control Areas
5. The number of times in which ERCOT relied
on realignment (or
redispatch)
6. The number of times in which ERCOT relied
on realignment (or
redispatch) for each of ten Control Area
7. Please break ERCOT related information in
the above questions into
Summer, Winter, and other periods.

Thanks.  Parviz.

ERCOT System Planning has prepared calculations
and data to support the identification of
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSC). A
meeting to discuss these calculations with
stakeholders will be held:

Wednesday, January 31
9:30 AM to 3:30 PM
Red Lion Hotel in Austin (I35 & 290)

The goal of this meeting is to identify which
transmission system contingencies and limiting
elements are commercially significant.  After
CSC's are determined at this meeting, ERCOT will
develop a recommendation and present it to TAC at
their February 7 meeting.

We have also set up an email account to receive
comments.  Its email address is

csccomments@ercot.com

it will be available throughout this process to
receive comments and input.
