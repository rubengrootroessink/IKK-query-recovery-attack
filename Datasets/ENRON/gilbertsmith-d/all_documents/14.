In addition to the proposal made by Manny, we'd like to propose the the 
attached
as a further modification to the unit specific dispatch for consideration by 
the
RUG on Dec 6 or 7.  This language proposes to base premiums on the Resource 
plan
rather than current output.  This is consistent with what ERCOT has proposed
with OOME and is more appropriate than basing the premiums on unit limits.
