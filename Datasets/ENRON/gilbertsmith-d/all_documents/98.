52502000 and will consist of actual charges for market data obtained through

WAN Links -  Wide-Area Network links are used to connect remote offices to 
the Houston network.  These charges will be billed on actuals and directly to 
the cost center.

Trading Turrets -  Special Phones used by the traders.  This will be billed 
on plan.


The following items are part of infrastructure, but the costs are driven by 
system development projects.  These items will be billed according to plan, 
which was derived from analyzing your expected system development costs.  As 
the year progresses we will examine your system development charges to 
determine if the portion of the infrastructure charges you are receiving 
should be adjusted.


Application Integration -  Whenever a new client level or web-based 
application is employed or an existing system is upgraded the application 
integration team ensures this system is compatible with other systems and 
will not cause system failures or downtime.

Change Management -  This group works with the development teams to provide 
scheduling and contingency plans for bringing new systems online and for 
maintenance on existing systems.  This includes scheduling downtimes and 
providing the expected impact on the company.

Architecture and Planning - The primary function of the Architecture group is 
to provide overall design and integration of technologies and products for 
Enron's network.  This includes ensuring server space for scalability and 
security is in place for the network.


If you have any other questions, please let me know.
