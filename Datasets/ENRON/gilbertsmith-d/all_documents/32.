Doug,
I forwarded this to Corp Benefits with the hope that they will be better able 
to serve you and answer your questions.  If you do not hear back from them 
before Friday, please let me know and I will follow-up.  I am going out of 
town tomorrow, but will be checking my email, so if you have any additional 
questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Anne

Kim,

Not sure what we need to do to resolve this. I calculated my overall coverage 
vs. cost at is was a palty 42%...

Please let me know where I need to head in trying to resolve this.

Thanks again,

Doug

Maybe I/you should complain to the benefits department regarding the dental
insurance situation. Serena (at Dr. Crowe's office) said she talked to a
Mary C. at Met Life in July, 2000. Mary said Met Life covered 80% of the
occlusal adjustment (code #9952). Then when I called yesterday they said it
has never been covered and MetLife has rejected the claim which means we
have to pay another $400. Let me know the benefits number and I will give
them a call.

Thanks!

Killian Gilbert-Smith
