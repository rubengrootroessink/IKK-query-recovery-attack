OWG Members,

The following set of responses to the request of the Commission Staff for
examples of the operation and clearing of ancillary services markets have
incorporated the comments that we received from ERCOT and members of the OWG. 
A
new question from the Staff concerning load has been answered by Reliant. It 
is
my understanding that these responses will be conveyed to the PUCT by Mark
Walker on the 17th. If you have any comments please call me or Mark.
