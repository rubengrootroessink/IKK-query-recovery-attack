Janie, how are things going for you??  I hope encouraging!!  We have some
new in-house systems close to being in place, and  I am updating all of my
Transportation Contracts.  Please give me the current name, phone, fax and
e-mail address for the main dispatch/nomination person.

Thanks,

A. Lindsey McMurray
