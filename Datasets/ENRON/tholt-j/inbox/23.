Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.
 
Ragards,
 
Stephanie
