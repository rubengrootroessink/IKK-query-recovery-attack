On the trigger, our system calculates as follows:

NX1 (Jan 2000)  $6.016
Trigger price               - $5.180
Trigger credit  $0.836

Trigger credit            $0.836
Scheduled volume       x465,000
Credit to invoice  $388,740.00

Southwest Gas is saying that the trigger credit should be on the physical 
flow, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please advise.

Thanks
Laurie
