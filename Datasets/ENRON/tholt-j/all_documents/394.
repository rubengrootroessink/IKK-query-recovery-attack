Janie:

Here is a summary of the new structure that we discussed for Harbor.  

1.  Each day we would call in our estimate of usage for the next day.  On 
friday we would  call in our estimate for Sat - Mon.

2.  The desk would bill us ON USAGE, not on deliveries or ordered.

3.  EPMI would pay the mid point of Gas Daily.

4.  EPMI would pay a demand charge of $.025/MMBtu based on a max DQ of 20,000 
MMBtu/d times the number

Let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will try to close the deal with 
the customer.  If you could call me back today that would be great.
