Thank you for choosing Time Warner Road Runner as your high-speed online
provider.  After a search of our database your address was found to be
non-serviceable at this time.  While our system does serve your zip code, your
particular part of the zip code has not been upgraded.  We are adding you to a
list of persons to contact when we have expanded our service area to reach 
you.

A card will be sent to the address where service was requested giving an
approximate upgrade date.  The card includes a special offer of FREE
installation and a FREE month of Road Runner service.  Please keep the card as
this offer cannot be processed without it.

Thank you again for choosing Time Warner Road Runner and we look forward to
serving you in the near future.
