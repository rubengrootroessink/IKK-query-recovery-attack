Subject: El Paso's Proposal to Address the Allocation of Receipt Point 
Capacity

El Paso recently filed their proposal to reallocate receipt point capacity. 
Comments are due on Thursday, May 17, 2001.

We would like to meet with you to make sure our comments address the 
commercial concerns regarding the reallocation plan. In that regard, please 
plan to attend a meeting on Thursday, May 3 at 3:45 in 3269.  Becky will 
provide for your review a summary of El Paso's proposal.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Stephanie
