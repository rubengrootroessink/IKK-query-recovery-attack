Jane, I have a few issues with SWG per their email below.

1.  SWG says the price on Sitara 518455 (Day 7) should be $9.50 instead of 
$9.55.  If this is correct, could you please change the price in Sitara?
2.  On Sitara 386140, SWG says that the trigger amount should be calculated 
on the physical volume, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please let me know 
which is correct and adjust in Sitara if necessary?

Also, SWG will be shorting ENA $198,026.60 for liquidated damages on contract 
96003533.  Would you like me to fax the backup to Patti Sullivan as I did 
last month?

I have one last question for you on contract 96003533.  For November and 
December gas, SWG is paying on the last day of the month versus the 25th.  I 
checked the contract and it does confirm this information.  However, it is my 
understanding that SWG is a netout customer (they have been receivable only 
for quite some time).  I have checked with contracts and credit and cannot 
find a netting agreement.  Do you know if there is a netting agreement which 
might override the payment terms on this contract?  I have a $2MM dollar 
invoice with a 1/25 due date that they will not be paying until 1/31.

Thanks for your help
Laurie

1.  Detail was mailed to you on 1/15.  the amount on your invoice # 19861SA 
agrees in total except for line item 3 on page 1 of 3.  The price should be 
$9.50 instead of $9.55 per Mark Anderson of our purchasing dept.

2.  The credit you applied on your inv # 19838SA is incorrect per Bill 
Brown.  The price was triggered at $4.74 on scheduled volume received.  Nancy
