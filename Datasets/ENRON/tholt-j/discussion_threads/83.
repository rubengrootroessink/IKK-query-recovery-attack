Just wanted to let everyone know about the changes that will be made in the 
upcoming week(s) to the EPNG/Blanco/Blanco meter.  Currently, Blanco is an 
active pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the 
Deal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling 
language in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with 
the same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve 
three purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data 
reference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without 
affecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all 
they receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the 
Product Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different 
pricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily 
resolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in 
segregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be 
creating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO 
meters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make 
sure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When 
the change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for 
selection in Sitara.

Pipe Zone  Meter   Product Description
EPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language". 

EPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language".

Please call me if you have any questions.
