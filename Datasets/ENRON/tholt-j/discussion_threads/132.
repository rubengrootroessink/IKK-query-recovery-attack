Janie, per our telephone discussion this morning, attached is the file 
containing the above-referenced agreement.? Please review, and if it meets 
with ENA's approval, please mail two partially signed agreements to my 
attention for SoCalGas' completion.? If by chance there are changes to the 
agreement's notices section, please let me know, and I will send you a 
revised agreement.

If you have any questions, please give me a call. 

Thanks for your prompt attention.
