She likes white wines like white burgundy--I don't know any of the exact 
ones, but I can find out if you want me to.

Another idea she would really like is a gift certificate to the Taste of 
Texas.  She went there recently for the first time and really enjoyed it.

We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.
