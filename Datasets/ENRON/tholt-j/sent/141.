Ed  called me on the equipment.  I asked him if he could provide the 
computer.  I downloaded some inofrmation on EOL regarding technical questions 
which provides some of the requirements for EOL and sent them to him. Let me 
know if there is anything else he needs to provide.  I have talked to Julia's 
secretary and plane and hotel reservations have been reserved for Julie.
