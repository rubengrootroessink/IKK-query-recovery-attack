You're not going to believe this.  I talked to Amoco and they confirmed that 
I did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay Agave Energy 
because tit's a complicated internal deal.  So we are both right..  I only 
wished Amoco would have told me ahead of time.  Bottom line- pay Agave Energy 
and not Amoco
