Friday was so perfect.  It snowed huge snow flakes.  Accumulation was just 
about 1/4 inch. The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so 
it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It 
just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and 
they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts 
at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were 
drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion 
King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever 
seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all 
of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really 
cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. 
level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during 
the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe 
coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO 
Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building 
to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.  
You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen 
so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at 
was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match 
that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and 
nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one 
hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small 
Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second 
night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We 
got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.  I would go back agai n 
if the right opportunity came up.
