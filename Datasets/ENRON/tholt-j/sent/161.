Do not want to go to Vegas-been there too much already this year.  I am going 
to have a message in Co.  Good job on the fare-that's cheaper than mine.  If 
you want to stay at the RIOin Las Vegas-Southwest Gas has a cheap corporate 
rate that you can get-it's off the strip but it's nice. Every room is a 
sweat.  Just call and ask for it.
