Janie,

 I have been talking with EES and they have confirmed their volumes for their 
purchases from ENA (I believe that it is Zarin who comfirmed their volumes on 
their side).  I need you to confirm and verify our volumes and to change them 
(or contact who can change them) if needed.  I am trying to get EES to pay us 
for these transactions and they will not if they do not agree.  The amount 
that we are talking about is over $10 mil.  Could you please look at this so 
that I can get this resolved today?  The following shows what we are out:



Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks...
