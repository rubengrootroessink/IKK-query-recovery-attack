Frank-we need to know if you have made any  arrangements for Mom Tholt's 
funeral.  Barb, Mike and Bob are flying nto Washington DC Dulles on Tuesday 
to tour the city.  Joe and I are flying in on Thursday at noon.  Everyone is 
leaving on Sunday. Bob and Us are leaving early Sunday morning.  So we will 
be driving back on Saturday night.  We are planning to stay together and rent 
cars together. Aunt Mary Agnes has offered to make hotel reservations for 
those days people who will be staying in DC.  Either Barb or Mike will make 
reservations for Pennsylvania.  We need to know if you would like us to 
include you in our reservations or if you plan on just meeting us there.  
There is only going to be  Mass on Saturday for Mom Tholt at 11:30 followed 
by lunch at Aunt Jean's.

Aunt Mary Agnes is suppose to be sending us money in the mail for plane 
reservations.  Please let us know as soon as possible,
