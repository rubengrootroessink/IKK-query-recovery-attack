I wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation 
over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out 
of you.

Also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day.  I 
know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to 
express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own 
selfish reasons.
