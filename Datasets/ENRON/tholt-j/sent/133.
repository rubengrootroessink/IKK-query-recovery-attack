I talked to your assistant and gave her my itinerary-but I don't know if she 
got your ticket.  I have a flight that leaves around 5:30 p.m. on Monday.   
We are staying at the Biltmore.  There attire is business casual.  I am 
wearing nice slacks and a sweater.  I told Ed we would meet him about 8:00 
before the 8:30 meeting to make sure everything is working properly.  He is 
supplying the computer.  I was told that he only needed a high speed internet 
connection.  I also faxed him the info that is on Enron Online concerning 
what is needed regarding computer equipment.    I will give you more details 
on Monday regarding my flight and the address of the hotel.  Your assistent 
is out today so I don't know if she booked you on my flight or not.  I went 
through Travel Agency and  had them hold a reservation but not to ticket 
you..  Your secretary told me you do not like to use them so I left it in her 
hands.
