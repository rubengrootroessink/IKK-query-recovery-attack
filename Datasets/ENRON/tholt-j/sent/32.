Are you in agreement with the demand fee PG&E is charging us.  See e mail 
below from Client Services.

Tenaska is billing us for demand fees on PG&E because we didn't take all the 
gas that we were suppose to.  The amount is $50,382.00.  They have sent me a 
spreadsheet.  If you need me to fax it, please let me know.  

Can you also retouch the deal?  The $1 differential is not being calculated 
into the price.

Thanks,
Shielah
