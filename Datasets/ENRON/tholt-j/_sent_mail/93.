I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th 
(mon).  I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that 
night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible 
without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San 
Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for 
breakfast or lunch let me know.  I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet 
but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to 
check with you  first.
