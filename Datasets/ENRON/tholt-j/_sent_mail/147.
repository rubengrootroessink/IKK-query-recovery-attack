This date works for me so I will assume that Julie will be going.  I will 
work on flight  arrangements for Julie and I unless you think you might be 
going.  I need your help in determing what equipment needs we need.  Call me 
at 35539 or respond to this memo.

Jane: 

It looks like the Oct 31st works for most people here that would have a stake 
in this proposal.? I have set-up a meeting starting at 8:30 to 11:30 am.? Let 
me know if that works for you or if we need to adjust.? Also let's discuss 
any equipment needs you might need such as a data line for access to Internet 
and any audio video equipment so I can have it arranged.?? Hotels in the area 
are: The Biltmore, The Westin Bonaventure and The Intercontinental Hotel all 
within one block of our building.? I believe at the Biltmore we have a 
special rate if you mention that its for SoCalGas.

I'll be telecommuting tomorrow so you can reach me at my cell phone at (213) 
248-4053. 

Thanks very much 


Ed
