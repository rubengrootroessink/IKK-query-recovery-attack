Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.  
Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and 
Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was so 
relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana over 
Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I are 
taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your ranch, 
is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly into 
Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date because I 
love to hike.
