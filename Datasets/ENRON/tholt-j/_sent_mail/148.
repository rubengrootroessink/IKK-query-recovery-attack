I f we get out of here early, I may run to Foley's.  I will leave you a voice 
mail or an e-mail to let you know.So be sure to check.  I was just messing 
withyou on the Evita.  I am going out to lunch with a customer today so I'm 
not going to be extremely hungery.  Maybe we just go to PF Chang's and I can 
have a lettuce wrap.
