Tickets are free.   I don't think we'll need binoculars-seats are on floor.  
Enjoyed helping you over the week-end-that's what friends are for-at least 
where we came from.  The flowers you sent me are beautiful .. All of my 
favorites-gerber daisies and liliies.  You didn't  to do that with all of the 
furniture you gave me.  By the way-are your legs killing you.  My calves hurt 
like hell-think it's from going up and down the stairs barefoot on Saturday.  
I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we 
made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.  Can't believe he 
didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.  Hey-we may 
want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black 
bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green 
room.
