It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.  Deb is moving into her 
new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her 
nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.  I think we are going to 
try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open..  
Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.  However, if something changes, we will 
let you know.
