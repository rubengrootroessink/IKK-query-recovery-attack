Nat gas is at a discount with Enron stock at 83 and what's your stock price.  
Did I tell you the company is going to give us more stock options at the 
start of the year.  Oh-and we get free bus passes.  So not only do they 
provide me with free lunch every day-oh-did I  forget to mention that 
too.-but they pay for my transportation to work.
