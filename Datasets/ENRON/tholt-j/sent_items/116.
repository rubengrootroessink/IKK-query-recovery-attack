They are going to send out an e-mail to all parties requesting that anyone who wants to turn back capacity should so advise them and at that time select whether or not their identity should be disclosed.  The confidentiality of identity was the subject of our discussion yesterday, not whether or not we wanted to do it.

Becky call me on this.  I want them to know that we are willing to turn back the capapcity and put in the numbers and they can share the numbers.  We just don't want them to name Enron.

Bill:	This is to advise you that, contrary to our discussion yesterday, ENA does not want to disclose its desire to turn back our firm capacity on El Paso's system at this time.
