This is enough for me not to want to eat there ever again.

Hi ladies, just wanted to let you know of something that happened in our own 
area on the most terrible Tues. morning ever.  As people were dying in New 
York the manager and a female employee at our local IHOP pancake house on 
Hwy.6 @ 290 were clapping and celebrating.  The woman behind the cash 
register said "I cant wait to go home and celebrate with my family." 
This seems so hard to believe doesnt it?  My best friends neighbor was there 
and heard as did many others.  Many people walked out as did she.  She 
called the FBI and IHOP main office.   Not to mention have now heard the 
same story from someone else who was there at the same time. 
I am writting this to let you all know.  I will not give my American hard 
earned dollars to someone/anyone who would celebrate any American loss of 
life.   I would kindly request that all of you let friends and family know 
what went on at this restaurant.  When I first heard this it seemed so hard 
to believe, that anyone living and especially owning a business and 
benefiting from America would feel this way.   My best friend knows this 
woman well, this is not an internet hoax.   When I first heard the story I 
didn't know what to do, but as it is Sunday morning and I am picturing his 
restarant packed with Americans and him taking in all those dollars I have 
suddenly become inspired.   Not to mention when I first heard of this it 
seems so hard to beleive that anyone would feel this way you tend think 
"that just can't be true"  But it is!! 
Thanks. 
Laura

Not sure how often you eat at IHOP but I think we will find other places to
eat based on this story.

I usually do not forward email to people that have provided me with their
email addresses but I really felt that this was worth passing on.  I
received this email today and it made me really sad.  Even worse, my family
stop for  bite to eat there Friday night when Chili's was packed.  I
wondered why the restaurant was empty..

Anyway, please pass on if you can...

Thanks,
Pam
