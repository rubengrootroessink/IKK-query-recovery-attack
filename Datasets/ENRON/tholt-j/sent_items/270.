I like to make my own chili.  I load it up with beans, Sue uses pork and
beans(it's O.K.), but I like the beans mom used to use.    I was told I needed
to put a little more kick into my chili, so I figured that I would ask the
best-JOE.

Hey, for Christmas, I will provide the Ham and all the beer,wine,pop,liquor,
pie,chips , nuts and bread. I will have Amy make some barbacued weiners. I will
need you to make double baked potatoes. I will have Jean bring the polish
sausage and corn/greenbeans.  I may get some sourerkraut and dumplins from
Stoysich also.  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham.
I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne.( I thought it was
pretty good)
Do we need anything else? We are all off on that day, so we can start the party
as early as 3P.M. or earlier if you think, my guess is that you will be at the
casino that morning. Please advise.
