Neutral intervention is fine.

Subject:	Kern River Application for Kramer Junction Delivery Point

Kern River recently filed an application to construct the new Kramer Junction Delivery Point in San Bernardino County, CA as an alternative to the Wheeler Ridge Delivery Point.  Maximum design capacity is approx. 500 MMcf/d into the new Adelantro Lateral, planned by SoCal Gas, and existing and prospective expansion shippers have already contracted for approx. 328 MMcf/d of firm capacity.  SoCal Gas will reimburse Kern River for the cost of construction plus associated income taxes.  Kern River asks for approval within 30 days (by the end of November).

Any issues for ENA on this project that would require more than a plain intervention?   Are we one of the shippers?

Here is a link to the main part of the application:
