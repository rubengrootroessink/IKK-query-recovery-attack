>The Bowl Championship Series ranking formula was designed
>to give something to everybody. The human polls are counted
>along with computer rankings, the strength of schedule is
>factored in, and teams are penalized for losses and
>credited for victories over better teams. As it has the
>past three years, the system worked. Can anyone honestly
>say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska (11-1) is not the best
>matchup for the national title game?
>
>Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes' faithful
>are trying to say it is not.
>
>Yes, Colorado (10-2) beat the Cornhuskers handily and went
>on to win the Big 12 championship.
>
>The Buffaloes also lost two games, one to Fresno State, a
>fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr. But
>Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic
>Conference title; Louisiana Tech did. The Bulldogs posted
>an 11-2 record by beating league teams like Tulsa, Southern
>Methodist, Nevada and San Jose State - a group that
>finished with a combined 11-34 record.
>
>The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off
>Texas, 39-37, in the conference championship game, but the
>Longhorns rolled over Colorado by 41-7 earlier in the
>season. One loss in a season when there are not two
>undefeated teams is understandable; rewarding two losses
>would be absurd.
>
>Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl. If the
>Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska
>upends top-ranked Miami in the title game, shame on any
>voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides
>that Colorado (11-2) is more deserving of the No. 1 ranking
>than Nebraska (12-1).
>
>Oregon (10-1), on the other hand, has a right to feel
>slighted. The Ducks can also be heartened that a
>Miami-lose, Oregon-win scenario might earn them the A.P.'s
>top ranking.
>
>The Ducks, who only lost to a very good 9-2 Stanford team,
>are ranked No. 2 in both the A.P. and USA Today/ESPN
>coaches polls. The strength-of-schedule and computer
>component of the B.C.S. formula did Oregon in. The won-lost
>records of opponents and opponents' opponents don't lie.
>For Oregon, those numbers add up to the nation's
>31st-toughest schedule compared to Nebraska's 14th-ranked
>schedule.
>
>Even if you dislike or don't understand the computer
>rankings, they account for only 25 percent of the B.C.S.
>formula. Oregon was ranked as high as No. 2 by one
>computer, and as low as No. 8 by another. Both were thrown
>out, as the formula requires, and the remaining six
>computer service rankings were averaged. Oregon's
>average-point total was 4.83, which means the computers
>rated it as the fourth- or fifth-best team in the nation.
>
>The math is essentially the short way of telling you what
>an hour of reviewing Oregon's season game recaps spell out:
>the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great
>opponents.
>
>Six of their games were decided by 7 points or fewer. In
>four games, the margin was 3 or fewer. The Ducks had to
>persevere against Wisconsin (5-7), Southern California
>(6-5), U.C.L.A. (7-4) and Oregon State (5-6).
>
>Without the moral authority of the No. 2 ranking in the
>human polls, Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks' fans
>would assume the same gracious (and silent) posture as the
>coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland, both also
>10-1. They would celebrate their fine season at a
>high-profile bowl game, regret their single loss and admit
>that a down year in their respective conferences cost them
>a trip to the big game.
>
>And how about that moral authority? After Tennessee lost to
>Louisiana State last Saturday, the coaching colleagues of
>Nebraska's Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of
>Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of
>the title game.
>
>Say what you want about computers and formulas, but doesn't
>it bother you that the human component of the B.C.S.
>formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the
>integrity of the standing?
>
>Beyond Colorado and Oregon, the loudest whining is coming
>from the college playoff proponents, many of whom are A.P.
>poll voters. Fortunately, they too account for 25 percent
>of the B.C.S. standing.
>
>. . .
>
>So far, university presidents have emphatically shot down
>any playoff structure. Wisely, in my opinion. Would the
>last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado,
>Oklahoma to Oklahoma State, Texas to Colorado, Florida to
>Tennessee, and Tennessee to L.S.U. have been as urgent or
>dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee
>it up again in a week or two and commence a round-robin?
>
>Of all the major sports, only college football offers a
>regular season that matters. Expanded playoffs in the pro
>sports and even the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament
>give fans cues when to pay attention. In college football,
>you pay attention from August on because the playoff is
>under way.
>
>The B.C.S. standing was created to ensure that the best two
>teams met in a title game, which wasn't always guaranteed.
>Tennessee-Florida State? Virginia Tech-Florida State?
>Oklahoma-Florida State? The past three B.C.S. title games
>resulted in an undisputed national champion.
>
>Cut through all the noise, and in Nebraska you'll find a
>team that won 11 straight by 10 points or more. Yes,
>Nebraska's loss was ugly and it came in the season finale,
>which pollsters, for some reason, have historically found
>abhorrent. Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado
>and has faced better competition than Oregon.
>
>You may not like the B.C.S. formula, but it is fair.
>Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms. Whether you
>argue it with barroom gusto or classroom decorum, the
>B.C.S. made the right game.
