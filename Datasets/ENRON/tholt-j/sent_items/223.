Do you anticipate making these trades often?  If it will not be that frequent, just a notification (from you or Anne is fine) will do.  If they will be ongoing, it will probably be easier to have two separate entities set up.  My concern is the fact that they want to exclude this piece from our netting agreement.  Are you OK with that?

Janie,

On second thought, this may be a little more complicated.  So Cal wants to treat these trades as if they are a separate entity and they also do not want to include them with our monthly netout.  If this is going to happen on a go forward basis, maybe we need to get legal documentation from So Cal allowing us to setup two separate Global counterparties.  What do you think?

Thanks
Laurie

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

Thanks
