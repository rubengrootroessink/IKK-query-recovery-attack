I have pathed this deal in Path Manager and balanced.  There is still 43,559 then leftover unaccounted for on the trades, correct?

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James
