Becky-we can just intervene as an interested party-no ax to grind

Kern River has filed for a certificate to build and operate a delivery lateral pipeline to serve the High Desert Power Project (Constellation Energy Group) generating plant near Victorville, CA.  It would be 31.6 miles of 24" pipe with a design capacity of 282,000 Dth/d, and the fuel supplier for the plant (Victorville-Gas, LLC) has signed a binding precedent agreement for the full 282,000 Dth for a primary term of 21 years, with evergreen, at a negotiated rate.  The initial recourse rate is proposed to be $0.0583/dth.  Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for 7/1/03.  Interestingly, the notice states that the plant will initially require up to 141,000 dth/d to operate.  The rest of the capacity is to accommodate another plant at the site.

Do we need to intervene in this proceeding?  Any comments?  This is not a rush, but would like to know by Aug. 14th.
