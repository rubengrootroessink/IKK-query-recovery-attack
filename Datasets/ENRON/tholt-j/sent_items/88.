Janie, thanks for forwarding.  After reading the list, it looks like she may
have intentionally left us off the list.  She probably thinks of us as part
of Pacific Gas & Electric, and may not realize we do not share views on this
subject.  I do see that she has Frank Lindh on the list.  Do you think you
should ask her if it is OK for you to include me?  Let me know what you
think.

Susan
