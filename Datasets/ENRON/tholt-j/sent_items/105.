We aslo want to add the California delivery points as receipts points with a potential interruptible back-haul rate to the EOC delivery points.

Here is what came out of the west meeting today, at least as much as I can remember, and Janie has it all in her head anyway.

I will analyze the re-recall issue, so I need Becky and Steph to get me all the orders and contracts, etc.

We will argue for rationalization of the El Paso system, which entails turning back capacity before construction

We will file in the EP negotiated agreement case with Trachtabel to support indicated shippers (can I see what indicated shippers filed?).

6 pools, no linear pooling, etc.

anything else?

Becky, if I could I would like to meet with you and Janie Monday night at the hotel to discuss our strategy.  thanks.
