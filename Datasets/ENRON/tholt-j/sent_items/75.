no- the more the merrier.   Just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up..   By the way I talked on the QT to the Socal Gas trader and told him that I could not fathom that they would even consider 143 receipts points.  He said Rob Davis is clueless and currently is on a power trip.  They are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around.

Leslie and I work closely with Donna Fulton in our D.C. office.  I was talking to her yesterday evening after the meeting and told her how much we got out of it.  I think it would be very helpful to us all if she also participated by phone as often as she is able and she is willing to do so.  Would you have any problem with that?

Mike really enjoyed the meeting  yesterday.  Thank you both for attending.  We are scheduled to have that same meeting every two weeks.  I hope that one or both of  you can attend via conference call or in person.. I will try to remember to call you on the day of the meeting   to see if you want to attend or to advise you of any change in plans.  Thanks again .
