We are leaving late on Xmas day- I can't stay longer because that is our critical time at work.  We come in on Saturday afternoon.  I bought Dad some black suede slip on shoes for Xmas-you know the new style-

That's a good idea, everybody likes salad and it would go good with sandwiches.
We could also make some bakes beans.  It would be like a barbacue/.  Ham
,polish sausage, macaroni salad and baked beans.  That wouild really make for
an interesting afternoon.  That will make sure Mrs. Alberg stays upstairs.
