Leslie will be here next week (Tues & Wed).  She'll probably be getting in too late for lunch on Tuesday.  If you're here on Wednesday, I'll check and see if she would be available.  She usually gets scheduled up pretty heavy when she's here, but I haven't checked on her schedule for Wednesday.  I know she and I have a lot to go through.

Janie - are you planning to have the West Desk Regulatory Meeting tomorrow at 2:30?  I don't have anything of substance to talk about, unless FERC puts the El Paso proceedings on the agenda for next week.
