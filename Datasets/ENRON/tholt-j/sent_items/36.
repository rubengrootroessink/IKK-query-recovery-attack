How is Deb's knee?  Did she ever go to a real doctor?
[Tholt, Jane M.]  
YesShe is having physical theraphy 3 times a week.  She said it is getting better.  I haven't seen her for a couple of weeks and have only talked to her.  I wil l probably be calling you next week-the desk wants me to become more involved in regulatory updates so I will seek your assistance with this matter.
