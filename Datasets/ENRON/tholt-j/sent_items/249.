Sean, deal 1093464 is a sell to Southwest Gas for Oct-01 production.  On day 24, they show the price should be a fixed price of $2.64 (see email below).  However, we show 100% of ELPASO.SJNONBOND.GDP.  Can you please check on this for me and let me know your results?

Thanks
Laurie

Laurie, I have one problem on your invoice.  Package # Q91 (your ref 134 on 10/24 I show as a flat price of @$2.64.  I have checked here and our guys say $2.64.  Can you check your end.  No other problems.  Nancy
