Subject:=09Invitation to settlement meetings
Importance:=09High

SRP would like to host 2.5 days of settlement discussions in Phoenix. The
proposed schedule is:

EOC   =09=099/11      1 - 4 pm
All parties=099/12 =099 - 5 pm
All parties=099/13=099 - noon

The intent is to discuss any and all settlement proposals, as well as
feedback from parties on the proposal sent out by SRP. Please circulate any
comments or proposals to this distribution list prior to the meetings. All
materials will be for settlement purposes only.

I have not invited El Paso, nor all of the parties. IF you peruse the
distribution list and see a name that should be on it, let me know.

As you know, Joel is on vacation through Labor Day. Please RSVP to me as to
whether or not you will be attending or sending a representative.

I look forward to seeing you in September.
