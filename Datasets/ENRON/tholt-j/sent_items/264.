I tried calling but noone picked up the phone.  Anyway, I just wanted to ch=
eck and make sure you don't have any questions about running keystone and s=
ocal.  Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way unti=
l the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cen=
ts.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny=
).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market =
is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm ba=
ck to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  The=
se markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8=
000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in =
position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport=
 out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably wa=
nt to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.  Check with Patt=
i regarding the injection capacity since Socal raised it this weekend and t=
here may be other changes to the schedule.  I'm available for any questions=
 on my cell phone...832-444-7702.=20

Have fun,
