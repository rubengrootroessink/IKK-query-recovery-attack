I guess I was out that day and another trader did the deal and input the wrong price-so go ahead and honor their price

Jane, can you please call Mark Anderson at SWG on this price issue?  They won't budge.

Thanks
Laurie

I checked with Mark Anderson again and he says the deal was not made with Jane.  It was made with Steve South and he insisted that it be the fixed price deal of $2.64.  If Jane does not agree have her call Mark Anderson.  Nancy
  



Nancy, can you have your trader call our trader Jane Tholt?  She says our price is correct - I guess they need to work this one out.

Thanks
Laurie

Sean, deal 1093464 is a sell to Southwest Gas for Oct-01 production.  On day 24, they show the price should be a fixed price of $2.64 (see email below).  However, we show 100% of ELPASO.SJNONBOND.GDP.  Can you please check on this for me and let me know your results?

Thanks
Laurie
