Energy Commission Clock Starts
On Two New Power Plant Proposals


Sacramento - Two new power plant applications started the California Energy Commission approval process with unanimous votes today. Commissioners deemed the applications data adequate for the Magnolia Power Project in Burbank and the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility in North San Jose.
The 4-to-0 Commission vote finding the Magnolia Power Project data adequate means that the staff has enough information to begin the six-month licensing review. A unanimous vote also began the four-month licensing process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility.
Simple-cycle power plants that can be on-line by December 31, 2002 can be licensed under the four-month - fast track - process. The six-month process is for thermal power plants that will not cause significant adverse impacts to public health, the environment or transmission system. In both cases, projects must comply with local, state and federal laws, ordinances, regulations and standards, including the California Environmental Quality Act.
The Magnolia Power Project is a proposal from the Southern California Public Power Authority. The 250-megawatt, natural gas, combined-cycle electrical generating facility would be located at the site of the existing City of Burbank power plant. The city would operate the new plant that is intended to supply power as well to Anaheim, Colton, Glendale and Pasadena.

Magnolia is expected to cost $200 to $250 million. A workforce of approximately 320 craft and professional personnel is planned to build the facility. The proposed construction schedule would take 23 months, putting the plant on-line by the summer of 2004.
The Committee that will oversee the Magnolia Power Project review is comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert A. Laurie as Presiding Member and Commissioner Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Associate Member.
For more information on the project, check the California Energy Commission web site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/magnolia

The Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility is proposed by Calpine c* Power. The plant, planned for 15 acres in North San Jose at Highway 237 and Zanker Road, would produce 180 megawatts using four gas-fired, simple-cycle turbines. The project's key goals are providing a reliable source of electricity to the proposed U.S. Dataport facility scheduled for construction on an adjacent site and putting power on the grid to support South Bay energy needs.
Los Esteros is expected to cost $250 million. A crew of 287 will build the plant if licensed. Construction and testing are projected to be complete by summer 2002.
The Committee named this morning to oversee the review process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility consists of Energy Commission Chair William J. Keese as Presiding Member and Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) C. Moore, Ph.D., Associate Member. More information on Los Esteros is located on the Energy Commission web site at:
