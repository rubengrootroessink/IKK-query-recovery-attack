Hello.  I just wanted to tell some of my favorite people (to work with) that after today, Thursday, November 15th, I will no longer be part of the Regulatory Affairs Team.  I'm moving on to a different part of Enron, EES.  In fact, I officially start November 16th.

 I really enjoyed working with/and for you guys.  I've learned quite a bit from you all and I wanted to say Thanks.

Sincerely,

Melinda
