Sounds good to me as long as I have my own bathroon at the hotel in Paris.  Why does the description for the double include a shower.?  Does that mean that single rooms only have a bath tub?

Bonjour mes amies!!!!!!!!!!

The hotel where I am making our reservations for in Paris can be found at the following web site: www.france-hotel-guide.com/h75006stgermaindespres2.htm      As you can see, the rates for singles are really cheap by Paris standards, and include breakfast.  Leonard and I  stayed here twice before--it's in a great location.

 As I've done Normandy once before and have  good information, and as I've done Paris and London several times, if you guys want, I'll prepare a suggested itinery ,with associated costs, for the portion of the trip from London to Normandy to Paris;  then we can all look at it before making final plans.  Sound O.K.??

J'espere que vous avez un jour fantastique!!!  [I hope you have a great day!!]

Nous pouvons avoir dejeuner quelque jours avant pour parler le francais, d'accord??  [We can have some lunches or dinners to begin practicing French before our trip, O.K.?]

xoxo, Mme. Christie.
