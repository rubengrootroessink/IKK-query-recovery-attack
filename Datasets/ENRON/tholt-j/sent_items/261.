All the gas stocks getting hammered.  Natural gas is bursting at the seams.  Your bill should go way down

I ordered the pies for our big Thanksgiving day feast at Jeanies.  Wish
you could be there.  Dad is bringing the beer, he said one  12 pack
would do, I told him to bring a case, just in case someone wants more
that one can. I know that Joan is not coming to dinner.  Should we
invite her to Christmas or wait for her to call.    If you ever talk to
her, you may want to mention that her father is still alive and lives in
the same house that she was raised in.  I hope she comes for Christmas.
If she doesn't, I doubt that I will ever invite to anything again.  But
that is that fucking Links "better that everybody else"attitude.   I
might just turn that sideways and stick it up his German ass.  Hey our
stock is going up, how bout yours?
