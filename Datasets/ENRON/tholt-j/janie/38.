Jane, I still have two discrepancies with Southwest Gas which I need your 
help in resolving.

1.  SWG says price on Sitara 518455 Day 7 should be $9.50 instead of $9.55 - 
You have already confirmed with me that the price should be $9.55.  I 
forwarded your email to my contact at SWG and she responded with the email 
below.  Could you please call SWG trader Mark Anderson so that this can be 
resolved?

2.  On Sitara 386140 SWG says trigger is calculated on physical, not 
scheduled, volume - You have already confirmed with me that the trigger is 
based on scheduled volume and that you feel SWG will not agree.  According to 
my contact at SWG, their trader Bill Brown confirmed with her that the 
trigger is based on physical volume.  Can you please call Bill so that this 
discrepancy can be resolved?

I appreciate your help in resolving these issues.  Although I have already 
forwarded your responses to Nancy at SWG, she is being very insistent that 
SWG is correct and is requesting that the traders resolve these issues.

Thanks again
Laurie

Jane, per SWG's email below, can you please call Mark Anderson to resolve the 
price discrepancy I questioned (SWG says the price on Sitara 518455, Day 7, 
should be $9.50 instead of $9.55).

Please have her contact Mark Anderson our trader.  He assured me it was 
$9.50.  I'm sure she has his #.  It's up to them to resolve this.  Nancy
