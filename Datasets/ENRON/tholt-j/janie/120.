Subject:	New Reporting Requirements on Natural Gas Sales to California	Markets

Please see the attached order, which was issued by FERC on July 25, 2001.  The information specified in the order will need to be submitted monthly for the six-month period covering August 1, 2001 through January 31, 2002.  FERC plans to extend the reporting requirement through September 30, 2002 when it receives OMB approval.   The information will need to be submitted  Fortunately, FERC is recognizing the commercial sensitivity of purchase and sales transaction data and will treat it as "confidential" under FOIA exemption 4.  Transportation information obtained from pipelines and LDCs, on the other hand, was not deemed to be commercially sensitive.  However, respondents will be permitted to request privileged treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 388.112 of FERC's regulations.

Please give us a call if you have any questions.
