Janie,

I regret that when you called yesterday you didn't feel that anyone outside of me knew what was going with your portfolio.  Let me reassure you that there are several that are part of the team that immerse themselves in the accounts that we manage.  Unfortunately, insurance products are held at the insurance company.  We have submitted the proper paperwork to change the broker dealer.  That has been done.  Now we're waiting for First Union to network the annuities into your account so we can see them daily.  We at anytime can call Venture and get values and allocations.  We also have your profile on a spreadsheet where we track your Venture piece, 401k, Accounts with us etc...
Let me give you the result of the Annuities;

2106218    Current market -$6,718.00  Grip value 12,617.  Currently in Cash

2016219  Current market - 52,187.00  Grip value
100,880.85.  Currently in Cash.

2235338  Current market- 204,005  Grip value
222,923.  Currently in cash.

2235337  Current market- 137,391  Grip value
160,636.  Currently in cash.

2235339  Current Market- 40,101  Grip value
44,584.  Currently in cash.

2235336  Current Market- 15,586.  Grip value
17,700.  Currently in Aim All CAP.

The grip value is the guaranteed value through annuitization.  You have a guaranteed growth rate of 6% on an annual basis, with a step up election if the market value has performed greater than 6%.  The markets were great in 98 and 99 with the first annuities that we made an invest in.  We stepped up the market performance and that is why the grip value is at the levels listed.  We are in the final stages of the annuities being networked into your accounts.  One has already shown up on the account.  The other 5 should follow through shortly.  I'll track it daily and keep you posted.  The important thing for you to know is the the positions are in cash, except Josephs (I spoke to him last night, he sure sounds like a fun guy) annuity.  Hope that this helps.

Pat
