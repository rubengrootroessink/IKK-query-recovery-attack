Subject:	El Paso's Proposal to Address the Allocation of Receipt Point Capacity

El Paso recently filed their proposal to reallocate receipt point capacity. Comments are due on Thursday, May 17, 2001.

We would like to meet with you to make sure our comments address the commercial concerns regarding the reallocation plan. In that regard, please plan to attend a meeting on Thursday, May 3 at 3:45 in 3269.  Becky will provide for your review a summary of El Paso's proposal.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Stephanie
