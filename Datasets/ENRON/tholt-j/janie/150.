Leslie:	Is this in good enough legal form, since it is an informal request?

Janie:	I tried to make the questions very specific.  Does this still say what you want to know?

Dear Mr. Collins:

RE:	Docket No. RP00-336-000

Pursuant to the procedures agreed to at the August 28 technical conference in the referenced proceeding, Enron North America Corp. submits the following informal data requests:

1.	Please specify the receipt points that are associated with each of the twenty pools that El Paso proposes to use for allocation of receipt point rights in this proceeding.
2.	For each of the specified receipt points, please provide on a monthly basis the average daily volume of gas that was scheduled for receipt into El Paso's system for each month from January 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001.
3.	For each of the specified receipt points that is not an interstate pipeline interconnection, please indicate whether, to the best of El Paso's knowledge, gas from supply sources upstream of the receipt point can be transported on any other pipeline, i.e., whether or not they are split-connected.

Please provide the requested information electronically in Excel spreadsheet format to the undersigned, with a copy to Jane Tholt (jane.m.tholt@enron.com <mailto:jane.m.tholt@enron.com>).

Sincerely,



Rebecca W. Cantrell
