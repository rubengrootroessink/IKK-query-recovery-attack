Subject:	Information on Physical Index Positions and the transport deals assigned to you

Attached please find the following three spreadsheets:

1.  A list of all Pipes and Zones with the trader's name and book by each.  We have assigned all July out physical deals (purchases and sales) according to this list.

The only thing that may be a little confusing right now is that Tori's name is by the SJ book.  Jane will manage the SJ book at first and then the switch will take place after Tori returns. 

 

2. A list of the transport Capacity Tickets and the traders assigned to each

 

3.  The most important List;  

This list represents the Physical Index position by point for July.  The one transport deal that was mixed into the system generated reports has been removed.  This list represents your Physical Index Positions as of Last night, May 19, 2001.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I can update the positions list periodically, if you need it.

Thank you.

Anne
