I have put together a summary of discrepancies with the Imbalance trades for Socal.  I have attached my file to show where the problems exist.  I'm not sure who needed to receive this information so I am sending it to both traders that have forwarded me the spreadsheet.  Bridget Williams from EES spoke with Jane on Wednesday 9/5 regarding the missing purchases for 4/01 and 5/01.  The sales side of these transactions have been pathed but as my spreadsheet shows we are indeed out of balance by their purchase volumes.   I will also need to get resolution on these issues as soon as possible.  If you have questions or problems please let me know.

Thanks,
