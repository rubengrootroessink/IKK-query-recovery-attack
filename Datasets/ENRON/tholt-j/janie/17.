Jane,

you need to submit a request via the eRequest system.  (itcentral.enron.com)

Search for west power under "applications" and select general access, 
just note that you're in west gas.

That should do it.

I currently trade on the west desk gas desk and would like to get access to 
the westpower.enron.com website.  Phillip Allen thought that maybe you could 
help me.  Please advise.  Thank you.
