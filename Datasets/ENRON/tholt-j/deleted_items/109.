Thanks, I saw your name in Sitara.  Sorry for the mix up.

I have not done any deals with Sierra Pacific but will pass on to Steve South.

Hi Jane,

According to my contact at Sierra Pacific/Nevada Power, the deals you're doing with them should be with Nevada Power , not Sierra Pacific.  For Sept, the deal #s I see are 737918, 796406,and 1043833.  Is there any reason why we can't change the counterparty name in Sitara to Nevada Power?



Thanks
