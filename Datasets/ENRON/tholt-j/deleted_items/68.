Jane,

Bass Enterprises Production Co. invites you to bid on the attached packages
of natural gas.  We prefer bids based on first-of-the-month IFERC Pipeline
Index (are premiums out there?) for the period November 1, 2001 through
March 31, 2002.  Please note that West Sandy Hook must be purchased along
with Pointe a la Hache/Cox Bay.  Please have your bid(s) to me by the end of
business on Tuesday, October 23, 2001.  The attached spreadsheet should be
self explanatory.  If you have any questions please call me at 817-339-7339.

Thanks,

Rob Henk
Bass Enterprises Production Co.
