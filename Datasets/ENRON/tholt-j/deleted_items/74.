	WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth herein, ENA respectfully requests that the Commission require El Paso to immediately begin refunding demand charges for firm capacity that shippers have nominated but not been able to utilize because of system inadequacies, convene further proceedings to address the complex issues raised by the commenters in response to the El Paso receipt point allocation proposals, and give such guidance as it can, in response to the numerous arguments and assertions made in the Initial and Reply Comments, to help the parties craft a mutually acceptable resolution of the capacity allocation at issue in this case.
