I see where Enron might be in a little trouble with their stock.  Hope
you don't have too much of that stock.  Big game on Saturday.  I am
going down with Pat to the game.  Dad is going with Jeannie and Gary.
Every thing is fine up here . I have 50 weeks left to work.  I think I
can make it. Next time to talk to dad you may ask him when was the last
time him and Bob Potter beat me and Pat in golf.  We have kicked them
the last three times.  Joan still has not come to Omaha and visisted
dad.  I think I might send her a picture of her father so she knows what
he looks like.  Talked to Gary Stevens last night and Jean was having
some dizzy spells yesterday when she woke up.  She is going to the
doctor today.  Gary said she was really doing well .  When I talked to
her, she even sounded like her old self.  Hopefully it's just an inner
ear infection or problems with her sinuses.  I will keep you posted.

GO BIG RED!
