I'm confused - Cara had already entered an annuity, deal #709630.1, for $43,708.25 for the scheduling fee.  Kate, is the deal #723265.1 in addition?  What is it for? - Amy

I've entered a sale annuity (723265) between the Short Term West Hourly and Short Term West Services books to divide the July EPE scheduling fees. Also, it appears the original annuity billed to El Paso has been changed to physical, so that should be set to liquidate. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

This was entered as a financial annuity - can it be entered as a physical annuity? - Amy

The annuity will be entered by the person hired to handle EPE's scheduling.  I will do it for August unless that person is already up to speed.  This will be invoicable only for July 1 on.  I have added the July annuity already.  It was deal # 709630

Cara - will you be adding this annuity into EnPower so that I can include it in my invoice to El Paso for June?

Thanks - A

Kathy had a meeting with Rodger and the accounting people at EPE, and they want to just show everything on the sheet and not do any billing changes in the individual deals.  I explained your point and validated that I thought it would help them later with the PUC stuff.  She told me that she is talking to our settlements person in Houston (Amy Clemons) and wants to show it as just part of the overall invoice number each month instead of breaking it out.  She said that would accomplish the same thing.

Pete is out of the office until Monday, but they are going to get his final blessing on this before the final OK is given on procedure.

Let me know if there is anything further I need to do on this.
