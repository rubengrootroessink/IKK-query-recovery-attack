For your reference, the following counterparties have terminated deals with us. A separate portfolio has been set up in Enpower to handle these deals from Jan 2002 through the remaining term of each deal and will no longer be valued under the West Region.  The new deal numbers are listed under the Bank Deal column on the attached spreadsheet. The original deals will only have volumes until Dec 31, 01 in the west portfolio.

Please forward this on to anyone who made need it for their reference. Let me know if you have any questions.

John
