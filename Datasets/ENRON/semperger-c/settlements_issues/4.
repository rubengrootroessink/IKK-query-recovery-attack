I believe the preschedule loss charge is valid for 2/9/01, as I see no loss schedule represented on the scheduling sheet.

Dear Cara and Bill,

Do you recognize these charges as valid  (Cara for 2-9 and Bill for 2-14)?  

Virginia

Hi Amy!

I tried to return your call from yesterday this morning, but only got your voice mail.

The February bill for $341.90 was for two days:  February 9th and 14th.  February 9th (Tag No. 16259) was priced for 1 MW @ $207.99.  February 14th was a real-time transaction with no tag for less than a MW priced at $133.91.  I checked our records and saw no energy return for losses to WACM from Enron at any time during February.

Please call if you have further questions.
