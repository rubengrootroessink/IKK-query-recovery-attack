None of your folks moved. 

As ratings are not mandatory they have removed from the form.  I would encourag you to put it in supervisor comments.

Let me know if you need anything else!

Are the numbers the same, or was their movement?

Are you going to publish a list with the numbers,  there was no place on the reivew form to put it.
