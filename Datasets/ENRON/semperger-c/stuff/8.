Dear Cara,  I can not speak for the other two but I want you to know that
I love you very, very much. The only way I could love you
more/differently is if you were my own offspring. It has been my
privilege to embrace you as part of our family. I was so happy to learn
that you were going to marry Dave and make it official. I love you very
much and will continue to love you for all time and eternity. You are a
special lady.

You have helped me in many ways. You came to my side when I had the
overwhelming job of caring for my Mother. Your wisdom and experience made
that part of life a lot easier. The help you gave Christine was
priceless.  Many times you have given me words of encouragement that gave
me that little bit I needed to go ahead and try what ever it was that I
was so unsure of. You comforted me when we lost Mom and Chip. You were
there for me when we nearly lost Cheri and when Dad took his turn hurting
me. Then there was the church crap that you listened to and helped me to
understand that I was not all the things they said I was and that we
could do better than to bury ourselves in 'that'. You cared for Nathan
for me so I could go and take care of Cheri. I was able to go without
having to choose between two people that I love. You are helping me in
other ways now that I will not discuss, but you know. Last but not at all
least is your humor. That has gotten me through untold hard times. You
will never know the half. I am not even sure I know all what a blessing
you have been to me.

I knew that when I started this list I would forget something and I am
sure I have. These are the things that pop into my mind when I think of
you. I love you very much and I Praise the Lord that He brought you into
our lives.    

Mom
