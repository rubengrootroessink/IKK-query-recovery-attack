Cara,

Portland will be Tuesday Sept 18 (with hospitality suite evening of Sept

OATI is proud to demonstrate our Etag 1.7 readiness to the industry by
announcing training dates and locations for Etag 1.7 Orientation
Workshops to be held around the US, and Etag 1.7 Hands-On Training
sessions to be held at the OATI Data Center in Minneapolis.

Please visit our corporate Internet site by clicking the "OATI" logo in
your ETS toolbar or by going to http://www.oatiinc.com, and enter the
