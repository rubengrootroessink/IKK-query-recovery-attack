Subject: Northwest Power Pool System Schedulers Meeting Announcement
-October 23-24, 2001


Attached is the meeting announcement (1023-01FN.doc) for the System Schedulers Meeting which will be held in Portland, Oregon on October 23-24, 2001 at The Benson Hotel.  Please note that the room reservation cutoff date is September 29th, 2001. 

Also attached is the Meeting Attendance Confirmation Form (Registration2001.doc).  Please fax or email this form by October 12, 2001.  

This year we are sending out a Burning Issues form (Burning Issues102301.doc) for you to fill out and email to myself or drop in the box at the handouts table on the first meeting day.  We are hoping this will give everyone a chance to get their issues out on the table for discussion.

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
