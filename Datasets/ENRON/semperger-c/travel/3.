You are invited to participate in one of three workshops designed to
solicit input into training
issues which will help NERC understand what operating and marketing
personnel feel they need in
the way of training programs and study materials.

Attached is the announcement and registration form. The announcement is
also posted at the
following NERC web site: http://www.nerc.com/~filez/workshops.html

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Glenda Rodriguez
