I'm just sitting here trying to catch up on e-mail, trying to get ready for the shut down and all I can think about are those beautiful eyes of yours.

I just love the way you look at me. I can't wait to see you again. you've definitely got some cuddle time coming to you.

Talk to you later sweetie. 


Craig.
