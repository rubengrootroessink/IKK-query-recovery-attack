I do have plans. I'm going over to my uncles for a little family get together. I'm not going until around 6ish. I would love to just spend the day with you. :-)

I don't think we are going to be able to go see Lord of the rings tonight, sold out. I haven't talked to sissy yet so I'm not sure what the plan is. I will let you know as soon as possible.

I am soooo tired today. It's a very good tired though. :-) 

Miss you. 

Sir.

Hi, 

I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my 
head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. 
You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would 
really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you. 


I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, 
keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my 
fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans? 


Bye my special one, 

Kitten
