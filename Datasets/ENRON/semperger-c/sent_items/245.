MEAD HLH schedule for 5mw has a late downstream change.  Also, see Morgan tag #MS04315.  I could not access the new data base to change the path myself.

PAC(GEN)CH4-APS(T)CH4/WW5#1198(F)-APS(T)WW5/MED5#1197(F)-AZPS(T)MED5/MED2#1210(F)-PACE-EPMI-PNM-PPLE-MORGAN-PINW-APS(T)MD2/WW-PINW

The previous downstream was Morgan wheeling into SP15 from Mead.

Thanks, Donald, presched.
