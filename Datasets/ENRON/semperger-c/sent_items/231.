Hi

Donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report. Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if Donald will have time.  Maybe you can do this with Vish and Donald's Passwords?

Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.


I am just ducky.
