Hi Mom,

I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!

How is Natalie doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.

Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.


I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.


Cara
