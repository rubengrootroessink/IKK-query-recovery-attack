Mine is all done, whiz quiz completed and Paperwork given to Gabrielle

Thanks.

Does this mean that the final stuff is done and we are all locked in for UBS? I understood that there was one final thing to happen before we were officially 'done'

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!
