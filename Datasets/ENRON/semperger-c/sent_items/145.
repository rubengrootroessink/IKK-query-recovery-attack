Hi Mom,

Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.

I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.

School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  

I love you!
