Cara,

The Deals 576490.1 & 737863.1 are booked in strange way, we segregate these deals depend on the Day week Mask, 

If DOW is  -MTWTFS- (Monday thru Saturday, excluding Sunday & Holidays), for WEST desks we segregate them into  1-24 Hours category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400) 
If DOW is S------H (Sunday and Holiday, except Monday thru Saturday), for WEST desk we segregate them into Off Peak Deals
If DOW is -MTWTFS--(Monday thru Friday, excluding Saturday, Sunday & Holidays), for EAST desks we are secreting them into  1-24 Hours Category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400)  
If DOW is S------SH--(Saturday, Sunday & Holidays excluding Monday thru Friday), for EAST desks we are secreting them into Off Peak Deals

Where as 
Deal # 576490 DOW is -MTWTFSH,  that is  the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section
Deal # 737863 DOW is SM--TFSH, that is the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section

If you want to segregate the deal into OnPeak/24 Hours/Off-Peak  depending on the number of hours it is flowing, not depend on the Day Week mask, let me know I will make the changes required in Pre - Schedule Work Space an release it in the next version.


Thanks,
Vish

Good Evening

I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the "OFF PEAK" deals. 

The deal numbers are:

576490.1	 
737863.1	 


Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?


Here is my PSW sheet:
