BuildRoute report is ready for testing now.  Please see version 3.2.3.10 in enpower stage environment.  Two optional check boxes are created as requested: "exclude DART" and "include DART only".  Let me know if it works to your expectation.

Good morning!
BuildRoute Version 3.2.3.10 is ready for testing.  
I will try to help if you have any questions, but you will be better off calling Nikolay (713-345-7265) with any questions about this.  Please see Bill's email for all the details I know.
Thanks so much for your help.  Sorry I am not more so.

QA's:

	BuildRoute has been modified to allow the exclusion of DART deals.  Since they are waiting on it, it is difficult to test and Nik has done quite a bit of testing anyway, we promoted it to Stage.  Please contact Fran Chang about testing.  If it goes OK and she wants to, we can put it in as a production break fix.

Regards,
