Cara,
Did the error take place again, or did it just happen the one time.  If it
just happened the 1 time, everything is ok, the server that you were on just
restarted that piece of code.  If it is continually happening, please let me
know right away.  From the logs that I was able to look at, everything
looked fine so I think the server just restarted that piece of code.  Please
let me know if it keeps happening.
Thank you,
Mary Tollefson
