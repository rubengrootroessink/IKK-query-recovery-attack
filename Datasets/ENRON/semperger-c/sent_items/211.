I would like to get together with the people who have management responsibilities today.  I have no news, but I'd just like to get together with you guys to get your read on how people on the floor are doing.  I'd like to get your thoughts on what we as a management team should be doing to keep our team focused / informed / productive / happy ....

Let's meet at 2 PM in Mt. St. Helens.  Let me know asap if you won't be able to make it.
