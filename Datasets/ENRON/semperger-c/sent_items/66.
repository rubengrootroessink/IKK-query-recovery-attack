Hi My Love,

I have told Sylvia and Cheri about you, and how important you are to me. Phase 1 is complete!  I am leaving in a few minutes for Bandon, and will drive sooooo carefully that it will become the stuff of legend.

I miss you already, it's going to be a long lonely weekend without you!  But I will see you on Sunday, and you are a DEAD MAN! ;)

I love you,

Cara

P.S. Don't cheat on your cards................................ :)
