Hi Dear Man,

I feel the same way that you do, I feel like you are a gift that the universe has given to me. You are such a rare and special man. I love being with you and having fun with you, I love your tenderness and your competitiveness and your sense of humor.  What did I ever do to deserve you!

If we aren't too tired tonight, let's go poke around a store or something. Maybe linens and things to look for kitchen stuff??  We are going to have such fun together.

I love you,

CF
