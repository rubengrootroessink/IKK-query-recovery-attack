I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846
