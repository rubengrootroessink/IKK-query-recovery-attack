I miss you and am wonderin how you are faring in the working world.   I have been checking in on the Riley photo site, she just gets more beautiful every day. 

Dave and I have signed papers and are final, now I am just waiting for the house to sell.  I have already found another place to live, and have an offer on it based on the sale of my house.

I love you and hope to hear from you soon.
