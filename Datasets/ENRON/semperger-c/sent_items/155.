Hi Sweetie,
 
I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
 
We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!
 
I love you, and Pat and Riley
 
Cara
