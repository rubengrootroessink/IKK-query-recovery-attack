Please copy me on anything that you need to speak to the developers on.  DART changes to the build route need to be done in the PreSchedule Workspace version of build route, as that is what we are using now, we have been phasing out the old build route.

Noted about the changes need to go thru you.  For now I only forwarded the request for adding a check box for option to exclude DART products.  From what you wrote, seems like we need the report to be able to show DART deals only, so real time can see it.  So basically we have two requests:  one to enable us to exclude/include DART deals and one to enable us to run DART deals only (while excluding all other deals that are going to be scheduled day ahead?)

* when IT gets back to me on the addition of the check box I will let you know so you can play around to see if that's how you want it to work.

Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day. Any change to it must go thru me.

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.

Just so you know I have submitted a request to Bill Crook's group (Bill Crook took over Will Smith's old responsibilities).  I will keep you and Sean posted when IT made progress on this.  I am curious what this Build Route report is and how schedulers use it, generally speaking.  Also, I understand that you would like to see the DART products excluded (by a check box) in this report.  While they won't show up in this report in the future, where should the deal info show up in stead in order for Real Time scheduling to pick it up?  Do we need real time position manager modified accordingly as well?

Maybe next time when you run the Build Route report I can go over and watch a bit, if you don't mind.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Fran

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,
