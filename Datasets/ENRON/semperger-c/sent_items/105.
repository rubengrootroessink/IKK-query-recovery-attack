Thanks Frank,

Hey did that intermittent blank drop down field bug in the physical path area get fixed?

I tried doing a tag a few days ago and still got that error.


Have a good day,

OATI has recently completed the effort to contact each customer by phone to provide access to the Etag 1.7 Tagging Simulator.  If you would like to have an opportunity to use this system and do not already have access, please inquire within your company to determine whom we've contacted, and they should be able to provide you with a user account, password, and the web location of the Etag 1.7 Simulator.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact OATI by email at ideas@oatiinc.com or call us at 763-553-2725.

There are still a few openings left in the Etag 1.7 Training workshops scheduled prior to the March 6 rollout date.  Please visit the OATI Corporate Home Page for Workshop details, by clicking the "OATI" logo in your tagging toolbar.
