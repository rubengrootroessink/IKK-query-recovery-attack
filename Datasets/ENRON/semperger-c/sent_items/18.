Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)
