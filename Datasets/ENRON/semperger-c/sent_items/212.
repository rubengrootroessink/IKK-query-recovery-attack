The PSEs in the Physical Path are not populated until the PSEs in the Market
Path are selected.  As promised in training, the PSE's in the Physical Path
will always be a short list derived from the Market Path, saving the person
who is entering the tag from wading through all unnecessary PSE codes, since
no PSE should ever show up in Physical Path who was not part of the
financial chain.

Good Afternoon,

I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop
down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been
populated.

I logged off and onto the system several times today to see if that
would help. It didn't.
