Thanks for that laugh! I needed it.

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.

My new Company is called  "Cara-land".  I am working on the national anthem now.

Cara,

Stella and I have been communicating via email and have determined that your vending machine was involved in this somehow.  It all started with Pollard, your predecessor.  Any comments, Ms. Semperger? (we're waiting for your confession)
