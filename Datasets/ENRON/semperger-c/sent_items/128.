Dear Little Sister,

Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.

I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.

I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.

I love you,

Cara
