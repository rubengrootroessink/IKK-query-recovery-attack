Hi Again,

Just let me know about Lord of the Rings, when I am done here I am going home to take a nap if we aren't going.

If Saturday or Sunday would be a better lazy day than Christmas eve, then we can do whatever. You are the only thing on my calendar after tonight, sir.


Call me at work, I would love to hear your voice.


:)
