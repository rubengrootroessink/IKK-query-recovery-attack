Hi,

How are you? Are you keeping busy or taking some days to decompress?  A few of us are going out to sushi tonight,  Me, Laura W, Stacy, Perry, maybe Jesse, and a few others.  We would love to have you join us.  We are thinking Koji's on 6th and broadway around 7 ish.  Please join us if you would like.
