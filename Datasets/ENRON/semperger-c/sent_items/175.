Hi Cara,

I hope things are going well for you today and that you had an enjoyable
Thanksgiving.

I just wanted to follow up with you regarding your order.  I know you wanted
the basket with the lightbulb, but I wanted to know if there was anything in
particular that you wanted added or deleted from the basket.

Also, I am needing to know when you would like me to deliver these.  You can
email me addresses and the message for the cards.

Thank you for your order.
I hope you have wonderful Holidays.
Renee
