Hi Mom,

I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  

Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.

Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  

I love you,

Cara
