Hi Mom,

I am so glad that Nathan seems to be responding, his well being and future are what is most important. I don't know what to say to the behavior of Beth not taking responsibility for the financial end, and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren.  I have so little respect for her for treating people this way. If I didn't think she would punish you somehow, I would tell her so.

I am looking forward to seeing you next week!  woohoo!

Luv,

Cara
