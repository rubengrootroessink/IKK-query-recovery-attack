I spoke with Serena and told her how to roll scheduling forward.

Let me know if that doesn't do it.

Cara,

I need to talk to you about Jan, it looks like nothing has been auto scheduled.  Serena is going to start doing the California deals.  It looks like from the 1/2 on nothing is in actuals.

Thanks
