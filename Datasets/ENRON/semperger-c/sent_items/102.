Hi,

I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. 
You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you. 

I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking, keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans?


Bye my special one,

Kitten
