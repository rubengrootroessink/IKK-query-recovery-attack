Hi There,

What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.

I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.

I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.
