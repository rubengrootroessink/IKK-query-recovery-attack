I have definatly missed you.  I have missed everyone.  I like my new job but Sean was right, it is very slow paced here.  I find myself fighting for things to do some of the time.  I live on my own, I really dig my new pad.  It's definatly different living by myself.  Please tell everyone I said hello and if they want my address or phone number you are welcome to pass it on.
