Auntie Cara,
 
How are you?  I am doing fine, I guess.  I think I am passing through the shock stage and may be entering the exceptance stage.  I am still so dazed from this whole thing.  I am supposed to go back to work on the 5th and may not be going back at all.  This whole thing is so heartbreaking.  
 
I am attaching my resume just so you have it, if you think of anyone who should see it from you contacts please pass it on.
 
Take care and I will keep you posted.
 
Susan
