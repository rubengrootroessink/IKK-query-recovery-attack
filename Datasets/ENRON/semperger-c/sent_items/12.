I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.

They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.

My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com

or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,

Can you please provide the latest contract terms we have with OATI for the West.  I would think that we too could reduce our # of users and Tags being printed every month.

Thanks for your assistance - MO

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you. [May, Tom]  	 
Thank you,
