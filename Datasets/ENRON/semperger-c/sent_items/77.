Hi Dearie,

How are you?  I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!  I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.

Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.

If you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.

I miss you,

Cara Poo
