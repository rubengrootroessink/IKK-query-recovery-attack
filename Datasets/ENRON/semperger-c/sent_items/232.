I found the following problems when using the preschedule workspace.

When I ran the error check for my sheet on the 17th, there were no errors to report.  I proceeded to run the confirmation  and route deals and noticed that on some of the rows my supply mws were not equal to my market mws.  This discrepancy should have been caught by the error check function.   The system allowed me to run my confirm anyway.  

Thanks,
Stacy
