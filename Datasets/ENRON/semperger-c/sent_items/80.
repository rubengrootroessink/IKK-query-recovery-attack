I was tickled to get such a cool card! Where did you find it?  I am thinking about taking the front off and putting it in a little frame.


I have decided to postpone the catchup Christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when I move into my NEW beautiful Condo that is right on a wetland/woods!  I go to sign papers today.

Thanks again,  

Luv Luv
