WSCC ESWG - 

Here's what we have been waiting for.  Its the sector voting registration
site.  You'll need a browser with 128 bit encryption to get in (guess I'll
have to go home to do that).

So go tell everyone you know who qualifies for one of the these sectors to
register.

John Canavan from Montana Power has put forth his name to be considered for
the ESC Vice Chair officer position.

Remember, in order to vote for the officers at the Denver/April ESC meeting
you need to be there and be registered.
