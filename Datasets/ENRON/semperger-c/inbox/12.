Hello Cara,
 
Hope this finds you well.  I received your e-mail message.  Are you interesting in purchasing a home in this area or another area?  What price range are you looking at?
Have you been preapproved for a loan?  Are you currently working with a real estate agent?  are there a minimum number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
 
let me know, I would be happy to assist you in your search.
 
Take care,
 
Aimee Davis
