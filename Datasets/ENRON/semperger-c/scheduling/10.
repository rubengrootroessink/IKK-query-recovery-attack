Will,
I ran another quick test this morning (spanning 0730 to 1015 due to other events) for June 22.  The paths routed correctly and information went to the Confirmation area properly.  

Even though I had "East Power" checked in the confirmation area, all of the "West" paths also showed up too.
The only error message I got involved not being able to route transmission deals.

I will do a more extensive study this afternoon.
