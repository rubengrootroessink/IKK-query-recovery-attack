Cara,

Do you have a couple of specific deal numbers we can research?

Thanks,
Will

I have looked at deal Scheduling, and have tried to pull up data for a range of dates,  no data will show.

Can you tell me a date range in Test P that has scheduling populated?  I was trying to work days that correspond to days that I am testing the PreSchedule workspace on. No luck

Those Dates are June 16-22.  I also tried looking at various days in July

Thanks,

Cara

Deal Scheduling has been moved to stage and is available for testing.
