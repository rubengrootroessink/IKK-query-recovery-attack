It would be good if you would also provide us a list of who exactly those customers are

In California

Out of California

Schedulers,

There have been a few instances where it seems that there is some confusion as to who is responsible for what on the Services Desk.  So, I just wanted to make everyone aware of the break-down of responsibilities on the Services Desk.  Myself and Chris Foster schedule all the California generators, Les schedules for all other generators outside of California.  

There is one exception, I schedule for Valley Electric, who is outside of California.  If Les is absent one day, I will step in and schedule all his generators outside of California.

I hope this helps clear things up.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Stan
