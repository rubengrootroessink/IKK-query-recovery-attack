First I hope that I have everyone's correct E-mail. I guess time will tell on that.

Second I want to thank all of you for participating in the SO Training Workshop in Phoenix. Your input to date will help NERC define its role in training, and we hope improve on the training that is currently available to system operators, schedulers, marketers, and planners.

As promised attached are the flip chart notes from the workshop for you to look at and hopeful you will add more comments. I know that some attendees refrained from speaking out so here is your chance. Also I have included the complied results of the questionnaire that you filled out in class. I included this so you can see what others felt of the workshop and of the effort that NERC is undertaking in regards to the future of training. Maybe these notes will stimulate further thoughts and ideas. These are unedited versions.

I intentionally did not want to present some formal recommendation or program at this workshop because NERC (not just me) felt that it was important to get your opinions before drafting any program. This workshop will become the basis of what NERC will be doing in the future. Training is important, that was oblivious from some of our discussions. Through your input I can start to draft an outline of what NERC's role will be, what training is needed, and who needs the training. I can see now that there are varying levels of training that will be required. Some wish simple overviews, others want details and structure. 

What is the next step? Each of you should review these documents and make comments, add other ideas that maybe you did not think of at the workshop. Talk about this with your fellow coworkers, seek their opinions and then send those comments back to me. I will then add any additional comments I receive to the flip chart document and try to define some of those thoughts and return them to each of you. After that I will start to draft a plan and/or program that will be posted for public comments. After public comments are received and reviewed, a second draft will be written and posted. This final draft may require approval (From the OC or BOT) before NERC rolls out any program.

Timeline:

First draft of SO workshop notes        sent            10/10/01

Comments on notes due to NERC by                10/31/01 ? This is your deadline to return any comments to me.

Second draft of SO workshop notes sent          11/16/01

First draft of NERC Training Program/Role       11/23/01

White paper on role and training program posted 12/07/01

Public Comments due     (45 days from posting)  01/21/02

Final draft of action plan for NERC             02/08/02

OC or BOT Approval of action plan (open)                (Unknown - depends on who will approve and when their meeting is held)

Again thanks for your help and participation. Remember with your help we can improve the quality and timeliness of training for everyone.
