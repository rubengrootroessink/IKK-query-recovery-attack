Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

 thanks
