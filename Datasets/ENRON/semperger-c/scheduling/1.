Subject:	PSW Day 2

Good Afternoon,

Here is my Laundry list for today:

My saved sheet does not save all of my criteria selections in build route.  When I re-open, I have to select the day of week mask filtering and report changes again.  It is defaulted to checked in the new sheet, but erases upon saving and reopening.
Fixed - Saved sheet will save all the selection criteria.

I also do not see where to find the changes to existing deals that I want to see reported.  How do I get to those?  In the original build route, it was a second tab in the excel sheet.  
You can see deal changes in Log tab, next to Route Data tab.

Routing does not show an OK on rows with the sched term of "BOM", but it does route them.
The workspace error log gave the following error on these rows of "No Supply Data available for Term Routing.  Just have BOM equal Day in the logic of routing.


The workspace error log does not pop to the front of all active applications, nor does it have a space on the tool bar.  I thought the sheet was frozen again, and started minimizing applications until it suddenly popped up. Just clicking on the PSW does not bring the workspace error log to the front.



One problem with many other problems imbedded in it.

The Global ID column needs to be able to hold up to 30 characters, I had numerous rows with the notation "IDACCISO0010 and SRP_WESC101P_CISO" . 
Increased the Column Size to 50 in Stage, Will do the same changes in Production as soon as Production Freez ends.
 
This gave me an error "General SQL error. ORA_01401: inserted value too large for column, but error check did not say anything. When I changed the cells and re-saved, I got the same message again, as if the rows are permanently embedded with these values.   I had to delete the rows and re-paste them in from the sheet to get them to work.  This would have been problematic had I not had my working sheet in Excel.

The rows that had this notation were not sent to Path Confirmation, but were changed from X to R in the PSW.
These are routed but, path is not confirmed. 


Please call me if these explanations do not make sense, I will be happy to explain myself further.

Thanks,
