Cara,

I can't get into Lotus Notes. However, looking at the scheduling file we quit entering Services schedules in the Lotus notes files early Jan. 2001 when the CALPX went away and we started doing unit contingent deals instead of Firm.

All deals are entered under the Services book and all went physical.

I'll be out next week on vacation.

Les
