Subject:	Enpower Login problems

I was able to login to the main platform of Enpower under csemper, but not able to run psw or deal entry.  However, I was able to login as drobins and run things.

Please do what you can to get my login fixed today if possible. I will use Donald's login as a workaround.

Thanks,

Cara
