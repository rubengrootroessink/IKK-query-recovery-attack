How's you day so far Princess? 
I've been busy straitening things up around here. I can't finish my machine yet because I don't have some parts that I need. I feel so much better today since I didn't have to get up at O dark thirty. I loved waking up today. :-) fun fun fun.

I love you and I hope you are having a good day. 
Don't do to much heavy lifting at home Ok. I don't want you to hurt yourself. 

I love you baby. 
See you tonight.
