Cara,
I was out Friday, but totally agree on segregation of East and West Confirmations.  Also, I agree that there needs to be a method to delete confirmation records (either for mistakes on date, path changes requiring it, etc).  I didn't get any records to go to the confirmation table on Thursday, so I'll look at the information on the transmission cells uploaded today.

I don't think repeating some of the errors we find is too big of a problem.

CB

Good Afternoon Everyone


PreSchedule Workspace:

I started uploading schedules last evening from the PSW to the Path Confirm Dbase.  The COB sheet took 1 hour and 12 minutes to run 40 lines, still around 2 minutes per line.  This is an improvement, still slow for usefulness in production.

I experimented with putting the transmission in the E column, to see if it will represent in the path or if it will blow up the app. The result of that was that it ran the lines and totally ignored anything extra in the E cell. 



Path Confirmation:

We will need to automatically make sure that only East users see East Schedules and West users see West Schedules.  I cannot comprehend the nightmare of problems we will run into if we are not completely segregated.

If I run lines into the wrong date, or for some other reason need to delete entire records, how do I do that? I assure you this will happen.

*Something seems to have changed in the transmission cell uploading, Any information I put in the first set of Transmission cells is ignored. (Trans1 Name, Trans1 deal, Trans 1 oasis).


That's all I am going to do for now,  we can pick things up again on Monday.  Do you think it would be good to do a quick rundown of what has been identified and what has been corrected ? I am worried that my testing might have to be repeated on some of the same items due to the volume of e-mails.

Thanks,

Cara
