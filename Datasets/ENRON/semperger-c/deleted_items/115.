Hi Sweetie. 

I hope you slept well last night. I love you. 
things are pretty slow for me right now because I am waiting for my machine to finish it's thermal soak. I'm going to do some of my review stuff I think. What is on the planner for you today? I hope you plan on taking it easy.

Thank you so much for caring about me. It is so amazing to experience the love that you give me every single day. I know that I will never get tired of it. I plan on loving you for the rest of my life. I just want you to be the happiest woman in the world. :-)

I love you so much Cara. 

I hope you have a good day. I'll see you when I get home. 

Love.
