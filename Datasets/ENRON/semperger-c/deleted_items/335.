Cara,
I've sure enjoyed getting you emails to will regarding the Workspace/Confirmation programs... most of your comments have been right on.  I keep having small anxiety attacks when I realize all of the tweaking we'll have for a while.

Onward through the fog.

Aquila - agree
Dukeenetra - DETM
Morgan - agree
Edison - agree
Avista - agree
The rest we don't have any contracts with as far as I know.

I'll have everyone back next week and re-do some of my testing on the workspace.

CB

Hi Corry,

Since the new sheets are going to be a little more fussy, and the alias thing harder to fix or maintain, I would like to get the enpower short codes changed to things that are more workable and make sense.

See how these grab you:


AQUILACORP -- AQUILA (The canadian ones can stay long for differentiation)

DUKEENENTRA- DUKE (But is there another Duke that is just Duke already?)

MSCAPGP - MORGAN

EDISONMISIM - EDISON

IDACORPENE - IDACORP

PINNACLEWE - PINNACLE

AVISTAENE - AVISTA


I have a few west specific ones, but wanted to check with you for these.

Lemmie know.
