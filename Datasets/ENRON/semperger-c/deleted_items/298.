Cara,

	Understood, and your plan sounds fine.. any chance of you copying that production sheet onto your local machine and using it as your own 'test' copy then?
	The plan for having the reports merged with AggSchedVol data, talking with the team and Poston for info gathering, is a month after full initial release of our current phase.

thanks

What I meant was I would run one day and put test data in the production sheet (since there is not a test sheet of that), and then go get rid of that day when it looks like it calculated right.

I know so little about that sheet, I am a typical user and just know what I want.  How long after the initial release into production do you all think It will be until we get the project cleared to have this data merged with the AggSchedVol Data? That is the ultimate goal.  Poston has his FSP data that will be part of this too.

Cara,

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.
regards

Hi Asem;


O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls
This is the right address.  I am reluctant to add data to the production model, as it will mess up my reports.  I might rename a test file with a strange date, and then purge it.

That should work, eh?


Thanks,

C

Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself. 

thanks

Good Afternoon,

I tried to run the Physical and Bookout summary, and got this error

"Unable to locate M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\Stage\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTest.xls"
