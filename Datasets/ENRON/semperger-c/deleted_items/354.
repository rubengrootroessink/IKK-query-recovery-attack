Cara,

Sorry it took so long to get back with you.  All of the routes should be cleared out for the 18th.  Let me know if I have missed something.

Regards,
Will

I agree with Corry's requirements, it is one of the most important defenses we have against human error.  We can always refer back to the build route report.

Can you unroute June 18th in TestP Sched so I can test routing again?  I don't want to do the same day over and over again, so we can compare. 

Thanks,

C

Cara,

I fixed the locking problem on the Build Route sheet.  Corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  This is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  

Corry,

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

With kind regards,
Will
