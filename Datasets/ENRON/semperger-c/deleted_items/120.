Thanks John.

That reminds me there was a list of action items from our last meeting.
I've attempted to list here.  Any comments, additions, or corrections, let
me know:

*	split list of 31 business practices into market design dependent and
independent - done
*	participate in ESC conference calls - pending

*	distribute latest version of John Hormozi's white paper - "what
makes WSCC so different" - done
*	attempt a correlation of the differences to business practices
(small group) - pending

*	promote registration into the ESC sector voting through out the WSCC
- week of Jan 28th expected ESC sector registration begins
*	confirm meeting for election of ESC officers - done, election at
April meeting in Dallas
*	encourage nomination of WSCC members for ESC office positions - one
volunteer so far

*	Steve McCoy to contact SEGWIG and/or SEASIC (excuse my spelling)
regarding the 31 business practices (ideally the RTOs could review the
practices and cite problem areas) - pending
*	Others
