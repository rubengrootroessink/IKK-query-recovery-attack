Susan,

Please make sure both directories showing below are the same

HOUSTON ESTATE PRODUCTION
\\enehou\houston\appinst\enpower\enpower\Prod

PORTLAND ESTATE PRODUCTION
\\ectpdx-fs1\appinst\enpower\enpower\Prod


Check if Cara has the latest power.ini ( should be under c:\winnt\power.ini )

Check if c:\enpower\pdeal.exe is current
Check if c:\enpower\PreSchedWS.exe

Let me know !

Regards,
dluu

Subject:	Enpower Login problems

I was able to login to the main platform of Enpower under csemper, but not able to run psw or deal entry.  However, I was able to login as drobins and run things.

Please do what you can to get my login fixed today if possible. I will use Donald's login as a workaround.

Thanks,

Cara
