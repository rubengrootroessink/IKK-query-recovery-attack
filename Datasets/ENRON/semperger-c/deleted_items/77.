Cara;
You owe ME a conversation!  I can't stand missing a gossip session!
Congrats on your offer and acceptance!  How exciting, and you earned.  You have always beed a good, heads-down, committed employee.
I got a sniglet of the personal life, but not enough.  Fill me in, please.  Are you separated?  If so, I hope that you are doing well getting through it all.
Well, I'll await your responses, and look forward to working with you in the future!
