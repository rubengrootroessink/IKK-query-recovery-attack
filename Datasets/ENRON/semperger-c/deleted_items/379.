1 week = 40 hours of work on this project.  Duong Luu ensures me that I will not have to deal with various distractions.
I expect that you will be able to play with the Workspace in test before Path Confirmation.  However, they will both need to be release to production at the same time.

I will keep you updated on the progress of this project.  If it looks like there are too many distractions and I will be unable to complete it in the designated time, I will let you know as early as posible.

Regards,
Will

I have a question-- The 3 weeks, and 2 weeks designation.  Is that 3 weeks of 8 hour days of your attention, or 3 calendar weeks if we are your only priority, or something different?

When I see 3 weeks, I look at my calendar and think that I will be testing something by April 26

I just want to manage my expectations.

Cara,

This is what I sent to Duong Luu regarding what needs to be done to complete "Phase 1" of this project.  Feel free to add more detail if you desire.

Prescheduling Workspace	Will Smith	(3 Weeks)
?	Replace Auto-Route Worksheet.
?	Create routes in EnPower.
?	Create "Path Confirmation" data.
?	Export MW information (for Aggregated Schedule Volumes?).
?	Maintain local/network copy of workspace data in case EnPower is inaccessible.
?	Provide auto save option.
?	Allow access to application even if EnPower is unavailable.
?	Include "Build Route" technology with auto-run feature.
?	Allow copy from and paste to Excel.

Path Confirmation			Will Smith	(2 Weeks)
?	Replace Lotus Notes database.
?	Provide screen to maintain extended counterparty information.
?	Allow flexible grouping of path information (by Date, CP, Border, etc)
?	Allow cutting MW, automatically updating routes.

Cheers,
Will

If you would like my input in working up the specs, the scope of the project, or the phases, let me know..... I know how Tim likes to see information, and that will help you and me.
