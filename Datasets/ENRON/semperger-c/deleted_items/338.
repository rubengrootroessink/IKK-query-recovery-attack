Cara, 

I cleared the schedules for MidC and COB on June, 20.  I haven't had a chance to thorough look through your list yet.  I will do that now.

Will, since I am testing all of the points in the west, I need all of the routes cleared out from the following points:

Mid Columbia
Palo Verde
COB N/S
Mead 230
Midway
Craig
Four Corners-345
West Wing


I am sorry if I was not clear about this in earlier e-mails
