Will,

Here new fixed list  to Path Confirmation, I moved the new version to P:\PowerSys\Stage


?	Fixed - Annuity still will not accept a number with a decimal. says "Is not a valid integer value".
?	Fixed - Resupply deal thinks its empty when it isn't.  Should also be re-labled Resupply or ReMarket.
?	Fixed - Transmission deal should be able to be empty. Does not tolerate that now. I have to put a zero in
?	Provided an option to Delete the path cuts created
?	Path Cuts show Deal Peer ID + Deal Leg ID 
?	Path text in view fits in more lines
?	Prompts for Default Trading Desk and displays records depending on the selection
?	Now Transmission Deal Number can be Empty  in Path Cut Dialog
?	Now Resupply Deal#  caption depending on the Path Confirmation Type


Thanks,
Vish
