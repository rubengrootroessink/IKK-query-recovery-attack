Cara,

Each alias must have a separate entry.

Subject:	Table Edit Aliases Question

When I was running my path confirmation (still running it, 3rd try), one of my paths was not imported because instead of the name PINNACLEWE, I had PINW in the path.

I had created an alias in the Table edit, but listed 2 aliases, comma delimited.  Is it possible that each separate alias is going to have to have a separate entry?
