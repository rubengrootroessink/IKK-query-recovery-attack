FYI

I inquired with Houston volume management re: SP and NP because the estate would like to terminate with these counterparties if they fail to pay.  This note indicates they are current but the December invoice has yet to issue.

Alan, both CP's paid on time for November activity (12-20-01).  December activity is currently being checkout with the customer and will be invoices when the checkout is complete.  The payment terms are Net 10, or 20th of the month.  As stated below I will confirm with Cara in Portland that we are delivering the power for January 2002.
If you have any other questions please let me know.
Thanks,
Thresa Allen

please forward this to a coordinator, have them reserach nov contract - if it was paid
Dec contract - if we have checked out - if it is a net payable/ rec
and let me know their remittance terms (net 10, 20th of month - whatever)		
ask them to forward what they find to Thresa and myself

Thresa - 
Are we delivering power to these folks in Jan? Is that a question for the West VM? It sounds like it - but I am a little surprised.

I am going into meetings the rest of the day - thresa - if they get some information, could you review it and try to start preparing an answer to this inquiry??

Any help you can throw my way is appreciated.
Thanks
EV

Kim,

Are you the person who can tell me if Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power Co. are timely paying their bills with respect to term power being sold to them by EPMI/OldCo?  I need to know for a complaint these parties filed at the FERC in which they are asking for relief from the terms of the deal.

I would be interested in knowing when power delivered in January '02 will become due and if they paid on that date.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes
