Good Morning Cara,

The changes you requested for the Buildroute report have been migrated to stage.  You can either test it in either of the test environments (pwrtestn or pwrtestp) or you can have Mike Tully create a temporary short-cut for you so you can run the report against production data.

Thanks,  Poston

David, I did not know if you wanted to look at this first, before Cara got it, but Build Route ver. 3.0.1.7 is in Stage and is ready for user testing.

Thanks,

	I will assign Nikolay to get the exact specifications from you and Cara.  We'll evaluate it and add it to the list.  Please give me an idea of the urgency of this request.  Thanks.

Good Afternoon Bill,

Please disregard the previous email.  I accidently hit send.  Can you please add this to the log of enhancements.  Cara Sempberger wants to add DOW functionality to the Build Route Report.  I think this functionality is available if you run the report in some modes but not in others.

Thanks,  Poston
