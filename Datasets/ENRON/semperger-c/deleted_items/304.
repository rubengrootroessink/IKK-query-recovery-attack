Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself. 

thanks
Asem

Good Afternoon,

I tried to run the Physical and Bookout summary, and got this error

"Unable to locate M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\Stage\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTest.xls"
