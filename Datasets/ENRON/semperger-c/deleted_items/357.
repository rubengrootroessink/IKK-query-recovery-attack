The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

I cannot get RT position manager to run in TestP,  which will show me the total of MWH that are unrouted.

I get this error message when I try.
