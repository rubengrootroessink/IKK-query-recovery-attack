I made a new sheet for the 18th of june, only 7 lines long.  routing took only  a few seconds. I changed all the counterparty names to match the Enpower extract

I don't have an accurate time, but the confirm seemed to take about 10-15 minutes to run., all ran and have an OK now in the J and N columns.

I am still unable to verify that anything is actually housed in confirmation.
