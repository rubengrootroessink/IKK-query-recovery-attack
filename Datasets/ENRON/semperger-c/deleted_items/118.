John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an "independent issue" and BP 4 is identified as
a "dependent Issues", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would think
both of these should be "dependent",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or financial)?


Thanks John,


John Canavan
