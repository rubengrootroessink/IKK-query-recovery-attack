Cara,

I had Tantra (our DBA) refresh testp.  All necessary data as of yesterday should be available.  Also, you should be able to run the application in any Terminal Server environment.

I verified that I could pull up a mass of deals for Palo Verde and June 22.  Let me know if you are still having trouble pulling up deals for Palo.

Regards,
Will
