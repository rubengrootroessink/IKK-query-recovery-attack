All --

In anticipation of the UBSWE migration, Tom May has requested that Estate accounts be set up for you, so that you may continue to work on the Estate contracts, even after you've been migrated (actual migration date TBD at this point). Please take time this afternoon to log in with the IDs and password given below (it will force you to change your password after the first login). Once logged in, please test your applications, etc. to ensure that you'll be able to work in the Estate environment. We don't anticipate any issue, as these are replicas of your current Enron accounts. Please contact me immediately should you have an issue.

Finally -- please send a note to Tom May and me after you've tested, and we'll consider your email a "sign off" that you are able to work in the Estate environment.

Please note that these accounts will be disabled on Day 1 (also TBD) of UBSWE.

thank you in advance for your assistance
