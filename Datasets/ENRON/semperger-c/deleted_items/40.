Tom & Mike,

To make this easier,  I spoke with Dave Steiner, (Local Portland IT infrastructure) today and told him that their should be 3 ID's established,  One for trading, one for Scheduling and one for Real Time  these ID would be able to access the estate and would not be user specific but would be role specific. This way anyone on the UBS team could use them and each person does not need their own ID.  

If you wish to change this please make sure that Dave Steiner is notified.

Thanks - MO
