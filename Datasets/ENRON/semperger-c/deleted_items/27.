Hi There, 

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you, 

CF
