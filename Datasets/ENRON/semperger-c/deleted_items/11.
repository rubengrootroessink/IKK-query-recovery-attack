How are you doing this morning? How did everything work out with the house and everybody looking at it? 
Work is pretty boring today. I am trying to make a flow chart for the very first time. I'm using Visio to create the chart so it will take me some extra time because I don't know what I'm doing. 

I am so tired. I think it's because I haven't had any sugar in two days. Hopefully I will start to get used to this soon. I know it is going to be well worth the effort in the long run. I love you so much. Thank you for helping me get healthy. You are a wonderful person and I am so lucky to have you in my life. :)

I love you baby. 
I miss you and I can't wait to see you tonight. 

I Love You. 

Craig. 

P.S. 
Did I mention that I LOVE YOU?? :)
