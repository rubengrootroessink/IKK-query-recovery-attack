Cara,

There have been a few delays, simply because I have not been able to dedicate my time toward this project.  In fact, Duong Luu's wife just gave birth to their second baby a week ago, so I have been filling in on a number of Duong's tasks.

However, to give you an update of where I am (as reported to Steve Nat)

Pre-Schedule Workspace 
Retrieve Unrouted Data  (90% complete)
Create Routes in EnPower (80%)
Create Path Confirmation Records (75%)
Aggregate Data Export (0%)
Path Confirmation
Main View Screen  (70%)
Edit Path Screen  (70%)
Cut Volumes Screen  (0%)
Table Edit
Add Counterparty Extension editor (0%)
Add Counterparty Aliases editor (0%)
Data Transfer from Notes To EnPower
This needs to be coordinated with the Notes team.  A tool (temporary) will need to be constructed to move the data from Lotus Notes to EnPower's Oracle database.



Welcome back,
Will

Hi Will,

I just wanted to let you know that I am back from vacation and ready to begin testing whatever you need for the Scheduling System
