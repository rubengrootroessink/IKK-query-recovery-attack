Cara,

I am pretty deep in the code right now.  Corry has helped me with a few questions that I had.  I hope to have something to test by the end of next week.  I am primarily focusing on the routing part of the project.  It is by far the most complicated part.  

I will give you another update at the end of next week.

Regards,
Will

Hi Will,

I was just wanting to see how you were progressing on our project, I am going on from May 7-18 and would like to get an update before I take off.

Thanks,

C
