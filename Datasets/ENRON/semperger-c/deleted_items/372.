Cara & Corry

I am happy to annouce that we have completed the two new applications which will help scheduling group
with routing and path confirmation. Currently, it is in user STAGE for you to look at ( NOT FOR TESTING ) since
there are few minor issues that need to be resolved with terminal server folks and developers.

New applications are Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation which are available under
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Pre-Schedule Workspace
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Path Confirmation

Note that new application will not work under terminal server since it requires a special MS office file
to be installed on TS.

Thanks to all enpower developers for their continued hard work, especially Will Smith's significant contribution
to this project

I am glad to discuss with both you offline for any issues / comments / concerns

Regards,
dluu
