A new Path Confirm has been release that should fix your problem of not being able to see your path records.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Test Results for June 23rd 

Good Afternoon

I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd.  Here are my findings:

PreSchedule Workspace:

I was forced to choose East or West:  good.

The error-check feature found the following problems:
	Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names
	Missing Sched term 
	Missing Border 1 
	Missing Sched Hour 
	Missing Supply or Market Price
	Missing Supply or Market  Cont. Term
	Missing Time Zone
	Missing Supply  or Market MW


Error Check did not see the following errors:
	Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers
	Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation

During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet.  When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying "List index out of bounds (2)". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message "List index out of bounds (3)". 

The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation.

Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.


Path Confirmation:

Not forced to choose East or West on this:

Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed.  I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

Please let me know what you find, here is the sheet that I ran.
