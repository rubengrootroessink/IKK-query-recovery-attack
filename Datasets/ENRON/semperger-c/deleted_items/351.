Corry, Cara,

There is a new version of Table Edit in Stage, ver. 1.0.0.33, which Counterparty Extensions and Aliases have been added to it.  Bill informed me that you two were the best candidates to look at this for user testing.  Please let me know how it looks, and if you have any questions.  Be sure to verify the version number.

Thanks,

Brett Pate

QA:

	Let's move this to Stage and then contact Melissa regarding the Legal Entity Rule tab (she's best to test that.)  Corry and Cara can test the Couterparty Extensions & Aliases - just let them know that this is critical to Preschedule Workspace.

Regards,
Bill x53492
