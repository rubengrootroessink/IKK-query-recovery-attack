I will create a new data set, my test date will be June 23.

Please delete routing records for that date from my usual points.

Thanks

Subject:	Pre-Schedule WS and Path Confirmation

Corry, Cara,

There are new versions have been released to stage.

What's new and what's fixed:

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Now able to select a Trading Region/Desk (EAST or WEST) to separate path confirm records.
Confirm record creation should be significantly faster.  Let me know if the speed is still unacceptable.
Issues with Aliases should be fixed.  (This covers your problem, Corry).
Now able to Check for confirm errors without saving to confirm report.

Path Confirmation
?	Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records
?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.


Regards,
Will
