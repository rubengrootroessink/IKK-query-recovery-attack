Cara, Corry,

I am trying to get data refreshed to pwrtestp from production, but there will be some delay due to some other testing against testp.  Until then the "useful" data will remain 6/24/2001 and earlier.  Cara, we are still investigating the issue with data not showing up in scheduling.  Are you not able to test Pre-Schedule if that issue is not resolved?

Keep in mind we are trying to get this version out to production as soon as possible so we can move forward on the Executive Summary report.

Let me know if there is anything you need from us.

Thanks,
Will
