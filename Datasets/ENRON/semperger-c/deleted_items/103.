Good morning my sweet sweet girl. 

I love you so much. I hope you slept really well last night. I think I may have to cave in and go see the doctor about my little problem. While I'm there I will inquire about the sleep disorder stuff as well. :-( "Why are you putting that glove on Doc" EEEWWW!!!

Really looking forward to that let me tell ya. 
I hope you have a relaxing day today baby. Don't strain yourself today ok, you need to heal still and I don't like that you are not taking care of yourself. I worry that you will hurt yourself. I love you so much and I don't like seeing you in pain. Maybe tonight we can go see Black Hawk Down if you want. Or we can just sit around like lumps tonight. 

I love you so much. It doesn't matter to me what we do as long as we are together, that's all I care about. You are such a wonderful person. I can't believe that it is me that gets to be with you. I got the best prize of all...

YOU!! 

I love you sweetie. 
I'll see you when I get home.
