I have not used table edit in over 2 years, I really don't think I am a candidate to test it.  I have told someone this already when asked a couple of weeks ago.  I also am very involved in testing the Preschedule workspace and Path confirmation, and don't want anything to get in the way of that.

Corry, Cara,

There is a new version of Table Edit in Stage, ver. 1.0.0.33, which Counterparty Extensions and Aliases have been added to it.  Bill informed me that you two were the best candidates to look at this for user testing.  Please let me know how it looks, and if you have any questions.  Be sure to verify the version number.

Thanks,

QA:

	Let's move this to Stage and then contact Melissa regarding the Legal Entity Rule tab (she's best to test that.)  Corry and Cara can test the Couterparty Extensions & Aliases - just let them know that this is critical to Preschedule Workspace.

Regards,
