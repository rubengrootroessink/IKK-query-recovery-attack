Hi Cara.  How's it going? I left you a message the other day.  Just wanted to see if you are doing ok and/or needed anything... 

Emily loves that teddy bear you bought her.  Every morning I put it in her crib with her when she first wakes up and it's her best friend.  She gives the bear the biggest smile.  :)  She's growing fast.  4 1/2 months now.  She rolls onto her stomach all the time and is eating cereal with a spoon.   

Let me know how things are going. I'll talk to you soon.
