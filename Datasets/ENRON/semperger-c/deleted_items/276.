As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all=
 systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identif=
ied the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to=
 identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This wo=
uld include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close=
 of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some =
data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specif=
ic or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise
