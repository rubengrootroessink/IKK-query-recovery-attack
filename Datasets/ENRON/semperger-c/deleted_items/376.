Corry,

Who is the "owner" of the path?  My understanding is that the path only needs to be confirmed once, but which counterparty is the path confirmed with; the supply or market?

e.g.

Supply				Market
DUKE		-E-		ENTERGYPOW

Confirm with Duke?
Confirm with Entergy?

Thanks,
Will

P.S.
I will send a revised table structure sometime today for your review.
