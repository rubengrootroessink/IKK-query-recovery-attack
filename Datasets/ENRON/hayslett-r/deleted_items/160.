Using  100% debt at 6% interest per Rod Hayslett, I come up with a factor of roughly 3% of the cost estimate for AFUDC.  I used a couple of  different cash flow S-curve algorithms developed from prior similar projects and both yielded roughly the same result.

	No cash flow of any description has been done at this point in the estimate. Please feel free to cobble.( Current direct 	cost before AFUDC, Contingency, Escalation, and Overheads is $88.6MM)

I'm now back.  Do you happen to have a ballpark cash flow schedule I can use to come up with an AFUDC figure?

If not I'll cobble one up from some of my Phases IV thru VI stuff.

Can you give us the overhead rate and AFUDC rate for the Trans Pecos (Transwestern) estimate? 176 miles of 24" in west Texas, with one compressor station of 13,000HP.
