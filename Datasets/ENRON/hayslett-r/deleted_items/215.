FYI - from our brief "across the table discussion", I just wanted to be sure you understood that I am just offering up my help as having the right person in the job also serves my self interest, if in your new organization, I am to retain my current position.  I will not be upset if my offer is turned down.   cvb

If it would help to have move time to interview and find the right person for the EGS CIO position, I would be willing to run the organization as Steve tries to leave for his new position.  I do not have an interest in the position but know I am capable of handling the job on a temporary basis if it would help.   I do not want us to rush just to fill the position if you and Stan do not have a strong feeling for any of the current candidates.  I think we need a strong person to carry us forward and deal with Networks.   cvb
