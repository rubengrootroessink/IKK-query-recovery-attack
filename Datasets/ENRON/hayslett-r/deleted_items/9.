Jim, we need to get this cleared up in light of what has happened in recent weeks.  The remaining dollars are the last of the allocation for the share of the PGAS projects committed to by HPL and paid for by ETS.  HPL/AEP has been running in a PGAS stand alone production mode since October.  I do not want to do an invoice but would like to do an intercompany charge.  There already was a work order set up to accept the PGAS charges  - C.007054.  It seems to me that it would easier to have all the charges in one place to get reimbursement from AEP than to have them spread out all over.  The sale of HPL did not negate the obligation HPL/ENA had to ETS for the cost of this project.  Even when the sale was being contemplated in Dec 2000, Jan 2001 timeframe ENA told ETS to continue on with the project for HPL.

I talked to Karen about this (and she has evidently talked to you) - I told Caroline to send you an invoice and support for the additional charges.

thanks
Lisa

Lisa, it is my understanding that you are now in charge of "old" HPL projects per Karen Gruesen.  Project C.007054 is the old J50127 PGAS Software  Measurement project set up in 2000 to accept the allocation of PGAS charges for HPL's share of the project.  The PGAS project is an ETS/HPL project to replace the MIPS measurement system.  PGAS went into projection for both ETS and HPL/AEP June of this year.  This project has been allocated all but the final allocation of $194,000.  The previous allocations where charged to C.007054.03.09 through May of this year.  This WBS is not accepting charges so I assume that it is locked.  Please unlock it so that we can make the final allocation of HPL's share and close out ETS's PGAS project.  Please call Judy Lin (37193) when unlocked so she can make the entry and notify you when it is complete so that you may relock the WBS element.  Thank you for your help.
