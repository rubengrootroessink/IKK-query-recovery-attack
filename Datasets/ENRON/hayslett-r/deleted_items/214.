Attached is testimony that we were asked to submit to Rod Paige, Sec. of Education. I never heard anything from Steve Kean or his people as to whether he had any objections to this.  Please let me know what you think.

Also, Lou and I spoke today about the Dec. event at the Kayenta Boys & Girls club.  He thought this might be a good thing for Stan to attend.  I will try to firm up details.

Cheers.
