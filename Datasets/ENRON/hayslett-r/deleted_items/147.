Rod,

Thank you the information.  I have quickly reviewed it and I believe we can determine the contracted capacity for Red Rock using this information, but what is the total Red Rock capacity (to determine %)?

Also, have you had any luck finding the other information we discussed?  Jayshree and I are trying to get a sense of timing.  

I will be in the office for a couple of hours, but I will then be working from home.  I do not have a Blackberry, so would  you please call me if you send additional information?

Thank you,
Sarah
