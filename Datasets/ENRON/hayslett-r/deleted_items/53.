In Stan's staff meeting this morning he asked we let you know of any vacancies that are being filled.  I have two that are currently in process: 
Director, Financial Planning -recruiting internally and externally on a concurrent basis due primarily to Omaha location,  preference given to internal candidates.
Financial Planning Analyst (Ben Humann's vacancy) - recruiting internally only.

For either of these positions I think Enron should be willing to pay relocation if necessary (to avoid severance costs).  From the standpoint of the partnerships I don't think NBP should pay this cost since there are plenty of local candidates from which to choose.
