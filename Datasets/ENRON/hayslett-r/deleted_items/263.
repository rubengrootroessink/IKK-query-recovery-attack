1. E-Business: Will Web services launch a B2B revolution?
2. Movers & Shakers: Buckley takes over IT at Vanguard
3. Career Counselor: Mark Polansky offers career advice
4. From the Archives: The high price of age discrimination
5. Ask the Author: Roger Schank on e-learning

1. E-Business: Yes, there's a lot of hype about Web services.
And it's worth paying attention. Not because this new software
architecture really will transform your business overnight -
we all know better - but because if it lives up to its billing,
it could create a stronger value proposition for B2B e-commerce.

2. Movers & Shakers: Taking over after his former colleague,
Robert DiStefano, died of a heart attack is not the
way Tim Buckley wanted to become head of IT at The Vanguard
Group. But Buckley is determined to build on - and add his own
stamp to - DiStefano's legacy.

3. Career Counselor: Looking for executive IT career advice? Our
resident expert will answer your questions about senior level
career advancement, change, education, strategy, and more.

4. From the Archives: Whether it's illegal, unethical or simply
bad business, too many IT veterans are getting left behind in a
labor market that needs all the talent it can get. Read all about
the high price of age discrimination in this feature from the
May 15, 2001 issue of CIO.

5. Ask the Author: Quality e-learning programs are different
from traditional ways of learning, and e-learning is more
complicated than posting manuals and other classroom materials on
the Web. Roger C. Schank, author of "Designing World Class
E-Learning," is on-call until November 30 to answer your
questions about e-learning.
