I am sending all the files in four seperate e:mails because they are so large.  The one attached is the 3rd CE file.  The other three (again, they are attached to separate e:mails) are all differently updated copies of the 2002 Plan Forecast file.  I will put in each e:mail which is the most recent and which is the least recent.
