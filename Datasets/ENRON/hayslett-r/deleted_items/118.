You need to begin thinking about what we could do here if we were asked to reduce staffing to save money?

These phone moves are for positions we asked for approval for last week.

Thanks,

LeShawn Edwards, currently a contractor in Elaine Concklin's accounting group, has accepted a position with Barney Brasher to fill the position vacated by Vera Jones, and Elaine has hired another contractor to backfill the position LeShawn is leaving.

I need your approval to switch the telephones:

LeShawn's phone from 3AC3321 to her new location at 3AC3336
Vera Jones' old phone from 3AC3336 to 3AC3321 & reassign to new contractor

If you approve, please forward to Rod Hayslett for his approval as well.

Thank you.

Ruthann
