Rod,
 
After reviewing the information you sent on Wednesday afternoon I am not certain I can break out the Red Rock revenues.  The RedRockExpansion bids appear to total 113,000 which exceeds the 107,000 capacity you mentioned.  I assume that the 106,700 in the pitchbook is correct.  Please let me know if this is not right.
 
Also, the finalTWrev spreadsheet is the information you included in the pitchbook, correct?  If I sum the four tabs does that constitute all of the exisitng capacity?  Is there any expansion capacity (Red Rock, Gallup) included?  
 
Please let me know if I am not correctly interpreting the data.  Jayshree and I are meeting at 9am tomorrow if you would like to discuss.  We will also be on the call at 10am.
 
Thanks,
Sarah
