Just realized that Saunders had not sent this along to you.  I'll call about it on Monday when I'm back.
 
I haven't had the nerve to look at the stock price this AM.  At least the Chronicle article allowed that the world was not necessarily ending for Enron.
 
Have a Happy Thanksgiving if possible!!!

Can you give us the overhead rate and AFUDC rate for the Trans Pecos (Transwestern) estimate? 176 miles of 24" in west Texas, with one compressor station of 13,000HP.
