As stated in the note the JV will pick up these expenses.  Our impact is the percentage ownership we have in the JV.  Do you see any issue with proceeding?

Bruce,
 
David Walton, CFO of the Accroven Joint Venture in Venezuela, is asking for Jonathan to come down and finish some work that has been in progress for a while now.  They have already spent quite a bit of money on hardware and need to get everything setup. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and was scheduled for last week.  I had Jonathan cancel this trip due to the travel freeze.  Both the airfare and Jonathan's Hotel will be direct billed to the JV.  The remainder of Jonathan's expenses should be under $500.  Can you please get this travel approved. 
 
Thanks,
Jason

Jason,
 
As you are aware, we have been working for a while with Jonathan Perret on a project for installing new Exchange servers in all our 3 plants (Jose, San Joaqu?n and Santa B?rbara). At the same time,  we decided to install a Web Sense server in Caracas in order for us to manage the Internet access connection and an Intranet Web Server in Puerto La Cruz for Accroven Home Page. We have also modified and stabilized all our links so to improve the bandwidth used for our applications and for soon to be "Voice over IP" for the communication with all ours plants. All the hardware necessary to perform these actions were purchased (and received) by Accroven, all the software, purchased and received by Enron to be back-charge to Accroven.
 
Now, to complete this project, the following tasks must be perform with Jonathan assistance:
01) Build SACAR-APWS01 (Web Sense server in Caracas)
02) Build SASJ-MSMBX01P (Exchange server for San Joaqu?n)
03) Build SAJOS-MSMBX01P (Exchange server for Jose)
04) Build SASB-MSMBX01P (Exchange server for Santa B?rbara)
05) Migrate Jose users from SAPLC-MSMBX01P to SAJOS-MSMBX01P
06) Build SAPLC-WWGEN01P (Intranet Web server for Puerto La Cruz)
 
The estimation time to conclude these tasks is 1 week and we understand that you will charge us all the cost for this assistance and reimbursable expenses. 
 
I would appreciate your approval for Jonathan to to travel. 
 
Best regards,
 
David
