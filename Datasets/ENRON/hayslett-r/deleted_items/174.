Dan:

My Wed morning is completely open for this meeting - I have also line up Drew Fossum and Dorothy McCoppin to participate as well.  They have already gone through and identified a number of things that will require further clean up.  Do you want to go ahead and set up a time and place for Wed am?

Chris Lyons called me this morning to discuss status of mortgage filings - I can't imagine he is getting nervous!

Thanks for the earlier note.
