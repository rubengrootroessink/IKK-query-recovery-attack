Just in case we miss one another this afternoon (I will be leaving for B&P's
office at 2:30), just a few comments -

ENE:
Second line, "particular" misspelled
Need period at end of first paragraph
Liquidity section - since we are closing today and funding tomorrow, we should
say, "has executed" (your call)

NNG:
4th paragraph - "increase peak day deliverability for transportation services"

TW:
2nd paragraph - We paid off the $16 million last week as part of our $550
million credit facility.
3rd paragraph - this actually sounds worse than what it is - 70% of capacity is
subscribed for until 10/31/05, but sentence implies a lot of turnback risk
during next couple of years.  Big SoCal gas contract comes due in 10/31/05 which
represents about 30% of total capacity.
Liquidity section - "no" versus minimal.
Key credit strengths, second bullet - "regional" misspelled.

Do you include any financial info?

my cell phone is (713) 582-6282 if you need to reach me.
