Rod,

I am working on formatting the information you provided.  I have a couple of questions- first, using the margin numbers in the 2001 CE I get a lower number than we calculated for contracted volumes in the spreadsheet you created yesterday.  I also want to ask you some questions regarding the segregation of existing, Gallup, and Red Rock.   Do you have any time tomorrow to sit down and walk through the numbers?

Thanks
Sarah
