Since Elaine and I are planning to be at the AA Symposium tomorrow, we are 
providing you our laundry list of year end IBIT items for discussion at your 
meeting tomorrow.  

FYI, if we have more items than you need in total, the items I would prefer 
to pull back first would be the Mobil payment, the DOT safety user fees, and 
the capitalization of specialized overheads.








Please let us know how you wish to proceed.
