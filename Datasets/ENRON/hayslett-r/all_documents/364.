Rod,

The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of 
the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can 
be most directly involved with the last one:

9).  E-Commerce Strategy

 We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and 
proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more 
development and implmentation of is the use of :

 "Payment on Receipts"  this eliminates the further processing of vendor 
invoices related to approved purchase orders.

 SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA 
agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the 
requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.

 Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into 
their Purchasing System and reverse create a "Purchase Order" into our SAP 
System.

 An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron 
world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from "Cradle to Grave" - 
Requisition to Payment".

 Our implementation of an "Integrated Supplier" is allowing us test ground 
for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.

Morris
