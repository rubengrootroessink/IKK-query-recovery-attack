Rod,

Following my voice-mail to you, here is an e-mail from Dan Stockrahm of ANR 
(its got his e-mail address) advising his outside counsel, Rhonda Chandler, 
that he thinks any intervention by us would be counter-productive.  I'm sorry 
I don't have Stockrahm's telephone number or office address.

Britt
