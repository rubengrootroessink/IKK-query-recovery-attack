Rod,
         Who is watching over this in your shop?  I'd like to make sure 
Finance is in the loop.

Dan -

Attached from Trailblazer is a Resolution for execution which approves 
various aspects of the proposed expansion.  The issues and the 
recommendations are those which I have reviewed  and agree with.  They are 
also the exact same as the information I sent previously to you for review.  
There is nothing new.  Are you OK with me executing these??????

Also, I am working on another financing option with Kinder-Morgan  which 
would basically increase Trailblazer's debt structure (partly in preparation 
of the next rate case in 2003) which would result in increased cash 
distribution to the partnersa in 2001.  This cas could then be used to fund 
our cash call  for the equity financing(30%) of the expansion.  There would 
be a timing difference - we would get increased cash distributions in 2001, 
and then have to make our cash call in 2002 for appr. the same amount.  I 
will develop this in more detail later this week.

Let me know of any concerns.
