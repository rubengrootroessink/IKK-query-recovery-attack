Jeff is in 3AC1458.  I told him we would come over there.  But who else would 
you like to invite from GPG?  The same group that was at the reporting 
meeting yesterday?  If so, we can have Jeff come over here.  Would you like 
to try to include Wanda Labaume at this meeting?  We have not heard from 
either Jeff or Wanda.
