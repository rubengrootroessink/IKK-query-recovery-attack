These will not work for GPG as they are all above thresholds in agreements 
with 3rd parties and we desire to operate with a greater level of control 
than these proposed levels allow.    See my recommendations below.

Subject: Cash Controls & Approval Authorizations

Bob, Wes, John & Rod -

Rick has asked that we develop Minimum Cash Control Standards.  These have 
been completed and we'll be meeting with each of you within the next 2 weeks 
to discuss.  A critical part of these Standards are "Authorization 
Guidelines" for approving transactions and payment execution.  These 
guidelines already exist for transactions flowing through the approval 
mechanisms within  Purchasing, Commodity, RAC, etc. systems.  However, we 
don't have minimum guidelines for g&a and other expenses.  Here's a proposal:
        Budgeted   Unbudgeted
Director    $50,000 - $1,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, except 
emergency
        or $250,000    
Vice President   $1,000,000 - $2,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, 
except emergency
        or $500,000    
Managing Director  $2,000,000 - $5,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, 
except emergency
        or $1,000,000    
Executive Vice President $5,000,000 & Above  Same as MD

CEO (i.e. Stan Horton)     All over $1,000,000  All    
Each business unit CAO to designate approval authorizations below $50,000
Each Individual has the ability to further delegate the authority that has 
been delegated to them, but must do so in writing and be approved by the 
responsible supervisor
.
Just wanted to run this proposal by each of you and get your thoughts.  
Please respond with your comments so we can incorporate these into the 
Standards.

Thanks.

Terrie
