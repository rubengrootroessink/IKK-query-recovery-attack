Mark Russ will be representing Michael Ratner at the PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.  
I am looking into the pre-ranking meeting that is supposedly going on now.  
However, the Associate Analyst program indicated that this was a pre-ranking 
for Associates within EBS.  Please provide your feedback to Mark before the 
PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.

Rod,  

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your 
evaluation to Mark for the final Corporate ranking.

Thanks.
