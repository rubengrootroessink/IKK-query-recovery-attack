Subject: Help?

James,

I enjoyed being with you during our most recent trip and meeting with SoCAl 
Gas in Los Angeles.  After getting to know you (at least briefly) I was 
wondering if you could give me a little help.  My son-in-law is a young CPA 
who now works for Reliant Energy in Shreveport.  We have been circulating his 
resume a little around Enron and have gotten little interest.  Do you know 
anyone in the finanace end of the business (accounting, etc.) in which you 
could pass his resume along.  I would really appreciate any help you could 
give me.  Thanks, John Shafer
