Attached is a draft of  2001 Objectives.  I have not yet had the opportunity 
to sit down with Dave Neubauer and his direct reports and probably won't 
until after the holidays.  I will update the objectives at that time.

 I have not included some of the standard objectives (e.g. "prepare current 
estimate") but have tried to keep the statements  at a higher level.

Let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss.
