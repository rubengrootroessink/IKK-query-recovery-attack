Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.
