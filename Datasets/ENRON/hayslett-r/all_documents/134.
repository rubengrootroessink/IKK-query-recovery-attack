Subject: SAP Financials Data Warehouse Update 07/18/2000


Below is an update on the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse Project.  Information 
has been divided into five areas: Infrastructure, Software, Rapid Mart 
Configuration, 'People' involved with project, and Training.  

Each area has a status color associated with it indicating how the project is 
done in terms of schedule.  RED represents trouble areas we are addressing, 
YELLOW represents potential slippage we are addressing and Green is for items 
"in good shape".  I am preparing an MS Project file and will publish it later 
this week to illustrate timelines in a graphical format.


I. INFRASTRUCTURE ACQUISITION and PREPARATION: RED

ACTA Application Server (UNIX):  Configured and being tested. 
ACTA Database Server (UNIX):  Received 7/7/2000.  O/S being added, internal 
drives on order (due 7/19), adding of Oracle DB Software will follow.  Target 
date to start Acta install and configuration is 7/26/2000.  
UNIX Database Storage: On order, due 8/9, estimated ready date 8/17.  Sense 
Corp. agrees that we can install and configure ACTA using internal drives 
until Storage arrives.  Not as critical to delivery date since initial Rapid 
Mart configuration can proceed using extra internal storage drives added to 
DB server (item 2 above).  Storage to be ready for install mid-August.
BRIO Broadcast Report and On-Demand Query Application Server (UNIX):  Ordered 
from SUN vendor 7/11/2000. 
Intranet WEB Server (UNIX):  Ordered from SUN vendor 7/11/2000.
Connectivity:  System Requirements forwarded to all technical contacts 
(7/18).  Meeting Thursday (7/20) with all technical groups and Sense Corp. 
consultant to cover ACTA System Requirements Document and ensure everyone 
understands details and can deliver on or before 7/26 target date.
The hardware mentioned in items 1 - 5 above make-up the DEV/QA environment 
for the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse.  The UNIX Infrastructure group 
recommendation is still to hold off ordering the Production environment 
machines.  Two reasons were cited:  
Wait so the performance of the DEV/QA boxes can be tested and determine if 
models originally identified for Production will be sufficient.
Wait to get feedback from customer groups on the value of the Data Warehouse 
deliverable and concept.  Frequently, Data Warehouses catch on quickly with 
the user community and they push to include much more information (in our 
case non-SAP data) into the data warehouse than originally anticipated.  


II. SOFTWARE ACQUISITION:  Green

ACTA software is purchased, in-house and paid for - installation awaits 
database server.
Confirmed that additional funds will not be needed for Oracle database 
software.  Meeting with GSS rep. Laine Borgman, Oracle rep. and NET WORKS 
contact Bob McAuliffe Monday 7/17 confirmed Enron has an enterprise license 
for the Oracle DB package.
BRIO Reporting and Querying software is in-house as free trial license 
through 7/31/00.  Tool has been selected by Enron Company business and IT 
group and is final stages of purchase process.  Target completion date is 
this Wednesday (7/19).  
Initial meeting on BRIO Training Wednesday (7/19) with Tennyson Group.  
Information and issues will be taken to initial Reporting Council meeting 
(7/27).


III. RAPID MART CONFIGURATION (Phase One of Project): YELLOW

ACTA consulting Partner, Sense Corp., is lined up to install ACTA and 
configuration of Rapid Marts.  Their paperwork for IT, HR and A/P is 
currently being completed.  
Received and reviewed Sense Corp. project plan and resource rates.  Project's 
budget can pay for Project Mgr. and two Acta Extraction Developers during 
Phases One and  Two, based on savings experienced on reporting and querying 
tool. 
Schedule is 2-3 weeks per Rapid Mart, if architecture, security and IDs are 
completely prepared prior to Sense Corp. arrival.  This makes best case 
scenario of first Rapid Mart delivery 8/9 -8/16.


IV. PEOPLE: YELLOW

Reporting Council representatives:
Requested in July 7th email to CAOs and cc: to SAP Site Managers.  
12 reps. have been named to-date.  
Kickoff meeting for all members scheduled for 7/27.  Agenda to include 
overview of council role, project objectives, obtain council member's

feedback to developers on finished product (feedback loop).
Technical contacts:  
Obtained contacts for all groups UNIX Infrastructure (Mike Barber and Gary 
Law), DBAs (Douglas Cummins), Networking (Keith Dziadek), SAP Technical - 
Database and ABAP (Tracy Terrell).

Kickoff meeting with Sense Corp. consultant to confirm pre-installation 
checklist on Thursday, July 20th.
SAP Technical Analysts/Developers:
Held meetings with Mark Schmidt and Kathy Kokas regarding SAP/COE resources.
Interviews with recommended resources this week and next.
COE / SAP resources will be charging time to project, whether they are Enron 
employees or contractors.  This was not incorporated in the initial project 
budget and may cause the project to go over budget.  (Specifics will follow 
once resources are confirmed and their rates identified).    
Reporting and Querying Tool Lead and Developers:
Requested a reporting tool lead and developers from initial project companies 
(GPG has 5-6 EDS Developers who are budgeted for SAP ABAP reports and will 
now take BRIO Training. 3-4 additional resources are being requested through 
EES IT Outsourcing Deal to IBM with no additional cost to ENRON or project.  


V. TRAINING:  Green

ACTA TRAINING:
ACTA training will be given for the first 3 days of the ACTA software 
installation.  Up to 8 Enron resources can attend.  This will be scheduled 
shortly, in conjunction with availability of on DEV/QA environment and Acta 
training consultant. Target date 7/26-28.  
Confirm 8 individuals who will support ACTA: Contacts Michael Barber (2?)  
Douglas Cummins (2?) Operations (?) SAP Technical (3?).  
BRIO REPORTING and QUERYING TOOL:
Training classes for 10 BRIO Support Contacts across Enron are included in 
BRIO contract.  Travel expenses to California training site paid by Enron 
(project).
Two additional one-week classes at Enron are included in contract to an 
initial group of "client" and "server" users.  Enron pays consultant travel 
expenses to Houston.

install, uninstall as users need them.  Which group to administrate (NET 
WORKS Global Help Desk)?
Other training can be purchased directly from BRIO or their outsource 
partner, the Tennyson Group.  Meeting with Tennyson Group on Wednesday 7/20 
for training overview, recommendations, issues, etc.  These items will then 
be brought up at the Reporting Council Kickoff Meeting Scheduled for 7/27.
