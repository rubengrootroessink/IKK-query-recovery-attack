Regarding objective #8 on the  Pipeline Group 2000 objectives,  you should 
consider the  NNG base gas sale as a major contributor in meeting and 
exceeding this objective.   I discussed this with Dan McCarty and he  
suggested I send you a note to include it in the first pass.  If you need any 
help on the amount etc, let me know.
