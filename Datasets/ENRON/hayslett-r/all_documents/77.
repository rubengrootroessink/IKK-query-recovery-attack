Before the Apollo Cut-over Team can create GPG's FAR orders the business unit 
needs to determine the make up of the FAR orders required for each cost 
center (how many and what are they).  We can identify field assets to be 
tracked by the FAR orders; however, development of the FERC IDs for the 
orders will be the responsibility of the various GPG accounting groups.
Please plan to attend a meeting to develop a strategy for the completion this 
task.  The meeting will take place, Tuesday, April 25, 9:00 a.m. - 11:30 
a.m.  The room location will be communicated prior to the meeting. If you 
know of other individuals who should attend this meeting, please feel free to 
invite them.
Accurate assignment of the FERC IDs to the FAR orders is critical.  This step 
will determine the accuracy of  GPG's O&M expense translation from SAP's 
natural accounts to the FERC accounts.  
Please call me at (713) 853-5292 if you have any questions.

We will cover the following agenda items:
Overview of FAR Order and functionality (very brief)
How are the FERC IDs used to facilitate data translation for FERC reporting
One to one relationship between FERC ID and FERC Account
Use of a variant for the FERC ID
Who in GPG will identify FERC IDs for each Cost Center's FAR Orders
Assignment of tasks, by operating group, to achieve completion on or before 
May 9th (to be included in FIT 3)
