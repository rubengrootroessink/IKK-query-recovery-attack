Subject: Stan Horton Meeting; Subject: Citizen's Project in Arizona (O&M 
Service Proposal)

A meeting concerning the above subject is schedule for 2pm with Stan Horton 
on Thursday, December 14th.  Please try to arrange your schedules to attend, 
as Stan's schedule is not flexible.  

Please confirm your attendance by email or voice mail to me by tomorrow, so I 
can provide Cindy Stark with a headcount.

Thank you so much!
