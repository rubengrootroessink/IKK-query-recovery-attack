As background data for Project Tangerine,  I've prepared a schedule (tab Greg 
Gruber Info) (per Rod's request) that is part of the file TOTAL TRADING.XLS.  
This shows the value of the administration payments to El Paso and Enron for 
2000, the supply volumes provided by each, the relative value at 11/1/00 
discounted at 6.5% and a list of contacts in Birmingham.  Additionally, the 
file titled PANNAT~1.XLS gives the details of the financial swap on the 
Amoco/Pan Nat volumes.  If you want to adjust the discount factor, simply 
change the value in cell B50 of the tab labeled Greg Gruber Info.  
Please feel free to contact me with any questions 713.853.6186 or the email 
address above.  The info included on these files can be pretty confusing.




FYI When Excel asks if you want to update the links, please say NO.  It will 
freak out the files.
