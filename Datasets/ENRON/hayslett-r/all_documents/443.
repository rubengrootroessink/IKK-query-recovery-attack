The Market Service Team has reviewed their requirements for the proposed 
relocation of ETS within the Enron building.  Under this plan, Gas Control 
would not move from their current location and the Market Service Teams would 
be in close proximity to Transactional Marketing and Facility Planning.  
Julia's intent is to have discussion with Danny to make sure the 
organizations are aligned to support the commercial teams. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.
