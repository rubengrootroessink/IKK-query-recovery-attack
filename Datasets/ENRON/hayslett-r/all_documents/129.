Website for train times from Bath Spa to Paddington is www.railtrack.com.  I 
will however collect a pocket timetable from the railway station for you 
tomorrow which will be useful for you.

Just a few points I have noticed from the programme which I have not dealt 
with:

the programme states that the chauffeur bring you straight to Grosvenor House 
to meet Colin Skellett (rather than taking you to the hotel to freshen up as 
I suggested).   I will arrange a light lunch for you and Colin.

I have received written confirmation that your room at The Royal Crescent is 
o130 per room per night - a bargain!

you asked about dress code which I have not addressed.   It is a bit of a 
mixed bag here at Bath - some suits/ties others smart/casual - I wouldn't 
worry about it.     I thought I had better let you know however that it is 
"Wrong Trousers Day" on Friday for charity.     It is a national event and 
everyone is encouraged to where something they wouldn't normally wear to work 
- especially on the bottom half.   Don't worry we won't expect you to turn up 
wearing this dress code but thought I had better warn you just in case you 
see some "strange sights" on Friday in the office.

I hope you have a pleasant flight.

Best Wishes
Linda

Thank you very much.     What is the train schedule?    I think the train 
would be an
enjoyable experience.   I would like to leave at a reasonable time after 8 
and before 12 I
would think.    If there is a website for the train schedule you might point 
me to it.
Once again thank you for your kind assistance.
Rod
