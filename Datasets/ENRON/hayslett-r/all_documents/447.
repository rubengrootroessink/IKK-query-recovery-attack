Jim, gave an excellent start.

Commercial Support group:
Develop a format to best compare the volumes, margins and applicable expenses 
of 2001 Actual and Current Estimates/Forecasts to 2001 Plan to 2000 Actual 
for use by Danny McCarty as a Commercial GOAL.

Identify potential areas to monetize contracts or assets where feasible.

Improve Citrus/FGT Cash Flow forecasting by utilizing SAP as much as possible.

FYI:  I participated in Super Saturday (12/9/00; very interesting).
