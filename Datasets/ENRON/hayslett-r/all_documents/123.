Dear Mr Hayslett

Keith Harris has passed me your note regarding a visit to Wessex Water.  I
need to ascertain a few things before I go ahead and make arrangements.
They are:

When will you be arriving (date and time)
How will you get to Bath?
Have you booked any accommodation?
How long will you be with us?
Have you booked any appointments to see Wessex Water and Azurix Services
staff?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Marilyn Smith
