Rolling 4 quarters estimate for income and cash

Less focus legal entity, more focus functional groups

Detail quarterly reviews/current estimates for O & M and functional groups

TW needs new financial modeling tool to analyze market data

Focus functional groups on ETS bottom line not just their group/company

Consistency in policies, procedures, schedules, accounting methodology, etc. 
across functions

If I think of others, I will send them.

Subject: 2001 Goals & Objectives

I would like each of you to submit, up the chain of command,  a list (not to 
exceed) 10 items (but at least 3) that you believe  need to be accomplished 
in the year 2001.     Some of these can be group goals and some may be 
personal to you and some may be personal to others in the group.      Some 
may even belong to another group.    I am looking for ideas that will improve 
our organizations, that will improve us, and that will potentially improve 
Enron.    Any and all ideas are desired, and things that relate to Stan's 
list are more than welcome.     I would like ideas by early next week as we 
are trying to get draft input/ideas into Stan before the Holidays.

Speaking of the Holidays, I would like each of you to get to Kathy your 
vacation/"out of the office" schedule over the next several weeks.     I 
would like contact phone numbers and to know who is your substitute if you 
are out and unreachable.   Kathy will publish a list after she gets every 
one's input.

Thanks.
