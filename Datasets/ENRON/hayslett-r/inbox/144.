CAn you 2 help her out here?    I believe the footnotes probably cover it, but to the extent you have more, it would be helpful.

Hello Rod,

In the audited financials, there are footnotes that explain some of the environmental liabilities.  Is this what you referred to when you asked if I had the disclosures?  If not, is this a separate document that I need to have for the "data room?"

Thank you,
Jayshree
