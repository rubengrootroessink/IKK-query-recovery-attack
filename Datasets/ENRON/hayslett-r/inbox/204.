With everything going on, I wanted to speak with you about some issues, particularly how things may effect my group.  In light of the attached memo, it does not seem that we can do anything that will cost the company more than $50mm.  What does this mean for what we are looking at?  Can Enron even participate in the Arctic project as a $1mm commitment will, not including the potential additional liabilities, commit the company for more than $50mm.  I guess you can make an argument about it depends upon how you count it.
 
Anyway, please let me know when you have some time.
 
Cheers.
