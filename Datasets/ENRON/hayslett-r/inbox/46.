Shawn:

Attached is a preliminary definition of social risk - let me know if it is not clear or needs to be further defined.  

I thought you might be interested in the attached link to the UK's Institute of Internal Auditors magazine.  There are several articles discussing social/environmental/reputation risk and role of the internal auditor.   <http://www.iia.org.uk/knowledge/magart01.html>

Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards, 

Lauren




Social Risk: the risk associated with direct and/or indirect impacts of a company's business decisions and practices, business partnerships, products and services on its stakeholders and the communities where it operates.
