Subject: EEI an economic Stimulus Package
Importance: High



As you know the House has passed their economic stimulus package.  This contains a deduction of 30% in the first year for property placed in service after September 10, 2001 and before December 31, 2004.  EEI convened a meeting late last week to see if other industries had a problem similar to theirs; i.e., that most of their property additions take a longer time to build.   They also would like to see repair and replacement of their property included as this also promotes jobs.

Enclosed is a proposed amendment by EEI along with a explanatory position paper. <<expensechanges to section 101.rtf>>   <<expensingcorrec2.DOC>> 

They want to know if other associations, such as INGAA, have a similar problem and would support such a change.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW PRIOR TO 12:30 PM ON THURSDAY IF YOU NEED THIS CHANGE.  I WILL BE ATTENDING A MEETING AT EEI.  THANKS.
