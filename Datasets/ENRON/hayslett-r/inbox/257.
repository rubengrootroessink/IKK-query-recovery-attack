Yes, it could happen that way if the Note Receivable would not be setup.  The establishment
of the Note generated the credit (reimbursement) to the project.

If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.   Isn't that about the way it could happen?
