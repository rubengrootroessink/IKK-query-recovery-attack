Rod,  I wanted to confirm with you that it is OK for us to move certain employees to co. 1202 as of Jan. 1, 2002.  I know that we cannot move all the Service Groups, but you had agreed that we could move all the E&C Employees in Jerry Martin's organization to 1202 and a number of the Ops. Support Services Employees (in Morris's organization) that support all of the pipelines and are NOT mostly dedicated to just one company.

Please confirm so we can work with HR to have these employees moved at year end.

Also, have there been any further updates from regulatory regarding a more encompassing move of employees to one service company?

Thanks,  Elaine
