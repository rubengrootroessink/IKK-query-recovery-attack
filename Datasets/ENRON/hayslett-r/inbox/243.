   I would like to quickly recap the result of yesterday's meeting.  Your five day forecast should be input into the Treasury Forecasting Intranet Website by 3PM daily. The website address is egf.enron.com.  It is imperitive that we use the website so that all of the information is compiled in one location.
   Every payment is being scrunitized by senior management. Please understand that if your disbursements are not forecasted there is a good chance they may not be paid.  
   In order to get the ball rolling, I ask that you input your five day forecast by 12 noon today. If you have any question or concerns do not hesitate to call me. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.
