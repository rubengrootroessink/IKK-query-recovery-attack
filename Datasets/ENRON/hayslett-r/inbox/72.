Steve,

I was contacted by Teobaldo Camejo Soto (Enron HR - Carribean Basin) regarding the sale of an Enron Asset, Ecco Electrica (sp?).  He indicated the sale of this asset was set to close in ~2 weeks and needed IT support to review all of the systems and software licenses involved.  

I am not sure who in IT should handle this support.  

Thanks,
-Scott.
