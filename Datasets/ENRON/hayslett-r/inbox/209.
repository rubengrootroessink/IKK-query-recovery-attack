Just wanted to see if these LC's were absolutely necessary at this time.  We just got another request today for two more LC's.  The total of all four LC's is now $11.98MM and all cash requests are now going through Bill Bradford to see which gets paid.

Is there any update on your negotiations with Standard Chartered?

Thanks,

JR

James Richardson asked me to forward to you.  We are not sure Standard Charter can do these.  We also have around 20 amendment requests from EOTT on date extensions past the 12/31/01 drop dead date.

Please advise.

Thanks,
Jessie
