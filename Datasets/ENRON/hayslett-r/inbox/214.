We have done an evaluation that showed our interest to be worth the following:

10%		12.5%		15%
$84mm		$73mm		$64mm

If you want to see the model let me know.

Cheers.

They took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.

Michael: What do you know about this one?

Can you attend this one for me?     They are working on the sale of our interest in the Trailblazer Pipeline.    Sounds like a reasonable deal to me.
