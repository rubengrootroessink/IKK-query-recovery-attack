Jim

Following our last chat provide update for you. Had good meeting with
Richard Haines at JLT and agreed strategy in relation to FM Global.
Understand Richard is getting terms to extend policy and also Wessex
stand alone quote as you requested and will report directly back to
yourself.

We will also report back to you with results of our endeavours ASAP,
before month end, to allow you to consider and discuss directly with
Wessex.

If you need any further advises please let me now other wise will
provide progress report this time next week.

Have a good weekend.
Regards
Steve
