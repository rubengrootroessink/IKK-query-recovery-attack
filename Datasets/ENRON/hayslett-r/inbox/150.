We are all confirmed on Continental Flight #410 departing IAH at 10:00 p.m. this evening (see schedule below).  Our confirmation numbers are the same as our previous tickets.  I will be sending you your individual confirmation shortly.

I have also spoken with the W hotel and we have reservations for this evening.  The hotel confirmation numbers also remain the same. 

If any of this is a problem please call me or Linda at Travel Agency in the Park 713-560-8080.

Thanks 
Sarah
