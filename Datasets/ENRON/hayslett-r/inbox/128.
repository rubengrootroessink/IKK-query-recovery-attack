We put up signs on the 31, 32, & 33 floors of 3AC announcing the meeting, so hopefully Morris' group will be there.

It is an auditorium-type room. I can't say it is big enough to bring your entire finance group, but I'm sure there will be room for some extras.

Is this a place that is big enough to handle some extras?
