DRIVING BEST-IN-CLASS PERFORMANCE WITH WORLD-CLASS PLANNING
12:00 noon, EST. Tuesday, December 4


You're invited to join Business Finance magazine and Adaytum 
for a live, one-hour webcast to examine the link between 
world-class planning and best-in-class performance. 

See how enterprise business planning can deliver near-immediate 
ROI and enable thousands of your front-line managers to 
contribute to an enterprise-wide view of performance in real 
time.

You'll also see a live demonstration of Adaytum e.Planning, the 
planning platform adopted by 10 percent of the Fortune 100 in 
the past six months. And a guest speaker from Accenture, 
Manager Mary Koch, will describe the success her Fortune 500 
organization has achieved with its e.Planning implementation.

Please join us. All you need is a telephone and access to the 
Web.
