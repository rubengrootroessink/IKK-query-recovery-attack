Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expenses?   Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

Morris, can you look at this for us.  I kinda think that the Corp Allocation is the right place for this expense.

I appreciate Kyle's expertise and work, but do we always pay the direct expenses for Corp assistance?

Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.

Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28

Many thanks.
