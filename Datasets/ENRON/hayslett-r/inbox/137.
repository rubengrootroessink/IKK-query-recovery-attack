Subject:	Pollution Liability Runoff Coverage

As requested we have amended the quote for pollution runoff coverage.   Attached is a spreadsheet reflecting the two options you wanted to consider.

  
Option 1 - For the extension of the existing coverages for the 40 month period  - AIG quoted $340,000

Option 2- (48 month new PPL run-off  policy including products)
AIG has agreed to the price of $509,000 with a deductible of $100,000 for all claims except products liability which carries a $1Million deductible.  The $509,000 will be credited with a $85,000 pro rata premium refund from the current policy for a toal owed of $424,000.

The premium difference betwen the extension of the current policy with limited coverage (Option 1) to the new expanded coverage version  (Option 2) is $84,000

It is Risk Managements recommendation that Azurix go with Option 2 for the broader coverage.
