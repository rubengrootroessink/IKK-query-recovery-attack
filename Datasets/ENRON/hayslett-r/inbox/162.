Rod,
    The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in intertest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future. Either way we will limit further funds from going out the door. 

Dan
