Rod:

I took the liberty of summarizing my 14 1/2 years of work at Enron.  Either you can use it in your discussions with Andy or I can (if we feel it becomes necessary).  I get the sense that Andy (and Ben for that matter) may have lost sight of my contributions to the company.  I thought this might help clear up a few things.  I was a little "fuzzy" pre-1992!  I would be more than happy to discuss this with you prior to a meeting with Andy.  

Thanks,

Kevin
