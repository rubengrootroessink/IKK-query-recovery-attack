John,

With all the problems we have been experiencing with SourceNet, a move in December that could restrict our year-end abilities, raises extremely high concern.  We feel at this point it would be unacceptable to entertain.

If this is out of our (Enron's) control we will begin to take action to pay ALL our invoices in DECEMBER.

John,
We need to be prepared to communicate to ETS about plans for the phased-in move to Bryan-College Station, call center and transaction processors this December and everyone else next December.

	Call center hot link
	Staff turnover and retraining
	Drain of management expertise
	Re-mailing to vendors (the first mailing created so much noise I though we would lose our jobs over it)

This will surely come up on next Friday's meeting if anyone from ETS is there.

Judy
