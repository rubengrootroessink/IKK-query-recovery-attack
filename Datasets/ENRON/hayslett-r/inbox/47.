Subject:	2002 IM Structure

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.
