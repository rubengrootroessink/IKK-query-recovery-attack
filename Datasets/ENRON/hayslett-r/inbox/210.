As discussed these individuals will transfer to EGA

Biff Brannon

Blake Walker


In addition, the following would support the transition through the period stated below:

Joe Grajewski -  	12/31/01	- Transition issues to Sommers
William Gehle -   	 1/31/01		- Currently negotiating CIGSA settlement
Amanda Camacho-	 1/31/01		- Transition A/P to Corp outsourcing group

Discussions with Jeff indicate that he does not have the excess capacity to absorb the remaining issues confronting EEOS accounting.
