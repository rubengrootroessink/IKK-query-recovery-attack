This is what I sent to Jim a few days ago from my understanding.  They were going to charge us for cancellations.  So we will have to fight the bill.

I talked with Sabrina Whaley who is the contact at Enron for this Symposium.  If you signed up prior to two weeks ago, there was a 50% discount off the $950 price.  Both Henry and Sally signed up and got the discount which I confirmed with Sabrina.  If you want to sign up now the price skyrocketed to $1,250 each!  Wow!

If they signed up and cancel now there is no refund, but someone else could go in their place so let them just go.

After Rod's staff mtg. on Friday, we followed up w Andersen on attendance discounts related to the above annual meeting (12/4 and 5).
Andersen indicated no discount...interested attendees would have to pay full amount, $1200.
