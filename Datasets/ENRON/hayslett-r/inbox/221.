We are sitting in Weil's offices, waiting to negotiate. Unfortunately we do not know what the deal is. We are waiting on the higher ups to fill us in on what we are negotiating. 

Unclear whether dyn is in and the total deal is for 750mm, or dyn is out and it is a $500mm transaction. 
We'll let you know

Mitch
