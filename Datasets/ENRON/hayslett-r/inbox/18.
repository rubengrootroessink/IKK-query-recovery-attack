Attached for your final review is PGE's Form 8-K which we plan to file with the SEC tomorrow (Wednesday, Oct 24th).   The document incorporates suggested comments received from Enron Legal and Regulatory Departments, Enron's NW Natural Sale Deal Team,  PGE's Bond Counsel (V&E),  Arthur Andersen Audit Team, and PGE's Legal, Rates and Finance Departments.  
 
Please provide me any final comments you have no later than 5:00 pm today.  Jim Piro will be getting our final version to Mark Dodson (NW Natural) to allow a quick review of our proposed filing.
 
Thanks again for all your assistance with this filing.
