Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!
