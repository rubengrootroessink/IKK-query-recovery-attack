Hi Rod

Hope things are going ok.

Just wanted to drop you a note about any job opportunities that might come up 
that  might fit me. Cindi and I have been out a long time (5 years) and we 
are looking to get back. I have a year left on my contract but if the right 
opportunity came along I would like to consider it. I thought I would start 
now eventhough I have a year left. I am definitely not going to renew my 
contract again. 

thanks

mike
