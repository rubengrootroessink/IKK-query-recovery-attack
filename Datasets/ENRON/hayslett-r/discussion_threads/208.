James,
The following contains the background information you requested.  I have al=

attached my resume for your review.


Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks for all your help,
Ken

Degree:
Bachelor=01,s in Mechanical Engineering

Education Facility Name:
McGill University, Montreal, Canada

Career Path:
 As an engineer in Enron=01,s Analyst Program, I have not been on the rotat=
ion=20
track of a typical analyst.  My technical background and experience led me =
to=20
non-traditional rotations in Facility Planning and System Optimization. =20
These rotations gave me the unique opportunity to work as an engineer in a=
=20
commercial environment.  With the Houston Pipe Line Facility Planning Team,=
 I=20
provided technical support to marketing and producer services.  In my curre=
nt=20
rotation with the ETS System Optimization Team, I apply my engineering=20
knowledge to maximize pipeline value.

 My objective is to gain more experience in the financial aspects of ETS.  =
I=20
am interested in learning how to perform project evaluations and financial=
=20
analysis so my intent is to have a greater emphasis on finance in my final=
=20
rotation.  My strength lies in technical work but I envision my knowledge o=
f=20
assets and operations to be an infusion of different intellectual capital t=
o=20
the ETS finance group.

 I always had a desire to learn about finance, having taken accounting=20
courses in high school and through my college classes in economics and=20
operations research.  At Enron, I continued to pursue this interest by=20
attending development courses in corporate finance and risk management.  I=
=20
also registered to take the GMAT so that I can keep my MBA option open.  I=
=20
want to make an informed decision on business school when I graduate from t=
he=20
Analyst Program.

 By developing my financial skills, I intend to become a more valuable Enro=
n=20
employee. I want to bring some financial focus back to the engineering grou=
p=20
so we can manage our assets more efficiently.  Combining what I learned in=
=20
previous rotations with what I could learn from the finance group will give=
=20
me a new and fresh perspective.  That is why I approached Ron Matthews and=
=20
James Centilli about a hybrid Planning/Finance position.  In our changing=
=20
business environment, I feel this will be mutually beneficial to all.
