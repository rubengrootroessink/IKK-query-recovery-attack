To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

Will we be proceeding with the Dec 5 meeting? If so, Ozlem could you get 
notice out to the original distribution list concerning time and location. I 
will be out of the office on Monday, so I would appreciate your assistance in 
coordinating the meeting logistics. Thanks.

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

If there is going to be no effort to fix my problem as a result  of the 
change in the effort, I am wondering why I should support the project at all?

Do we have any current Form 2 or other FERC related reporting 
requirements/concerns as a result of the "redirection" below?

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

Tzlem

The review by ETS of the FERC data warehouse information will be on Tuesday 
December 5th at 10:00am, location TBA. This initial review should last approx 
one hour and your input would be greatly appreciated. I will inform you of 
the location when this is established. Please feel free to contact me if you 
have any questions.
