Lou-I think you might want to meet the folks from Louisiana that are 
considering buying the Sunniland oil fields and want us to put it back into 
service.  They make a compelling case.  Their company president is in town 
for other business and he and his two top people have this slot available to 
meet.  I'll get a room and let you know the location as soon as I know.
