Rod,

I had heard from a friend of my mine that you were looking to add some 
finance positions in your group.  I am currently exploring opportunities in 
finance, and would be very interested in talking with you.  I am attaching my 
resume for your review.  

I would like to schedule some time with you, and would appreciate if you 
could let me know when it would be most convenient for you to meet, or if I 
should contact your assistant to schedule a meeting.  If you need to contact 
me immediately, please call my cell phone at 713-851-9764.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.  Thanks.

Rahul
