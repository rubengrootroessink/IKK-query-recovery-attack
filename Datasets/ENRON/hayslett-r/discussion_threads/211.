Rod, Julia wanted me to help you gain access to the Daily Market Summary.  If 
you will click on the hyperlink below and scroll down you will see a contact 
list.  The first name is Fraiser King, I would select him and request a 
password (usually your name and an easy to remember number).  I would 
bookmark the login point for fast and easy access.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thank you,
Ricki
