Thank you very much.     What is the train schedule?    I think the train 
would be an
enjoyable experience.   I would like to leave at a reasonable time after 8 
and before 12 I
would think.    If there is a website for the train schedule you might point 
me to it.
Once again thank you for your kind assistance.
Rod
