This will be an opportunity for you observe the business discussions so that 
you can more easily prepare/amend the legal docs.  If you cannot attend, then 
please pass this on to Mike as this is the only time all participants could 
come together.  I told them your name and that you'd probably be coming in 
case they want to have their atty present (they probably won't).
