Although I did not graduate from U of H, I would be happy to assist you with 
any recruiting efforts.

Gretchen, I am sure Rod will need your help with this college recruiting 
effort (even if you did not go to that @!## school, just kidding).

Subject: U of H grads

Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.
