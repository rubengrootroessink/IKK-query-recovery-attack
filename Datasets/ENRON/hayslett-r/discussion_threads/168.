Hi Geynille,
I would like to refer a particularly good student to you who is interested
in a position in Energy finance.  His name is Jonathan J. Morace and he can
be reached at (713)797-0377 or jmorace@msnn.com

He has an excellent record, with a GPA of 3.90, and has had some experience
in risk management.  I can recommend him very highly.
