Rod:

Thanks so much for taking time from your busy schedule to meet with us last
week. We are extremely excited about the possibility of exploring
partnerships between the Bauer College and Enron and feel that we can do so
to both of our benefits. As we mentioned, we currently have a number of
Centers of Excellence in Energy, Technology Management/eBusiness,
Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Professional Selling that could
flourish with investments by key business partners such as Enron. We look
forward to discussing these opportunities with you at the appropriate time.

Jerry
