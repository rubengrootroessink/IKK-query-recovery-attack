You are invited to attend a "brief" ETS PRC review meeting on Monday, 
December 11.  

One purpose of this meeting is to review the performance distribution in each 
ETS Division (i.e., percentage of employees at each performance level) to 
ensure comparability across the organization.  Human Resources will provide 
performance distribution charts to each of you for your organizations based 
on the results of your PRC meetings.

The second purpose is to review the performance ratings of the Managers and 
Directors/Sr. Directors in your organization, particularly focusing on those 
individuals being recommended for promotion.  Ratings will be reviewed for 
all, but a detailed discussion of each individual's performance is not 
intended.  

The hoped for outcome of this meeting is to reach consensus prior to, and 
minimize surprises during, the final ETS PRC meeting scheduled for December 
15.  This will allow us to focus the majority of that meeting on the 
performance of ETS' Officers.  

Meeting details:
When:  December 11
Where:  EB49C2
Time:  11:00 AM-3:00 PM (lunch will be served)
