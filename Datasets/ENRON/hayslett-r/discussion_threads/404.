Actually, I am not sure NPNG currently has a lot of expertise in this area.  
I have asked John to evaluate whether corporate should handle NBPL's 
insurance needs.  We have Jim Menning, spending about 75% of his time on 
insurance so I am hopeful that a move to corporate could reduce our costs - 
but obviously eliminating 0.75 FTEs is minor compared to the effect (plus or 
minus) of a change in direct insurance premiums or allocated insurance 
costs.  Do either of you have experience or information that would support 
either side, i.e. directly manage ETS insurance function or outsource it all 
to corporate?

Any chance at  all that we can use Northern Plains/NBPL insurance expertise 
to find a solution for ETS increases???
