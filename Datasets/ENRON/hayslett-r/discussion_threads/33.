Rod, per our discussion recently, I've drafted up some language to be 
included in ETS approval authority guidelines in the event that projects 
overrun their initially approved amounts:

Once capital projects are approved (whether included in the Plan or not), 
spending is limited to the approved level. If a project is projected to 
overrun, proper approval authority must be obtained prior to expending or 
committing to anything over the approved amount. In no case, can anything be 
spent over the approved amount without obtaining additional approval.

To determine the appropriate approval level needed, add the expected overrun 
to the originally approved amount. Then go to the appropriate section (ie 
projects not approved in the Plan or projects approved in the Plan) and 
identify the appropriate approval level for the new total. For example, if a 
capital project was approved in the Plan for $1.8MM and it is projected to 
overrun by $.2MM, the ETS President can approve the overrun. However, if the 
original amount were $1.9MM in the Plan and is expected to overrun by $.2MM, 
the ETS President cannot approve. It must go to the GPG CEO. Further, if the 
project's new total exceeds the GPG CEO authority, the decision will be made 
at that level when and how to obtain approval from Enron's Office of the 
Chairman.
