Hello Everyone,

I spoke to Mike Sullivan about a week back, and I suggested that the 
Financial Site Managers get together for lunch to catch up on what other 
business units were doing to make SAP a BIG SUCCESS.  I may have missed a few 
Financial Site Managers, so make sure you let me know if we need to add more 
people to the lunch reservation.
