Dear Rod:

You must be up to your ears in administrative paperwork.

I just wanted to touch base about our discussions.  You said that it would
be to your advantage to start some sort of analysis review this year
(budgets??), if this is still important we can still get started.  We can
start with one or more people with 48 hours notice.  We have a team on
stand by for you.  Let me know if I can do anything to help in this area.

Best regards,

J. Mark Kearns
