Attached is a Word version of the draft issues chart that Bruce Neely 
forwarded last night.  This is a document you can print and read.  We may be 
getting a more refined Word version of this chart from LeBoeuf later today.  
The Native Load Analysis should also be received today.

Beth, if you know of a safe way to transmit this on to Ron today, I would 
appreciate your doing so.
