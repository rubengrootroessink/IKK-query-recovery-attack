Hi Rod

Since I am using Yahoo as a mail server, I am not sure
you received my e-mail of yesterday with my resume
attached. If you did not, please let me know and I
will resend it.

Also, I wanted to let you know that I am in Santa Fe,
NM and the telephone number is 505-982-6636, Ext 130.

Thanks

Mike
