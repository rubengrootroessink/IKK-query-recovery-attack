Greetings!

One or more people have evaluated your performance as a boss at 
ImproveNow.com. The results have been compiled and are strictly confidential, 
for your eyes only.  You may review your results by logging on to a secure, 
password-protected area of our site at:

http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/IYBoss/BossResults/

Your login is: rhaysle@enron.com
Your password is: 84ot8g

If you have login problems, go to: 
http://www.improvenow.com/faqs/index.cfm?action=results_faqs

We trust that your employees chose to participate in this process in a spirit 
of constructive criticism, and we are committed to supporting the possibility 
of positive change in your organization. Accordingly, you will find that your 
results link to a customized list of resources we've recommended to improve 
your performance in key areas.

And if you believe that simply letting your people know that you're listening 
to them, that you care about their opinions, and that you intend to change 
things for the better can have a profound effect on morale, we recommend you 
initiate a "top-down" assessment.  It takes only a minute and can be done at:

organization in general, please check out:

This is a complimentary service of ImproveNow.com.

Thank you.
