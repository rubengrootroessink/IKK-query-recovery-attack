Rod . . . 

I do still have my file from the two meetings in which I participated with 
you to discuss the Omaha office.  I'll have someone bring it to your office 
this morning and you can copy from it anything you need.

Attached are the electronic copies of our flip charts from those meetings.  
Let me know if I can help further.

Regards, - Roger

Did you keep any of the studies that Mary Ann and I worked on on closing down 
the Omaha Office?    I am interested in resurrecting that study.
