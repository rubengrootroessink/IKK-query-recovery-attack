NEW LATIN POP, DANCE AND MIX MUSIC ON NETRADIO.COM

Candy Cintron, NetRadio's Latin music programmer, has been working like
one of Santa's elves on a slate of new Latin music channels. The first,
"Tropical," debuted last month (it's temporarily known simply as "Latin"
on the site). The next two went live yesterday: One is "Romance Latino" -
a
pop and dance channel featuring familiar names like Christina Aguilera,
Selena and Gloria Estefan. The other is "Latino Mix" - a "Top 40"
format featuring an eclectic mix of chart toppers like Ricky Martin and
Alejandro Sanz. Links to all three Latin channels are below.
Watch for two more to arrive in early 2001!

A NEW NETRADIO EXCLUSIVE: Q&A WITH MICHAEL MCDONALD

Driving down a Tennessee highway, solo artist and former Doobie Brothers
front man Michael McDonald dialed up NetRadio for a conversation with
staff writer Steve Marsh. In our exclusive Q&A, McDonald discussed playing
live, his move from L.A. to Nashville, his new album Blue Obsession, the
record label he co-founded with Jeff Bridges, and what it's like to return
to the stage with his fellow Doobies.

ANOTHER EXCLUSIVE: IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH RICHARD MARX

Beyond gigantic 80s hits like "Right Here Waiting" and "Hold On to the
Night," and the relatively quiet career he's had in the 90s, Richard Marx
continues to be in demand as a producer for artists ranging from Lionel
Ritchie to the latest boy bands. (And he's still so cute!) He also
continues his career as a humble adult-contemporary artist (his new album,
"Days in Avalon," was just released on his own label). NetRadio's John
Michaels sat down and talked to Marx about his time at the top of the
charts and his continuing work.

AND YET ANOTHER! IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH CHIP DAVIS

Mannheim Steamroller founder and driving force Chip Davis is among the
pioneers of neo-classical electronic music, and with his independent label
American Gramaphone, he helped give rise to the New Age music phenomenon.
His path to his current post with his Grammy-winning group Mannheim
Steamroller included many sidetracks, from teaching music and writing
advertising jingles. Davis talked to NetRadio programmer Jane Fredericksen
about his impact on the New Age landscape and Manheim Steamroller's huge
holiday success. http://www.netradio.com/features/chipdavis.html
