I'm unclear as to the appropriate accounting period; but -to me- the deal 
should revolve around the economics, and -as previously mentioned- if Kent 
and management believe prices are going to decline then a forward sale makes 
sense.

(But note that prices have continued to escalate sinse this deal was 
originally proposed)
