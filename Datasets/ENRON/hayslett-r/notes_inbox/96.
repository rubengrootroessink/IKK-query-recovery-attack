Well, if it's going to be 18 months before the upper floors become available 
to us, should we reconsider?

In an effort to evaluate the feasibility of constructing our existing space 
vs. waiting for the 30's bank, we need to know the timing on the availability 
of EB43, 44, and 45 for the ETS restack. Please respond directly to Rod 
Hayslett (copy me, please).

Thanks for your help!
