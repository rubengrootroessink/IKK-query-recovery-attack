Dear Friend,

?

We invite you to read the first newsletter issued by the C.T. BAUER COLLEGE

OF BUSINESS.? In this newsletter, we feature the once-in-a-lifetime

investment of $40 million made by Mr. Ted Bauer, Chairman and Co-Founder of

AIM Management Group, in the College that now bears his name. Please take

the time to read about the greatest event in the history of the College of

Business!

In addition to Mr. Bauer's gift, this newsletter also features information

on a unique initiative between the Bauer College of Business and AIM

Management Group and our features on key Bauer College programs, faculty,

and staff.
