I was just kidding.  The EOTT template looked familiar to me.

As Caroline pointed out,  they used the ETS IT template and made a few name 
changes from it.  Caroline has the blank ETS IT template.

Can you compare it, or better yet share the IT template?

F.Y.I.

Please see below how Jim manually voted.

Do you want a machine recount plus a manual recount of the votes so that you 
have a chance to compare the EOTT template to the ETS IT template?

seems to address all important considerations. i would vote (manually) for a 
consistent apporach across all ETS managed activities. however i think it 
will receive resistence by selected project engineers - who tend to anly take 
respeonsiblity for a single facet of a project and not the whole project; and 
may think it slow down an already slow approval process

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

What do you think about using this proposed document for approving any EOTT 
project that is outside the approved Project budget plan?


Here's my attempt at the template:
