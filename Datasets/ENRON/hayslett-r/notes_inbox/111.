Stan.  Per your request, here is the update for the first three Year 2000 
Goals and Objectives for ETS.

1.  We obtained our FERC certificate, completed construction on the Ft. Myers 
lateral, and made initial deliveries to FPL at their plant on October 1.  

2.  We have obtained a very favorable Preliminary Determination on our Phase 
V project, in spite of having significantly revised the filing on August 1 to 
include TECO in the Phase V project.  FERC staff is working on issuing our 
Environmental Impact Statement, which has been delayed due to the TECO 
filing.   We remain on target, however, for timely receipt of our certificate 
to allow construction by the second quarter of next year.

3.  Mr. Hayes and is team are continuing negotiations with prospective 
shippers for a Phase VI project.


If you have any questions, please call me.

Rock
