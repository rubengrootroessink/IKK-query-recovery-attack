Rod,
Attached below is the draft Deal Approval Sheet for the Trailblazer 
construction project.  Jerry Martin mentioned that ETS might be interested in 
including an alternative in the bid response that offered a lease option on 
the deal.
Jerry has asked me to follow up with you on this possibility.  
What additional information would be helpful in considering the lease and 
what would be the next steps?

Arnold, 
Attached is the revised DASH for Trailblazer,  

In red on the first page the statement about the finance commitments needs to 
be changed, however, you should probably provide the verbage for that because 
you know what you want to say about the cancellation and cashflow curves. 

Also, some of the names for sign off like G. Matthews (spelling?) need to be 
verified and their project function should be verified also.

After you update the file, just e-mail the 2nd revision back to me.  

We should probably consider setting up a directory on the OTS server as we go 
forward to make the sharing of files easier.
