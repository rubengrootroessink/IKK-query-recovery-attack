Could I please have an ETA on any comments to this agreement?  I will be out 
of town the first three days of next week and would like to have this done by 
Dec. 15.  Thanks.

Attached is a draft of the Corporate Services Agreement to cover the property 
tax function EOTT is moving to Enron.  Could you please forward this to the 
appropriate Human Resources and Legal people?  I am not sure who would handle 
this.  Also, if Rodney Meek's start date is something other than December 1, 
the Exhibit B-1 will need to be redone.  Thanks.  Please call if you have 
questions.  Mary Ellen Coombe is out this week, but I can contact her if 
there are questions on the HR side.
