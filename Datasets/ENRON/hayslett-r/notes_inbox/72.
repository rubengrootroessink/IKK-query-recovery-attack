The attachment overviews an agreement for ETS to provide Desktop Services, 
Application/Database monitoring, and Windows 2000 conversion for  The New 
Power Company.  If approved by The New Power Company, this agreement will 
generate approximately $300,000 in revenue with a 35% profit margin for ETS.  
This will also open the door for a number of higher dollar service offerings 
including Optical Imaging and Disaster Recovery.

Bob Martinez and Kelly Strader are our IT point people for this transaction.  
We should know by year end if our proposal is accepted.
