I would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct 
reports with about 10% of my pool reserved for my use.    Can you help me 
with this?    I also understand that we are doing a handoff from Ben to 
Shanna for my support point, therefore I am sending this to both of you.     

For Ben:    Where are we on the job description I sent
