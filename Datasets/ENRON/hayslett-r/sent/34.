I proposed that we allocate residual costs using a documented ETS "modified 
Massachusetts formula"
I think Tracy was "ok" with that approach.

Jim - Has there been any determination on spreading the SAP costs to the 
BUs?  We need to load the 2001 plan into SAP soon.

Yes.      Let's ask Jim for a recommendation as to the method of allocation.

How do you want to allocate to the BUs the SAP costs that Company 0366 
receives from Corp?
