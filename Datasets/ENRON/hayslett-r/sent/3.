Subject: Credit Rating Ratios

Rod,

Here are the credit rating ratios you requested for evaluating a potential 
deal.

In the spreadsheet I have given you two sets of figures for the year 2000 -- 
one set represents what was shown to the Board of Directors in December, the 
second set is the current set of "rating agency targets" for the year.

Please call me if you have any questions -- or need assistance formulating an 
analysis.


Greg Adams
