Hello, Bill!    This was sent out during my absence, and I see that your name 
was inadvertently omitted from the distribution.   Sorry about that!

5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;

and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.


We will discuss further at up-coming staff meetings.
