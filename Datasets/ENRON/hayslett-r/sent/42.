Before I answer this email, thought I would confirm with you how we intend 
collecting and distributing the $180K  rebate for the pre-buy program.  The 
methanol plant contributed $300K toward the $1.500K goal.

Thanks,

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you. 
Regards,
Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson
