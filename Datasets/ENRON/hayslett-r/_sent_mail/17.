I do not see why not.  I would prefer that we have shipped the computers 
before there is any announcement.  Do you have an exact date?  If your 
announcement is before we actually ship the computers, which hopefully will 
be this week, then I would just say something like NALMP has established a 
new relationship with Enron Transportation Services, the pipeline subsidiary 
of the Enron Corporation.  If your announcement is after we ship then I would 
feel more comfortable mentioning some of the details.

Let me know what you think.

Michael

 Michael-- 

??????At this time of year, I usually send out an update to NALMP supporters 
and donors about what we have been up to in the past year and what lies 
ahead. ?Do you think that I can mention this pending project with Enron?
