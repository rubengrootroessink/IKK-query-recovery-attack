Subject: E-Mail and Voicemail Retention Policy

The following change in policy to e-mail and voicemail has just come to our=
=20
attention.  This change in policy limits our exposure.  This type of exposu=
re=20
was discussed at this years management conference in San Antonio, listing=
=20
examples with Microsoft.  The largest impact of this change is your "sent=
=20
mail" retention being reduced to 30 days from the current 365 days.  You wi=
ll=20
note that if you move your sent mail to a folder it will be retained for an=
=20
entire year which should minimize this impact.  The rationale for the=20
continued longevity in folders is that if you physically move mail to a=20
folder you are making a conscious decision to keep that document.

If you have not dealt with folders please give me a call and I can assist y=
ou=20
on their creation and on moving the documents into them.  Unless I hear a=
=20
concern, this new policy will be implemented on Friday, December 15th.  Our=
=20
help desk will be sending a message to the entire team tomorrow to notify=
=20
them of this action.
