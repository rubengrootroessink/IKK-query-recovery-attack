This is a pretty high priority issue.   I discussed with Gary Smith and he wants us to do the review.    We probably should use a contractor to do this one.

Would you immediately initiate an audit of the time sheets and payroll for Mike Woolery - a shift operator at the Garner, IA location?   It appears that his payroll has been wrong since the implementation of the SAP system in July of 1999.

If this proves to be as he states, we need a complete audit of this system, especially for all shift operators and possibly all employees, especially those that are non-exempt.

I don't think this is a totally unique situation and any help you could provide is appreciated - Mike

ATTN:  Mike W.--- I am sorry that this has not been taken care of to your satisfaction to date.  I'm sure you know that we have been assured that everything was fixed, but it appears there is still quite a problem in your pay--or some kind of misunderstanding.

JIM CARLSON----  I agree with Mike Woolery in him memo below, that we need to have a knowledgable person perform an audit of Mike's entire payroll from the beginning of the SAP payroll system initiation.  Who do I talk to to get this rolling.  Once the audit is complete, we need to sit down with Mike W. and other concerned Shift Operators to review findings and proposed remedial actions to eliminate this type of thing in the future.  I know that Terriann has met with knowledgable SAP administrators and changes in the payroll process have been initiated recently that, hopefully, should address future problems of this nature.
