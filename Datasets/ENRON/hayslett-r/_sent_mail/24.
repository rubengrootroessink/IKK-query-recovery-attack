Subject: 2001 Goals

Here is a start at the 2001 goals.      It will take more specifics before it 
is done, dates and measureable objectives but it is a start.     Please feel 
free to suggest changes, additions, deletions.     In the end we will turn 
this idea list into a scorecard.    I have not meant to exclude anyone, but I 
didn't get a lot of input from everyone on the beginning of the list.    
Thanks to Jim there is a longer list, than I might have started with.
