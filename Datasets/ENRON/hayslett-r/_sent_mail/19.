Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such 
should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen 
nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC 
on that date, out of the office.

Subject: Stan Horton Meeting; Subject: Citizen's Project in Arizona (O&M 
Service Proposal)

A meeting concerning the above subject is schedule for 2pm with Stan Horton 
on Thursday, December 14th.  Please try to arrange your schedules to attend, 
as Stan's schedule is not flexible.  

Please confirm your attendance by email or voice mail to me by tomorrow, so I 
can provide Cindy Stark with a headcount.

Thank you so much!
