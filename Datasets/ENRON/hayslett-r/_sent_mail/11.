Subject: Re: Space Planning

To begin the process of thinking about what is needed to plan our space for 
the future, we need to pull together some very simple information from each 
of you.   Please provide the following to Rod Hayslett or to me as soon as 
possible:

Number of work spaces by category:
 Office
 Cubicle/work station - high walls
 Cubicle/work station - low walls

Number of additional work spaces (visitors, auditors, etc.)

Number of Conference/Team Rooms:
 Small (4-6 person)
 Medium (7-12 person)
 Large (more than 12 - please specify)

File Rooms: Specify the linear footage of file space required and/or list 
special requirements for maps, etc.

Special:  Model Office
  Computer Rooms/Cold Rooms
  Map Tables and/or walls
  Writable walls
  Video Conference Equipment/Connections
  Other

Also, please identify one person from your organization that can be used for 
coordination purposes. For instance, Rod Hayslett will assign Kathy Campos 
for his section.

Thanks for your help in this effort!
