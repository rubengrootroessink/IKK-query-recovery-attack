The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to 
adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have 
to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to 
do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.

Subject: Revenue Management Expenditures

While talking with Kim and Martha a question was asked  on capital budgeting 
for Revenue Management..  The question has to do with carrying over 
previously  approved dollars from 2000 to 2001.

The facts ($millions) :

2000 Revenue Management Budget:

$5.7 - Original RM Phase one approval
$(1.0)  In July 00, this amount was approved to spend in 2001 (in the 2001 
budget as a line item)
$4.7    Expected expenditures in 2000 for Phase one.


$(1.0) Current assessment of money not needed for Phase one deliverables 
(estimated, may still change)
$3.7     Amount  approved  with current work-orders
$  .8     Possible amount to be carried over and spent in 2001 
$2.9     Phase one amount to be spent in 2000


2001 Revenue Management Budget:

$ 1.0   Phase one approved carryover  (in 2001 budget)
$  .8  Estimated additional carryover   (not currently in 2001 budget)
$3.0 Phase two   ( in 2001 budget  in the Marketing Pool)
$ 4.8  Total to be  spent in 2000

Question:  
Since the $.8 was approved and is covered in the existing work-orders, can 
this be additive to the 2001 budget without any further approval - even 
though it is not currently a line item in the 2001 budget?  Or does the  $.8 
have to be offset against the Marketing Pool?

If this $.8 does go against the Marketing pool of $15.0 million, will the 
revenues generated from Revenue Management  reduce the revenues generated 
from the pool?  In other words If the capital dollars from the pool are 
reduced because of RM will the revenues also be reduced?
