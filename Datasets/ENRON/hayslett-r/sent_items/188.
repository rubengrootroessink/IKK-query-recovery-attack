THe enron situation has slowed down the process as we have not been able to get a clean OK from the SEC to go forward as yet.

Rod - the banks are asking what our plan is regarding the EOTT shares and the conversion.  I was wondering where you saw the process standing.  I've heard that there has been some trouble in the recap events and I didn't know if the conversion vote was tied to that or if we were planning on going ahead with it as soon as possible.  I believe the Koch deal on the subs expires at year end, but I'm not sure.  Also, Gay Mayeaux has been calling me on what's going on with Nikita and I directed her to you to discuss why ETS was selling its EOTT shares.  When you get a chance, will you let me know what the update is?  Thanks.
