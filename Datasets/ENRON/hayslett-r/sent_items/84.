And we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal, if that is deemed to be necessary.     It will be worth the paper it is written on at the moment it is written, but means nothing 1 second later, and that's the problem with these kind of things.     I guess my concern is what good will it do anyone?    I don't think it's a problem to get, however I do believe we would want to get V&E's opinion at the time we wanted it, that it was necessary/required.

Based upon our conversation, I agree that we s/not need to have any immediate disclosure over Enron's ability to perform - OK, Main Issue Done! 

However, I do feel that we should address/consider, before issuing the 10-Q, whether we need a written confirmation from Enron of their intention to meet EOTT's LC needs estimated to be in a range of $200-$400mm.

Do you think we need for Enron to acknowledge, in writing, their ability and/or intention to perform under our facility?

Looks like there may have been a little confusion here, but it appears that the deal is still working as before.

Rod, I am very concerned about the statement that Enron cannot get any added LCs' issued.  This may be a disclosue event for us.  I think we need this retracted and for Enron to affirm there ability to perform under our facility.  Your thoughts?

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc
