Need to get you 2 talking to LORI,    I don't see much of a problem in going along with the EOTT valuation.   It's their asset now.

Rod, Tom, 
Roger's question/concern is serious, and the approach I've seen in documentation
does not help our position

We are proposing (or are) to argue that Fair Value is substantially less than $41.9mm.
If that is the case, we will have to go back and impair the MTBE facility, and re-do the
financials. We have asserted that the fair value for book purposes approximates a higher value than our tac position. Normally this variance is no big deal, but because of the "sale", this book tax variation is problematic. This will result in a substantial loss, and cause EOTT's SEC filings to be in jeopardy.

Is Enron disputing the fair value of $41.9 million already disclosed as
agreed to with HCAD?  And if so what value is the company asserting?

Attached is a red line version and "clean" version of proposed EGP Fuels
responses to the EOTT SEC request.

Bob - I assume you will also review this w Mr Causey
Tom - Item # 18 on affiliated revenues requires additional data, that I
believe you have on file.
All - Item #17 on Morgan's Point tax valuation should be reviewed
closely.
