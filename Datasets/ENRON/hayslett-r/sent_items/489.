Probably.   Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar.     the margins for 2001 and 2002 are not the same and I didn't think we had 2001 in the other model in detail.    Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.   You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.    You have to remember it was an expansion, not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact.

Rod,

I am working on formatting the information you provided.  I have a couple of questions- first, using the margin numbers in the 2001 CE I get a lower number than we calculated for contracted volumes in the spreadsheet you created yesterday.  I also want to ask you some questions regarding the segregation of existing, Gallup, and Red Rock.   Do you have any time tomorrow to sit down and walk through the numbers?

Thanks
Sarah
