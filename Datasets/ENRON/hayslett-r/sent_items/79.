We got invited to Don Hawkins bi-weekly EAMR update on their projects on November 1.

Do you have any outstanding issues on EAMR third party transactions which we need to follow up?  Not that I am aware of

Are you satisfied with the information provided by Don/Sarahbeth on how they go about to provide services for third parties?    Generally yes.

Is the new $500,000 (vs. the $250,000) cash commitment for ETS RAC review policy in effect now?   Ask Cheryl
