I think you need to coordinate with Kevin Howard and Drew Fossum.   I will be out of the office tomorrow.

Rod and crew,

In speaking with Jayshree, I think Mitch and Jeff would like to divide the information into categories i.e legal information (environmental disclosures, etc.) regulatory information, financial/accounting (I think we have a lot of this and I will try to get it organized), any relevant tax information, etc.  I know this is a lot but let me know what you think, who I should coordinated with, etc.

Thanks
Sarah

I just spoke with Jayshree.   Jeff has requested that we have a data room by tomorrow night and I was wondering who I should I should contact in legal to coordinate this effort.

Let me know
