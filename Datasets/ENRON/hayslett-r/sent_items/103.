Jim, thanks for the note.  Please forward this on to Clint Walden, Rick Causey and Rod Hayslett (and anyone else you think needs this information)

I have a couple of comments on the conditions below that were discussed on the phone but were not included in the list below.  We would expect a
representation from the Board as well as outside legal counsel on point #4 below.  Also, I assume this review is a condition precedent in the debt
documents.  Enron should be aware that there may be issues that arise that do not allow us to complete our work in the timetable necessary and should
consider whether wording the loan documents relating to this cp should be modified to describe the review as something that is a condition precendent
"if it is professionally able to be completed."   Also, all of these conditions assume there are no financial obligations from the entities in
the reviews from or to Enron corp.  If so, those contractual relationships will need to be evaluted to determine if "overhang" issues combined with
the financial obligations might preclude us from completing our review.   This is a high priority item.  I would ask that the company assist us in
immediately identifying and evaluating those financial obligations, if any,  to determine if significant issues exist.  We can get started now on that.
Please call Heather Mueck and Chris Herbold.  I would like to get that identification work completed by end of business tomorrow.  Heather and
Gerrad will be leading the review work and Chris will be assisting also.

Overall debt questions.  We need to understand terms, conditions and debt documents.  Who has these? We are ready to start reviewing today.

Financial statements and review work. What periods are going to be included in the documents? The comment below says quarterly.  Which quarters?
Year-to-date? Comparison to prior years? We would expect a full set of financial statements with footnotes for all periods presented (balance
sheets, income statements and cash flows?   Who is drafting the footnote that describes the overhang issues? This is a high priority item that will
get much review and scrutiny. l would like to get the Company's signed off footnote disclosure on the "overhang" issues tomorrow.  Also, we will need
immediate access to the financials and your people to answer questions. When can we get the financials that will be included in the deal.  I assume
Enron personnel will be available to answer questions 24/7 beginning today to complete this work in the necessary timeframe?

I know these are many questions.  More to come I am sure.  But I also want to get started and focused on time consuming issues.  We will be
determining our expanded scope procedures that are referred to below.
