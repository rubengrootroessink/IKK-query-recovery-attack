Do you have a document signed by Stan authorizing the amount of dollars you need to spend?

Thanks for getting back to me on these.

Regarding the operational storage gas purchase, I did receive an e:mail back from Stan approving the November purchases.  We need to begin purchasing gas by the end of the week so please let me know what I need to do to refresh the dash that was completed a few months ago.

kent, et al, 
quick feedback from rod:
1. gas purchase - need to get approved thru stan    $'s required make it a Stan approval.    We will need a DASH to get his signature on.
2. hedge of gas purchase - no issues; need to quickly develop hedge documentation     
3. hedge of sba "spread" - we need to regroup to better clarify how the commodity component of the sba can be identified within the
sba contract, for hedge purposes
