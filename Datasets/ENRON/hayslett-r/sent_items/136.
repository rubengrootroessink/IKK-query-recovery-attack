You. That's the reason for the changes (other than the capital which changed this week.).  The risk analysis type stuff has all been sent to Brad Larsen.

The attached includes the standard economic analsyses for Phase VI. 

<<Synopsis Phase 62.xls>> 

The pertinent worksheets are: Capital, Economics on Total Capital, and Detailed Leveraged Books Grossed Up.  The last item includes the working capital impact.  For consistency with prior analyses, the total capital economics do not.  

One other twist:  Rather than use the equity AFUDC as non- cash, I recalculated the "AFUDC" using real life short term interest to come up with a more realistic estimate of the total cash requirements.

FYI, there are a couple of other worksheets in the workbook.  Among them is one for the the leveraged books on a non-grossed up basis.  I did this primarily to make sure that there were no busts, since the results must come out the same whether or not you gross up.
