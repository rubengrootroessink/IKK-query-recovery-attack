I do have a copy, although it is not all in electronic form.  I am happy to fax if you give me a number.

Rod-

This is the AA memo they discussed with us last Friday.  I have prepared a package to respond to all the points.  I plan to send it to them tomorrow morning.  I have discussed the package and its contents with Rick and Rodney.  Let me know if you have any questions.
