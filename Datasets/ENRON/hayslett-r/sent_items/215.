I was aware of Kevin Howard but didn't know he had a group that was transferring.  Talk to Rod Hayslett to get the straight scoop.

Gary:

	I was not aware of the transfer noted below.  However, there's no problem processing it unless you see an issue.  Any issues that I may not be aware of?

I understand that you have spoken with Leticia Leal in search of updated information on above group.  I have requested this information from Mr. Howard.  However, he is currently involved in the credit packages and has not had time to get this information.  I will get it from him as soon as he is available.
