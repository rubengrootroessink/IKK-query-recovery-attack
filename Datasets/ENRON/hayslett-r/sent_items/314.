FYI.  Recall that I directed Arnold to request this as a result of my conversations with Pete Weidler - he wanted to ensure we didn't get too far out in front on expenditures.  I'm going to ask Arnold to indicate that it is our normal review process, unless you guys disagree.

Arnold,

I'm in Bolivia this week, returning to Houston over the weekend and then going on to Miami for meetings with GTB's lenders, Exim and CAF.  I will bring the information you requested back with me and give it you when I get back into the office the week after Thanksgiving.  In summary, GTB is in good shape....we raised $10MM more in bridge loans than we planned and are making good progress with our Exim and CAF financing.  The lenders have completed their due diligence and we are meeting next week to finalize term sheets before the lenders go to their respective boards for credit approval.  

Just curious...is this request in accordance with your regularly scheduled review process or something more?  GTB's financial condition if anything has improved since the EPC contract was signed...wish we could say the same for Enron.

BRS
