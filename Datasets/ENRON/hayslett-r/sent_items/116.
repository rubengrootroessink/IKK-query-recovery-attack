Yes, I'll work with the 9th floor residents next week to set up fire wardens.

We have six fire wardens on 3AC 6th floor -- I'll get 2 more.

Stan's list indicated we need 3 more on 3AC 33, but we have 8. I'll e-mail names to Monica.

Ruthann, I think you have already taken care of the 3AC floors, but could you please follow up on 9th floor to see what needs to happen after EGAS moves? Also, have you already taken care of 3?

I'll take care of Enron Building. Looks like we're pretty okay except for 13.

Thanks!

During a recent review of Enron's High-rise Fire Evacuation Plan, the City of Houston Fire Department noted that several of our floors did not have the required number of trained Fire Wardens.

I need your help.  If you are a full-time Enron employee, please consider being a Fire Warden for your floor.  Newly designated Fire Wardens must complete a two-hour certification training sponsored by the Fire Marshall's Office on Thursday, Nov. 15.

Please contact Monica Rodriquez (x35393) or Harry Grubbs (x35417) to participate as an Enron Fire Warden.

Thank you for your commitment to safety in our workplace.

Stan
