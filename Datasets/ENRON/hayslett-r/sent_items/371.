Has your group been asked (by your BU or by anyone else) to identify those possible candidates for personnel reductions?  Please let me know.

Wes Colwell has been working on a "10%" list per request from his BU, and Rick is going to ask Bob Butts to start working on it tomorrow (after 10Q is filed).

If you have not been asked, you may want to start thinking about it.  Rick said that there may be a request coming to complete the list this week (and to notify people as early as next week), although he has not as yet received that request.

Thanks!
