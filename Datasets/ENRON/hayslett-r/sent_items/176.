Rod,

I had just talked with Jeff prior to sending out my email asking for volunteers.  Now we're changing the dates.  I will be out of the office Thurs and Fri so someone will have to communicate with the UH recruiting team.

Tracey,

I have contacted U of H CSC and have moved back the interview dates as we will not have enough time to review the reumes and select those we wish to interview for the 12th and 13th interview dates.  I will contact you tomorrow with more details.
