I am assuming that by now you know that I am pledging my receivables into the secured deal Dan Boyle is working on.

Rod:

Global Finance is undertaking a corporate-wide accounts receivable securitization program. We closed a commercial paper conduit receivables securitization transaction program last quarter and are looking to close a second receivables transaction (most likely a privately placed term loan facility) by mid-November.  Towards that goal, we are investigating the receivables and payables position of all Enron entities.  We would like to enlist your team's assistance in better understanding ETS's receivables and payables position and how that data is generated and processed.

To better understand our project and data request, I have attached presentations and due diligence questions from the mandated banks' proposals to Enron.  Although all requested details are not needed immediately, what is urgent at bare minimum is net receivable balance, aging and roll forward for September and October.  We are scheduled to meet with banks tomorrow to discuss opportunities.

Any and all assistance and guidance is much appreciated.  Based on our prior experience, we understand the process of gathering and processing data may be time consuming.  However, I'd like to note that the other business unit teams assembled thus far are available to share their insights, techniques, and expertise.  We will do our best to provide you any assistance you may need in fulfilling our request. 

Please call me at your convenience to discuss the best way to proceed; my telephone number is 713-853-0920.  I look forward to working with you and your team.

Sincerely,
Michelle Wenz
