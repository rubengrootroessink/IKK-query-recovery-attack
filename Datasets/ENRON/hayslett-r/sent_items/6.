Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.
