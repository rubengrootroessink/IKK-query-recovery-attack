This would be an Enron deal.    And we just have to get over the hurdles here.

The 10Q describes Rawhide - although it does not list investments, it does reference domestic and international assets.  I assume we can use the same disclosure as is shown in the Q.  When you get back, we can talk more about it.  Any time constraint on this (other than the obvious need for cash)? I hope Jerry hasn't mandated anyone just yet (especially Citi/Solly).

The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.  A 13d filing is required.  If we want to sell then we need to file and wait.
