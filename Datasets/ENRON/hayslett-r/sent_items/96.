If you want to have a "snowball" chance of getting this done this year, we need sign-off on the acctg comments.

Still want to try and get it done this year. Per Stan this am. Cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash.   If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.
