There are definitely issues here and we will have to deal with them for sure.    I will let you know when there is document to review so that we can get moving.

Rod,

After hearing the discussion on tighter restrictions and enforcement of "Market Affiliate" rules on the pipelines, should we be evaluating how we interface with GSS and SourceNet.   We openly share information on upcoming projects and strategies, at least with GSS.

Sounds like with the direction we are headed over the next several months, what division or subsidiaries are going to be left to buy materials or develop service contracts, other than ETS?   Should GSS be moved under ETS?    If so, it is way to big, just to cover our needs.

Any thoughts?
