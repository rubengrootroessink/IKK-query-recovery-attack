Yes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.
