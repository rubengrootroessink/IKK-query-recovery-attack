Drew is correct, but we can tell them where we want the money wired.

Mary Perkins of the Treasurer's office needs to know which account the money comes into if Notre Dame closes.  The way I read the new structure chart, looks to me like Rockne, Inc. buys preferred from Northern, so the $1.5 b should be paid to NNG.  Pls confirm and I'll let her know.  dF
