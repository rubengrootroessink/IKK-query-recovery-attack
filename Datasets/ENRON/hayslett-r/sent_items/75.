Looks like there may have been a little confusion here, but it appears that the deal is still working as before.

Rod, I am very concerned about the statement that Enron cannot get any added LCs' issued.  This may be a disclosue event for us.  I think we need this retracted and for Enron to affirm there ability to perform under our facility.  Your thoughts?

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc
