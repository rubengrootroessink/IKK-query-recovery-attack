Rod:

I think it may eventually be appropriate, but I would prefer not to do it r=
ight away.  My team has had a bad experience with Global Finance over the y=
ears.  They have always had an arrogant attitude and often did deals involv=
ing our assets without consulting or even involving the commercial team res=
ponsible for the asset.  Kevin is going to need to overcome this and demons=
trate that he is coming in to behave differently.  It is very important to =
me to have a centralized analytical team so that I know there is consistenc=
y, independence and thoroughness in the analytics related to the EGAS busin=
esses.  I have learned the hard way that analytical groups under the contro=
l of a commercial team sometimes produce lower quality results. I also like=
 to have a single point of contact for other parts of the Enron organizatio=
n that want or need models, valuations and analytics.  Again, historically =
I have seen disastrous results when there are multiple sources of informati=
on relating to any given project.

I do think it makes sense to describe Louie Fischer's relationship to Kevin=
 as a dotted line and then we can reevaluate over time.  I would also sugge=
st that prior to or immediately following an announcement you have Kevin go=
 meet with each manager of a significant business (namely Pete and Mariella=
) to introduce himself and describe how he is going to fit into the organiz=
ation.  I also think he needs to make that introduction interactive and do =
some listening not just talking.  He will ultimately find them more coopera=
tive and trusting if he makes an effort to assure them that he is part of t=
he team and not just a finance guy trying to get his name on a deal and ear=
n a big bonus.

I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as =
Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the cu=
rrent organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer =
in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently ar=
e similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Cor=
p on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talen=
ts and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some othe=
rs.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial=
 units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for =
themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willin=
g to carve out some priorities.
