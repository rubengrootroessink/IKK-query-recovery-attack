As part of the recent pipeline financings, Andersen will be performing "comfort" tests and preparing a review report. This may entail
"pbc" preparation in ETS Acctg.  I have been designated the ETS Acctg. "point" person, so hopefully "pbc's" will be coordinated
systematically. I do NOT know the volume of data required, but please make every effort to quickly compile, review and submit requested data.  More to follow...

Patty, I do NOT think your NBP team will be impacted.
