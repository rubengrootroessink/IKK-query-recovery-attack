Kevin and Rod,

I'm working with Corp. PR to develop q&a's for the press release that communicated Enron securing commitments for additional $1billion in financing.  

Would you both take a look a the questions and answers and fill in the missing/incorrect information?

Can I hear back from you this afternoon?  This document will have to be reviewed by legal before finalized.

Thanks for your help.

Gina
