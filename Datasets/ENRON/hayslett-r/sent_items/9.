At mid year, Rodney and Wes went through a fair amount of discussion about whether the transaction accounting folks should be specialized technical or commercial support.  Same for some tax jobs.  It was probably my mistake to not recognize that London's not sticking to the same categorization created a problem.  In the end I think Fernley saw the problem, too.  So if there is a "message", it's to Fernley to do what the rest of the Global Accounting group is doing (and that message is pretty explicit below, I think).

I don't believe that there will be any change at year end in the use of Peer Groups (Commercial, Technical, Specialized technical, Commercial Support).  Do we want to go with the same usage of these Peer Groups as we did at mid year?  The one thing I would suggest, if possible, is that London go with the same usage as the rest of the BUs.

Please let me know your opinion on this.  Thanks!
