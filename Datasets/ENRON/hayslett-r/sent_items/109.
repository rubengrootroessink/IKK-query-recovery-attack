Was there a plan here, like you guys decided to not pay, or was this just overlooked?

just as an fyi.

Every time I think we're bringing closure to IT expenses related to Azurix another item to discuss/debate turns up...

Steve, Ariba has invoices still open related to the Waterdesk Marketplace.  Do you know if there are any points of contact that can address Ariba's invoices?

Thanks

Raul,

I believe all the WaterDesk folks are gone. I would suggest getting in touch with someone within EGS group. I recall the WaterDesk folks believing they would not pay Ariba for this as their marketplace has shut down. I don't know if contractually they have this right. Maybe Mike Sullivan can help.

Sorry.
John

John, Do you know who took over the Waterdesk stuff for Azurix?  Ariba is calling to get their invoices paid.  The invoice is not in iPayit but Ariba doesn't know who to contact on it.  Any ideas?

Raul,
Need your help on this,  I have no idea if we indeed are working with Azurix invoices.  Maybe you know of a contact that we can ask or forward this issue to.  

Let me know.

Letty
