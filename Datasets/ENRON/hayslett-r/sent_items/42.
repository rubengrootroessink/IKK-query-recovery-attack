Our payment system summarizes tax liability by county for each pipeline com=
pany. It also summarizes the taxable value by county. However, this number =
includes real and personal property. We currently have the 2000 totals in o=
ur system and are putting in the 2001 numbers. We have yet to finalize 2001=
 assessments in the state of Iowa.=20
Is this what you need!!!!!!

We have done it before, in fact it was the way all of the pipes were origin=
ally built, but not for short term stuff.    Gavin Russo can probably help =
us with his property tax background.   Lou, please try to get hold of Gavin=
 or whomever he believes should take part in the discussion.=20

Here's a little more detail on the voice mail I left you earlier.  The bank=
s want more than just secured debt.  They want a mortgage on all of TW and =
NNG's real property.  That's right, they want a filing with every county co=
urthouse where NNG and TW own assets.  I want to talk to you tomorrow befor=
e Stan's meeting about why that is just a terrible idea.  In short, at the =
same time we are doing this big loan and cash infusion into ENA to "calm th=
e market" we will simultaneously have dozens of right of way guys and local=
 real estate lawyers crawling all over the place doing something I don't th=
ink any pipeline has done before (at least not in my memory).  Nevertheless=
, I want to be able to move forward if there is no alternative.  For us to =
prepare mortgage documents we need (I think) to have approximate property v=
alues by county.  Do we have this info somewhere?  Are ad valorem tax value=
s kept by county?  I don't think our FERC books will be much help on this. =
 Lou is getting Johnny McGee and some folks together after Stan's meeting t=
o talk to me and the Vinson and Elkins folks about how we can do this proje=
ct if we have to.  It will be a challenge, particularly in the 2 week timet=
able they are talking about.       Talk to you tomorrow.  DF
