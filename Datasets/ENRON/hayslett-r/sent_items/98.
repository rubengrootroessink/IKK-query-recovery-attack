I am not sure, I just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of.

I agree, but I'm not sure who--is it someone in Rex Rogers' group that handles the propriety of employee benefit plans, etc? Let me know if you have a name, otherwise I'll call Rex.  Thanks. DF

Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.  What do you think?

Drew and Rod,
I thought that I would give you a heads-up that a Unanimous Consent is being circulated for your signature. Northern Plains and NBP Services Corp are the sponsors of the Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. We have been working with the benefits group and Pat Mackin and have now prepared an Amended and Restated Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. The Consent authorizes the adoption and execution of that Plan. I have initialed the Consent for your execution. Should you need any further explanation, please let me know. Thanks.  Janet
