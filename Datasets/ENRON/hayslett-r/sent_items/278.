I guess now that we have obtained approval to hire the employee, we need your approval to move his phone number to his new work location.
 
Thanks,

Joe Jeffers has hired Russell Hardie to fill the vacancy in his group. Russell is currently working in Elaine Tombaugh's IT group, here on 3AC32. He'll be taking only his telephone and personal belongings with him.

I need to get the proper approvals before submitting a churn request to move his telephone from 3AC3234 to 3AC3204. 

If you approve of this move, please forward this message along with an indication of your approval, to Rod Hayslett for his approval.

Thanks.
