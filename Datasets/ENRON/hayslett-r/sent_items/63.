Subject:	Steering Committee Meeting - Global Accounting Priorities

Even though a number of us are swamped with work related to the issues Enron is currently facing, progress has been made in three of the priority areas.

The purpose of the first Steering Committee meeting was to review (1)team members and (2)plans for the first 30 days.  For those teams who have named a lead (Reporting, Communications, and Human Capital), George Wasaff and I propose that we continue with the status meeting originally scheduled for November 1 from 10-11:30 with those team leads who are able to participate (Jan Johnson, Carol Howes, and I) and any Steering Committee members who are available.  Documentation indicating team members and plans can be made available to those unable to attend.

The five priority areas were expected to move at different speeds, so we can initiate the other two teams once time permits.

Please let me know if you are able to participate, and/or if you have any problems with this proposed path forward.

Thanks!
