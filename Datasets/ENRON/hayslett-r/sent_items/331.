As we have discussed, this is a memo I plan to issue today that will create=
 a vacancy in my organization (Director, Financial Planning).  Since this p=
osition is located in Omaha, I would like to immediately post internally an=
d externally; however, I will do everything I can to use an internal candid=
ate.  FYI, I believe Rod is on board with this.  I'll try to e-mail the job=
 description to you today.  Let me know if you have questions.
