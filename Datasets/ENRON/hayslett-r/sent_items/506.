I have included Paul Cherry, Gary Smith, Jim Bouillion, Greek Rice, Phil Lowry and three from MKM's team. I went through the list and I think we should have everything covered.  We are meeting at 4 to go over the requests, timing and responsible parties.  I have also asked Kyle Kettler for some materiality threshold (if we hope to get this due diligence done by 2010).
All but Phil Lowry are confirmed.

We probably need to get this stuff in the hands of a few more people to make this work smoothly.

Kevin,

Attached is our detailed due diligence request list for Northern Natural.
The list is not 100% complete.  I am awaiting input from our operations
personnel, but I am forwarding it to you now in the interest of time.
Please call if you have any questions (713/767-4764).

Regards,

Kyle
