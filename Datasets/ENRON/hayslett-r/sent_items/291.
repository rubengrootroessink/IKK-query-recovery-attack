I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.
