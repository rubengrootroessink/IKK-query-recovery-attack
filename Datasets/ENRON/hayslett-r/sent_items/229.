Do you have volumes and rates info to go with the NNG current estimate and the 2002 plan?    If not you, can you get for me?

I am not aware of the volume/rate info you used - is this pulled in from another schedule?


Kevin,

Do you have the volume and rate information on Northern Natural that will
tie to Rod's forecast as well?
