Rod -

In planning office space for the EGS legal group, please hold a space for Paulette Obrecht.  She has served in a number of roles in the legal department over the years but would be invaluable in keeping us, er, me, organized.  She is presently on the Corp. payroll.  Let me know if you have any questions or need any other information.  Thanks.

Rob

I am moving to the 3AC2092 with Bruce Lundstrom's group but will keep my same phone extension. They will be moving to the "old" Azurix floors in another three weeks, and I plan to move with them. I hope this meets with your approval. They are literally taking the furniture apart on the 19th floor and dismantling the entire office.
