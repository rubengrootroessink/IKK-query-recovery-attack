I think the biggest problem is that where are we going to get the funds for that?

When I was in Calgary, Keith Petersen and I were talking about rates and certificates and he mentioned some seminars that the Omaha people do.  Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me. 

What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.  

I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.  I realize this could become a lot of people, but it could be a good opportunity for some practical experience and team building.  What do you think?

Cheers,

Michael
