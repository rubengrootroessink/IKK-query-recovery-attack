Rod,

I would like to pass along my appreciation for the excellent assistance Pam 
has provided my group related to our contract file room renovation project.  
She has been quite creative in suggesting improvements to our physical layout 
and has been able to obtain timely results in her discussions with the 
facilities group.  Her involvement has saved us a lot of time.

Rick

I just checked on the construction in EB4159, and it looks like they have not 
done anything about the wiring for the wall phone that's supposed to move 
across the room to EB4159-C  in this Friday evening's churn. Would you please 
check to make sure the change was made on the plans for us? 

Also, I just heard they are planning to put a desktop copier and a fax 
machine on one end of the work surface. I don't know if anyone has done a 
churn request on an existing fax machine, or if a new one will be purchased, 
but we probably should confirm there are enough ports and power to handle the 
additional fax line, along with Victoria Martinez (x3-1953) phone, LAN, etc. 
She's on Friday's churn to go into EB4159-A. 

I've attached a copy of our churn request for your information.



You may have already handled all this, I'm just double-checking. Please let 
me know if you need any additional information, or if you run into any 
problems. Thanks for all your help on this (and many others!) project.
