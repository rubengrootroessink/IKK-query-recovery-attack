Rod - I have not been specifically requested, but if you are asked here's my 
input on selected folks whom I interfaced with on SAP.

Melissa Becker -Excellent; Delivered "80%+" of a huge project!

Mark Schmidt -Excellent; Solid technical skills; experienced; responsive to 
Business Units (BU)

Kathy Kokas -Excellent; solid technical skills; thoughtful; service oriented 
(but too much enterprise orientation versus BU sensitive)

Susan Bellinhausen -Strong; Has worked hard to deliver a myriad of reports 
for users; solid attitude under pressure.

Emitra Nelson -Issues; Long on talk, short on delivery; unable to effectively 
produce needed SAP reports in a timely and responsive manner

Rudy Elizando -Need Improvement; turned out to NOT be the best 
depreciation/FERC resource. Prone to talk; evasive;
short on quality delivery.
