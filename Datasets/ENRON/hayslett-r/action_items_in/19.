Jane DOES need the FERC role.  She will be running the assessments for the 
FAR orders during the close process.  Co. 930 is a regulated entity and Jane 
will be accounting for it.  She will need access to the FERC account 
information in order to create the Rail Road Commission Report at year end.  
Please let me know who we need to direct this to and I will discuss it with 
them further.
Thanks,
Karen
