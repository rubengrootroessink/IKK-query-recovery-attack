Well if her job actually requires access, we need to figure out a way to 
grant it with rules.     How many others are there potentially in this 
predicament?

No, the FERC module is not completely secured. Duane was referencing the 
drill down ability to A/R only. Frazier recommends we prepare a policy and 
state that HPL is not allowed access to the regulated information. We may 
want to consider an enhancement next year to secure the FERC module by 
company.

I will let you know when the policy is finalized and seek your approval for 
Jane's access at that time.

Access to the FERC viewer role will allow access to all FERC drill down data.
From what I understand is the regulated companies were blocked from being 
viewed by the non regulated.
No specific roles were mentioned in the memo.

Are we sure that access to FERC data will allow access to all FERC data?

Frazier,

Do we have concerns? I believe the access requested is needed to satisfy 
Intrastate requirements. If we approve, access to pipeline companies will be 
available as well.

Jane DOES need the FERC role.  She will be running the assessments for the 
FAR orders during the close process.  Co. 930 is a regulated entity and Jane 
will be accounting for it.  She will need access to the FERC account 
information in order to create the Rail Road Commission Report at year end.  
Please let me know who we need to direct this to and I will discuss it with 
them further.
Thanks,
Karen
