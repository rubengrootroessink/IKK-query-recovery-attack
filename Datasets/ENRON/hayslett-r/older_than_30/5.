Jerry -

Per our phone call, attached is the interim policy template we use to obtain Skilling/Buy's approval for interim limits.  You will see the form is organized for functional sign-offs in Enron's wholesale business, so you'll need to customize accordingly for your business organization.  What we'd like to ensure is that each function involved in the trading activity is notified and ready to handle the business - therefore, research or whoever is involved in the Value at Risk methodology, Operations for the daily reporting and analysis required, accounting and tax if it is a new business, the head trader, and we normally get the Office of the Chairman to sign as well (COO or CEO).  

If you have any questions, Frank Hayden at 713-345-8341 should be able to assist, or you can call me at 713-853-0429.

Also, would you please send me your current version of the ETS policy?  I only have the power point presentation recently prepared for Stan to provide an overview.

Regards,
Cassandra Schultz.
