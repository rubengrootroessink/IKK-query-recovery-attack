Rod, if you are talking about Enron Corp. options, the procedure for you has not changed.  You just call Paine
Webber at (713) 654-0371 or (800) 713-0231 and let them know what you want to do--providing, of course, you don't have any material non-public information about Enron stock.

Now, if you are going to exercise EOTT options in a cashless exercise and sell the units, you would have to get clearance from EOTT legal and then call me so I can prepare the 144 forms which need to be signed and put in the mail on the day you sell the units and then you would need to file Forms 4  reporting the transactions by the 10th of the following month that I would prepare for your signature.

Call me at Ext. 3-6062 if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Elaine
