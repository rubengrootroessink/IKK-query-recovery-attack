Rod,

I agree,  I think that  if Mark and Jim discuss the issue directly they can
come to a resolution.  The fundamentals question is does Wessex really need
the level of coverage that the Azurix insurance program offers?

Mark and Jim,

As you analyze this please take into consideration any insurance
requirements of the AEL revolver and the Azurix Corp Bonds to the extent
they have any impact on the insurance decision.

Thanks,



John L. Garrison

Jim:    What do you think?   I would like to get you involved in this
discussion to help us sort out the costs and pros/cons.
John:   I think we can get Jim Bouillion working with Mark to get this
moving in the right direction.
