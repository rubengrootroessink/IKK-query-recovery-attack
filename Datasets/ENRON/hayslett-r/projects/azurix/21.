Once Azurix North America exits the program, only the foreign assets will remain.  Wessex will likely be the largest exposure in the group.  I am gathering some numbers and will advise further.

I guess I would like Mark to substantiate the claim that he is paying too much and if he can do so, then we should be able to adjust his share of the costs.    Don't you think that is fair.    I'm not talking about adjusting AZX's amount, merely the share paid by Wessex.     The substantiation of his claim will actually be the test which will meet the substantiation requirement.

Jim,

Thanks for your e-mail of 8 August informing us that a decision had been
made to keep Wessex insurance's under the existing Azurix global programme,
or to ultimately absorb the whole of Azurix into an Enron programme.  Whilst
we understand this, we are concerned that a continuation of the global
policies, at the current cost to Wessex, will raise some regulatory problems
for us in the UK.

Our Licence requires us to report trades with parents and associated
companies, and to demonstrate that any such trades are undertaken at arms
length.  Moreover we are required to periodically test such arrangements.
Clearly this has not been done in respect of Insurance.

Even more worrying is the fact that the cost of the Global insurance
programme to Wessex is simply not competitive.  The current level of
premiums we pay, when added to the much higher excess levels we incur, are
in excess of what we could arrange on a standalone basis.  Going forward, if
Wessex is to support the rest of the Azurix programme, our costs can only
but rise.

In light of these problems we either have to reduce the cost of the Global
policies to Wessex or allow Wessex to obtain standalone cover.

Regards.

Mark Watts

Treasurer
