Kevin -
Here is the latest run of assets in Rawhide.  The first file is Ponderosa and the second one is Sundance.  As Stephanie mentioned in her note, Paladin has been sold, and the Ponderosa loan was reduced from $740 mln to $691 mln in August.  If you need anything else, let me know.

I have attached the Statement of Investments as of June 30, 2001.  Since then Paladin (in Sundance) has been sold.  Also, in August, the Ponderosa Loan was paid down.  The balance was $740m, but is now $691.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
