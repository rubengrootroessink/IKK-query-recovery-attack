Attached is a preliminary model based on the 1999 10K.  I broke it out by segment so we could see what each piece is valued.  I was not sure what to use as salvage multiples.  The "Other" sheet contains something called eliminations, which I am not sure about.  Also, I was trying to follow Yuan's levered page and had some questions when you have some time.
