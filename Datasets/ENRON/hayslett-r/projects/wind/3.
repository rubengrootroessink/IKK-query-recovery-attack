Rod - ok for Miller to call Newell at Mike Miller's convenience.  At some point, I would like to be briefed on the structure as well.  Adam

PS by the way, the wind co also has a Mike Miller, making for potential e-mail confusion.

I thought I would let you know we are working on this transaction, that should be ultimately transparent to EREC.    With your permission I will let Mike Miller know that it is OK to contact Eric.

Rod,

As part of the due diligence for the Storm Minority Interest transaction, it would be very helpful for David Koogler, my in-house transaction attorney, to be able to talk to Eric Newell, Enron Wind's General Counsel.  David will primarily be focused on insuring that there are no European legal issues that would negatively impact the execution of the Storm transaction.  Eric should be able to alert David to any obvious issues as well as refer David to appropriate European counsel as needed.  Please let me know when it would be appropriate fro David Koogler to call Eric Newell.  Thanks for all of the help.

Regards,

Mike J Miller
