Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign is kicking off this month.  As a pacesetter company in Houston, our campaign starts in mid-July with the leadership giving appeal followed by employee giving and participating in Day of Caring in early August.  

To ensure the success of the ETS campaign, we need employees throughout the organization to spread the word about the United Way and help with the logistics of running the campaign.  As a Campaigner, our employees would work closely with the ETS Communications group to drive a successful campaign.

I ask that you submit at least 3 names of Houston employees from your group to be Campaigners and help with this year's campaign. Each campaigner will be responsible for a group of Houston employees in their business unit.  We need, on average, 1 campaigner for every 20 employees.  

Can I get your list of Campaigners by Monday, July 16?

Additional information about this year's campaign will be coming soon.  

For now, please mark Thursday, July 26, from 3:30 - 4:30 on your calendar.  Stan will be hosting the ETS Leadership Giving reception and the ETS Management Team will be invited to attend.  Also, please mark Thursday, August 9, on your calendar for ETS' Day of Caring.

Please stay tuned for details about this year's Campaign and ETS' Day of Caring.

Thanks so much for your commitment to the United Way.

Gina
