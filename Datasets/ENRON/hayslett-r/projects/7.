Hi Rod.  I wanted to check with you to determine if we've made any progress on our proposed professional services agreement?  Once we're through with it, it'll be much easier to start and meet with business owners and their customer teams throughout Enron.  It would be a great help to me if I could succeed in this small effort.  Hope everything else is well.  I met with Doug Leach and provided much insight to him about Sooner and Alligator Alley Pipeline.  Thanx for your help.
