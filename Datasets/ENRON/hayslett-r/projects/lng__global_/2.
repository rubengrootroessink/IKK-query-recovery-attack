ROD:

I am going to send you a couple of memoes from our external FERC counsel re jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional facilities.  We are, of course, thinking of the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  This is the first memo.

Nancy Corbet, internal counsel, will call you shortly to discuss, then we may ask you to conference with our external counsel at a later point.


Regards.
Les Webber

Nancy and Les:  Enclosed is a draft of the memo.  I apologize for the delay.  The Houston office server has been down and I couldn't get the document from D.C.  Rather than my spending additional time reviewing it, I am forwarding it to you.  Hopefully, it addresses the question of whether Enron would have a seat at the table.  Also, Les, I just saw you e-mail as I was opening my inbox but I haven't yet opened your message.  I will review it as soon as I finish sending you the attached.
