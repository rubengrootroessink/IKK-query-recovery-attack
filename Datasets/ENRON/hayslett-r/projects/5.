Rod-  please find attached a draft of a professional services agreement.  Since I know the procedures there, you'll notice that it is "made-ready" for approval.  There are no immediate Work Schedules, but I hope to change that soon!  Please have counsel contact me with any draft changes (to save your time).  Thanx!!
