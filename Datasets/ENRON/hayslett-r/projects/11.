Hi Rod,


Marla asked me to get in touch with you regarding Gaye Mayeaux.  I spoke to Margaret Dennison and she confirmed that we can charge Gaye's time directly through HR  to whatever company and cost center you want.  Would you please have someone contact us with the company number and cost center number.  I understand the effective date is July 2.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  My extention is 3-6452.


Thanks
Carolyn Barrett

Can you set Gaye up on the HR system that her time gets charged to ETS without any billing?


Thanks
Carolyn

Carolyn,
Gaye Mayeaux will be taking a short term assignment with Rod Hayslett beginning July 2 and it could last for 6 mths.  I need to explain to Rod how the cross charging works  - can you provide me that info.  thanks
