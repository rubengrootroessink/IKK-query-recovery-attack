How has Enron managed to achieve such success while other energy firms have struggled to deal with the changing market landscape?

Global Change Associates is pleased to announce the publication of a new corporate profile entitled, "Enron 2001: An Inside View".

Much of the information provided comes from first hand accounts and covers areas such as:

?	The recruitment and training of new employees
?	How Enron empowers and compensates its employees
?	The keys to structuring Enron type "risk free" transactions
?	How to negotiate with Enron
?	Why Enron occasionally forgives counterparty obligations
?	Is the Enron model right for your organization?
