Subject: Fixed Assets - EECC

Marian - I wanted to let you know that I have hired a new accountant that 
will be responsible for fixed assets for EECC -- Biff Brannon, x66073.  He 
will be the primary contact  (I will remain the secondary).  As such, I would 
like Biff to be the representative from EECC to the Fixed Assets Council that 
we discussed a few weeks ago.

Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Bart.
