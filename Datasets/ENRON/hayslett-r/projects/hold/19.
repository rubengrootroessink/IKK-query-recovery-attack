Thanks.  I tracked down the info about burial at sea.  We're going to take his ashes to Corpus Christi and they will send a letter to my mom telling her when and where his ashes are scattered.  


My phone number in NJ (Wednesday evening to Sunday morning) 732-244-2175.  Would you please let John Jesse know.  I appreciate everything.
