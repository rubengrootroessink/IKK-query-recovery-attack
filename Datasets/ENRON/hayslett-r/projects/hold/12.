Hello Rod,

Thank you for your e-mail.  I understand that you receive an error in
moving a file when installing USB software.

Please do the following to test the USB ports:

Checking the Device Manager in normal mode

1.  On your screen, locate and click the Start button.  From the Start
menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Note: In Windows Me on the left side of Control Panel, you may have
to click View all Control Panel Options to see all of the icons.

2.  In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

3.  In the System Properties dialog box, click the Device Manager tab.

a.  Verify that everything is recognized and properly configured.

b.  Check the Other Devices category and verify that it is properly
configured.

Note: It is not uncommon for the Device Manager to display a phantom COM
port under Ports (COM and LPT) for certain motherboards and BIOS
versions.  This phantom COM port is necessary for the modem to be
recognized in this situation.  It is likely that the phantom port has a
yellow exclamation point on it.  This is not a device conflict and is
the normal configuration for the motherboard and BIOS.

If the USB ports are properly recognized, then this is a software issue.
Gateway does not support third party hardware or software.  Please
contact the manufacturer for further support in installing their
product.

Thank you for choosing Gateway.

Original message follows:
-------------------------

It does seem strange that my installs are failing on all of new hardware
that I have tried to add to the system with USB connections.   Not just
one of the pieces.   And all of them return the same error.    What are
the chances of that one?
