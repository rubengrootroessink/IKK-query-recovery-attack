The ClickAtHome portal (www.clickathome.net) will allow employees to access MS Outlook (email, contacts and calendars), eHRonline, PEP, and other employee applications via the internet using your existing network ID and password.  This functionality will be available mid-summer and will not require any action on your part.  

For other remote access requests, the Information Technology group (I.T.) is working on a solution to identify and address the issues involved in providing eligible employees approved access to the Enron Network and other applications by the third quarter.  You will receive future messages on our progress.

I.T. is not responsible for the support for your ClickAtHome PC and Internet service.  Support is provided by the appropriate vendor which you may contact directly at the numbers listed below.
