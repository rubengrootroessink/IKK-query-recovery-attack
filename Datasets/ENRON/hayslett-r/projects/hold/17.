Please send details to our local HR manager, Caroline Schaeffer.  We'd certainly be interested in following up.

Danny McCarty tells me that you are the person I need to talk to.     I have been approached by a Japanese student graduating soon who would like to go to work for Enron
in Japan.     I know her from an exchange program a few years ago.     Who should I tell her to talk to?
