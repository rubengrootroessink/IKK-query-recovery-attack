Rod,

I am forwarding to you via FedEx tomorrow a copy of our Energy Trading
Policies and Procedures.  This document contains our risk management policies
and procedures and hopefully the information that you are looking for. In
addition, I also understand that you are looking for a copy of our credit
policies. We are currently in the process of developing  these procedures and
do not have a draft that is in good enough shape to share with others at this
point.  Once we have competed it we will send you a copy.  Until then, as you
pointed out in the requesting email most of our credit terms are contained in
the various tariffs that we operate under.  You will find a copy of the
relevant credit provisions from these tariffs included in the FedEx package.

If you need any additional information please feel free to contact me at
503.464.2723.

>>> Hayslett, Rod 07/03/01 11:05AM >>> 
To the extent you have a policy concerning risk management, would you please
forward me a copy so that I can get your input into some changes that the
Enron Board will be asked to make to the Enron policy. I will copy you on what
I get from them.
