Generally, I am not too concerned with the position violation, since we are still under the VaR limit. However, the risk has been increasing and we are pushing the limit: $1.9 MM vs. the limit of $2.0 MM.

Also, the explanation below does not quite make sense because the gas desk has increased risk by getting shorter from yesterday, implying that there is some ability to transact and change risk profile.

Vlady.
