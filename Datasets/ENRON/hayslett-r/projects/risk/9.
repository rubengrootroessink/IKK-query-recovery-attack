Please let me know as soon as possible the limit request to be proposed to the Board in the upcoming meeting.  These are limit request for ETS and Portland General.  Specifically, I need to understand limit as well as notification levels.

Sorry for the rush.  (I have some of this already, I just want to verify to minimize misunderstandings and better manage expectations) 

Thanks,
Frank
