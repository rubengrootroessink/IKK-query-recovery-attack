We normally involve Colin, my financial controller Nigel Reed, the Ops
Director Sam Allen, and myself

Propose that we continue that.  The question is whether we need a face to
face.  We have done it by phone -  but I guess that reflects the fact that
the AZX guys were comfortable with us.  Its your call.  We would be more
than happy to do a face to face

regards

Keith

How many of you would you think need to be involved in a budget review
of Wessex?     I am trying to make the costs be the lowest, but Stan
think's it need's to be face to face.    Typically Stan would like most
of the management team in attendance, but if you and Colin have a
preference let me know and I will attempt to get it planned out.

For reference purposes, Tracy Geaccone is responsible for pulling
together and understanding Stan's numbers (in addition to being my right
and left hands) , so you and your people will probably start to hear
more from her.
