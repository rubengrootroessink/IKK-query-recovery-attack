A number of comments from the Global Accounting/Investor Relations PRC meeting for directors and senior directors led me to believe that a "rotation list" (for lack of a  better term) for Global Accounting might be useful.  Attached is a first draft.  We can use this list to identify personnel needing new challenges, greater exposure, etc., as well as to fill gaps created by expanding businesses or departure of employees to other opportunities.

Currently the list contains only directors and senior directors, but we can expand to levels below if this would be helpful.  Please give me any ideas you have on how best to distribute and use something like this, as well as any additions, deletions, comments, etc. you might want to make to the draft.

Thanks!
