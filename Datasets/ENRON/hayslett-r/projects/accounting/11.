Have we ever reached closure on a potential adjustment to NBP/NBPL SAP charges?  I couldn't find our last e-mails on this but my recollection is the charges to NBP companies went from $290k to $1,250k in 2001 with the increase mainly caused by an allocation methodology change from an activity measure of system usage to MMF.  NBP earnings could sure use an extra million or so!  What do you think?
