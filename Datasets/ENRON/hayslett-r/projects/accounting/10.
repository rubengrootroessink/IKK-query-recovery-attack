It has been decided that the offsite scheduled for September 19, 20 and 21 will focus on leadership:

refining our objectives for Global Accounting
getting better aligned on priorities
possibly some leadership "training"

Given those objectives, we determined that the appropriate audience was senior director and above.  Given that some groups don't have the senior director title and that there may be a few directors in key leadership positions, the purpose of this message is to request that you eMail Sharron Westbrook and me with any directors whom you wish to include in this offsite.  Please reply by the end of the day Thursday.  If you do not have any directors you wish to include, please reply with "none" so we know you got the message.  We anticipate and prefer that the number of directors added will be fairly low.

We revisited with Jan Johnson the original study that led to the creation/improvement of these offsites.  You may recall that the primary goal was to improve communication.  For the director level and below we plan to:

continue with an annual "all Global Accounting" offsite
provide quarterly opportunities for technical training (look for information from Rodney Faldyn)
provide a structure for best practices sharing around topics such as cash flow reporting, etc.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know (x36641).
