Rod,

Karen Myer is setting up some meetings between Rick Causey, myself and some of the business units. I just
wanted to let you know a little more about those meetings. The purpose is to discuss Enrons plans to step up our
cash flow reporting and forecasting effort. We have some ideas and would like to bounce those off you and see what 
ETS is currently doing and how that fits into our consolidated plan. Please bring whoever who think would be beneficial.
