Yes, and I got a copy of the bill.  I have no idea how to divide it up.  It is not very clear on what company incurred which expenses.  Please call me and I can give you some thoughts on this.   Thanks.

Rod is correct.  Everyone is covering their own expenses

My recollection is that when we lowered the price, that everyone was then going to cover their own bills.

We are putting together cost numbers over here.  When do you think you will have a resolution on this issue?  I will assume no charge to EOTT unless you tell me you have heard otherwise from Stan or Rod.  Thanks.

Molly and Ann,
I was under the impression that V&E expenses related to EOTT would be paid by EOTT.  However, I may have misunderstood Stan's comments a few weeks ago and I don't know how feasible it is to split the expenses.  I believe this is a Stan/Rod/Dana decision ultimately.

Just confirming Bob's comments that EOTT will NOT be receiving any V&E bills on Project Timber.  Thanks.

Molly:  I talked with Ann Ballard, who said that all of V&E's fees and
expenses on Project Timber would be paid by Enron Corp.  And our billing
coordinator, Carol Wells, plans to send the bills to Enron. So the only
legal fees that EOTT will have will be Haynes & Boone, plus any followup
work that you ask us to do (which I don't think will be much, if anything).

Do you want an estimate anyway?

Bob-We are pulling together costs for Project Timber.  When can we expect
to see either an estimate or an invoice for time from V&E?  Thanks.
