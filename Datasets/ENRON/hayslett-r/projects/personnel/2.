Rod: How are you? Thought I would update you on my status. I'm currently
doing some consulting for Raytheon. In fact, I'll be heading for Asia this
Tuesday for about 4 weeks. My commitment to Raytheon is open-ended so I can
terminate at any time. I've been in contact with Stan Horton and he informs
me that since the EES organization is still shaking out, it may be a bit
premature to sit with the executive team at this point in time. Probably
good timing for me as I will be out of pocket for most of June. Anyway, I
want to stay in touch with you and would still appreciate your continuing
advice and counsel. You can contact me through my Raytheon email address.
Thanks again and looking forward to our next get-together. Regards

Rich Leong
