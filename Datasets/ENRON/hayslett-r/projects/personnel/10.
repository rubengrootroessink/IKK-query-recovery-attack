Rod,

I wanted to let you know that Pam bailed us out this week in regard to acquiring a fax machine. Our fax machine ( after eight years ) finally gave it up on Wednesday morning. Not knowing exactly who to call, I contacted Pam, and by Thursday morning our new fax machine was delivered. Her efforts were very significant as this was Bid week and the beginning of close so having the fax operational was critical. 

I believe that instances such as this need to be communicated to one's superior.

Regards.
