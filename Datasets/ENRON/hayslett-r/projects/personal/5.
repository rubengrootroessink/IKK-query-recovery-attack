Rod

I appreciated your method and style of communication this morning. You spoke clearly, with obvious knowledge and expertise, and came across as straight. None of us can take this for granted, especially during times like this, simply because 'we need to know what we need to know'. 

The trust, credibility, and integrity factors have been shaken at Enron, and no 'spin' on the facts will do.

Thanks.
