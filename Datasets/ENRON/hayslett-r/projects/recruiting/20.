Dear Mr. Hayslett,

My name is Gertrude Onuoha, and I am currently a senior at the University of 
Houston, graduating with a degree in Finance in December of this year.  I had 
the wonderful opportunity to meet you yesterday at the information session 
held at the Shamrock Ballroom at the Hilton at University of Houston ground.  
I would like to use this medium to let you know that the reception was very 
informative, and to thank you for such an excellent presentation.  I would 
also like to reiterate my interest in a position with Enron.  Enclosed is 
another copy of my resume for your review.  

I have also selected Enron at the Univerisity of Houston Career website, and 
I would definitely welcome an opportunity for an interview.

Thanks once again, and have a great day.

Sincerely,
Gertrude Onuoha
