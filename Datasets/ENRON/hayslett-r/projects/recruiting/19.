Just wanted to thank you for your time the other night at the University of
Houston's info session. I am sure that you met a lot of people, but I was
the one who was hired by Enron Middle East last year. As I had mentioned
that Rick had moved his division to Dubai and therefore, unfortunately, I
had to let go of Enron's offer.

I am extremely interested in joining the Associate program. I have an MBA in
International Business and Management. I am currently working in the Lending
department at Southwest Bank of Texas.

I am enclosing my resume for your review. I have applied through the
University Career Services as well.

I look forward to seeing you again in the near future.

Thanks.

Nadia
