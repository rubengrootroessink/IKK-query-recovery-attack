Dear Mr. Hayslett:
 
It was a great pleasure meeting with you Monday night.  I really enjoyed hearing about Enron.  It really gave me a better understanding of Enron and the businesses Enron is involved in.  Also, I now know the type of candidates that you are seeking and the opportunities that exist there for me.  As a result my interest in working for Enron were strengthened.  
    
opportunity is exactly what I have been looking for, something challenging and fast-paced.  I am confident that my background and experience will allow me to be a great asset to Enron in various capacities.  I am attaching a copy of my resume and I sincerely hope that I have the opportunity to prove this to you.   I hope I am the type of person you are looking for as well.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Thanks,
 
Sejal Patel
