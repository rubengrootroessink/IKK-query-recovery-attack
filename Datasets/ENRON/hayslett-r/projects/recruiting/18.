UH Recruiting Team - 

This is a reminder about tonight's UH recruiting event.  The details are as follows:

Date:		Mon, Oct 15th
Time:		7:00pm
Location: 	UH Hilton - Shamrock Rm

Parking is available at the Hilton in its underground parking lot.  You will have to purchase a token at the Hilton Front Desk prior to leaving.  The A/A program will reimburse you for parking.

Attached are the job descriptions for both the Analyst and Associate.  I will be coming by this afternoon with brochures which outline the program in more detail.  

Thanks so much for your assistance and I look forward to seeing everyone there.

Regards,
Tracey Kozadinos
