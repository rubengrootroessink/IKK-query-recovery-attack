We are currently renting 198,378 square feet (without the swing floor 3AC33). At a price of $27.19 per square foot per year, $5,393,000.

Deborah Bubenko will reprice the floor 41 estimate to include the storage cabinets and lights this week. The original estimate of $1.5 million did not include these.
