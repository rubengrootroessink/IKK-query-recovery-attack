Rod,
Send the resume over to me - I'd be happy to speak with her.
Thanks for thinking of us over here in Japan!

Danny McCarty tells me that you are the person I need to talk to.     I have been approached by a Japanese student graduating soon who would like to go to work for Enron
in Japan.     I know her from an exchange program a few years ago.     Who should I tell her to talk to?
