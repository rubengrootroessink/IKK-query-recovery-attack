There are two Hiltons in central Bath, both a short walk from the office, the 
Roman baths, the antique shops, etc.  I haven't stayed at either.  They're 
both fairly modern hotels, so I'm sure they'll have all the stuff one needs 
for business, but probably no charm if that's what you or your wife like.

The Royal Crescent is very special.  It's more luxurious, with a spa and 
stuff, and less of the standard business hotel.  It's about a mile from the 
city center, but literally part of the famous Royal Crescent built by John 
Nash, the great Regency Period architect who designed Regent Street in 
London, etc.  Of course, I'm sure it's a lot more expensive, but I believe 
Wessex has a special rate there.

As for London, the Athenaeum is nice--modern, but in the midst of all the 
good stuff in Mayfair.  It's around a 15-minute walk from Enron's new office 
(and probably 15 minutes by taxi, given the one-way streets and traffic!).  
Our meetings will be in the City (ie, downtown), which is inconvenient to 
everyone but  where all lawyers, bankers, etc. have their offices.  Mayfair 
has many of the good restaurants, plus a lot of the good shops along Bond 
Street.  For a Mayfair location, the Athenaeum can't be beat.

My wife, Dede (who's coming with me), and I will stay at the Sheraton 
Belgravia.  It's about 1/4 from where we used to live,  and very close to the 
shopping along Sloane Street, Walton Street, and Knightsbridge (Harrods, 
etc.).  It's also 10 m inutes from Enron's new offices.  Other  good choices 
in that area are the Hyatt Carlton Tower, the Hyde Park (just revamped as 
part of the Mandarin chain), and the Berkeley (the latter two being very 
expensive).

By the way, if you haven't been to the UK lately, don't both with travellers 
checks, etc.--your US ATM card will work everywhere, and there's an ATM 
machine about every 15 feet in London and Bath.
