Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.
Mery
