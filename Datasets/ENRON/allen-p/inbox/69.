Phillip;

This attachment is my start on your 1031 search.  From my experience, you
will probably need to park the money until we find the right investment for
you.  I have not had time to analize all of the possibilities.

Are you coming on Friday? Do you want me to drive by these properties
tomorrow, or are we going to do it Friday?

Please reply
