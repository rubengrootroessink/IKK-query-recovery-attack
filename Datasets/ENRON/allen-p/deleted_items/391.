UNLUCKY 13: MY TOP TECH TURKEYS OF ALL TIME

    It is sad that a fowl so noble--not to mention
         savory--has come to symbolize lame thinking
         and laughable losers. But alas, it has. And
         so in honor of our national holiday I've assembled
         a list of things that, well, I can't be thankful
         for. Once I've given you mine, why don't you
         give me yours?

    GET READY TO SHOP... MS'S NEUKOM DEPARTS... FBI LISTENING IN...

    It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...well,
    at least in the shopping malls, and probably
    at your favorite online stores, too.
    This holiday season, the biggest retail
    names are putting extra effort into
    making their online shops as good as
    their offline ones--and, unlike past
    years, in making your experience there
    as pleasurable as possible.

  BEST STUFF IN THE 'DIGITAL DECADE' WILL BE BEHIND
  THE SCENES

   Which technologies will matter most in the
         next ten years? Not XP, Xbox, or the Tablet
         PC. Try Office and back-end Web services.
         It may not sound sexy, but it'll help you get
         work done. Eric has the story.

  GET A STEAL ON A CELL PHONE THAT'LL KEEP YOU IN CONTACT(S)

   If you fumble with your PDA every time you make
         a call, you need a cell phone that manages your
         contacts. A lot of high-end phones do this,
         but they're pricey. Janice finds an affordable
         phone that fits the bill.

         up three downloads that provide hours of fun--without
         costing a penny.
