Amazon.com reported a narrower third-quarter loss that matched analyst
expectations, amid weak growth in revenue. The online retailer stuck with
its profitability target.

Compaq swung to a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter on a 33%
drop in revenue amid shipment problems and slack demand for computers.
