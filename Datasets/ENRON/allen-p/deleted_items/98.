AFTER SERVING UP boring banners for years, online publishers and advertisers
are getting creative. The banner ad is "the biggest mistake we've ever
made," says one member of our roundtable discussion, in the first of a

TO CAST YOUR VOTE on what kind of marketing you'd prefer (or least dislike)
while surfing the Web -- e-mail, banners, or instant messages, among others
-- go to:
