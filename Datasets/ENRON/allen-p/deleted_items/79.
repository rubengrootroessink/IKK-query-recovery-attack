[IMAGE] =09 Envoy: GMC's Bold New  SUV      The GMC Envoy is one of the nic=
est surprises of the 2002 model year. It  represents a comprehensive improv=
ement over its Jimmy predecessor, making  it one of the most competitive mi=
d-sized SUVs on the market.   The fact that it is still "truck-based" - whi=
ch essentially refers to the  full-frame construction that makes its Yukon =
big brother such a beefy  workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides lik=
e a truck. Quite the  contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way th=
at would have been  unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market=
 in which the Envoy  competes has become packed with excellent choices, wit=
h everyone from Acura  to Mercury entering the fray. We drove an Envoy SLE =
4WD to find out how it  stacks up.      Full  Review   > >      You are  re=
