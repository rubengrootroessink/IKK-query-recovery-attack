Phillip,

I talked with Ina and scheduled a meeting for Wednesday at 10 am. I am
booked from 1 to 4:30 tomorrow, but other than that I'm free the rest of
the week (until Friday).

     Subject:  Summary of Today's Meeting

     Phillip,

     Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
     summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

     1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions
     you
     gave us and move forward with this approach.

     2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for
     Topics
     reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
     sign-off on each topic.

     3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
     incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We
     will
     meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
     designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
     Monday with the room number.)

     Have a good weekend.
     Mery
