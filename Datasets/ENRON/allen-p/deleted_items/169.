    itself anticipated. Reason: At the
    same time we're saying hello to the new
    OS, we could be saying goodbye to the
    Microsoft-Intel duopoly.

   Like those cheesy all-in-one stereos from

         inferior to their standalone counterparts--especially

         the OS's security weaknesses, and tells you
         how to safeguard your computer.

         of being the first portable MP3 player to make

         why this Mac peripheral might be worth a good
         long look (and listen).
