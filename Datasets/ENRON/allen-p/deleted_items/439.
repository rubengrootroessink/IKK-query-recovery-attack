PRESSPLAY, MUSICNET: LEGAL, BUT NOT FOR MP3 PLAYERS

    This is so idiotic that I can't believe I'm
         writing a column about it, but here goes: You
         know those "legal" Napster sites the music
         industry is creating? Well, throw away your
         MP3 player, because it won't work with them.
         Are these people nuts?

    HOLIDAY WORM STRIKES... PCS W/DVD: HOT!... INTEL REVS UP...

    Think you've got the post-Thanksgiving
    blues? Try snacking on a worm to go with
    your leftovers. This weekend a computer
    worm caught holiday-sated folks off
    guard while they contemplated stuffing
    instead of security.

  WHY THE NEW POWERBOOK G4 IS A MAJOR FASHION VICTIM

   While Stephan's not a huge fan of the Titanium
         PowerBook G4, he thought he should give the
         newest model a try. What did he find? It sure
         looks nice, but it still isn't the greatest
         pro laptop out there.
