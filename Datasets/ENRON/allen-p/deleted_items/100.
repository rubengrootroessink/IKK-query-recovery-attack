SE:NT)(TSE:NT.) today reported results for the third quarter and first nine=
 months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accountin=
g principles.   Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=
r the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =
in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=
rter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=
4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=
 and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=
e third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=
ompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =
share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=
cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=
ions(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete=
 inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=
x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=
cing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =
with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 m=
illion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of=
 the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=
nd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately=
 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components=
 business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=
ion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=
tel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=
arter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   "Revenues f=
or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=
djusted to new levels of spending," said John Roth, president and chief exe=
cutive officer Nortel Networks. "Our bottom line results reflected the impa=
ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=
e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=
t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=
 Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=
reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=
re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002."   Frank Dunn, =
the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =
1, 2001, said, "Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=
ation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=
, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=
d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=
etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=
ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=
ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=
 them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=
ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=
tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=
s included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to =
packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =
softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =
and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,=
 MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G=
 Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=
st commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=
all;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =
       Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =
 Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=
ed software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =
        solution."    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =
to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=
f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=
s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =
workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=
er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=
e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=
r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=
 the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=
timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =
quarter, Frank Dunn said, "We are extremely pleased with the results that h=
ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=
cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=
ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=
 completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=
, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=
ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=
ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=
s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=
s well positioned."   "While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=
ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=
e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=
ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=
ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=
sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=
rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time," concluded Dunn.         R=
evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=
ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=
 quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =
and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =
in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=
rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=
urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=
 revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =
Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=
ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=
mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=
argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=
y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=
d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=
bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=
rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=
ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=
less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =
October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=
rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=
l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =
in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =
of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=
ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=
nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=
 revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=
9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=
g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=
S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=

 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=
, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=
 and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=
ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=
$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=
 Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=

usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=
t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=
on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =
approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=
750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=
ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=
ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=
ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=
red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=
nses    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses in the third =
quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=
justments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=
ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=
ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=
isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =
to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=
earch and development ("R&D") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=
rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=
o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=
ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=
 R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=
 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=
s.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) ("NNL"), Nortel Ne=
tworks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=
 into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =
traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=
harge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=
ce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=
eamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=
pproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=
s Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated No=
