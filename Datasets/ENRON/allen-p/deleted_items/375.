HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form
         factor first and live with the compromises.
         (Or just stick with separate gadgets.)

    APPLE: BRING ON XP... HP'S SPEED BOOST... PENTAGON GOING
PRIVATE...

    Might you Windows users come back to
    the Mac? Apple thinks so. It's confident
    its new OS X out-XPs Microsoft XP--enough
    to entice more than few converts into
    the Mac fold. But will it work?

  CAN YOUR BIZ PASS A SECURITY AUDIT? HERE'S WHY IT
  MUST

   A recent review of government computing showed
         its security was sorely lacking. What about
         at your company? The nation has paid ample
         lip service to the importance of tight security,
         now it's time to act. Wayne tells you how.
