IPOD FOR WINDOWS: WHY JOBS MUST JOIN THE DARK SIDE

    It's the coolest thing many people say they've
         seen in a while: Apple's sleek new iPod music
         player. But here's the hitch: There's no Windows
         version right now. Will there be? I'm betting
         on it. And here's my plan for Steve Jobs' foray
         into darkness.

    MS TO SETTLE?... LINUX PDA SHIPS... OPEN SOURCE FACES REALITY...

    Microsoft may settle! Again! This time,
    it could get out of a slew of private antitrust
    suits by donating software to schools.
    A good cause, no doubt. But does that
    really make up for its legal violations?

  HOW HACK ATTACKS ARE GETTING SMARTER--AND HARDER
  TO STOP

   Malicious users are learning to better outsmart
         their captors, a new report says. They're
         using hard-to-detect worms to carry out denial-of-service
         attacks, and targeting routers that could
         bring down whole portions of the Internet.
         What should you watch out for? Robert has the
         scoop.
