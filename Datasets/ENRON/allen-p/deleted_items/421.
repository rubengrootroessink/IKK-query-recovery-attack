tinuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation r=
emains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary wi=
dely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become f=
ar less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b=
ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =
September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds =
in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =
week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=
om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=
ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=
nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=
nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =
months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=
d after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in=
 a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=

   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  b=
