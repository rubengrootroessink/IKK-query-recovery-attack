10 COMDEX PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO SEE (AND CAN)

    I couldn't possibly do justice to all the things
         I saw at Comdex in the 600 words that make up
         my column. But since pictures are worth a thousand
         words--and video even more--I'm still able
         to give you a good glimpse of 10 products that
         are well worth watching.

    AN XBOX IS BORN...LINUX PDAS COMING SOON...BIDDING FOR VINO...

    It ain't over 'til it's over. Most Comdex-goers
    have packed up their laptops and stumbled
    for the first plane out of town, but the
    news keeps pouring forth from Vegas.
    At the top of the list: Microsoft's Xbox
    launch, handhelds for the open-source
    crowd, and eBay's second dip into the
    sauce.

  TALES FROM THE COMDEX CIRCUS: WHAT MADE THIS YEAR
  UNIQUE

   Robots, MP3 teddy bears, oxygen bars. What
         do these things have in common? They were all
         sprucing up the Comdex show floor. Josh and
         John give an illustrated tour of the stuff
         you had to be there to believe.
