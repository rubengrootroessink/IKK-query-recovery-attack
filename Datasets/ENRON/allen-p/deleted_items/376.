HO-HO-HOW TO BUY A COMPUTER FOR CHRISTMAS

    It's that time of year again! If you're considering
         buying yourself a spiffy new PC (maybe spiced
         up with a broadband Internet connection?)
         or are looking to bestow technological riches
         on someone else this season, don't miss this
         great advice from Santa David.

    SONY ON DVD FENCE... NEW LOOK FOR LINUX... MS SERVERS
ATTACKED...

    The battle over which DVD format will
    become the industry standard wages
    on. Sony's weighed in on which one it
    prefers, but its stance is hardly decisive.
    Also, a new graphical interface for
    Linux and other Unix-like OS's has arrived,
    and a worm is wreaking havoc on Microsoft
    SQL servers.

  WHY A 'PATCHWORK' APPROACH TO SECURITY IS RIGHT
  FOR YOUR BIZ

   If you're concerned about keeping your network
         safe from hackers, crackers, and worms, there's
         an easy way to do it: stay up to date with patches.
         But most organizations don't have a patchwork
         plan. Lee Schlesinger explains why that's
         important--and shows you how to take the right
         approach.
