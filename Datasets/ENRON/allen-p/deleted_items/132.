ire via COMTEX/ -- American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) today reported thir=
d quarter net income of $298 million, down 60 percent from $737 million in =
the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=
ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=
n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=
quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=
ected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=
 of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =
September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=
ertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=
ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=
nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =
of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=
-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=
 September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=
y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=
 of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=
e company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =
expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =
operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=
ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=
 will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=
ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=
sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=
ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=
n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=
ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=
ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=
ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=
tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=
f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=
ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=
ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=
 on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=
r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =
  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=
time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =
19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=
nt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   "While we w=
ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=
rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =
we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=
estment activity slowed after September 11th," said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=
airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. "In light of =
the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=
 our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=
itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=
es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=
nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=
hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=
 the economy."   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=
e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=
 year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=
 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=
d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=
e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=
tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =
would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=
ear.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=
ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =
28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=
ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=
e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=
r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=
et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=
arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=
lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=
uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=
.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =
higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=
ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=
in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=
 expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=
ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=
ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results "=
on a managed basis" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=
ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=
lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=
rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=
 $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=
illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=
se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=
 therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=
an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =
million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=
 Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=
62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=
d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=
s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=
ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=
sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =
the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =
lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=
agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=
ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=
 primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=
control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=
 company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=
ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=
ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=
lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=
rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=
ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=
 ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=
ng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=
ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=
ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=
, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=
sts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=
t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=
sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =
as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=
gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=
alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =
to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=
rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=
illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=
