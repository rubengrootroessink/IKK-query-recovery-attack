THE 10 TOP THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT WIN XP

    Reams have been written about XP. I've gone
         on and on about it myself. But now it's officially
         here, what's left to say? Not much, but just
         this: A list of the few features and issues
         that really, really matter.

    XP: PHOOEY ON YOUIE! WHY IPOD IS THE APPLE OF OUR EYES TODAY

    Apple poured some precipitation on
    Microsoft's XP-week parade by introducing
    its new MP3 player. But the iPod isn't
    just some mischief at Microsoft's expense.

    Apple at its very best and makes you wonder:
    Is Apple underestimating itself by
    not making more things for the rest of
    us?
