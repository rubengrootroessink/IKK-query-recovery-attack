XP COUNTDOWN: MORE OF YOUR TOP QUESTIONS ANSWERED

    In the last month and a half, I've been inundated
         with XP-related questions from faithful
         AnchorDesk readers. Can you upgrade? Is XP
         faster than 9x? What's the deal with licensing?
         Join me as I do some eXPlaining.

    SUN, MICROSOFT AND THE ROAD TO THE 'FRICTION-FREE ECONOMY'

    The Internet and World Wide Web gave
    birth to an idea--a hyperefficient
    economy that operates less like a heat-producing
    mechanical engine and more like a motor
    coiled with a superconductor. To understand
    this basic idea is to understand Sun,
    Microsoft and their dueling ambitions
    for Web services.

  WHY INTEL COULDN'T MAKE ITS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FLY

   Long the king of PC microprocessors, Intel
         thought it could rule the world of consumer
         electronics, too. Not so. Josh and John find
         Intel's decision to abandon consumer products
         disappointing, but not surprising.
