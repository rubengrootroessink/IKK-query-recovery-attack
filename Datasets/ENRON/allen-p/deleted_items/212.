GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

    WILL THE PATRIOT ANTI-TERRORIST BILL BETRAY US?

    A new anti-terrorism law, which significantly
    expands law enforcement powers, is
    speeding into law. So now we'll see:
    Whether Congress, with our assent,
    acted wisely or whether we allowed fear
    to lead us astray.

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security
         systems are quite vulnerable. Add a second
         element, such as an ID card, and the solution's
         more secure. David looks at the promise--and
         the difficulties--of two-factor security.
