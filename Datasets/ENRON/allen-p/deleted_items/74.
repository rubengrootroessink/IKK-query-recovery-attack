WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

    WHAT'S MS' ULTIMATE GOAL FOR XP? HINT: WAY MORE THAN AN OS

    reminded no less than five--count 'em,
    five--times to sign up for its Passport
    authentication service. These pleas
    speak of far more than Microsoft's persistence.
    Like what? Like how it plans to become
    another AOL inside an OS.

     PLUS:

      APPLE HINTS AT 'BREAKTHROUGH' DEVICE.
    WHAT COULD IT BE?
