HAPPY HOLIDAYS! (AND WHERE TO GET HELP IN A PINCH)

    The week between Christmas and New Year's
         is traditionally vacation time in Silicon
         Valley, so we're taking the week off, too.
         In the meantime, here are some places you can
         get computer help over the holidays. And if
         you really, really miss me, I've also linked
         to my most popular columns of 2001.

    HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY

    While this is a muted Christmas for most
    of us, it's been a merry one indeed for
    e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday
    generated so much holiday cheer, just
    wait 'til next year. That's when some
    enabling technologies will make online
    shopping far more than the glorified
    catalog-buying experience it is now.

  WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT

   The Internet promised to make "mass customization"
         a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that
         well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But
         is there some way your business can create
         tailor-made goods for even broad markets?
         Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.

  BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT

   Will the government ever go paperless? It
         looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking
         would boost government spending and give
         tech businesses a much-needed shot in the
         arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why
         it'll be so challenging to bring the government
         into the wired world.
