SHOWDOWN: SUN, MS SQUARE OFF OVER WEB SERVICES

    Next week brings us a pair of dueling conferences,
         as Microsoft and Sun try to woo folks into following
         their visions for Web services. But is calling
         the competition a battle a fair assessment,
         when MS is already so far ahead?

    NANOTECHNOLOGY: INSIDE THE 'SINGLE MOLECULE' TRANSISTOR

    Death and taxes aren't life's only inevitabilities
    after all. There's another: miniaturization.
    Latest example comes from Bell Labs,
    which unveiled a carbon transistor
    thousands of times smaller than those
    now inside a Pentium 4.

  WHY VIEWSONIC'S NEW MONITOR FALLS FLAT--PLUS MORE
  REVIEWS

   New 17-inch flat-panel displays have become
         almost affordable in the past year. But at
         $799, ViewSonic's new model is at the high
         end of the price range--and the features don't
         justify the cost. Josh and John tell you why
         as they bring you this week's new-product
         roundup.

  PRIVACY: WHY TECH SHOULD TAKE A BACK SEAT TO TRUST

   Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance may end
         up producing incompatible single sign-in
         technologies. But David says the bigger issue
         is whether consumers and businesses will
         put their faith in one, both--or neither.

  NO NEED FOR ACROBAT-ICS: 3 NEW WAYS TO CREATE PDF
  FILES

   Adobe Acrobat is a great tool for converting
         files to a format that can be read by any computer,
         any software, anywhere. But Preston knows
         not everyone wants to pony up for the full program,
         so he's found three shareware options that'll
         do the trick instead.
