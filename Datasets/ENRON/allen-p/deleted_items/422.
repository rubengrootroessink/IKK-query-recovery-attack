Phillip,

I am waiting to get info. on two more properties in San Antonio. The broker
will be faxing info. on Monday.  One is 74 units for $1,900,000, and the
other is 24 units for $550,000.

Also, I have mailed you info. on three other properties in addition to the
100 unit property that I faxed this AM.

Let me know if you have any questions.
