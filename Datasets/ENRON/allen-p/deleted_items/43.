MY 2001 FAVORITES: PRODUCTS I COULDN'T DO WITHOUT

    One of the perks of my job is getting to play
         with lots of neat new gizmos. During the past
         year, I tried out dozens of different devices.
         But when it comes right down to it, there's
         only a handful that really made a difference
         for me. Here's what they are, how they work,
         and why I like them so much.

    WELCOME AT&T COMCAST... XP HOLE PLUGGED... CRACKERS UNDER
FIRE...

    Say hello to the new cable king: AT&T
    Comcast. That's right. Comcast beat
    out AOL Time   Warner and Cox in the contest
    for AT&T Broadband's hand in marriage.
    The cable giant is out   to dominate not
    only the cable-modem and TV worlds,
    but also the local telephone service
      realm. Watch out, Baby Bells!

   WHY IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE A MAC AND MUSIC LOVER

   First, Apple gave us the iPod, perhaps the
         best MP3 player ever. Now comes a new version
         of its iTunes digital jukebox software, which
         really takes the cake. Josh and John tell you
         why these Apple products--and a slew of other
         gizmos to pass through ZDNet Labs this week--scored
         so well with our editors.

   HOW TO MASTER WINDOWS (AT LEAST WHERE YOU CAN)

   You can't fix all of Windows' idiosyncrasies,
         but you can at least control how it behaves
         when it starts up and shuts down. Preston recommends
         three downloads that let you choose which
         programs load when you boot up, as well as set
         tasks--such as ejecting a CD--for each time
         you power down.
