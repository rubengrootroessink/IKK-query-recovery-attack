Phillip,
 
NPW laid off 20% of its workforce about 2 weeks  ago, and I was unfortunately one of them.  I can not believe what is going  on at Enron.  Hope you are doing all right.  Give me a call or drop me  an email when you have a chance at 936-321-6307 or let me know when is a good  time to call you.
 
Al Pollard
