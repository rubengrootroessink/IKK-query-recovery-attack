Phillip,

I know that Yevgeny has been keeping you upto speed with the options we have on the BRM deal. We have Accenture exploring the Zero option, as well as other restructuring choices. As I'm sure you know, we will be in a better position to make a definite choice, next week.

If you have any questions, do call.

Tim
