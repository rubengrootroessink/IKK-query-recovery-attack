WHY THE IDEA OF AN ID CHIP MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL

    Dogs, cats, and cows have them now, so how long
         could it be before a surgically inserted ID
         chip comes to people? In the case of the new
         VeriChip, the answer is how long it takes for
         the FDA to approve it. This is an example of
         a technology that could help some people--but
         hurt lots of others, too. Let me explain why
         the VeriChip should give you shivers, too.

    XP HEATING UP?... DON'T COPY THAT CD!... 'NEW YEAR' WORM
HITS...

    How's Windows XP doing? Not so hot on
    the retail front. But that doesn't mean
    it's going to be a flop. Judging by license
    sales to PC makers and businesses--a
    better measure of an operating system's
    success--XP may become Microsoft's
    best-selling OS yet.

  WANT BETTER WORKPLACE SECURITY? JUST USE SOME COMMON
  SENSE!

   Yes, almost every electronic device emits
         radio noise that can be eavesdropped by your
         enemies. But is this really your company's
         biggest security worry? Robert says no. Your
         real concerns are much more mundane--like
         closing your shades.

  LIGHTEN YOUR LOAD WITH THIS SLEEK AND SEXY NOTEBOOK

   Longer lines at airports and tighter restrictions
         on carry-on luggage mean you want your laptop
         to be as thin and light as possible. Your best
         bet? An ultralight. Janice has chosen a beauty--the
         Sharp PC-UM10--that's featherlight, super
         thin, and still has a lot of power under the
         hood.
