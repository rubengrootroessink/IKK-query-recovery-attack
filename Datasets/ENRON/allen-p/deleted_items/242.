JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES, PART 2: THE Q&A

    When I and 14 other journalists joined Microsoft's
         chairman for a private dinner after the Windows
         XP launch, he had a lot to say. In the second
         installment of this two-part story, Bill
         speaks out on XP's controversial activation
         technology, the company's upcoming tablet
         PC, wireless standards, and more.

    SEND IN THE REBATES! APPLE HOPING TO BOOST INTEREST IN IMACS

    Apple is hardly immune from the slowdown
    in hardware sales--and now we're seeing
    the rebates to prove it. The company
    is giving cash back--or free toys--to
    anyone who buys its computers from now
    through December, borrowing a tactic
    from its PC-selling brethren. But is
    it too little, too late?

  WHERE'S THE BEEF? AUDIENCES TIRED OF CEOS' EMPTY
  RHETORIC

   At a recent tech conference, Microsoft's
         Steve Ballmer and Sun's Scott McNealy played
         up the jokes, while HP's Carly Fiorina stuck
         to business. Can you guess who won the crowd's
         favor? David finds out that technology execs
         crave substance, not style.

  HOW CITRIX IS SHAKING OFF WORRIES OF A MICROSOFT
  INVASION

   Despite talk that Microsoft will encroach
         on its turf, software maker Citrix continues
         to deliver strong results. What's its secret?
         Larry explains why Citrix is one of the few
         companies that has been able to dance successfully
         with this 800-pound gorilla.

  NO THANKS, BILL. TRY 3 NON-MICROSOFT WAYS TO MANAGE
  PASSWORDS

   Sure, it's a pain trying to remember your username
         and password for the numerous Web sites you
         visit each day, but Microsoft's new Passport
         service is not the only solution. Preston
         digs up three programs that store and manage
         passwords--with no involvement from Redmond.
