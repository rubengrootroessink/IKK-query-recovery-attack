Michelle,

I have executed the Warranty Deed, First Amendment, and the Escrow
Agreement.  I am waiting for the agreement that replaces paragraph 7D in
the original Escrow Agreement.  Once you email me that document, I will
execute it and overnight all 4 documents to you.

Phillip

     Phillip,

     I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing
     both
     the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
     documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First
     Amendment.
     Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
     possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make
     sure
     that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also
     enclosed
     is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the
     version I
     e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of "June 29, 2001" as
     the
     date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000
     Extension Fee.

     Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address
     described
     below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at
     (512)
     370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000.  Thanks.
