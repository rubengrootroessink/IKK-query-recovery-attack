The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you 
consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment 
and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be 
used much more.  Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any 
time of day.

Let me know if this is possible.
