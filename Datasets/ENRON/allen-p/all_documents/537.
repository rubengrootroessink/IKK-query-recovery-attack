Lucy,

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Phillip
