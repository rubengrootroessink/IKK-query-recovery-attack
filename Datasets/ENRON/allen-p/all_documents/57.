George,

 I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at 
them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which 
I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it 
to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend.  Does 
this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?  I just want to get a 
feel for when you will start needing money.  

 
Phillip
