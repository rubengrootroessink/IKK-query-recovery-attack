Jeff,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.


Phillip

I was told that you were faxed the loan application.  I will send attachment
for a backup.  Also, you will need to provide a current rent roll and 1999 &
2000 operating history (income & expense).

Call me if you need some help.

Thanks

Lee O'Donnell
