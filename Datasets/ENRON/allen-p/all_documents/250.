Lucy,

 Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep 
a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending 
me updates.

  

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be 
more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments.
We can adjust office hours on another day.

Phillip
