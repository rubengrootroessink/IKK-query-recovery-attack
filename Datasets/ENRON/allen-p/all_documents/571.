Nick,

There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor 
new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being 
coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call 
and he will fill you in on the details of the program.

Phillip
