Lucy,

 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

Phillip
