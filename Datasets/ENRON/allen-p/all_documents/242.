Lucy,

 I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

Phillip
