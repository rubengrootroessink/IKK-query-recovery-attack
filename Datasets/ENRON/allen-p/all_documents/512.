Lucy,

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?
