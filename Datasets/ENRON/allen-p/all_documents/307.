Dear Phillip, 

7th Portal is a super hero action/adventure, featuring a global band 
of teenage game testers who get pulled into a parallel universe 
(through the 7th Portal) created through a warp in the Internet. The 
fate of the earth and the universe is in their hands as they fight 
Mongorr the Merciful -- the evil force in the universe. 

The legendary Stan Lee, creator of Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk, 
brings us "Let the Game Begin," episode #1 of 7th Portal -- a new 
series exclusively on shockwave.com.
