Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons 
for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from 
legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some 
response.  Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market.  
We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be 
included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

Christy,

 I read these points and they definitely need some touch up.  I don't 
understand why we need to give our commentary on  why prices are so high in 
California.  This subject has already gotten so much press.  

Phillip

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
