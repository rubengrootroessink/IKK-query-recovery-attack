Phillip:

Please excuse my oversight is not getting the proforma back to you in a 
usable format.? I did not realize that I had selected winmail.dat rather than 
sending it as an attachment.?? Then, I did not notice that I had overlooked 
your email until today. ??That spread sheet is attached and an updated 
proforma will go out to you this evening or tomorrow morning with a timeline.
