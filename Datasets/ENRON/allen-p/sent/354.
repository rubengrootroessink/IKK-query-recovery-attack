Lucy,

Here is the rentroll from last friday.  

The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday 
April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If 
you have made other commitments I understand.

Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35. 

You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041

Phillip
