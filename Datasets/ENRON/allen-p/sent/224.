Mary,

I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3.  He agreed that it 
would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to 
#2.  Then they can just focus on #19.  I worked on the books this weekend but 
I need more time to finish.  I will call you in a day or so.

Phillip
