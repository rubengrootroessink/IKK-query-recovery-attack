Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors "in smoke filled rooms", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?  
Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed 
price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens?
