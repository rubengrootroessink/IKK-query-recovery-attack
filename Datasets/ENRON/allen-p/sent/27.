Subject: New Generation as of Oct 24th



As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.
