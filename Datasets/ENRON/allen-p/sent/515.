Lucy,

Why did so many tenants not pay this week?

#12 95
#21 240
#27 120
#28 260
#33 260

Total 975

It seems these apartments just missed rent.  What is up?

Other questions:

#9-Why didn't they pay anything?  By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent 
should have been due on 12/12 of $220.

#3-Why did they short pay?
