Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike
