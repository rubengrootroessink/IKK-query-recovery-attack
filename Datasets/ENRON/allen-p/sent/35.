Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip
