Kirk,

Andy Lewis, a director on the Central Desk, has agreed to participate as a content SME.  I plan on being heavily involved in reviewing the content as well.

Phillip, John & Dutch
I want to personally thank you for supporting the BRM deal and I look forward to working with each of you to make this deal a success. I have provided the email below for your information.  The current next steps are as follows:

Yevgeny & I will meet with Vince Kaminski (tomorrow) to get his support as an Exec SME and get his nominee for content SME;
Phillip will provide his nominee for content SME (by tomorrow);
I will contact both Phillip's & Vince's content SME nominee (By Wednesday); and
All SME's will meet and have a demo provided by Accenture. (as soon as possible and feasible based on schedules)

Thus the SME picture should look like  this

Exec SME's : Phillip, Vince, & John
Content SME: Dutch, Phillip's Nominee, Vince's Nominee, Mark Reese and a structuring nominee (Phillip can you provide me with your suggestions again, Thanks)

If you have any questions contact me at your convenience.

Again Thanks!

Cheers
Kirk

Kirk, here are two documents I have revised, assuming a start date for the
week of August 24 for actual content work/design, not just kick off.  This
slips our delivery into the new year.  Please review and let's talk about
them the next time we meet.  I hope your meetings are going well.


List of deliverables and tentative and aggressive due dates, all to be
revised once we start.  In addition, as we move through design, many of
these deliverables will become unit based to ease our tracking of progress,
but since we don't know how many topics/expert stories... that we are
building, it is difficult to create that tracking now.

(See attached file: Deliverables Tracking 081301.xls)


Here is the revised list I mentioned as our SME goals each week, assuming a
start as stated above.
(See attached file: SME Meeting Schedule 081301.doc)

I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Give me a call and let me
know how things are going.
