Griff,

It is bidweek again.  I need to provide view only ID's to the two major publications that post the monthly indeces.  Please email an id and password to the following:

Dexter Steis at Natural Gas Intelligence-	dexter@intelligencepress.com

Liane Kucher at Inside Ferc-  lkuch@mh.com

Bidweek is under way so it is critical that these id's are sent out asap.

Thanks for your help,

Phillip Allen
