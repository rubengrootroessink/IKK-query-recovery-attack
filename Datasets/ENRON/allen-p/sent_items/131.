Kay,

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.

On a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.

Pat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

Keith
