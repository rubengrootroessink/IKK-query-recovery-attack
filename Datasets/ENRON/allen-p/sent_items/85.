Here's the forecast that you asked for, updated for reported actuals, mid-Columbia spill participation and an assumption that the current drastic efforts to refill continue through June 10. Not included is the rumored 400 MW-mo of federal lower Columbia spill that's been considered for the May to mid-June time frame.
