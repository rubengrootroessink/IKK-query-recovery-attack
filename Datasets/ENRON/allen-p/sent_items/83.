Phillip,
	Below is a brief update on the Sutter Power plant.  We expect more information soon on both and will forward it when received.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sutter Power (500 MW)
They are very close to being complete with all construction
They are currently taking in gas for testing of the plant and the project is expected to be fully on-line July 2nd
All environmental permitting and regulatory hurdles have been completed

Thanks,
Kristin
