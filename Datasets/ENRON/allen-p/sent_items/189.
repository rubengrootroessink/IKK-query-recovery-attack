John,

I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.

I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.

See you on Monday.

Phillip
