Jacques,

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

Phillip

Phillip, 
      I received a fax of the consent agreement the attorney on the Stage  
Coach transaction sent and a copy of his coner letter to the bank's attorney.  
I called and left a message that I had comments on that agreement and that we  
will only consent if we get the entire transaction including our release and  
the utility issue resolved at one time. I have jury duty Monday and will call  
you Tuesday to touch base. Jacques
