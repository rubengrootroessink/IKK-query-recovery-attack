Scott, Phillip, Tom and Hunter -

Nine Energy Services LLC is a Woman and Minority Business Enterprise (WMBE) counterparty with whom ENA has been conducting physical gas business under our standard WMBE agreement.  Nine Energy has refused to remit payment via wire transfer, per the terms of our agreement, and we are now placing them on NO TRADES status.  Absolutely no trades can be conducted with this counterparty without full upfront payment.

Please pass this message to the originators on your desks.  Thanks for your help; please call me with any questions.
