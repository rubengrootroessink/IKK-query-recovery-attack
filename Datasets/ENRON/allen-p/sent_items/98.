Tim,

I know you looked into this before but we are still having issues with Mike Grigsby's access to the west power site.  He can view some parts of the website but cannot view the heatrate information under the testing tab.  Does he have some sort of reduced access?  Our IT (Collin)  looked at Mike's access but claimed that it must be on the Portland end.  Sorry to bother you with this again, but can you help?

Phillip
