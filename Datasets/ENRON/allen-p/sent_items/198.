Mark,

The planned mountain bike activity is on Beaver Creek Mountain.  Do you kno=
w what kind of trails are there?  There is a break on Saturday after lunch.=
  The trails at Vail sound great.  Hunter and I would definitely be up for =
trying them out.   Let's set it up.  Let me know if you can book a side tri=
p or if you want me to try.

Thanks,

Phillip=20

Do you know what they are planning for Mountain Biking?  Hopefully it is no=
t just paved bike trails.  If you and Hunter want to we can schedule a side=
 trip if we get a break.  The trails at Vail are the ones they use for the =
World Cup Championships.  The downhill is awsome.  Let me know.

Mark
