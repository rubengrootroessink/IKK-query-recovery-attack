Jim,

I read through the data request.  We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.  We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.  Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.  I would  like to review the final product before it is submitted.

Phillip

Becky --

Pls take the lead in coordinating our response to these requests.

It is critical that legal litigation counsel (Richard Sanders and Bob Williams) see and approve the responses before sending to FERC.

Thanks,

Jim
