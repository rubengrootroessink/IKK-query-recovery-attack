 Jeff,

The attorney's are done with the documents.  I have a call in with Pauline to schedule a meeting to sign them.  Most likely in Columbus.  I am waiting to hear from her.

Phillip,

I spoke with Doug Bell this AM.  He says AMHP got their letter from the
school last Thurs.  Now they are getting a letter from Sam Olguin for an
easement.  So the ball is back in his court.  Once that happens the deal can
close.


What's up with  Seguin?


Thanks.
