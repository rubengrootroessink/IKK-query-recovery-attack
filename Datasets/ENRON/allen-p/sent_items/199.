Ceci,

I would like to stay current on listings under $225.  As an alternative, I would be interested in finding a lot with city utilities to build a small home(<1500 sf).  I am not in a hurry.  I would just like to follow the market and hopefully find a great deal if I am patient.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip Allen

Ceci,

I received the list of properties you mailed.  Thank you very much.  I
would like to stay updated on the market in Hood River and the
surrounding areas in Washington as well.  I would be interested in lots
as well as homes.  In case you don't still have it, my address is 8855
Merlin Ct, Houston, TX 77055.

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
