John,

The spreadsheet below ("Valuation Summary..") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.
