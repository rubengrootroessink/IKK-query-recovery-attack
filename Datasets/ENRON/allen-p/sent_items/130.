Yes they do need to get approval from Southern Pacific Bank.  Their attorney
says that the bank has not responded to their requests.  Pauline is still
trying to get them to move forward.

I spoke with their attorney this AM, and he said that he is reviewing the
settlement document and will like to get everything settled before he leaves
on vacation. (even though he has had the document for a month?)

I suggested that he talk to Jacques to speed the process up.  Pauline may
have been slowing the process by not giving him info.

You should probably have Jacques speak with their attorney (Kolb) if he does
not make contact by tomorrow.

Also, Pauline wants to know if you have any info. on a contact name for the
pay phone.

Call me if you need anything.

Jeff
