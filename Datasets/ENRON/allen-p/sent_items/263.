Jacques,

If you can believe it I have been unable to get with Pauline Kuo to sign all the agreements.  Kevin Kolb sent me additional comments on Monday.
I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.

It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.  

Thank you,

Phillip
