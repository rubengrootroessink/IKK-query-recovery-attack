Greg,

I typed up this resume from scratch in 10 minutes.  Will it do?  If you work for the same company for 8 years your resume tends to get dusty.
Let me know if I need to beef it up or if I need to include any financial information.

I wanted you to review it before I sent it to Montez.  If it is ok please forward to Montez.
