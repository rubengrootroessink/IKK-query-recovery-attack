Steve,

I need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.  Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.

Please get back to me soon.

Phillip
