Jean,

Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at John Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.

Phillip
