Phillip -

Thank you for giving us your feedback on the first seven topic outlines.
I've incorporated your thoughts, but was hoping you could take a look at
them since we didn't have a chance to go over them together. The outlines
and explanations are below. Could you respond back by EOD Monday in hopes
for us to send these outlines for Final Signoff?

Lastly, I was wondering if I could stop by (your's or Ina's desk) and pick
up your comments about the last three topic outlines by EOD Monday. Can you
let me know if this is possible?

Organizational Structure.
You  jotted down "Jeff Gosset, M to M, P&L, and Positions". We have an
entire section about Mark to Market in the Risk Management Inputs topic.
P&L statements and Position reports are large sections in the Accounting
and Reporting topic. In addition, we discuss Mid Office in the Overview
page of this topic (org. structure). Is this enough or were you thinking
something in addition to what I just mentioned.
(See attached file: Framework Org Structure_4.doc)

Accounting and Reporting
I've incorporated the areas of  "G&L, cash payments, and reconcilation into
the last section of the outline. Is this what you were thinking?
(See attached file: Framework AR_5.doc)

Thank you for your time,
