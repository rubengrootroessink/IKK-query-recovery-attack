Ina,

Gracie finally sent the CPE credit information.  Thanks for staying on top of it.

Is there somewhere online that I can find my YTD wages and taxes withheld.  I know it was on the pay stub from last week, but I threw that one away before I realized I needed the info.  If I can't find it online, can you get payroll to print out another check stub from 8/31.  I need to do some income tax calculations.

Thanks,

Phillip
