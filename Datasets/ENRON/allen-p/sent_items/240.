Jacques,

Once you make the changes to the release, please fax a copy to Kevin Kolb.  I am going to try and meet Pauline Kuo on Tuesday or Wednesday to wrap things up.  In addition to the release, I will need the guarantee and a release of lien for the smaller note.  I will speak to you on Monday.  Hope things are going well with your wife.

Phillip

Phillip,  
      Thanks for the info. The changes are alright. I will make the  
revisions and call you. I am at MD Anderson tomorrow morning, so it will  
probably be late tomorrow or over the weekend. We will coordinate Monday  
morning so I can get you everything you need for the closing. Thanks. Jacques
