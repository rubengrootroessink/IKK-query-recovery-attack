I am going to be in a meeting with Accenture on Friday from 9am until 3pm.  So I can't meet with Paul Margraves.  Have him call me directly and I will set something up.

Paul Margraves would like to come here and meet with you at 1:30 this Friday.  He says it would be a quick 15 minute general meeting.  I put him on your calendar and told him if something needed to change I would call him back.  Is this okay with you?
