Greg, 

I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office.  The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold.  Let me know what you think of this property.  Also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.

Phillip
