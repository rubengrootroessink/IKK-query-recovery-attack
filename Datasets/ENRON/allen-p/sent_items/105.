Faith,

Two changes need to be made to the list.  First, Jason Wolfe is a trading track analyst on the west desk.  Second,  Matt Lenhart should be an Associate as his duties and responsibilities are identical to Monique S, Jay R., and Randy G.  I don't know if this change can be made administatively or if I need to bring this up during PRC.  Please let me know.

Phillip

John Lavarato has requested the attached report. He is still a bit concerned about the proper classification of employees within the various titles. If you would, please review this list of employees and advise me of any changes by the end of day tomorrow, if possible. If you have any questions, please contact me at x30352.
