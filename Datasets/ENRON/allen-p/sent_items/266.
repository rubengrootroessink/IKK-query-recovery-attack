Gentlemen
Please take  a look at the attached document. Provide me with your final input, if any, in so that I can give Accenture Sign off acceptance. This document includes input Accenture received or derived from yesterday's Design Scope meeting.

Tim
Your initial concerns around Processes and Knowledge Acquisition were relayed to Accenture and they stated that these will be addressed in the learning objectives, which will be the more detail backup to this high level documents.

Yevgeny
Your Fundamentals issue was handled by the i.e. notation on this document. In addition, Accenture said Yes that this document is aligned with the Topics Document and will be aligned with the more detailed back up document (i.e. Outline) that will support the Topics Document.

I request everyone's input by COB, Wednesday 9/26 in so that if changes are needed we can still get final sign off by COB Friday 9/28. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk
