Jeanie,

Can you send me a list of performance review that I have not completed?

Thanks,
Phillip

As a reminder:

 Signed reviews for each of your direct reports are due to me tomorrow.  

Your stats are listed below and we still have quite a bit of work to do. As a group, I have only receive 15% of the reviews to be completed.

You will continue to recieve emails from me until you reach 100%. 

If you had an employee who was ranked in the 3 for non-exempt(clerks,asst) or a 5 for exempt(analyst and above), you are required to submit a review and a performance improvement plan to me for legal review prior to your discussions with the employee.  

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please give me X53847 or Sarah Zarkowsky(an assoc in my group) X53791a call.

Thanks for your cooperation as we finish up the mid-year process.
