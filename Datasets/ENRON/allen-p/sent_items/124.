Phillip -- Would you have some time Wednesday afternoon to meet with Leslie Lawner and me (and Donna Fulton in the D.C. office by phone) to discuss what we could be doing for you at FERC in the next few months?

Following up on Alan's comment to Phillip --

I've asked the RTO heads to think about 6 month and 18 month "plans".  What about something like this for gas?

Jim

Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.
