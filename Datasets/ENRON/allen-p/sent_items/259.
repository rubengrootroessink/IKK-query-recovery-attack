Don,

Jeff Gosset runs the risk management group.  I spoke to him about including a module on how the books work.  He liked the concept and is willing to sit down with you to discuss further.  His number is X37306.  He is expecting a call to set up a meeting.

Phillip

I would appreciate it if you could review the attached document and
respond
