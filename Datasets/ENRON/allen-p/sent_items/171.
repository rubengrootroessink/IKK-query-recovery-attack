Jacques,

Keith and I were able to resolve our concerns about having the GP as a  corporation.  Several CPA's assured us that the tax treatment fears we had were not a significant risk.  Therefore,  we are ready to finalize the agreements.  What is the next step?  Do we just execute the copies we have?

I haven't heard anything else on the stagecoach from Kevin Kolb.  I keep leaving messages.

Phillip
