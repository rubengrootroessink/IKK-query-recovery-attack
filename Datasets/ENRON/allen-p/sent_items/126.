David,

This note is to give you my feedback on Jeanie Slone.  

She has been extremely helpful with all personnel issues during the last six months.  Without exception she has satisfied any request I have made of her.  She has done an excellent job dealing with performance reviews (both good and bad), salary, and title issues.  

Phillip
