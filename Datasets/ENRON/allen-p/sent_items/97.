Phillip --

Any interest in sending someone from your fundamentals desk to cover this meeting?  May be a good opportunity to hear from the leading "experts" on the subject.  May want to present a basic outline of our fundamental analysis.

Please let me know.

Jim

Jim:  see note below from Pew Center on Climate Change.   Do you have any suggestions as to someone in Enron who could speak (someone from gas trading who does modeling, fundimentals?)

Thanks

Jeff - The Pew Center is sponsoring a  2-day workshop in conjunction with an annual summer program held by  the Energy Modeling Forum in Snowmass, CO.  We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.  
 
Thanks for considering,
Vicki Arroyo Cochran
Director of Policy Analysis



   

The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)

Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  "cleaner" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more "dirty" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  

The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.
