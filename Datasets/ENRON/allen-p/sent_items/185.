Krishna:  One of our clients has requested that we send the information contained in the Deal Fixed Price Report to them in an Excel Format.  Our data will not be used in the monthly pricing survey, if we can not provide the information to them, today.  

Phillip Allen has made this my number one priority.  Please let me know what can be done on a very short time frame.

Thank you.
