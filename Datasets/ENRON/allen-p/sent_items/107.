Thanks for the update on the foundation design.  The clubhouse floorplan looks good.

We talked to Bob Braden about designing the foundations using the geottech
information that we was done previously so as not to delay the permitting
process. He said that he would do a preliminary design for permitting only
and as soon as he gets the new geotech information showing the actual
borings where the buildings are actually going to go, he will revise his
foundation designs. He is in the process of sending us a revised proposal
showing the additional costs to do this extra designing. Any questions,
please call me. Thanks.
