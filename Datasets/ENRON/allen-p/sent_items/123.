jacques,

I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.

 

Phillip
