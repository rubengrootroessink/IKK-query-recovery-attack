I will send checks directly to the vendor for any bills pre 4/20.  I will fax you copies.  I will also try and get the payphone transferred.

I spoke with Pauline again this AM.  She chewed me out about the utility
transfer again.  She was mad about not being told about the transfer before
it happened.  I wasn't sure about the exact date so by the time I told her;
it had already been done.  She would have been pissed either way.

There are two additional items involving the sale that she is requesting.

1.  She wants to transfer the pay phone account
2.  She wants reimbursement for the bills that I am faxing to you.

I will talk to her again about the check that she sent.

We need to work on getting the pay phone transfer, and the small outstanding
bills.  Let me know what I can do to help.

Jeff
