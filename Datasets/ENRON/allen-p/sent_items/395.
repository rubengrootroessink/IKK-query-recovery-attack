Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be =
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, t=
he application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression th=
at yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball. =20

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful su=
ggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition f=
orward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.=
  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new =
space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing=
 play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bord=
ered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for =
a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to=
 add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bed=
room should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof un=
til you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facin=
g the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway =
the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be =
brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitche=
n and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would b=
e more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a b=
ad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or di=
ning room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining =
room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exp=
loring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest somethi=
ng in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try=
 and sketch out these ideas.

Phillip
