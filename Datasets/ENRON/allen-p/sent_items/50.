Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c=
lient will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma=
il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=
onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=
igrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=
 web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T=
o-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl=
ient is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OW=
A) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connect=
ing to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA availab=
le from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou=
-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You=
 will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your us=
er id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=
  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

=09

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality betwee=
n the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the thin=
gs in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of t=
he functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the =
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:
