For your information - 

This morning Goldman issued a brief report following their visit with Enron Management on Monday.  
Their revised price target is $68/share.  
Many of the recent issues driving causing downward pressure on the stock are discussed.

Goldman will be hosting a conference call today at 10:00am (CST) to discuss their views on ENE shares with clients.  Should you wish to listen, dial-in details are included in their report which is included below as an attachment.

Should you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards.
