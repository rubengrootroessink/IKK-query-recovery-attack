Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
