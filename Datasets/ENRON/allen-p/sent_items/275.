Gary,

Can you call me to discuss the panel quote for the Allen residence issued to Johnnie Brown?  In April you worked up a quote for $20,000.  The dimensions of the house have not changed.  The quote given last week was over $26,000.  Have raw materials and labor increased by over 25%?  I need help understanding this increase.
