Jacques,

Did you receive the fax from Kevin Kolb with a small change on page 2.  It also included the conveyance and assignment document.  Does this look ok to you? Is the language "Transfer will occur when first lien holder, Pacific Southwest Bank, approves the assignment" sufficient?  Hopefully it is ok.  Let me know if it is and I will come by your office to pick up executable copies.

Thank you,

Phillip
