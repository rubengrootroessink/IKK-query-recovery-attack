Renee,

I wrote "check" as the method of distribution on the form I dropped off last Thursday.  I thought it would be more likely for the distribution to be made off-cycle.  
However, if the distribution could be made on-cycle I would prefer direct deposit.  Is this email sufficient notice or do I need to do something else?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen
