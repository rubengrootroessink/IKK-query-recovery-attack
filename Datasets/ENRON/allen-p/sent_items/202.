Vail sounds good.  If we are only going downhill our legs shouldn't be too =
wiped out after the morning.  We will be on rented bikes, but I'm sure we c=
an keep them for the day.

I don't know much about the Beaver Creek trails although I am sure they are=
 decent.  Barry heard we will all being doing down hill only at Beaver Cree=
k, so we must be riding the chairlifts.  Saturday afternoon at Vail sounds =
great.  I can bring my truck and we can just drive over with the bikes.  Th=
e trails are well marked and we can either ride up or do the chair lifts th=
ere.  Depends on what you guys think you want to ride.  We could do a coupl=
e of cross country trails and then hit the world cup downhill or we we coul=
d do all downhill there as well.  I am open.=20
Are you going to just rent a bike?

  The trails at Vail sound great.  Hunter and I would definitely be up for =

p or if you want me to try.

Thanks,

Do you know what they are planning for Mountain Biking?  Hopefully it is no=
t just paved bike trails.  If you and Hunter want to we can schedule a side=
 trip if we get a break.  The trails at Vail are the ones they use for the =
World Cup Championships.  The downhill is awsome.  Let me know.

Mark
