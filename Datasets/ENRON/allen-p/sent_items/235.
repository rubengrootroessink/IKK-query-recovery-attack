They cannot meet on Saturday.  I will probably meet them in Columbus on Monday or Tuesday.  I will let you know when.

Phillip,

I am leaving tomorrow morning.  Have you worked out a time to meet the
Kuo's?  I can overnight you my check to present to them on Sat. if they have
signed the release.

Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks.

Jeff
