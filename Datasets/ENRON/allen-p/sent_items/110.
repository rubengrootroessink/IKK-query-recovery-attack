Jeff,

I understand you spoke to Jacques Craig about the consent and assignment documents.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from Pauline that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communicating through you is working well. 

Thanks for all your help.

Phillip
