Rick,

Here is the table to insert during Oxley's introduction.  Maybe you could flash to this screen while he speaks.  If you can read my notes, the second Oxley intro has a better audio reference to the skewed distribution.  That might be useful.

 
Can you send me an email confirming receipt.

Phillip
