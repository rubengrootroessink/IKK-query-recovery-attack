Can you set up one more simulated account with access to all products for the west desk.

Thank you,

Hunter,

The simulation url is https://simweb0.eolsim.com

Your accounts are:
	access to all:		simtrader1
	access to us gas only:	simtrader3, simtrader4

Phillip's accounts are:
	access to all:		simtrader2
	access to us gas only:	simtrader5, simtrader6

In each case, the password is the same as the username.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

--jay
