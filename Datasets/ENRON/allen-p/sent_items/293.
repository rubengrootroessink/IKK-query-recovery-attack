Phillip,
 
Could you please do me a favor?  I would like  to read your current title policy to see what it says about easements.  You  should have received a copy during your closing.  I don't know how many  pages it will be but let me know how you want to handle getting a copy  made.  I'll be happy to make the copy, or whatever makes it easy for  you.
 
Thanks,
 
Bob Huntley
