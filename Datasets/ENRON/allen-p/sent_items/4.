Tony,

Here is the completed worksheet.  I also attached both a plumbing and an electric worksheet.  

I spoke to Steve Chapman with the panel company in Kerrville.  He has a complete set of plans plus an engineers drawing of the slab.  I let him know that you would swing by and pick them up.  He said he knew Mike.  As I mentioned, Mark Olguin should also have a complete set.  I will arrange for the additional copies to be mailed.

   

Call with questions. 

Phillip
