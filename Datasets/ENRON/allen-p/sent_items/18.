Phillip, here is the breakdown on new deals and option values for Sept 24.

Options:

Sold put with strike of 150 and volume of 30,800
Sold put with strike of 220 and volume of 92,400
Buy put with strike of 175 and volume of 61,600
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800
Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30,800

Total new deal value $(3,552,534)

Value in exercising of deals (liquidations) $3,642,100

Net value to book = $89,566

The reason for the difference in new deal value for LT - NW between the new deal report and the DPR of approx $(2,290,630) was due to the fact that one of the swaps that was entered for the exercised options was incorrect. The correct value was determined by running a minibook and the difference was $(2,290,630) and so the new deal value was adjusted accordingly.
