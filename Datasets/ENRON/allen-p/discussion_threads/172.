Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test 
server environment on Tuesday. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

best regards

Steve Stock
