First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

Lick the Frog.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.

Business Meeting or Missile Command? You Decide.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take it offline! No, it's not a horrible meeting with your boss -
it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?

Souls for Sale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '80s may not have left many good memories, but at least we still
have our Atari machines. What? You sold yours for a set of golf
clubs? Get your soul back, man! Super Breakout is alive and well and
waiting for you on Shockmachine. Now if you can just find that record
player and a Loverboy album...

Playing Arcade Classics on your Shockmachine -- the easiest way to
remember the days when you didn't have to work. If you haven't
already, get your free machine now.
