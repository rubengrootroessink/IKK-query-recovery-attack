Log in to www.enrononline.com and install shockwave using instructions 
below.  I have set up a composite page with western basis and cash prices to 
help you filter through the products.  The title of the composite page is 
Mark's Page.  If you have any problems logging in you can call me at 
(713)853-7041 or Kathy Moore, EnronOnline HelpDesk, 713/853-HELP (4357).


The Shockwave installer can be found within "About EnronOnline" on the home 
page.  After opening "About EnronOnline", using right scroll bar, go to the 
bottom.  Click on "download Shockwave" and follow the directions.  After 
loading Shockwave, shut down and reopen browser (i.e. Microsoft Internet 
Explorer/Netscape).

I hope you will find this site useful.


Sincerely,

Phillip Allen
