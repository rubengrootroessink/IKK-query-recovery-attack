--  WHAT'S NEW ON Y-LIFE  --
Jon Katz's Internet Domain
Will the Net change everything? Might we be overrun by new gadgets
and new technology? Will our lives be ruled by the almighty dot-
com? Will the Net fail? Don't believe the hype: Katz has a simple
guide to surviving the panic.

--  NET RADIO SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-
percent commercial-free. That's right, nothing but the good stuff.
Sorry, Pepsi. Sorry, McDonald's. Sorry, RJ Reynolds...
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70393:8593142

--  INCREDIBLY USEFUL SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: "Always buy a Swiss watch, an American motorcycle, and a
Japanese radio." If that's the kind of buying advice the folks at
the water cooler are giving you, it's time to look elsewhere - like
ConsumerSearch. Whether what you want is as complicated as a car or
computer or as simple as a kitchen knife, you'll find links to
reviews here, distilled so that you can quickly scan for the best
items in each category.

--  PRETTY STRANGE SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Are you a loser? Do you have lots of time on your hands
because no one would socialize with you if your life depended on
it? Do you have incredible powers of concentration for even the
most mundane and boring tasks? Congratulations! You might be the
person with the strength, stamina, and general dorkiness to win the
World Mouseclicking Competition.

--  TODAY'S TIP: ASK THE SURF GURU  --
Today: A reader writes, "Can I update all my Netscape Bookmarks at
the same time? With nearly 500 of them, I don't have time to check
each one individually." Whoa there, Mr. Busy Bee, you don't *have*
to check those bookmarks individually, says the Guru. You can check
them all at once, and you don't even have to download any confusing
programs to do it.
http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?70398:8593142

--  FORWARD/JOKE OF THE DAY  --
Today: It's a surprisingly long list of "I used to be a ____
but... " jokes, the prototype of which being "I used to be a
barber, but I just couldn't cut it." Can you guess what wacky twist
a math teacher would put on that statement? A gardener? A musician?
A person who makes mufflers? There's only one way to find out...

--  THE Y-LIFE WEEKLY MUSIC NEWSLETTER  --
Time is the essence
Time is the season
Time ain't no reason
Got no time to slow
Time everlasting
Time to play b-sides
Time ain't on my side
Time I'll never know
Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong or what's right
I've seen signs of what music journalists Steve Knopper and David
     Grad went through
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
