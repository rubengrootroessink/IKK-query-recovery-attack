Jeff,

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.


Phillip
