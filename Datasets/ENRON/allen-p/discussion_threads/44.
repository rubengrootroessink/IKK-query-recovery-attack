Mac,

I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has 
an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the 
choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier 
service account, but I will have to transfer the money.  

Hopefully this will reach you.

Phillip
