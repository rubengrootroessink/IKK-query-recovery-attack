Lucy,

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

Phillip
