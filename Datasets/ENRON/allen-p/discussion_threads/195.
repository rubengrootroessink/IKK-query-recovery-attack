Lucy,

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late? 


Here is a file for 12/08.
