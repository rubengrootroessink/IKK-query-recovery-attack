Larry,

I was able to scan my 98 & 99 tax returns into Adobe.  Here they are plus the 
excel file is a net worth statement.  If you have any trouble downloading or 
printing these files let me know and I can fax them to you.   Let's talk 
later today.

Phillip

P.S.  Please remember to get Jim Murnan the info. he needs.
