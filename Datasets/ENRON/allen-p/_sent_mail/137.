Lucy,


You wrote fewer checks this month.  Spent more money on Materials and less on 
Labor.

Total Materials  2929  4085  4801

Services  53  581  464

Here are my questions on the August bank statement (attached):

6.  Check 1428    Ralph's   What unit?

7.  Check 1438    Walmart?    Description and unit?
