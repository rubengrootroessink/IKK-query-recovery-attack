Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Phillip
