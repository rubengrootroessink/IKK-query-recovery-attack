Lucy,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

Phillip
