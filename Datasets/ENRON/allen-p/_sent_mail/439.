Jacques,

Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that 
it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents 
need to be
completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer 
and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in 
structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.

Phillip
