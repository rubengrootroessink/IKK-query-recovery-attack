Bob,

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Phillip
