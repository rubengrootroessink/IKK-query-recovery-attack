Got your email.  I will let Jacques know.  I guess we can work out the finer 
points next week.  The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors 
this week, so unfortunately I did not hear from them this week.  The are 
promising to have some feedback by Monday.  I will let you know as soon as I 
hear from them.
