I am sending the Dr. a contract for Monday delivery.  He is offering
$739,000 with $73,900 down.

He wants us to finish the work on the units that are being renovated now.
We need to specify those units in the contract.  We also need to specify the
units that have not been remodeled.  I think he will be a good buyer.  He is
a local with plenty of cash.  Call me after you get this message.
