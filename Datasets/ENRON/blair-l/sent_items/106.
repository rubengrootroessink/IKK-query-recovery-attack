Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Spreadsheet attachment to letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc

Ladies & Gentlemen:

Here is the spreadsheet that Ken plants to attach to his letter to ONEOK re the Fisher Roc lock-up period.  If this causes anyone any heartburn, please let me know ASAP.  
Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon.

Many thanks.

Britt
