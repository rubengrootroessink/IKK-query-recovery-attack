Here's what we have so far on the code to be incorporate into the SCADA Excel Addin.  I'll come up today at 3:00 to discuss it.

1.  NNG CAS operational capacity

select 
 a.nb_poi,
 b.dt_date,
 qt_operational_cap_mcf = sum(a.qt_operational_cap_mcf)

from nngadhoc..cas_poi_oper_cap a,
 nngadhoc..tms_date b

where nb_cmpy = 179
 and nb_poi = 129
 and b.dt_date = convert (char(10), getdate(), 111)
-- and id_poi_role = 'R' ???
 and b.dt_date between dt_effective and dt_termination

group by 
 a.nb_poi,
 b.dt_date


2.  NNG Current month imbalance

3.  NNG Accum. month imbalance
