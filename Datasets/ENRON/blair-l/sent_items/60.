    Shelley, for Saturday's gas day the Socal window was approximately 653,000. We actually scheduled 615,674
    For Sunday's gas day the window started at 707,476 and ended at 645,892.  We actually scheduled 615,618
    Otherwise the weekend was quite.  I'll leave the schedules for Socal on your desk in case you want them.
   Thanks. Lynn
