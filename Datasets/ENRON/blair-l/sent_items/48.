Attatched is our rework of Charlies "Check Valve" reimbursement proposal.
As you can see, we have expanded the scope of this potential agreement to
address several issues and put in place a mechanism to continue to make
progress towards the best gas segregation fix we can come up with in the
Holcomb area.  Please get us your comments and revisions as soon as
possible.  Let me know if you have questions.
