Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of This email.

Thanks Lynn
