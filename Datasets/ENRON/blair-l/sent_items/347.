I wanted to follow up with some responses to your questions in our last meeting.

?	The name of the course is Forward Thinking. 

?	The cost is $300.00 for the facilitator materials and then $35.00 per workbook for each participate.   The facilitator materials are reusable the participate workbook is not.
