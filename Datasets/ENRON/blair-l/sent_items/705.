Lynn, Randy added me to the distrubution.  Do you want to send Roberts mother some flowers?  Sounds like this was a terrible fall.

Thanks, Ricki

Subject:	Update on Robert's Mother

Robert called in.  The surgery went well and his mother is doing fine.  She will be going home in the morning (Wednesday).  The fall shattered the bones in her right wrist and the doctors put a plate in it.  Robert is going to stay at his mom's until Friday.

Robert's mother's information:

LaBerta Benningfield
500 Rowland
Stephenville, Texas 76401
