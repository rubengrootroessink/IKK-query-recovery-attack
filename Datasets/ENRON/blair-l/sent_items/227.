Lynn,
I've also enlisted Mike Rasmuson from Northwest Pipeline to talk about his
pipeline's experiences with the problem.

   Lynn,
   I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that
   you
   could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background
   and
   the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
   understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
   pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
   supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
   experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do
   you
   think?

        Todd, I'll be glad to lead the discussion.  Is this informal or do
   I
   have to
        have a formal presentation?  Thanks. Lynn

      Lynn,
      We lost our discussion leader for the "mismatches during ID2" topic.
      Are
      you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
      important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
      everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but
   all
      of
      the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.
      Thank you,

         Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
      meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
         ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
      Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
         group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
      Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
         email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
      Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
         Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
      cancellation.

         One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
      "mis matches" across interconnecting
         pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
      the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
         if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these
      mismatches.  If you would like
         to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

         Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
      Thanks. Lynn
