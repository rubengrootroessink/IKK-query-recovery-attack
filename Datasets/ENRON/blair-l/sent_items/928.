I have visited with Kenneth and he said that anyone interested could attend so I am passing this on to see if you can make it or if you want someone to attend.     This product will not currently provide SCADA data but Kenneth is going to see if it can be adapted for SCADA along with the PGAS volumes.

I have asked Dan Noack of DataGateway to provide us with a brief presentation and demo of their products.

Location: 3AC - 3rd floor conference room
Date: Friday November 16
Time : 10:00AM - 11:30AM

They currently have two products, NetMeter and NetBalance.  The NetMeter applications looks like it would provide us with a cost effective way of making our PGAS measurement data available to our customers via the web.  NetMeter is a service they provide and our cost is based on the number of meters we post to their system.

They also have a new data validation product which will be released first quarter in 2002.  This product could be used with our PGAS system to perform some automated validation of our volume data.  Dan will be providing an overview of this product as part of this presentation.
