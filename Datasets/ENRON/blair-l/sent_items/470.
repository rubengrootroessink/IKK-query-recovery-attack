Sharon, Gina is taking care of this since Shelley is out of town.  We are very sorry we
missed his name.  I am glad he said something.  Shelley, Richard is one of the NNG/TW
Gas Controllers and was here all weekend of the flood. Thanks. Lynn

Can you help me on this?  I was unaware that they got gift certificates.  Let me know what I need to do to get Richard taken care of.

	Hi Sharon, not to complain..... but I worked the entire weekend in Gas Control during the flood. 

Didn't receive gift certificate the same as the others did.
