	Attached is our first pass at some questions and answers to post to the WEB based on
	discussions at the NNG Winter Ops Meeting.  Please review and let me know if you feel there
	needs to be more "in depth" answers to these questions.    Or are there additional questions
	that you feel need to be added.
