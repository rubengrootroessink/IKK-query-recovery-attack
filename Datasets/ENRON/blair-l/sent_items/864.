I talked to Lavila Lawrence with Duke Energy Field Services, LP. and she advised me that the GPM Dumas Plant (POI 18058) is going to be shutdown effective January 1, 2002.  They will diverting some of the gas to other pipelines and any gas that will be coming to NNG will come through interconnects that David Moon takes care of in the Texas Panhandle.  

She said "They wouldn't have to de-rhime that plant anymore!", which gave me the impression that the cost of maintenance might be the reason for the shutdown.

Any questions, please call.
