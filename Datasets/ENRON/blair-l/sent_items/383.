Subject:	Imbalance Cashout Priors

Kathy/Sherry - as I was looking at the imbalance invoice log this morning, I noticed that IES Utilities has priors totaling $2,036,585.73 for the production months of 11/2000 thru 04/2001 and Owatonna Public Utilities has priors totaling $144,578.68 for the production months of 11/2000 thru 02/2001.  I just wanted to make sure that these were valid before we close priors tomorrow (6/6).  Let me know if these are not valid.

Thanks,

Raetta

Kathy/Sherry - IES also has DDVC invoices for the same months totaling $6,068.55 and Owatonna has DDVC invoices for the same months totaling $160,246.75.
