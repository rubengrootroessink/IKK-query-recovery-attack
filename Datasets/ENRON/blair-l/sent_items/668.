	I definitely think we should let customers know as needed basis.  Someone should certainly
	talk to ENA.  Terry, please work with Jean on this.  

	John and Terry, are there other customers who download our rates?  Thanks. Lynn

When the descrepancy between our rates posted on the website and entered in our system was discovered, did we notify any of our customers that this had occurred.  ENA loads our rates into their system.  They should probably know if they need to re-load them for September 1.

What do you think?
