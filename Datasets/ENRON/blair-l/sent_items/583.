FYI--I visited with Galen Friday pm and he is planning on returnning this Thursday & Friday for a half day.  Next week, he will probably work half-days Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri.  Then we'll go from there!  His half-days will be catching the last bus from his area in the morning, and leaving on the first one back home.  He will be going down to the health center over lunch to rest.  Also, he's in a brace from his armpits to his hips which he says is extremely hot.  We're ready to welcome him back, but go easy on him!
