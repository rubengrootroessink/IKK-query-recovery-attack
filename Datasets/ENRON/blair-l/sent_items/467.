Effective Gas Day July 1, 2001, the Richland Center Master Meter will be put in-service and downsteam TBS' (identified below) will be measured at this new meter.

In a conversation with Lenny Klaas (Platteville Team), it was agreed the volumes associated with the amount of gas in the pipe between the master meter and all the town border stations downstream will be calculated at 9:00 A.M. on July 1, 2001.  Lenny will also contact Gas Control in Houston.

Once identified, I will provide these volumes to Market Services to be billed manually to Wisconsin Gas.  I have phoned and provided John Couillard of Wisconsin Gas a written explanation as to what to expect from measurement and billing.
