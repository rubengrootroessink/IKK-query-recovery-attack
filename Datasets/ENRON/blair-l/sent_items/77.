	Shelley, attached is the first draft for the plan to talk with the reps for all three pipes on Wednesday.
	This will be a two phase approach.  We (Sheila, Fran and I) will talk with the teams on Wednesday
	reviewing a high level plan.  Then we will put the teams into groups to talk about 5 topics we picked
	from the NNG meeting. Then we will follow up with Donna to develop a training plan.

	Fran and I are meeting again tomorrow (Tuesday) at 3:30 if you want to join us or
	have comments.  


			 

	Thanks. Lynn
