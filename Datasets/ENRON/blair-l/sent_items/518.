	Julia, Thursday sounds great.  We can leave as early as 11:00 a.m. since Steve is
	catching a plane to Minneapolis that afternoon.  Just let us know where and when.
	We look forward to seeing you guys Thursday.  Have a good week.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn & Steve,
   How about next Thursday for lunch?  If that day works, we will call you
Thursday morning about where and when (obviously, we retirees have a pretty
tight schedule).
   It'll be great to see you.  Look forwarding to getting caught up!
   Take care,
       Julia & dave
