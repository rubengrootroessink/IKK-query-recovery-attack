	Jodie and Raetta, I am giving a presentation to Measurement to review Gas Logistic's
	functions and interactions with other departments.  I would like for both of you to
	attend this meeting if possible.

	The meeting will be November 14, 2001 at 1:00 p.m. 

	Gary, I am assuming you are getting a room in the Three Allen Center?  Please let me
	know if you would like to get a room in the Enron Building.  Thanks. Lynn
