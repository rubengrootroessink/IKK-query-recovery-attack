	Mike, very valid concern.  Do we need to re-look at our procedure?	  Thanks. Lynn

Gerry, 
This past weekend, specfically September 3rd,  storage injections during the ID2 process were allocated by approximately 130,000 MMBtu. The net storage injections at the end of the allocation was approximately 600,000 MMBtu. However, during the confirmation process certain deliveries, sourced with PNR withdrawals, were not confirmed by the downstream parties. The confirmation process resulted in cuts to PNR withdrawals that allowed net storage injections to be scheduled in excess of the 600,000 MMBtu capacity. The pipeline was able to absorb the extra gas this weekend but in the future NNG may not be as fortunate. 

Is there some way for the system to send out a notice whenever, after all the dust settles and the entire cycle is completed, the net scheduled storage activity exceeds storage capacity by a significant quantity? 

When you get a minute ...lets discuss.
