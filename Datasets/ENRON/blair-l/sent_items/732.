I don't this we give our customers lockbox instructions any longer.  Invoices cite wire instructions and physical address.  Raetta please confirm.

Lockbox should still stay bank of america.  I  am working with Treasury to make sure that these accounts stay open for the next 10 days.

Rod,

Attached are revised wire transfer instructions for company 60 and 179

Companies 62 and 370 should remain unchanged

Thanks
