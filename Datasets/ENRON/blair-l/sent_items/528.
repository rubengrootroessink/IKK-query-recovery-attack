Raetta - Could you please forward this to everyone in market services?
Rosemary - Could you please forward this to everyone in Marketing?

As you may already know, on July 10, NNG again filed with FERC to update our fuel rates in line with our annual PRA
(docket RP01-395).  We filed the same rates that were set up for June 1, then pulled when FERC suspended them for 5 months, pending a Technical Conference.  The new filing asks for the rates to be effective August 1 and has requested FERC approval by July 27 to facilitate early nominations for August business.  After discussing the rate changes with our customers, we are hopeful that the latest filing will be approved.

I do not expect to update the Rate Matrix on the EBB or to load the rates into the system until we receive FERC approval.
The next FERC meeting is Wednesday, July 25.  

If customers want to see the proposed rates, they can consult our Tariff, sheets 54 (fuel & UAF), 54A (exception points), and 61-64 (transport fuel) on the EBB under "Proposed" with Effective Date "August 1, 2001".
