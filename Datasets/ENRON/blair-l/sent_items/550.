Brad, thanks for the info.  Also should John Dushinske be invited to this meeting?  He is the
Vice President over the North End Generation load and new services.  Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn and Rick:  

In conjunction with getting formal approval for the Rates & Revenue system, we are soliciting "buy-in" from the Marketing group.  It is important for them to understand the project plan, the initial functionality and the level of Marketing personnel commitment for use case writing and testing.  Shelley requested that this topic be discussed along with  the following:  

Morning meeting structure and content
Deal Capture
Web Site posting procedures

The marketing attendees would be Jo Williams, Kent Miller, Bill Fowler and Dave Nuebauer.  As soon as Shelley discusses this with Dave, I will move forward to set up the meeting (in Omaha).     We will need to meet prior to the meeting to discuss structure, content and attendees.  

Brad
