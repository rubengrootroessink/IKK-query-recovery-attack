	Ava, I am on vacation those days, so it would probably be OK.  But before we decide, let me know
	who would be here to cover for you during that time.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, I would like to take vacation days on November 20th, 21st and 26th.  I realize it's the holiday and am not sure if the requested is possible if not that is fine.

Thanks,
Ava
