Subject:	June billing for May Production

Due to the manual billing required with Phase IV, we will delay the billing process
by one day.  We will mail out May Reservation invoices on June 1 instead of
May 31, 2001.

The team will track the time it takes to accomplish billing for May.  After that time we 
will deterime how June production will be billed. 

If you have any questions, please let Hilda or I know.  Thanks. Lynn
