Steve,

Our first thought on this was to make it a volumetric agreement.  But now, we are re-thinking that we would like to have a dollar-valued OBA with daily cash out.  Guardian wanted a copy of our agreement today, but since we plan to re-draft, I've told them that it will be a couple of weeks before they get a draft from us.  So, please disregard this and I'll be sending you a new OBA draft sometime within the next week or two.  Thanks!


Janet

How come this isn't cashed out at each month's end? sj

Steve and Gary,

Attached is the standard volumetric OBA agreement that NNG normally uses.  However, we have made some changes to it in paragraph #7 - Other provisions - in an attempt to tighten it up a bit.  Please let me know ASAP if you have any problems with the language.  Thanks!

Janet
