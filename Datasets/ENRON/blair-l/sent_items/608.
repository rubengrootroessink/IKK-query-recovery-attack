If you have anything you would like for me to include in the packet I will be sending to Shelley, please let me know.  Also, I will be leaving at 3:00 today for a doctors appointment.
 
Thank you,
Ricki

Ricki,
 
Could you please send a package to my house this afternoon of the weekly reports, the gas dailys for the week and any other mail that I can catch up on the weekend.
