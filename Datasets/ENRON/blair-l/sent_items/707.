Lynn,

This does cause me a good deal of concern.  Kathy does not know that much of what I do and we do not share customers as Harry & I have done.  She is also new again to scheduling, so all those facets of my performance would be missing.  I might add that at midyear Harry was also unavailable for my review, and yet because of our close proximity, he knows better than anyone on the team how I spend my days.  At the end of the day, none of this may matter, but it is a concern today.

Thank you for your consideration.

Janet

	Janet, I had to change from Harry to Kathy Sturr on one of your reviewers.  Please let me know
	if you have any concerns.  Thanks. Lynn
