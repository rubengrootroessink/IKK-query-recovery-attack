	I think there intent was to be very general.  You have the right sheet.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, that tariff sheet is just one small paragraph and makes a pretty general statement re: Off-System Services so maybe I don't have the latest sheet yet (or that was their intent to be pretty general) - my sheet is dated August 1, 2001.

Thanks,

Raetta
