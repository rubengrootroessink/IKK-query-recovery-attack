No, you are correct. In my haste to get something out to everyone I misstated the concensus of the group. Storage allocations will be the final process in the Timely cycle only.
Thanks for clarifying the point.

We understood that the allocation would be the final process only for the Timely cycle.  
Did we misunderstand?

Thanks.
Reyna

Subject:	Changes to Storage allocation and SBS

To summarize the outcome of the meeting this morning....
In the short term:
Storage allocations will continue to be the final process performed during the Timely and Evening cycles
Storage allocations will be before the Confirmation process for the Non-Grid, IntraDay1 and IntraDay 2 cycles / SBS will not be available during the Confirmation process for these cycles 
The changes will be made effective for the gad day of July 6th

For the longer term
Continue the above 
Make modifications to the storage allocatons program to allow SBS availability for storage activity which is the opposite to the activity being allocated (i.e., SBS storage withdrawals when storage injections are being allocated)
