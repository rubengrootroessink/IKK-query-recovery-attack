Lynn,
Remedy has been updated to give home office workers a high priority and to be assigned to Glenn or Robert when possible.

Glenn did install a modem in Shirley's machine.

There is still some issue with the CITRIX Server and VPN access, the solution center believes the problem is on the Road Runner side and Jean McFarland is working on it. Everyone is working from home with little to no problems despite the CITRIX issue. 

John Buchanan

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.
