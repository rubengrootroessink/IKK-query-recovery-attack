	Robert, I would like to give all four tickets to Cynthia for this round since
	you will be spending time with Duke next week at the Winter Ops meeting.
	Will catch you on the next round.
	Cynthia come by and get the tickets.  Thanks. Lynn

	OK, here is what I have:
		For Wednesday, September 12 - Cynthia and Renee (NGPL) (2 tickets)
		For Wednesday, September 12 - Robert and Duke (2 tickets)
		For Thursday, September 13 - Bert and Texaco (4 tickets)

	Cynthia I am assuming you only wanted 2 tickets.  If that is not correct let me
	know and we can give one of you the 12th and the other a later game.

	Thanks. Lynn
