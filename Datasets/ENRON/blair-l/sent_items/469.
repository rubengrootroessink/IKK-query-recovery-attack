Keith here are some of the points I observed that were off rate for July 1st. gas day.

                                           Order          24 avg flow
GPM Linam Ranch       55.8                  82.3           +26.5
Shell Tippett                   43.8                  47.0                3.2
Plymouth                          17.0                  29.4              12.4
CRA Mertzon                   38.2                 47.7                 9.5
                                                                        TOTAL      +51.6        

Mitchell had a 46.5 schedule to us but average 19.8 due to not noticing that they had a schedule to us until 5:00 PM.  that after noon. As you know one of your responsibilities is to monitor ALL  points and make calls to stations that are not on rate and notify scheduling so they can make their calls. Cunningham was on Peak Alert all weekend and we were calling for MAX Injection, Redfield was suppose to be on 50,000 inj. for the weekend but was brought up to 200,000 inj. due to too much gas on the system.  My observation is that if calls would have been made on these points that are long to us it would have helped our situation. I would suggest that you pay close attention all orders for every cycle so that you do not miss a change and to continually review flows vs. orders through out the day.
