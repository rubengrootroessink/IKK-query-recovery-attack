	Mary and Dari, here is my answer.  Are you comfortable with it
	before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. Lynn

	Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1
	         cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.
	         Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the
		   operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter
	         a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at
		   total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines
		   if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference
		   between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  

	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
	Lynn Blair (713-853-7637).

Lynn, Steve,

When Gary post the SOL or SUL this verbiage goes along with the critical notice:

DDVC penalties are applicable to the bumped shipper's quantity.  

Who needs to answer her question?
