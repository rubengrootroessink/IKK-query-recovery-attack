Becky, yes I got a note as well.  I was very impressed he took the time
to acknowledge this situation to us.  Hope all is well for you.  I enjoyed
the opportunity to work with you on Mauro's trip.  Take care.  Lynn

Hi, Lynn - Did you get a copy of this from Mauro?  I thought it was very touching.

Dear Rebecca,
that sorrow tragedy, those coward attacks are beyond any expression of sadness and reproach.
I do believe that those who are responsible for the cowardly attacks be soon discovered and punished.
I also feel that in these times there is at stake the fundamental issue of Liberty, for all of us.
Just before coming to visit you I took part to a conference in Dallas, where Chairman WiIlliams of RCC gave a speech. 
It occurs to me recalling his words to the audience, at the end of his speech
God Bless America, and God Bless You
Mauro Formaggio
