	Shelley, I talked with Kent Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group sends 
	storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes.  They do NOT send anything to
	AGA.  But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information from EIA
	so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers.  As a reminder
	this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up with Kent.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
