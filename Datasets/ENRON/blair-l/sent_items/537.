	Shelley, the DCC (downstream capacity constraint) code was to acknowledge that the downstream is the 
	constraint vs our pipeline being the constraint.  We are working with Tammy and Donna to come up with existing codes to
	use for Needles and Nigas.  Thanks. Lynn

I know this has to do with Needles, but I don't understand the DCC cut code -- could you give me a quick explanation?

The new cut code went into production on the evening of the 17th of July, along with the rest of the migration. The reason being, is that it was already written 
into the script and tested. When we found out that there were issue surrounding the new code, it was to late to take out of the script and re-test. So in the
mean time, I have sent a memo to the teams informing them not to use the new code. The new code will not be pulled out of the system until the next migration, which is slated for September 1st time frame. If you have any questions, please ask me. Thank you.
