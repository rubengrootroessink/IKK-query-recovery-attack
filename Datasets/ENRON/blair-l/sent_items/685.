	OK, here is what I have:
		For Wednesday, September 12 - Cynthia and Renee (NGPL) (2 tickets)
		For Wednesday, September 12 - Robert and Duke (2 tickets)
		For Thursday, September 13 - Bert and Texaco (4 tickets)

	Cynthia I am assuming you only wanted 2 tickets.  If that is not correct let me
	know and we can give one of you the 12th and the other a later game.

	Thanks. Lynn
