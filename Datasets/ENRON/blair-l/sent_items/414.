I wanted to say I really enjoyed our visit as well.  It has been a long time since I have set
down and just visited with friends.  Jane, thanks for taking the intiative to make this happen.
I agree, we need to do this again.  Tell Amanda, Seth and Kirby "hi" for me.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn and Jane,

I really enjoyed our visit last night.  Thanks so much for taking the time to come see us and meet Seth.  Amanda woke up talking about you both!

Thanks again and let's get together...soon!

Gina
