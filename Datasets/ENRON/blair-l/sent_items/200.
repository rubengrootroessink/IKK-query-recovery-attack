Shelley's Monday and Wednesday staff meetings have been relocated to ECN42C2 thru December.  On Wednesday October 10th we have invited Jean McFarland to discuss various brands of handheld communication devices from 9:00 until 10:00AM.

Please forward this memo to individuals that you feel may benefit from learning more about standard cost effective communication tools that Enron supports.

Thank you, Ricki
