Linda Brooks just telephoned in response to our questions regarding the lack of injection activity on the above contract as mentioned in the Gas Control Meeting this morning.  She said Kurt Batenhorst didn't realize this contract was still out there, and they will begin injecting on the 7th.

Any questions, please advise -- ext. 3-3063 -- thanks.
