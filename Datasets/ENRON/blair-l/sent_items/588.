Lynn and Steve,
 I think you can answer this question below on the posting. The question is when to post.
Can you get back to us & let us know?

Thanks Ramona

Ramona,

I sent her the approximate times the TW cycles are completed last week (below).  The issue she is having now is when to post.

1.  After the cycle is complete   or
2.  After confirmations are available. 

Today we currently generate a new posting for Operationally Available every 15 minutes to keep it constantly updated. But if we go to 4 times daily, when does she set the time to generate and post?  I'm probably not the one to answer this.  Someone needs to make the call which of the two times would be correct one to post.  Another issue is when we have system problems and the time gets thrown off and it has a set time to run, wouldn't this skew the available capacity numbers?


This was my e-mail to Jeanie last week..........


They are generally set times, but there are times when we are having (TMS) system problems that the times have to be pushed up. But as a general rule the times that TMS cycles run are:  (This is for TW)
Evening Cycle: Runs at approximately 6:00 -  6:30 p.m and confirmations run at approximately 9:00p.m.
Non Grid: Runs at approximately 8:00 - 8:30 a.m. 
Intraday 1: Runs at approximately 10:00 - 10:30a.m. confirmations run at approximately 1:00p.m.
Intraday 2:  Runs at approximately 5:00 - 5:30 p.m. confirmations run at approximately 8:00p.m.
Timely:  Runs at approximately 11:30 a.m  - 12:05 p.m. confirmations run at approximately 3:30p.m.

Toby,
Have you already covered this issue below from Jeanne. I am thinking that you and Mary and Marketing might have already discussed. If so, can you respond back to Tina & Jeanne.

If you do not know, can we meet & discuss so we can get them an answer by Tuesday.
Thanks Ramona

Ramona,
Operational and Design Capacity Postings to the Internet and thru EDI is already implemented in Production and to my knowledge does not have any issues that I am aware of in regards to the schedules. 

The schedule for posting that I am referring to is for Unsubscribed Capacity. The meetings that were held with regards to Unsubscribed Capacity included what to post, for how long and and the frequency of the postings. Today, Perry maintains and updates his Excel spreadsheet and the Internet team posts the Unsubscribed capacity every hour. In one of our meetings, it was decided that we would post 4 times a day with the automated feature rather than every hour. From that I am trying to determine the times so that I can create an automated schedule to have this data available. The schedule really only applies to the Internet postings. EDI's schedule is when the customer sends in a request for data.  If you can coordinate and finalize this schedule while Dale is out, it will help us move forward. If you have any other questions, please call me as Tina is also out of the office until Tuesday.
Thanks,
Jeanne

Jeanne, 
Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to help follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cycle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is different on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocation is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule volumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confirms. 

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting Unsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operational available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after each cycle. 
Please let me know.
Thanks Ramona

Jeanne,

Unless there is any other comment we should post after the confirmations are complete,  even if the noms are late.

I will be out of the office the week of 7/30 so please send your comments or question to Bradley Holmes or Ramona Betancourt.

Thanks 
Dale Ratliff

Dale,
I need to know what is the schedule for the posting of the Unsubscribed. These are the times the cycles run. Do we run when these are complete? Should we post based on the confirmation time? Do we follow these times even if Noms is late?

Thanks,
Jeanne
