	Could we possibly make it at  2:00 on Tuesday?  That would work better for me.  Thanks. Lynn

Please check your calendars for your availability for a conference call with Virginia Power on the Demarc allocation process.  I am shooting for 1:30 PM Central on Tuesday, Nov 6.  Please let me know if you are available and I will then firm it up with VPEM.

Thanks!
