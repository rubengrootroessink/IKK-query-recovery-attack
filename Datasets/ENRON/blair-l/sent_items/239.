	Ava, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?  Looks like I am going
	unless cost is ridiculous.  Attached is the hotel I would stay in for Wed. night
	and possibly Thursday night, depending on what you find out with flights.
	Let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Lynn, here is the link to the Embassy Suites in Downey.  This should provide you with all the information.  
Also, could you please call Joyce Lloyd at (213) 244-3717 or email her at jlloyd@socalgas.com. to confirm your attendance for Thursday's meeting.
Thanks, Pat
