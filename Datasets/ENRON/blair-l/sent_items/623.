Subject:	Vacation....

Hey guys....I need to take vacation on August 23rd & 24th. I will be taking, what's become, my semi-annual pilgrimage to Aggieland. I'll be moving Daughter No. 2 into her new swingin' college apartment. 

If all goes right I can get everything transported and moved in on Thursday....which will give my body three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday to recover from the ordeal.  

Any problems?
