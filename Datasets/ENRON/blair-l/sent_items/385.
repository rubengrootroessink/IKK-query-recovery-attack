Larry and raetta, cand we make sure we do not bill for the vented gas.  Can we work with measurement and redcue
the actuals by the 8,000 to 10,000?  Steve, does anyone have the exact volume vented?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, how would we handle this Accounting wise? Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not. We need to get this situation stopped. They should blow gas upstream of the meter.  Gary, can you check with Bandel and get an approximate volume that has been vented? Richard, great job in bringing this to our attention. sj

Subject:	Warren Eunice

It was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.
