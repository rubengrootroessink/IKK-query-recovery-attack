	Kent and Dave, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting.  High level
	recap is:


		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day
		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to
					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from
					the previous day)

		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance
					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we
					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked
					to be pretty evenly distributed)

		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.
		_______
		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combination
					operational adjustments.

	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please let me
	know.  Thanks. Lynn

THanks Terry,

We still need to look into what the source of the huge daily unanticipated swing numbers for the past 3 days.  Is this related to some of our scheduling difficulties with BP Amoco into El Paso or is it spread across our LDC shippers in the Market Area?

The storage numbers on the 8 am morning report were the correct numbers but the numbers being referenced to on (Sum Sheet Report) this morning had an error causing the unanticipated swing number be much larger than anticipated. It has been corrected and is now within 2 thousand of the 8 am report. The unanticipated swing number for the two previous days still stands as shown on the sum sheet report. If you have any further questions, feel free to give me a call at, 3-6403. Thank you.
