    John is out of the office until Wednesday.  He sent me this list
    of topics he caught in the second break out session.  Thought I
    would go ahead and pass them on to you.  Thanks. Lynn

2. Improve how soon we post system problems and include EDI customers.
3. Storage allocation should show injection or withdraw allocation in the Batch Schedule Status screen.
4. Provide Scheduled Quantities reports by date range in a format for downloading in to Access database. 
5. GAS in Place is a moving capacity target, needs to be a 24hr number.
6. Cut notice should include the cut code.
7. Previous cycle cut codes do not show up on the final report.
8. Improve phone coverage from 7:30am until noon by CSR.
9. 8am Gas Control meeting interfeers with phone coverage, we should make sure to minimize how many reps. attend the meeting so phones are covered. Customers like assigned CSR.
