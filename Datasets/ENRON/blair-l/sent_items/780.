        FYI.  Just to let you know, Shelley is trying to minimize emails she gets to preserve space on her
        Blackberry.  But wanted to keep you in the loop in case you needed to send her something.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject: Shelley Corman - Out of the office email address


Shelley requested that I send an email asking that you send all email correspondence to her Compuserve email account while she is out of the office for the next couple of weeks.  Accessing her Compuserve account is much easier and faster than accessing mail.enron.com.
 
The address is:
cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com>
 
Please forward on to your team as you see fit.  If you have any questions please call me on my cell phone at 713-859-6238.
 
Thanks, 
Jean
