 Kermit Turbine station and KB-line outage has been scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11th. We are planning for a 24 hour outage and it will be posted as a 24 hour shut-in, but if everything goes as planned operations could possibly be ready to go back in-service after 12 to 14 hours. The 30" KB-line mainline block valve 7 miles north of Kermit will be shut and line blown down. This will not affect the El Paso Keystone interconnect.  Based on current flows in the Kermit to Gomez subsystem  it would affect about 375,000 MMBTU.in deliveries and 25,000 mmbtu in receipts ( Sid Richardson)

The following points will be shut-in during this time:

          POI.
  62873 - Sid Richardson rec.
  60749- TW Halley del.
  36175- Valero Ward del.
  152 -Westar Reeves del.
   2230- Coronado
  164- Norval
  57100- El Paso Waha
  62148- Oasis

 Please give  me a call if you have any questions.

Gary
