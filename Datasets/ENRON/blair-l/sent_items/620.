	In talking with Delaine today, the date has changed for Oneok to come to Houston.
	They are now looking at August 27 or 28th.  

	Mary, does that work for you at all?

	Is everyone in the office those two days? 

	I will be in the office Monday morning, August 6, so let me know and then I will
	coordinate with Delaine.

	Thanks. Lynn
