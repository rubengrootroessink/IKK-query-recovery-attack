	On TW, TW allocated SoCal on the ID2 cycle for Sunday's gas day, due to SoCal non performance.
	We cut about 27,000 mmbtu.

	The Sequel 2000 conversion on the reports went well.  Brad's team was here to help Sunday morning
	and I believe that made things go smoother.  There were a few isolated situations which were turned
	around quickly.  

	Otherwise it was quiet on the pipes.  
	
	Thanks. Lynn
