	Donna, did you and Shelley have any more discussion on the move and getting a letter
	to the reps?  I would like to send something out to them.  There are a lot of questions.
	Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Archive Boxes

Just wanted to let everyone know that I have ordered 50 boxes that are to be used to send any old files to the Record Center.  When you get ready to use these, please let me know because there are numbered stickers for each box that I will also need to give you along with directions on how the transmittal sheets are to be typed up.  If you have any questions, please don't hestitate to ask me as we want to make sure that we have followed the Record Center procedures correctly.

Thanks,

Raetta
