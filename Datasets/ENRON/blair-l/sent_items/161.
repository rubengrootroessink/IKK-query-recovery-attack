Subject: Robert Bryan


 
Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequently, his last day with us will be today.
 
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start working for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two familiar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
 
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had asked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finalized on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was unable to communicate Robert's decision until now.  
 
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the loss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.
