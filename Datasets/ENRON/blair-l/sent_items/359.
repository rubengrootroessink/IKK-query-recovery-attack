I appreciate your input.  All the other teams voted for meeting at 2:00 p.m in the afternoon.  So that is probably
what we will go with.  Thanks.  Lynn

Per the conservation in the team leader meeting yesterday, the Omaha/Minneapolis Team would recommend that Estalee and Shelley be in attendance and the meeting be held during the lunch hour.  If you have any questions let us know.  Thanks

Randy
