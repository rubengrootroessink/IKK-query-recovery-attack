Shelley, FYI.  Just to let you know our practice.  John and/or Terry issue procedures
in the attached format for any new service NNG or TW provides.  They also meet with the
teams to review the procedures and make sure all parties are up to speed.  If you have
any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn
