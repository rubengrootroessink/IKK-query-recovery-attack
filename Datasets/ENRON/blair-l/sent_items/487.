	Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on
	an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without
	a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled 
	volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.  
	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly
	would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters
	as we go through the billing process.  
	Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn
