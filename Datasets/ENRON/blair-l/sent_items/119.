The conference call to go over the Demarc Allocation has been scheduled for 2:30 Central time on Thursday, October 4th.  Please let me know ASAP if you cannot attend.

Lynn, 

Greg will be very interested in how Trailblazer is affected by the Demarc allocation.  We need to get together for a prep meeting prior to Thursday, 10/4.  Let me know when you are available for this.

Thanks!
