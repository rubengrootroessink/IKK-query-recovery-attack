	The "CMS Approvers" in Omaha (Kent, Dave, Mary Kay, Dari, etc.) will be migrated to Outlook sometime this week.  It is very important that if you have any deals that are routing or that will route before Thursday (7/19), that you notify Linda Trevino (x3-5413) immediately.  Any deals that are started, and need routing approvals, will need to be completed the same day or they will have to be killed and re-routed when the Outlook migration has been completed.  Please forward this to anyone in your region that works in the CMS system.  Thanks!

Craig
