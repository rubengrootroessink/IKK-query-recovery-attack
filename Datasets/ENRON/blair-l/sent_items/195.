	Ava, please get Jo and I some dates for giving the Marketers a "Brown Bag" training
	session on Nomination, Confirmation and Scheduling process.  
	I would like to use the video Room on 42 in Houston and 6th floor in Omaha.

	I would like to look at the week of October 15th.  

	The session could be a brown bag from 11:30 to 1:00.

	John Buchanan and I can give the presentation since Terry will be out that week.

	Thanks. Lynn
