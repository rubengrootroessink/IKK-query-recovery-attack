Diana is very much a team player and ensures all the team members' accounts are
billed accurately each month.   Diana is a very positive influence on her team.
She is the first one to bring resolution to the table on any reconciliation that needs to be done
on team issues as well as business issues.

Accomplishments -  Diana was nominated and selected for the Chairman's Award.

Alma, hopefully this helps.  Thanks. Lynn

Ava,
Note about Diana for the 25 Yr Banquet:
Diana never meets a stranger and you can find Diana almost every weekend ministering to people, whether in prison, on the streets of Houston or down at the Mardi Gras in Galveston.  Always willing and able to help others.
