Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

Randy Janzen
