Subject:	Coverage for the next 6 months

	
	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage
	by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs.

	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.

		Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team.

		John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

		Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame

	Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.

	Thanks. Lynn
