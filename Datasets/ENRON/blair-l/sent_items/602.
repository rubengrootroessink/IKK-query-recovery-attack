    Maria, I wanted to follow up after discussions with you and Shelley, th=
e SoCal window is based on what SoCal=20
    is willing to confirm into their system for the day.  It does not neces=
sarily have anything to do with physical capacity at Needles.
    If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks.  Lynn

Looks ok to me, but make sure that Shelley also reviews as her group deals =
with the windowing issue.  =20

I'll defer to you guys on getting the specific words right, but it would be=
 great if we can get something like this.  Steve Harris needs to take a clo=
se look to make sure we are describing the windowing impacts correctly.  La=
wyers:  will a letter from Sid be admissable evidence under FERC evidence r=
ules?  We may need to ask them to have Scott sign it instead of their lawye=
r to assure admissability.  DF

Richardson has agreed to send us an additional writing regarding the other =
justifications for the volumetric negotiated rate.   Joe Koury asked me to =
email the insert to the letter.   Koury told me that he would reference the=
 July 26 order and the fact that the Commission has requested additional in=
formation as to why the shipper entered into the subject negotiated rate tr=
ansaction, with Scott Walker stating that in reviewing his previous respons=
es he would clarify by adding the following: =20


Insert: =20
 =20
Richardson Products proposed to share in a rate based on a daily spread as =
a volumetric rate because under that rate arrangement if the gas did not fl=
ow, Richardson was not obligated to pay Transwestern the rate.  Richardson =
desired to avoid the risk, under normal demand service, of having to pay th=
e rate if the gas did not flow.   The issue of whether the gas would flow w=
as a very real one at the California border (Needles delivery point) given =
the manner in which SoCalGas, the downstream party, confirms volumes for de=
livery with Transwestern.   Specifically, SoCalGas has a windowing procedur=
e whereby it limits the amount of gas that Transwestern can deliver into Ne=
edles based on SoCalGas' allocation procedures and the amount of available =
takeaway capacity at the delivery point. [True?]  Simply stated, if SoCalGa=
s did not confirm Richardson's nomination at the Needles delivery point, th=
e gas would not flow.    The negotiated rate, as opposed to the rate for no=
rmal demand service, allowed Richardson to avoid the risks associated with =
Richardson's gas not flowing due to SoCalGas's windowing procedure.  =20

 Pls. review and comment asap.   I promised Joe K.  I would get it to him t=
onight or first thing tomorrow because he will be out all next week and agr=
eed to take care of this matter this week.  Thanks, Maria
