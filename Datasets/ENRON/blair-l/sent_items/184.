Pipeline Interconnect Forum Participants:

We are pleased to inform you that the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf has agreed
to extend our discounted rate of $199 for the following days:
Friday, October 19
Saturday, October 20
Sunday, October 21
Monday, October 22

As well, the reservation cut-off has been extended until October 18.

We hope this helps people who are either coming in early to enjoy the sights
of San Francisco or those who don't want to take the red-eye flight home on
Monday night.  We are excited about seeing everyone.
