	Raetta or Larry, do either one of you have the SMS chart on line?  I only have a
	hard copy.  If you could help Courtney out, I would appreciate it.  I will be in Omaha
	tomorrow and back in the office Wednesday.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,
I am working on a presentation for Dave Neubauer and I am needing an example of a SMS chart to include in the power point presentation.  Do you have a chart that you could e-mail to me, so that I could include it in the presentation. It doesn't matter which of the 4 charts you send. Thanks!
