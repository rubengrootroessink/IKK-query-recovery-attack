	I know a lot of work has gone into this effort and I really appreciate
	all the creative thinking some of you have done to accomplish our
	new report.  Dale and John, would you please work together to
	get the accounting support team to meet with us and to
	talk to someone about the long-term implementation of this project.
	Thanks. Lynn

Looks like we are on track to resolve all outstanding requirements except the prior month imbalance.  The data we need is not currently available by point, only contract.  Perhaps a meeting with IT Accounting Support would be the best next step.  Also, it would be nice to turn over the code we have to someone in IT for long-term implementation.  Lynn what are your thoughts?
