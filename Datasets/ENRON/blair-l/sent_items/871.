Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "wish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.
