Lynn and Steve,
How hard would it be for someone in the logistics group to develop and distribute weekly a report on all of the NNG interconnects and the imbalances of all of the ones that we receive a report of the noms from scheduling.  I am talking about a report like TW gets from Richard Hanagriff that gives all of the imbalances.   This would help Gas Control to keep a better idea of where we are with the other companies.  I have had other gas controllers ask me this same question.  Thank you both for your time and trouble in looking into this for us.

                                              Sincerely,

                                               Margaret Hall
