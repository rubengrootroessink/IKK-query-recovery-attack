Lynn--
  Today during the team leader meeting you mentioned setting up a meeting with the Solution Center for next Tuesday. I realized
later that I was planning to comp next Tuesday because I am working this coming weekend. Possibly they might be short-staffed
next week with it being Thanksgiving week. Could we schedule with them for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving?

                                          Thanks-
                                                 Shirley
