Lynn,
It looks like the mouse pads are kind of expensive, what do you think?

John, per your request price for front and back lamination is .70 cents for color copy and $20/ 1 hr. for lamination which is 50 copies per hour.
I was not able to get an exact price on mouse pad however I was given an estimate of $15 to $20 depending on amount ordered.  I have left a message for Karen in graphics and am waiting for reply.

Thanks,
Ava
