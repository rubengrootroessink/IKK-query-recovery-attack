Beverly, thank you so much for your help this weekend and your offer to come into the office.  Between you, Amy and Terry
we got through the weekend without a glitch on our side (even though we had system problems).  Tracy, I understand all is
OK at your house.  I am glad to hear.  Cynthia, I understand you had some damage.  Please let us know if we can help in any
way.  Linda and Bert, were you guys OK?  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Weekend Flooding

Since most of Houston is underwater and the Weather services is anticipate more rain today, Tracy and I have decided that I  will be working the late shift tonight.  Tracy's street is flooded and she doesn't know if she can get out of the subdivision.  She and I will talk later to see if it is necessary for me to work Sunday night.

Will keep you posted.  Amy, if you need any help, please call me.

Thanks,
Beverly
