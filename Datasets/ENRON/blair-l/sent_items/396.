Karen has a real phobia about spiders.  One time Karen and I and three of our team members went out to lunch.  As we were leaving the restaurant, Karen was sitting in the back seat.  I started backing the car out of the parking lot when Karen screamed.  Thought I had hit someone.  I looked back and Karen was climbing on top of Anita and Bill trying to get in the back window.  She had spotted a spider that had dropped down on a drag line.  That's when we decided to help Karen get over her phobia.  We started planting little plastic spiders in all her file folders and desk drawers.  So for the next couple years we would hear Karens little scream when she would run across our little surprise.  Think we helped her get over her phobia.  I'm sure when she sees a spider now she probably remembers her old teammates.

Karen is the official Food Monitor for the team.  She tracks the fat grams and caloric intake for those of us who can't count but love to eat.  We are always excited when she is gone on vacation because we don't have to hide our food.

Karen has done an excellent job of handling one of our most difficult interconnecting pipelines.  The customers love Karen's positive attitude and great sense of humor.

Karen carries a contagious disease called "A love of life" with an upbeat, positive attitude and an infectious giggle that surrounds our team.
