I know this is trivial, but, I don't believe we can actually settle on a .5 MMBtu and enter a fractional volume into GVA or TAS.   I would suggest using 8,625.

        Dari, Harry and I have run through the numbers and how we will show the difference on the 
        books and agree with your number. Thanks. Lynn

Dari, 

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.
