Ladies,

The Holiday Shopping Card is a wonderful holiday tradition.  The card entitles the holder to a 20% discount from November 1-November 11 at a range of stores throughout town such as Berings, Macy's, Events, Harold Powell, Banana Republic, Tootsies, JoAnn's, Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Richards Liquors, Children's Collection, Talbots Kids, Zainy Brainy and many, many more.

The cards are available for $60.  The entire $60 goes to the American Cancer Society and is tax-deductible.   Checks and credit cards are accepted.

Please contact Kimberly Nelson at x33580 if you'd like to purchase a Holiday Card and start your holiday shopping early and benefit a great cause at the same time.
