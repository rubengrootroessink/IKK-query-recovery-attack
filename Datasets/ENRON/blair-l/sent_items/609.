Maria,
 
I think the revised paragraph focuses on the wrong point.   The lack of take-away capacity alone wouldn't make a firm customer prefer a volumetric rate.  It's the problem of not knowing from day to day whether such firm transportation will be confirmed at the border (i.e. the windowing procedure).  
 
My feeling is that the desire for a volumetric rate isn't driven by capacity, but by transactional uncertainty.  
 
I would suggest that we use the orginal paragraph -- but drop the discussion of takeaway capacity and focus on the window procedure.
