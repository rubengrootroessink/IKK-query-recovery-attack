Subject:	FW: Customer Accounts Status

The customer accounts status meeting was held today, July 26th.  Marketing had one follow up item related to Terra and what the status of the receivable and related settlement is.  I am following up with Frank and will get back with Shelly's group. 

You should be receiving copies of the package shortly.

Please let know if you have any questions.

Dana
