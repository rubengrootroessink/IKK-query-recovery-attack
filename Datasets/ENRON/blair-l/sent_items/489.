Mike, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file Jeff
sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.

Tammy & Jesse,

Just wanted to touch base with you on todays activities.
We have address the problem with Utilicorp and you will now see 40 records on all meters.
A test file has been sent and Jesse notified. Please let me know of any further problems
that may develope on this file.
Jesse has notified me that the Entex file had a problem and will let me know what the point 
of failure item is. We will move to correct this immediately.
I have not heard if there were any problems with the Texaco files.

Any problem that we find will any EDI file will be resolved and that resolution will be implemeted 
for ALL EDI files. Like the 40 record problem on Utilicorp.

I want to be sure and emphisize that EDI is our top priority right now and we have every intention
to have these files ready on close night. If by some chance we still have problems the night of close
we will continue to resolve them to get the files out ASAP. Unlike the MIPS system, PGAS enables
us to run the EDI file over and over till we have what we need from the system. As long as the customers 
knows that we are redeveloping the file we send them they should understand that there MAY be a 
delay in them getting their data. I do not intend for this to occur but they may need a heads up if you
have not already done that. 
The backup plan for all of this is fairly simple, Other than a copy of the statements there is not one.
Going back to MIPS is not an option. The June data has not been entered into MIPS(except EFM)
and will not be available. Utilicorp already receives a number of copies of the statements. If there is 
someone or some department that would also need a copy in the event of a delay in the file we will sent 
it to them.

If you have any questions regarding the EDI files please feel free to contact me.
I am currently working an afternoon to evening shift so will not be available in the morning
except by pager.(713-813-8096)
Tks, Jeff
