	Chris, I only got info on the Mid Am Oct. charts.  I talked to Gary again yesterday and
	ask for more information.  Hopefully I'll have something today.  Have you already
	sent your letter to Alliant?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?
