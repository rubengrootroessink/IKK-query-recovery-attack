Vince, recently we found out that some of the people in our group (ETS Logistics - located on the 41st floor) do not have access to SAP - we called the SAP Help Desk and they directed us to fill out the proper forms and at the same time told us that it would take about 10 days to 2 weeks for us to get that access.  I was wondering if there is any way that we could get that sooner than the 10 days to 2 weeks. The people that recently sent in those forms are Joe Linhart, Harry Woodson, Randy Janzen and Jacob Conklin.  Please let me know what you might be able to do to accomodate us - we really need to get into SAP as soon as possible.

Thanks so much for your help,
