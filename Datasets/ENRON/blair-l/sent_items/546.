Beginning Wednesday, after the production migration, a problem was discovered with the IDD/PNR Contract Balance view on the storage menu.  The view was not displaying all information; it appeared many of the total balance fields were missing and zeros were displayed where numbers should have been.  After looking into the issue, we discovered that the data was never making it from the database.  This led us to believe there was a driver incompatibility issue.

We began working with Microsoft to find the cause of the problem.  Meanwhile, we removed our ODBC changes for this particular image and went back to using native driver connections.  This solved the problem with the view so it was decided to move this change to production.  We are still working with Microsoft to find the exact cause of the problem.

A fix was developed yesterday and moved into production last night.  The view should be fixed today.  I have tested it and am happy with the results.

We are satisfied with the solution of switching this process back to native driver connections.  I can give a more detailed explanation if you like, just let me know.
