Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  [Blair, Lynn]  Yes, during same cycle, but at a different time.
Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time?

If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]  Customers can pick up gas at demarc def.  
The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarch def.

and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.

>    1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the
> nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?
>
>         Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount
> or volume lower than scheduled amount
>                (2) RANK changed to a different number
>
>    2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in
> relation to mandatory monthly cash out?
>
>         Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E
>
>    3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc
> allocation?
>
>         Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only
> two points in the group
>
>    4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is
> allocated, can Virginia Power
>         switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and
> keep their gas flowing?
>
>         Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery
> IS included in a demarc allocation
>                because the transport tied to this storage
> nomination is physically coming from
>                       the field to the market area. (Greg we may
> not have been clear on this comment
>                on the conference call)
