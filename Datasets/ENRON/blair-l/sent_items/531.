I called Christine Slayman at US Gypsum to discuss clearing the credit balance on the A/R.  Christine informed me that US Gypsum had voluntarily filed Chapter 11.  Christine is to get back with me at a later date to discuss further.

I then asked Sherry Forbish if she knew anything about the bankrupcy filing.  Sherry had not heard anything and we called Tim Johanson.  Tim informed us that Rob Cooper of US Gypsum said the bankrupcy filing was to protect themselves from asbestos litigation.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Kathy
