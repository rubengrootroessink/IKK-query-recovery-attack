FYI,  Ken Cessac will be calling you or Harry for Oneok plant data (if they still send it to us).

fyi - no action required for now from Field Operations, but please believe this is a very sensitive issue and we need to make sure that the highest level of attention is given to the UST Meters - Mike

John and I discussed a couple of Bushton Measurement issues today that I would like you to take a lead on.

* According to John, the difference between their PTR and our meters seems to be abnormal for April and May of this year.  He will designate a ONEOK expert to call Ken Cessac to discuss possible investigations to resolve, if possible.  I would include an examination of the Plant PTR process and not just a limitation to Ultrasonic Meter Issues.


* John has expressed a concern for the need to add further clarification to the Measurement Agreement.  He foresees some issues that may not be addressed in the agreement.  I told him that I thought it would be better to resolve these issues before they became a problem and agreed to listen to their concerns and work to resolve if possible.
