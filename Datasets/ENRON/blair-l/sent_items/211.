Please forward this to everyone in marketing.  This is a presentation on nominations, scheduling, allocations etc. given by Lynn Blair. This is for anyone who wants a basic course on scheduling, and can also be a refresher for those already familiar with this.  Please include the Minneapolis, Omaha, and Houston marketing groups.

Thanks, Jo
