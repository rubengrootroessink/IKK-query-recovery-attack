Dennis, you are right, we are in the process of combining the two northend teams.
They should be getting with you to give you any info you need to update PLE.
Thanks for following up on this.  Lynn

I heard a rumor that the Des Moines and Omaha teams have been combined and will now be called the North Team; is this correct?  

Should I be updating PLE to reflect the change?
