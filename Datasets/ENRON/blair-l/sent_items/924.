	Harry, have you seen this?  Are you familiar with the info?  	
	I have a meeting at 3:00 with Dan Fancler, Tracy and Steve Weller
	on the EPPI issues.  Just wondered if you have any detail on
	this attachment I need to understand?  Thanks. Lynn

Hey Steve,
Kim and I have been looking at your spreadsheet.  I am attaching our
spreadsheet so you can see how we came up with our numbers.  It looks like
there is a pricing problem on your spreadsheet.  You have a price for
1/18/00 and there isn't pricing for that day.  The Jan00L tab in our
spreadsheet calculates the current invoice.  The Jan00S tab calculates what
we should have paid, inclusive of PPAs.  Kim tells me that our worksheets
are per the contract.  If you have questions, please email me or give me a
call.  Hopefully we can get this worked out as soon as possible.
Thanks!

I received both your email and fax.  I haven't had a chance to look at
it
yet.  I am in the middle of my closing cycle.  I'm trying to get the
plant
closed and statements mailed before I can take a look at this.  If I
don't
get closed Harry Woodson won't be a happy camper if I'm not able to
provide
3rd party shrink numbers to him before he has to close.  I realize you
are
trying to pay us $$$$$, but the timing of this issue finally resurfacing
is
bad.  I will look at this as soon as the plant is closed.
Thanks!
Sherry

Sherry:  Did you get the fax?  Does any of it makes sense?  Steve
