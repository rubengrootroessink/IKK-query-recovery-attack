Since we are already working on a short term solution to stop the 'bleeding' caused by the Schedule Quantities Report  fiasco, i would like for us to setup a project and a project plan for migrating all TMS report out of Crystal to Business Objects.

Thanks

	Lisa,

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?
