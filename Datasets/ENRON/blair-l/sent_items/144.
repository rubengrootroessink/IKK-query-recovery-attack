Please review the spreadsheets attached.  These are my notes associated with any outstanding items requiring final review/approval:

Item 1 - I have received the remainder of outstanding rates from TK and populated into the PDT records.  TK/Lindy, please provide email if corrections are necessary.
Item 3 - After discussions with Lynn, we chose to round up Daily Max Flowing Capacity for gas days 8/1 and 8/3 (both from 1,092,956 to 1,093,000) so this would not raise questions or require footnote explanations.  I have also updated the footnotes and comments provided by Terry/Darrell/Lynn and populated accordingly into PDS and PFS.
Item 4 - I compared the daily scheduled volumes by California delivery point provided under RP00-241-000 (CPUC vs El Paso) SCE-7 against the volumes extracted from TMS and highlighted the nine records having discrepancies, where the data to the right of the matrix is the amount reported in the prior request.  I would recommend that we adjust to the previously reported volumes.  I was not able to extract the website operational capacity volumes for each point in the West of Thoreau area; however, I did verify that the monthly Total Scheduled System Volume (PDSM) less the monthly Total Scheduled Volume at each California Point (PPSM) equaled the usage volumes billed to all customers delivering to East of California delivery points.

Provide comments to the entire distribution list in this email no later than Thursday at 1pm.  

Omaha - I will separate each tab and save as a separate Excel file using the file name convention as defined by the FERC.  I believe we need to provide both a hardcopy and a CD.  Is the current Excel format with headers acceptable for the hardcopy version?   Additionally, do I need to delete the headers for the electronic files on CD?  Unless otherwise instructed, I will email the final version of all four files for final disposition by Regulatory in Omaha no later than 3pm.  Please advise if there is anything else needed from Houston.

	 


Thanks,
Elizabeth
