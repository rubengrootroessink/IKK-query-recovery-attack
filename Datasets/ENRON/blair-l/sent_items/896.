	I do not think it is necessary to have another letter to Oneok from Harry.  Hopefully they get the message
	with this letter.   Thanks. Lynn

	Ken and Kile, 

	Please see the attached proposed draft letter.  I need to fill in one blank, but it is otherwise complete, subject to your thoughts.  I will try and get a copy of Sherry Rogers' letter to Harry Woodson of November 1 by fax to you both.

	Britt

	P.S. to Lynn and Harry:  is it alright with you for Ken to basically be replying to the letter to Harry?  Do we also need a "me, too" letter from Harry?
