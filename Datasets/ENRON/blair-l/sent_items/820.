EMA,

A customer, John Buchanan with ETS, states that the outage must not start BEFORE 10:30 PM.  They have a scheduled maintenance cycle at 10:30 PM and they need to be able to send out confirmation emails to customers until that time.

Please communicate with John at 3-7429 and coordinate this outage.

Thanks,

Melody Gray
