Subject:	TMS Oncall Support

All,
After talking it over with Lynn Blair, and with Sheila Nacey's agreement, the TMS Oncall support hours are being modified.  Instead of the current rotation that requires 2 developers to be oncall each working day plus a third person fulfilling the responsibility on the weekend, the TMS team is experimenting with a rotation of one oncall person for work days and one for the weekend.  The TMS team will still continue to provide oncall support from 6:30A to the end of the last cycle.

The only noticeable change during this 6 week experiment will be the onsite support hours, which will now be from 6:30A to 6:00P.  Following is an outline for oncall procedure during this period:

1)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide on-site support from 6:30A to 2:00P
	At times when the Oncall does not feel comfortable about being able to commute to office before 6:30A, the Oncall will 	provide support from home until he/she is able to hand off the responsibility to TMS team member onsite.
2)  TMS team, collectively, will provide the on-site support from 2:00P to 6:00P
	Before leaving, the Oncall person will make sure that one of the team member, already on-site, has accepted the 	responsibility for answering oncall pages
3)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide off-site support from 6:00P to the end of processing for last cycle

There will be no change to the weekend oncall procedures.

John/Terry,
please make sure that all schedulers are aware of the above change.

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.  

Thanks
