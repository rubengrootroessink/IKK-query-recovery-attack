You may have noticed that you have not received updated shipper lists for t=
he last few weeks.  When the conversion was made to Windows 2000, Forest & =
Trees quit working.  Therefore, I am unable to produce the reports until th=
is has been resolved. =20

I am working with Linda Trevino and Glen Stovall to fix the problem as soon=
 as possible. =20

In the meantime, PLE is being updated to reflect changes as I receive them.
