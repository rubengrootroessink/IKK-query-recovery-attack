	Shawn, it was good to hear from you.  Sorry it has taken so long to answer.  I will certainly
	look at the possibility of Robert being at the customer meeting.  I appreciate your comments.
	I am glad Shawn is going to be able to attend.  Have a good week.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

Do you think it's possible for Robert to attend the Winter Ops Meeting in
KC this September?

I think it would be very valuable for both Shawn Amaya and Robert to spend
time together at the meeting just as I found it very valuable when I was
the Operations Rep for NNG a few years ago.  Not only is the Ops Meeting
structured and informative, it is also a great way to improve current ties
and create new relationships.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Shawn Davis

I am planning to attend the NNG Winter Ops Meeting the second week of
September as we discussed.  However, my NNG rep Robert Benningfield informs
me that he and other reps might not be allowed to attend.  This was the
same case as last year.  Since I interact with my reps on a daily basis,
they are the ones familiar with our business and our operational concerns.
I think that it would be beneficial to us for him and other reps to attend
as they would be able to provide insight to the proceedings as they pertain
to our business.  We are investing time and money to attend these meetings
each year.  I think we should make sure that we get the most return out of
them.  Let me know if you can contact your counterpart at NNG to voice our
interest?

Thanks.

Shawn
