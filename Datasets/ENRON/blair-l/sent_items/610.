Tropical Storm Barry weakened overnight but still remains a tropical storm.  We have been coordinating with Gary Fitch of Enron Aviation and agree that the potential affect of this storm on the Houston area would not be until early next week.  I've again attached several images taken from the National Hurricane Center.  Jean McFarland and I will continue to monitor the storm throughout the weekend and will notify appropriate personel of any changes.
Thanks,
Bob and Jean
