The only time I'm not available is Monday from 1:30-2:30.  Tuesday is probably better since we'll need to get the fuel filing out on Monday pm.  sjk

We would like to have a meeting to discuss how we should/want to handle scheduling alternates versus TI above our sustainable capacity level at interconnect points.  I don't know what everyone's schedule looks like so I will throw out Tuesday (July 10th) or Wednesday (July 11th) in the afternoon as options.  We will probably need at least an hour.  What times are best?  Is there anyone else I need to include?
Ranelle
