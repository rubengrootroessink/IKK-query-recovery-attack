Subject:	FT. BUFORD CONFIRMATIONS

Lynn,  can we setup a few minutes to discuss the Ft. Buford confirmation processes.  NBPL is wanting to discontinue faxes for Ft. Buford and the ID2 faxes for all NBPL points.  This would require either NBPL or NNG dialing into the others system to confirm (Ft, Buford each cycle) and to verify the final ID2 scheduled numbers daily.  We need to discuss if NNG is willing to make this a practice or not.  I will have Ava setup a time on your calendar some time or get with me early some morning.  We need to see what direction we want to go.
