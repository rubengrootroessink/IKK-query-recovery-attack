	Attached is the action form HR has indicated we are to use for Level 3
	performer.  This form will be in addition to the PEP system Peformance
	review form.  In discussions with Shelly we will use the form for all
	Level 3, but ONLY input "target dates" for those employees with
	issues.


		 

	Thought I would pass it on and let you modify as you need for your reviews.

	If I have throughly confused you, give me a call.  Thanks. Lynn
