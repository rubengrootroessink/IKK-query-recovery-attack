Subject:	TW requirements for Inside/Outside the Path and TW Flow Direction

Attached below are the two files for TW CMS/TMS requirements on flow direction and current process for inside/outside the path requirements. 

Please review these documents and let me know if you have any questions or  corrections to apply to either document by COB
8/31/01. 

Linda, please keep me in the loop on both of the projects since they interface directly with TMS.

Thanks Ramona
