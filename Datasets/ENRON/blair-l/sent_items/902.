	Shelley, do you still want the report Terry is doing each Monday for the TW SOCAL and West
	of Throeau numbers.  We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations
	so we could track any possible "holes" in the pipe. 

	So far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report
	unless you need it for Stan's meeting?  Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes 
	as well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes.

	Thanks. Lynn
