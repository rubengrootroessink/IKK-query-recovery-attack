Lynn, in the note below they talk about some detailed procedures being put together.  I thought that we would wait until that comes out and then get with the Reps.

Thanks,

Raetta

Subject:	Wire Transfer Processing

Treasury, SAP, and GCP have been working together for a number of months to resolve payment issues.  During this time, Treasury has been reviewing each wire transfer manually.  It is now time to move to the next step and allow our banking system to provide these edits and focus our attention on just the wires that fail the edits.

Treasury has partnered with GCP and SAP to quickly resolve any vendor master and data entry related issues.  This team will be working with business units as needed to expedite the correction and reprocessing of payments to meet the commercial needs of Enron.  We will need your cooperation to expedite the turn around on any items in your area.

More detailed resolution procedures will be developed next week and communicated to all of you.  

Thank you for your help in this process.

Mary Perkins
