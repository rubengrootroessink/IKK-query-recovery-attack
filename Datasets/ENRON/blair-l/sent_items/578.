	Ava, we have finally made a decision to go with November 8 and 9th, 2001 for the
	TW Customer meeting.  Please work with Donna on the details and let me know
	if you are not able to get the hotel for that time frame.

	Donna, it was also suggested we just do the meeting in the Enron building and then
	go down to Kehma for the boat ride.  What do you think of that idea?

	Thanks.  Lynn
