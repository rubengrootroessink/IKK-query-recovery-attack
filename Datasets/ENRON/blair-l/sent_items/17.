Before you write the request, please make these clarifications:

1. If we allocated during timely,  then don't allocate again during any intraday cycles,
    do we count that as being a day that was allocated ?
2. Ventura receipt and delivery are currently being allocated separately, and not netted against 
    each other like everything else.  Does it count if  either side got allocated ?
3. If a point is in a group that is being allocated, but the point itself is not, does it count ?
4. Percentages ?

I know we can get the dates these points were allocated, but what about the percentages Chris is talking about?

Yes this data can be extracted from TMS.  Just send a req. to TMS on Call so they can get the information for you.  I am not sure what you mean by percentages.

Toby, does Northern track the number of days and associated percentages that a point is allocated during a heating season?  We are trying to do a transport deal and the customer asked how often we allocated POI 5532 (Eagle) and POI 192 (Ventura) last heating season.
