	Nancy, good job.  Keep up the good work.  See if you can get the rest of your team

Lynn,

Nancy Callans is the one that got Great Lakes to start e:mailing the confirmations.  I just sent the e:mail to all the reps.

	Good job in getting this done.  How are we coming with the other operators?  With us moving
	forward for Shirley to work from home, emails will be much better than faxes.  Thanks. Lynn
