Tangie, very good letter.  I am assuming this does not include the PVR OBA, but all others.
Is that a right assumption?  Thanks. Lynn

Jerry,

Attached you will find the Oneok OBA spreadsheets which identify the cumulative OBA imbalance
through April 2001.  In order to balance to your monthly Confirmation Letter that Northern sends I 
have made some changes to the spreadsheets to make it easier for both of us to identify the 
cumulative imbalance by contract.

As per our phone conversation the Burdett (17378) point was sold to Golden Belt Transport, LLC, 
effective 2/1/01 but, the imbalance volumes are still being placed under your OBA contract.  I am
working with others here at Northern to get this corrected.

Currently I have identified that Oneok owns Northern $2,401,128.62 on all the OBA contracts 
(Ellis-Woodward-Clark OBA's=$316,846.96 due NNG; Delhi Beaver OBA=$171,781.26 due Oneok;
Orignial OBAs = $2,212,211.59 due NNG).  It was stated that both parties would cash-in/out the 
imbalances on the Original OBA contracts, on a quarterly basis.  At this time I am requesting that we
cash-in/out the Original OBA's and the Delhi Beaver OBA since, Oneok no longer operates the 
point.

Please take a moment and review the volumes and dollars on the spreadsheets.  If you have any
concerns please let me know but, if you are in agreement would you please let me know when 
Northern can expect to receive payment.
