Richard Johnson faxed me a letter yesterday, wanting me to advise them on
how to proceed with this past due account.  There seems to be a lot of
misunderstanding about this that needs to be cleared up.  Johnson say "the
Young's are due to be cut off today."   Also in a copy of a letter they
sent to me they gave the Young's your work phone number (Richard).  Was
that OK?  I do not want Johnson giving out my work number to any customer!
Maybe if the Young's would just sent a partial payment we could get to the
bottom of all of this?
Let me know if you need me to do anything.  I can fax you copies of what R.
Johnson sent me if it will help (give me a fax number) or you can call me
this morning before 10:00.

Thanks,
