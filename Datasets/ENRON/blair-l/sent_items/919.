	Jo, I apologize.  Your right.  The imbalances are short to the pipe.  To be sure we are all
	on the same page.  All the deliveries off of NNG on this report took more gas than scheduled and the
	receipts gave us less than scheduled.  Thanks. Lynn

Isn't this 3.0 bcf short to the pipe?

	Attached is the spreadsheet Raetta put together after receiving all of the billing information to
	review the parties involved in the 3.0 bcf long to the pipe position on NNG for October, 2001.
	If you have any questions, let Raetta or I know. 

	Sue, the Pinnacle Natural Gas imbalance is the 5,000/day balancing Pinnacle is allowed
	before volumes go to park and ride. Thanks. Lynn
