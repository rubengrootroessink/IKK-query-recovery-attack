Attached please find a draft letter to Hibbing explaining to them why Northern has the right to limit takes at a TBS and why Northern will require them to pay for the TBS upgrade so that they can take more.  Bob would like to send this out on Monday, so can I please have your comments as soon as possible on Monday.  Thanks, Dari
