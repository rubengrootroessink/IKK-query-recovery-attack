	There is a meeting scheduled for Wednesday, August 1, to reveiew how TW allocates
	through pools.  


	Ava - Please see if you can possible get us 4102 and let us know where we will be meeting.

	Ava - Please order food for 10 from Trebeards.  The combination red beans and rice and
	         shrimp et..... (don't know how to spell!!).  

	Ramona - Carla is most interested in allocations through pools on the receipt side of the
		    business.  Doesn't mean she won't ask about delivery.  Let's discuss.
