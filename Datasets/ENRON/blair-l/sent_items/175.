	John, FYI.  I didn't know if you would be able to make this meeting.  Terry is coming until
	2:30 then he will attend Steve Harris' meeting.  If you need to stay on the floor, that is no
	problem.  I will update you.  Thanks. Lynn

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to "cooperate" with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the standards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF
