	Attached is a draft of a letter we are sending to our customers as discussed
	at the Winter Ops Meeting in September.  Also, we have attached a "Frequently 
	Asked Questions" (FAQ) document that will go out with the letter and will be posted 
	to the WEB.   We will monitor the WEB site and update the questions periodically.

	Please review the letter and FAQ and let me know of any changes or comments by
	tomorrow evening, Tuesday, 5:00 p.m.  Our goal is to get these documents to the customers
	by Wednesday, October 3rd.

	We appreciate your input in this process.  Do not hesitate to call if you have questions. (Ext. 3-7637)

		
			 		 


	Thanks. Lynn
