	Jodie, when you have time let's discuss.  Overall I am OK with plan, but had a question about who
	was monitoring imbalances.  Sounds like Marketing is instead of Gas Logistics?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,  please review and provide any comments.  Hopefully this will help the communications when facilities are new or reactivated.

Here is the procedures document that we talked about on the c. call.

Please review and provide feedback to either myself or Gary Anderson by close of the day on 10-8-2001. We would like to get this implemented ASAP so that approval can be done and the procedure put in to practice.

Gary,

I have tryed to put what you wrote up into a Word format with the proper Procedures headings included.
See what you think, add, subtract, delete, whatever and maybe we can go forward with the approval of the draft to be implemented.
