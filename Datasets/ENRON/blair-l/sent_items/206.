Alma- please make the appropriate meter station remarks for both Sept & Oct volume statements that the down time was confirmed by Tony Simpson in case Gas Logistics calls and says otherwise----.Our volumes look good for both months so far and we should not be changing anything.

Mike thanks for the info. We show a few hrs on the 4th starting @ 3 AM but the majority begins around noon

Just heard from Jim Westbrook and he confirmed that our meter is OK - the plant was down for expansion so the 0's are good.   Should start seeing some volumes with the gas day of the 4th.

Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy was convinced that they had been taking gas during this time.  Tony Simpson with Exol confirmed that they had not.

Will close the ticket.

Owatonna Team - Please pass to Jim Westbrook:

Looks like we lost the meter pulsar signal or module on the 25th - No measurement since.    Passed to Jim Westbrook - Owatonna Team.   Will need to get Sep. volumes to GMS for accounting close.

I passed to Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy.

:Jim - please let the NNG Measurement Desk know when you get the meter back up.

GMS - Bobbie - please pass to the GMS accounting rep for this station.
