This is to update you on what we are doing to correct the problems we have been experiencing at this point.  Penny McCarran and I have been working together to find a way to eliminate the DDVC's that are being created at this point.  This is such a small volume point (500 dth/day or less at present) being used for irrigation only and the shipper has no way of avoiding DDVC's since there is no storage arrangements in the Bushton Universe for them to make Final AM trueups and correct their volumes.  

We have worked with Contracts to determine if this point should truely be considered a TBS or Citygate.  EFM was installed due to possible volumes of approximately 1,700 dth per day and it was concluded that makes it a TBS.  Our findings, however, show that it does not meet the TBS criteria, due to the fact there is no LDC involved at this point. We have changed the type from TBS to IC and have created an OBA contract (pending signatures) to eliminate future DDVC's and make this a feasible point to operate.  

If you have any questions, please contact Penny or myself.
