Hey Lynn!  Lunch sounds great.  However, I'm off tomorrow - I'm going on a little retreat with my mom.  And then on Thursday, I'm having lunch with my new boss!  Maybe we could grab a coffee on Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you.  I hope you're not feeling the pain!

Gina

How's it going down there?  Did ya'll get moved?  What's the mood since the re-org has been announced?  Is this a good thing?

Inquiring minds want to know.....
