Alfredo, I am pretty open for the rest of today and tomorrow as well.  I am at EB4741c (on the southeast side of the floor overlooking the new building).  Just come by if you are up here.  You could call me at X.35840 to confirm that I am at my desk.  (I have to say that Lynn and her group provided most of the substantive information.)

Rebecca/Lynn

Thanks for your time spent with Mauro. I am today and tomorrow in Houston, and I would like to have a chance to see you and briefly discuss the issues you touched with him. Mauro is sending me a memo with the topics by end of today.

tx,

a.

Dear Amber, Alfredo and Fabio,
many thanks for the opportunity of visiting Enron in Houston.
Your colleagues provided me with a great lot of information and advice.
Rebecca Cantrell and Lynn Blair were very kind and helpful, in sparing their time with me and in organizing other meetings with colleagues.
They are very fine and I appreciate.
Maybe we would discuss, should the occasion come, some of the aspects of open access in the USA and their appropriateness for the italian case.
Best Regards
Mauro Formaggio
