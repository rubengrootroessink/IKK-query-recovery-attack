TO: SGA  ENERGY ACCOUNTING/MARKET SERVICES 
CONFERENCE REGISTRANTS
Due to the recent tragic events, we have decided to postpone the SGA 
Energy Accounting/Market Services Conference scheduled for next 
week in New Orleans.
The Conference has been re-scheduled for January 16-18, 2002
at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans. We will hold your conference registration 
for the new date unless notified otherwise. 
To adjust  your hotel reservation to the new date, call Hyatt reservations 
at (504) 561-1234.  Do not contact the hotel until after September 22, as they 
may not have the new information in their system until then.
Should you have any questions, please contact me or my assistant Melinda  
Bellido at (972) 620-4020.  We look forward to seeing you in New Orleans.
Best regards, 
Patrick Downey
