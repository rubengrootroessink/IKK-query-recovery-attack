	Steve and Mary, here is a seperate Agenda item for us to discuss at 1:30.  Thanks. Lynn

		OFO/PRIMARY FIRM REQUIREMENTS

			Can NNG call shippers back to primary firm receipt points?


		Answer:  Carlton is the only authorized OFO point NNG has on their system
			  which we have done with the 250 at Carlton

			  We do not have this authority at all other points
