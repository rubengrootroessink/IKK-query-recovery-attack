Jodie - I have been meaning to give you a call.  I will be in Houston on Wednesday and was wondering if we could get together to visit for awhile.  Since we did a formal interview earlier I don't think we need to go back through the same stuff but, would like to get an update on what you have been doing.

It is going to be hectic tomorrow so I will have Rosemary give you a call to set a time.  

RY - Please set this up one hour for Jodie and I.  The other meetings planned for the day are NGPL and another meeting I need you to set for Mike Stage, Dave Neubauer and myself.  We will need 1.5 to 2 hours with Mike.  

Thanks.  John

John,  I responded to the job you have posted.  Due to my promotion in February in Market Services it is a policy that I typically would not be allowed to respond to posted openings for a year.  I visited with Lynn this morning and expressed to her that I would like to respond to your opening.  Lynn agreed to let me respond.  Also,  Lynn has requested that you contact her if there is any interest in an interview.  She wants to make sure her t's are crossed and i's are dotted.  If you have any questions please give me a call @ 713.853.1465.

						thanks,  j.  floyd
