Unfortunately, the Check it Out Awards program has not been renewed.  If you have someone on your team you wish to reward for a significant accomplishment, please check with Lynn to discuss whether she should submit a Personal Achievement Award request.

Rick, 

The South team would like to nominate several people in ETS for the Check it out Awards. 

We have three questions: 

        1. What is the procedure for completing an award 
        2.  Is their an amount limit per team? 
        3.  Is their an amount limit per individual? 


Thanks 


Robert
