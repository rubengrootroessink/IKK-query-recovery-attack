	Ava, I am assuming we are sending flowers?  You may want to check with Sherry
	to see if we want to wait until Kathy gets home or send to hospital.  Thanks. Lynn

Just wanted to let everyone know that Kathy's mother called a few minutes ago -- Kathy has had her surgery and is now in recovery.  They will let us know when she will be going home.

Any questions, please advise -- thanks.
