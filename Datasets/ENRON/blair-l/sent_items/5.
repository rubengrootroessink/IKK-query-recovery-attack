Subject:=09Conoco will begin taping conversations

We received the following communication Dated August 29, 2001 from Conoco:

"In an effort to improve the quality of our services and consistent with pr=
actices, Conoco Gas and Power Marketing, a division of Conoco, Inc. has ins=
talled equipment to record telephone conversations with our customers and t=
rading partners.  These recordings will benefit us all by verifying the acc=
uracy of our verbal agreements and reducing the chance for miscommunication=
.

Working in this fast-paced environment, many of you are already familiar wi=
th recording transactions conducted by telephone.  Recording will occur aut=
omatically and continue throughout the conversation.  There will be no noti=
ce or recording indicator. =20

Please call me if you have any questions about this arrangement.  We apprec=
iate your business ant the opportunity to serve you.

Sincerely,

Jerry Wheatley"
