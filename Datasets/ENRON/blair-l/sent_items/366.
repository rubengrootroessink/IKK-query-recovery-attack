Gary is right.  But if NGTS is the only contract, they will take the swing.=
  Or is Pioneer saying they
want to take the swing?  If Pioneer wants to do the swing, maybe they could=
 do a contract to
cover the swing volume only?  Karen and Larry, what do you think?  Thanks. =

Subject:=09Request for OBA at South Texas Team POI

NGTS called me yesterday morning indicating that they were buying gas from =
Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company and receipting it at POI 401 (Gains Co. #2) fo=
r 6/1/01.  NGTS indicated that Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company wanted to buy b=
ack 100 Dths of this gas at POI 78163 and the system would not allow it.  I=
 pulled up POI 78163 only to discover that it was not a legitimate POI on N=
NG and that POI 401 was a receipt POI only.  I then went to Gary Spraggins =
to verify if their was a POI that NGTS could delivery gas off NNG for Pione=
er's compressor.

Received a call from Tim Green and Cindy White at Pioneer Gas Pipeline Comp=
any (915) 655-3300 explaining Pioneer sent in an agreement form to create a=
 new interconnect to take gas off NNG and mailed NNG a check to cover this =
expense.   I t went to Linda Trevino to see where we stood with this new ag=
reement.  Linda indicated that she had not activated POI 78163 as she did n=
ot have a reference contract.  I called Pioneer and they indicated that NGT=
S would be the only supplier at this POI.  I called Darren Brown at NGTS an=
d he informed me that he would be using contract 107903 to deliver gas to P=
ioneer's compressor starting 6/1/01.  I gave the contract information to Li=
nda and she activated the POI and it defaulted to active confirmation.  I c=
alled Tim at Pioneer and asked him if "active confirmation" was what he rea=
lly needed and he indicated that he would prefer "confirmation by exception=
".  I had him fill out "NNG Request for Operator Choice Form" and fax to me=
.  Linda  changed the operator option for Pioneer to reflect "confirmation =
by exception". =20

Tim Green asked if they could set up an OBA at POI 78163 as the compressor =
would not necessarily use the 100 Dths nomed daily?  I had him send an e:ma=
il request to Zula Carter and myself indicating POI 78163 be added to the O=
BA at POI 401 Gains County #2.   This e:mail request must be approved and Z=
ula Carter will advise us when this takes place.

I got involved in this as I schedule for NGTS although I realize POI 401 is=
 on the So TX Team and assigned to Janet.

If I you have any questions feel free to call me.

Nancy
