	FYI.  Wanted to pass on this information.  After working with Minnegasco to help them
	use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the
	Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday's gas day and changed their business
	between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2.  This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17.  We 
	tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. Lynn
