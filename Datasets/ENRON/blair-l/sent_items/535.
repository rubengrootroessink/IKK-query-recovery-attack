	Shelley, I think you want to continue using this report.  It is the report we have
	used all along to confirm the number against the ultra sonic meters.  We can
	discuss further if you like.  Thanks. Lynn

Given the Oneok Arbitration Decision, does it make sense to continue to send this report out?  Is it consistent with the decision in that PVR is not used on a going forward basis?
