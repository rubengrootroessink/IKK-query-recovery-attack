Amy, are they paying for all the expenses except air fare?  If so, go ahead and
plan on attending.  Thanks. Lynn

I have been invited to attend the ENA Customer Meeting July 21-23 in Miami. The only day I will be out of the office is Monday July 23 and that works for the team.  I will be responding back to ENA soon and wanted to make sure it was OK with you.

Thanks,
Amy
