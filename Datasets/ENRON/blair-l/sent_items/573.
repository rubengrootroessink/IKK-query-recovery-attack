Jeanne, 
Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to help follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cycle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is different on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocation is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule volumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confirms. 

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting Unsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operational available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after each cycle. 
Please let me know.
Thanks Ramona

Jeanne,

Unless there is any other comment we should post after the confirmations are complete,  even if the noms are late.

I will be out of the office the week of 7/30 so please send your comments or question to Bradley Holmes or Ramona Betancourt.

Thanks 
Dale Ratliff

Dale,
I need to know what is the schedule for the posting of the Unsubscribed. These are the times the cycles run. Do we run when these are complete? Should we post based on the confirmation time? Do we follow these times even if Noms is late?

Thanks,
Jeanne
