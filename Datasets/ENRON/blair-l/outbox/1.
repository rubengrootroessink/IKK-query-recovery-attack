Shelley, Larry Berger has put together the 4 PAA's based on these employeef efforts

 on the testing of the new Flowing Gas Documents.  They did a very good job and I think

it would be good tor recognize them for their work on testing while they continued to

keep their day to day activities under control as well.  

Diana Porter and Jean Adams are for $150

Kathy Sturr and Renee Perry are for $250

If you approve, please process these PAA's.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks. Lynn
