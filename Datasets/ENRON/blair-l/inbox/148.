Gas Logistics combined 2001 payroll is $8,209,648.  The 2002 Plans were built with a 4.25% combined merit and other which equates to $348,910.  At 3.75% the combined merit and other equates to $307,862, a reduction of $41,048.  Over the next few days, I will be rebuilding the 2002 revised plan for distribution.
