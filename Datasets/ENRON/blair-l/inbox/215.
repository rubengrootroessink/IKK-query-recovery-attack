	After further investigation here are the facts as of today (Monday) on the UCU SBA issue:

	1.  UCU nominated 20,000 dth on their SBA contract

	2.  UCU reduced there Carlton transportation by 10,000 dth

	3.  Kathy is checking all of UCU's contracts to see if overall they:

		a.  Reduced deliveries
		b.  Increased Receipts elsewhere to make up for the Carlton reduction

	We will have an answer by the morning meeting on Wednesday.  

	Have a great New Years Eve and be careful.  Thanks. Lynn
