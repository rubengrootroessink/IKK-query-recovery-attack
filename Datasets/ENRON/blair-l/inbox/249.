I would like to add the following items to the agenda.  I believe that coming to a resolution on these issues will increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the TW team.

	-Team members hours of coverage, and job responsibilities
	-Rotating team coverage responsibility in an emergency, and possible solutions to minimize unexpected coverage issues 	(weekdays, weekends, and late nights)

Thank You,
Christine

      With the customer service items put before us from Shelley and Lynn. It appears to me that now is a good time to review some items surrounding the team environment. This is a way for the TW team to show how or what we are doing to provide customer service. Thank You.
 

Agenda Items:

1.  Extended time away from desk (Lunches, Workouts, Meetings, etc.)
2.  Key information being passed along regarding your shippers or operators (Imbalances, OBA's, PG&E re-alignment, etc.)
3.  Best way to keep all team members informed of special deals (E-mail, Voice mail, Common folder, etc.)
4.  Best way to pass all information from days to nights and nights to day.
5.  Adequate coverage when away from desk (Share the work load, Don't make the same people stay behind, Mix it up)
6.  Keep all Team Advisors informed. (John Buchanan, Terry Kowalke, Darrell Schoolcraft, and Gary Spraggins)      
7.  Key to the above 6 items (Open line of communication)
