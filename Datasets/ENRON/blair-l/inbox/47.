I have spoken with Williams, and two representatives will be here Monday at 9:00 AM. Frank Billings and Greg Pointer are the two gentlemen that will be visiting us and they will have the reception desk call John when they get here.

As mentioned, their main interest is going to be how we manage the commercial transactions of the MOPS asset for NNG as well as our joint venture partners.  They will also be interested in discussing the interim service agreement and what services we will be able provide.  They have not provided us enough information to date to develop a definitive agreement, but after this visit they should be in a position specify what they need us to do. The physical operations of the asset is currently contracted to Enron Operations, LP, and that contract can be assigned by NNG to Williams.  It is possible they may have questions regarding the billing and allocation of the operating cost, and if so Betty Jamison may be able to provide insight on those.

Thanks for your help,

Bob
