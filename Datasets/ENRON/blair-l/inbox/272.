Lynn, the training went well.  We covered the following topics:

	- 8 a.m. true up process and how to avoid mistakes or invalid codes
	- Winter Power Pak agreement and true up process
	- Information about realigning their Demarc and Beatrice volumes
	- Differences between Demarc and Mid 17 Pool
	- Addressed EDI issues (will discuss with Mary Draemer to resolve)
	- Identifying cuts and utilizing the "Detect" tool in TMS
	- Also discussed Powertex and Pinnacle power plants since Xcel operates SPS
	- Discussed how and when path rankings come into play and how to avoid 
	  cutting their long term deals versus their daily gas

These were just a few of the topics I can think of off the top of my head, but overall I think the meeting was a success from an NNG and Xcel standpoint.  Let me know if you need anymore information.  Thanks.

Randy

Hello,

Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year).  The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Tim Johanson
