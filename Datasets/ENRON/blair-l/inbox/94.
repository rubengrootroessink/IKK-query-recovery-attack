To all reps, when filling out the Morning Gas Control Report to record on voice mail. Make sure that you start asking what the percentage is daily for the Carlton Resolution. As it is very important to get the proper percentage updated in TMS to be posted to the EBB. The North End Reps are the ones responsible for updating this by 9 AM daily to make sure it is posted to the EBB 48 hours prior to gas flow. The season starts Nov. 1, 2001 and runs through March 31, 2002.  On the attached form highlighted in yellow is where the information goes. If you questions or concerns regarding this please see Nancy Callans or myself. Thank you.

Terry Kowalke
