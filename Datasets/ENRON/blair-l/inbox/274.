Lynn:  From my perspective Randy did an excellent job - both at the meeting and at the social dinner that evening.  In my mind he is a definite keeper - one that Marketing will probably be trying to get there hands on in the future if you don't watch out!  Thank you for having him participate with us.  Bob

Hello,

Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year).  The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Tim Johanson
