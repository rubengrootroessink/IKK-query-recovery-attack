Subject:	Gas Tariff Issues at Winkler Co. Point - DRN 42599

For several days recently, gas received at the referenced receipt point has
exceeded the tariff levels for total diluents.  At the present time, the
Winkler Co. receipt point is shut-in because of excess Nitrogen.  Recently
we have been allowing this gas to be delivered at Waha (DRN 68517) instead
of the Winkler Co. (DRN 42599) point.  This is causing large imbalances at
each point which may or may not be able to be offset with each other.  We
would prefer that the gas be received as scheduled at each receipt point.

As stated in the EPNG Tariff under section 5.1.f under Gas Quality:

Diluents  -  The gas shall not at any time contain in excess of three
percent (3%) total diluents (the total combined carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
helium, oxygen, and any other diluent compound) by volume, except for gas
applicable to Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

Sections 5.2 and 5.3 cover receipt locations which have grand-fathered
contracts and arrangements.

While we try to work with our customers when there are slight variations of
the gas quality specifications during customer maintenance activities, it is
important that our customers understand that their gas must meet the
specifications set forth in the tariff.  To the extent that is not possible,
then our gas quality team must make a determination whether the gas must be
shut-in immediately, or whether a waiver can be granted, based on numerous
factors which would include the type of diluent out of spec, the cause and
duration of the problem, and the plan customers have to correct the problem.


It is important that Northern Natural comply with the provisions set in the
EPNG Tariff.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>
