I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?
