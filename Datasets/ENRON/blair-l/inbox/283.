Chris,
I have asked the IT group to see if they can recover the data and a search is underway. A number of the IT staff is on vacation due to the holidays.... so the answer may take some time...I let you know when I know more................

Happy Thanksgiving !

In a second conference call with Alliant, they requested Northern provide them with the storage injection allocations (on Intraday 2) that occurred from November, 1998 through April, 2001 (heating seasons only).

I told them this info must be retrieved from archives.  Let me know how long you think it will take to get this information.

Thanks!
