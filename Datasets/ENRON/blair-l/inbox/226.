Attached is the report I mentioned, in printed form it shows each discount for each path for each contract.  I will mention this to the TW team now, but go over the report in further detail on the first day of invoicing so each can see the discounts for their own shippers.  Hopefully this will reduce future PPA's.

Thanks,
Amy
