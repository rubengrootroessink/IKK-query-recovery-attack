I agree with Lynn's comments with one exception. My understanding is that P=
GAS was to be simply a vehicle to provide the end user volumes to Gas Logis=
tics, in addition to the TBS volumes, as is current practice. We want to pu=
rsue having these volumes supplied to Measurement  via email so that they c=
an be imported electronically. Again, these are not  OMVs in the traditiona=
l sense, since custody transfer has occurred on the TBS volumes. There is c=
urrently no mechanism in place to compare the TBS volumes to the end user v=
olumes other than manually. Additionally, due to the time of the month that=
 these numbers are received, I'm not sure that there is sufficient time to =
argue the accuracy of the numbers . Currently, paragraph 4. of the End User=
 agreement states "The Shipper's transportation agreement will be billed on=
 the actual measured takes at the End User's POI." It does not address any =
differences between the TBS volumes, positive or negative, other than Shipp=
er is responsible for any imbalances resulting from the measured volumes at=
 the End User POI. There are no provisions to challenge the accuracy of the=
 numbers being supplied. Lynn is probably right that we will need some  add=
itional discussions on this.
Thanks-
Gary

=09This is great and reflects my understanding from the meeting.  Let me kn=

Subject:=09RE: End-user Agreement Processes

=09I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meetin=
g yesterday. =20

=09=091.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS phys=
ical
=09                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing sai=
d TBS.

=09=092.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they w=
ere
=09                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we ha=
ve discovered that
=09 =09     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be d=
one).

=09=093.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if nec=
essary) for
=09=09     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this w=
ould be
=09=09     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

=09=094.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers creat=
ed by
=09=09     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater tha=
n the=20
=09=09     TBS connected to NNG.

=09=095.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes in=
cluding
=09=09     End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.

=09After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that n=
either Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
=09negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greate=
r than the TBS the following should happen:

=09=091.  Measurement should either:

=09=09=09a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at =
an end
=09=09=09     user point higher than their TBS.

=09=09=09b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measu=
rement Desk
=09=09=09     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.

=09=092.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, t=
hen measurement will
=09=09     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

=09Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I =
would be glad to regroup if you want.
=09I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on t=
his issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are
=09 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of w=
hy an end user point would be
=09greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We wil=
l let you know the outcome.

=09If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

=09Just wanted to follow-up.  Are we still O.K. with the decisions made in =
the meeting the other day regarding the handling of end-user transactions? =
 Have we run into any additional obstacles?  Do you need me to do anything =
to assist in the process?  If something does change, would you please let m=
e know.  Thanks MW
