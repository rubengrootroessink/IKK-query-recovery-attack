Beginning  10/1/2001, TMS stopped excluding city gates locations from the allocation, thereby they would be subject to allocation, where they were not before,  this was requested by John Buchanan.  Unfortunately or fortunately, NNG customers do not nominate a large portion of their gas to theses city gate locations, rather they nominate to the zone locations, so there is a 99.9% probability, that these city gates would never have to be allocated any way.  

Currently in TMS we exclude the zone nomination locations (OPS type) from the allocation process.  Therefore my question is, since we wanted to include the city gates in the allocation process do we also want to include the zone delivery locations in the allocation process?  Bewlow is a list of OPS type points.
