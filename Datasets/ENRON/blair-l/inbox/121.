As of today, we have e:mailed a list by station ( 7 and/or 16 day charts) t=
o the Measurement Group that need to be read for PPA's to correct the daily=
 volumes for the following shippers:

MidAmerican - 147 stations - to date, Measurement has corrected 44 stations

IES - 87 stations

Interstate Power - 6 stations

Wisconsin Power & Light - 11 stations

In order for us to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we wou=
ld like for Measurement to send us updates as to what station numbers have =
or haven't been done.  We would also like to make sure that they have even =
received all of these October, 2001 charts by December 14 and if they haven=
't, we would like to know which ones they are so that we could help by call=
ing the field personnel to get those charts in ASAP and also, if we could d=
o that for them, then they could continue to input the corrected readings w=
hile we chase down the charts they are missing.  We have given Measurement =
a date of January 3, 2002 (which is the last time that we run prior periods=
) for the date that we would like to have all of these done, but the sooner=
 they get those done, the better because we would like to have plenty of ti=
me to review them and make sure that they are correct.  To make that happen=
, it would help us if they could be done by December 19, which will be the =
first time that we run prior periods.  If we wait until the January 3rd dat=
e, we will only have 1 day to check these invoices to make sure that they a=
re all correct.

Lynn/Rick, I think that Jodie and I need your help in conveying this to Mea=
surement along with copying all of the other people that have been involved=
 with this to make sure that they (Meas.) know the importance of getting th=
is done.  We are depending solely on them to get this accomplished for us a=
nd we just want to make sure that they read all of the stations that we sen=
t them because we want to avoid doing multiple priors on the same months pr=
oduction.  Please let us know if you need any other information.

Thanks,

Jodie and Raetta
