Subject:	Galena/Belleville Firm Volume Split

I have attached a Excel file that includes the Galena/Belleville firm contract volume split out and their respective per cents.  The first page of the sheet has the summary of the data and Galena/Belleville split out, with the second and third sheets indicating the firm contracted volumes in the two groups for the 2001 heating season.

Madison Gas, in their firm contract 21340, does have the ability to deliver to both Madison (POI 53782 - 47,830 MMBTUD) and ANR/NNG Janesville (POI 180 - 46,469 MMBTUD), however, the total at the two points should not exceed 47,830 MMBTUD.  Contractually this creates a "double dip" in the CAS groupings that we "adjust" out of the system.  

The total firm behind Galena is 348,719 MMBTUD and Belleville 258,666 MMBTUD, including the one Daily firm contract for November.  Without the daily firm contract the firm volume is 340,119 MMBTUD for Galena and 250,066 MMBTUD for Belleville.  Please note that with the CAS groupings any firm volumes in the Belleville group are also included in the Galena group.  The Wisconsin Gas contracts are split between the two groups with Galena at 50,490 MMBTUD and Belleville at 25,2444 MMBTUD.  If in the nomination process you include all the Wisconsin Gas Zone nomination in the Belleview group, rather than split the volumes between Galena and Belleville, the  total Belleville nominations could be as high as 275,310 MMBTUD.  Other shippers that have firm volumes split in the two groups include Madison, WEPCO, WP&L and WPS Energy.  The per cent spilt by shipper is indicated in red on the first page of the attached Excel file.

Call if you have any questions.
