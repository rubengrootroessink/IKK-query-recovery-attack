Hi Lynn, I worked through lunch Friday so that I could leave at 4 sorry I missed you.  Attached will be the insert for the Nutcraker Invitation.  Shelley would like for me to get these out ASAP so I just wanted to get your approval on the insert.  Are there any changes you would like for me to make??  Because of paper format you will need to scroll down.  Also will Sheila, Shelley and yourself be taking their own vehicle or would you like for me to rent a van big enough for everyone to be in one group??

 

Thanks,
Ava
