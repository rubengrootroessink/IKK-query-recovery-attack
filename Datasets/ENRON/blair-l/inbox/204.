All I need is a copy of the invoices in order to pursue.  I beleive I have already taken care of the OneOk for January 01.

Thanks!

Hi Vernon!

Karen is out for the rest of the year.  She and I only worked one day together in the past couple of weeks, but I think she mentioned that she had talked to you about 3 A/R lines listed under her name that she thought were your companies----they aren't ones we work with.  The data is:


LAGERSTROM, KAREN	BENNINGFIELD, ROBERT	UNION PACIFIC FUELS, INC.	TPPA98084012	COM	1-Jan-99	24-Sep-98		13,342.90 	
LAGERSTROM, KAREN	BENNINGFIELD, ROBERT	KN MARKETING, L.P.	T17900052175	COM	12-Jun-00	22-Jun-00		9,249.28 	
LAGERSTROM, KAREN	LINHART, JOE	ONEOK ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING T17901014021	COM	12-Feb-01	22-Feb-01		35,163.87 		

Just wanted to make sure you are aware of these and confirm that they are companies you work with.  Karen sent a note to Robert Benningfield asking for a status report for everything showing under her, and she included these.  If I don't hear from Robert, I'll call him on Monday.  

Thanks,

Joni
