Rick, just wanted to let you know that the balance left to collect for our Reservation invoices as of right now is $371,134.43.   I have Renee in my office right now and she has the wire information for MidAmerican - the total that we need to send them for A/R and OBA is $1,762,907.66 which will need to go out on 12/26/2001. If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta
