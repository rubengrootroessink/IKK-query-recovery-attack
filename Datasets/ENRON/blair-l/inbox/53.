Dale, two gentlemen from Williams visited Debra and myself on Monday to discuss the operations of MOPS:  

Greg Poynter, Manager, Gas Control -- telephone:  918-574-9196, fax:  918-574-9609; e-mail:  greg.poynter@williams.com
Frank Billings, Director, Gas Management & Gas Control -- telephone:  918-574-9157; fax:  918-574-9237; e-mail:  frank.billings@williams.com

During the course of the conversation, they requested an IT contact who would be able to help them determine the system requirements necessary.  John gave them your name and we told them we would forward your telephone number to their attention this morning.

Should you have any questions, please advise -- thanks.
