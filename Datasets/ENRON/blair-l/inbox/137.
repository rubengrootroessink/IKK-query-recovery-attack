Due to the complications I am having with my right eye following the Lasik Enhancement, I am going to be going to the eye doctor more frequently than planned.

I have another appointment at the eye doctor tomorrow Thursday, the 13th @ 2:15 pm.  Since this will basically consume most of the afternoon I went ahead and made a follow-up appointment with my primary care doctor.  He has increased my diabetes Rx and needs to evaluate it's effectiveness.
