Beverly was given administrative rights, since she worked from home and that is why she has not experienced any problems. But, the rest of the team has experienced  some of the same issue you guys have. Kathy Royal with El Paso has their IT person working with Jean McFarland on our side to try and resolve these issue by the Jan. 6th deadline. If you have further questions or concerns, please ask. Thank you.

John & Terry,

My understanding is this request was to allow the changes EPNG might institute to be automatically accessed without our losing our ability to nominate in the new Passport system.  In the past, when EPNG institutes updates (I seem to recall the phrase, "changing the Java script"), we are unable to access Passport 2000.  I also understand efforts are underway to get this worked out with EPNG "IT" without our being given administrative access.  Scott had advised IT around the first of November that the old Passport would be suspended.

EPNG has extended the date to January 6th for the old Passport system to be suspended.  After that time, until whatever is worked out between the IT groups, when the EPNG updates occur, we will be unable to electronically confirm.  I would be interested in knowing how this has affected TWPL.  I had understood Beverly encountered no difficulties at any time.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.
