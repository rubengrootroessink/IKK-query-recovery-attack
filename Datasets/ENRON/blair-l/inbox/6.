   I  wanted to give you the results of the request  that you gave me on Friday.
   This is the info I was able to gather.  Several of them had already left for the day.


   Becky  Wells                                       Boss or supervisor:

   Conoco                                                 Susan.L.Griffin@usa.conoco.com           
   c.j.barrera@usa.conoco.com                                                          
                                                               C.J. informed me that his supervisor did not want to receive
                                                               any extra e-mails, so he would not give me the address.
                                                                He said that only the two designated schedulers should receive
                                                                the e-mails.
