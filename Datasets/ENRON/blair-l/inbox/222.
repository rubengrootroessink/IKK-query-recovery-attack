NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space cau=
sing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the=
 ID1 cycle. The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , To=
by responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not g=
et a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for =
over two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so w=
e could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem wo=
uld be resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , w=
e were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecti=
ng print servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washing=
ton could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the So=
lution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we we=
nt through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen respon=
ded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through =
this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support=
 people.
