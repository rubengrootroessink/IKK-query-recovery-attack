Reyna and Michele,

What do you think of the idea that We place the NNG and Procedures for Offsystem Transactions in a header to the document with Michele's as Part A - Initiation & Regulatory; Reyna's Part B - Deal making and Mine Part C Nominations & Scheduling. From that the procedures could be subdivide for 3rd Party storage or transportation.

Reyna... also in your Part B & C Specific Deal & Fuel....It is Gas Logistics' recommendation that Marketing e-mail the Deal/Purchase sheet to Chris and Debbie with copies going to Lynn and Myself. That way in Chris' absence, someone can follow up on the nom/scheduling.
