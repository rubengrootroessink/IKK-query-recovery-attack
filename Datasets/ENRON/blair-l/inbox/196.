Based on this,  I assume the memo is being changed to say that "the agreed upon measurement volume for the period is 567,546.5."  I'm ok with the letter-  
Do we need to send the dispute resolution letter as a precaution in case Oneok wants to change this settlement.  Or should we have them send us confirmation that the dispute response is suspended pending final resolution of this agreement.  MK

	Harry and I agree.  The 567,546.5 is the same number we came up with.  Thanks. Lynn

	Charlie,

	I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed upon difference.

		Charlie sent me the following message.
		"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
		As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

				Dari, Harry and I have run through the numbers and how we will show the difference on the
				books and agree with your number. Thanks. Lynn

					Dari,

					Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.


					Date		Plant PTR		NNG PTR		Difference
					9/12/2001	88,335			90,910			2,575
					9/13/2001	92,175			95,968			3,793
					9/14/2001	93,525			96,151			2,626
