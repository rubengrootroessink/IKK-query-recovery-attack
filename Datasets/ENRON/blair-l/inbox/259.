Dana,

Let me know if this is closer to what you want. 
There are three tabs in the report.
	 1) Summary by Customer
	 2) Summary by Amounts
	 3) Detail by Customer

The data is exported from SAP into an Excel spreadsheet. It takes 20 minutes to run the SAP report, export to Excel and format the Excel spreadsheet. A Business Objects report is refreshed (takes about a minute) to pick up the most current data from the Excel spreadsheet. 

The reports can be accessed directly from Business Objects if you prefer. I sent you the Business Objects report also.
