 Ava told me you were on Jury Duty on Monday.  I meant Tuesday, Oct. 30th, if you are that day.  Sorry for the mistake.

Randy

We have tenatively scheduled a meeting with Lynn to discuss the problems we are experiencing with Amarillo Natural Gas.  The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe!  

Date: Monday, Oct. 29th
Time: 9:00 am
Place: Lynn's Office

Any questions, please let me know.

Randy
