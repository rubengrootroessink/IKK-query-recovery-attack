Security, Everyone on the attached list will require after hours access to the common areas on EB39 and EB42. Please configure their access for both floors and then confirm back to us when completed.

Gary, the attached is a list of the Gas Logistics department that will require access into the common areas of the 39th and 42nd floors 24 hours, 7 days a week.
 
On the bottom left side of this document you will see Josh/Pager listed which you can disreguard because he is listed under Rick Dietz group.
 
Thanks for your help!!!!
