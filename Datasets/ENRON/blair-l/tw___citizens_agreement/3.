Ava,
Commencing with the August 15 pay period, please start coding 100% of Amy Milligan's time to work order E002494.03.  This is according to our payout for the Citizens/EAMR agreement.  Continue to use this methodology until further notice.

If you have any questions, please advise.

Thanks,
Donna
