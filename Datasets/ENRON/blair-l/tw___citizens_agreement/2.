Effective August 1, 2001, Enron Asset Management Resources will be acting as agent for the Citizens Communications Company at the Griffith interconnects on both Transwestern and El Paso.  I will be the primary scheduler in charge of communicating with the plant regarding its needs, confirming the gas at both interconnects, managing the OBA's, and allocating flows to the owners of the plant.

In order to ensure a smooth transition, I will probably be in close contact with each of you.  For the time being, we will use the burn estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.

Thank you for all your cooperation.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Sincerely, 
Amy Mulligan
