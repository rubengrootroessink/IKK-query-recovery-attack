I submitted the estimated headcount worksheets today based on the assumptions from the following worksheet.  The worksheet reflects the cost center that each employee is identified under in the HR system.  Please review this information and start to think about how employees need to be realigned in 2002 to accurately reflect what company they should roll-up to.  We will need to identify this information soon for budget purposes.  For individuals that provide services for more than one company I will need a % breakout for each company.  If you have any questions, please advise.
Donna
