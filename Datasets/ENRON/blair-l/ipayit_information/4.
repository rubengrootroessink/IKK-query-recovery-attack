Effective today, you will notice many iPayit improvements.  iPayit is Enron's tool to code and approve invoices.  Your feedback has directly driven these changes, and the iPayit team and your business unit representatives are continuing to identify and prioritize future system enhancements.

Resolution Type
iPayit inbox now displays updated invoice status once all coding has been applied to the invoice.  The resolution type will display "Needs Approval".

"On Hold" Status Information
The reason a transaction is on hold and the expected resolution date can be viewed by hovering your cursor over the "On Hold" icon.

Improved Search Functions
* Streamlined search for Tax Jurisdiction Codes by entering one or more data points with fewer clicks.  You are no longer required to enter all four search criteria.
* New search boxes to generate Material Numbers and Descriptions and Functional Area Numbers and Descriptions.  You will no longer see the drop down boxes with truncated information. 

Advanced G/L Account Coding Combinations
You now have the ability to enter Balance Sheet Accounts 2, 3 series and Revenue/COGS Accounts 50, 51 series in invoice line item coding.
