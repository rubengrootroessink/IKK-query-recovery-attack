Shirley,
We will not allow furniture to be removed from the Enron Bldg. for a home office pilot program. After the pilot period has passed and you, ETS, and your team decides working from home is a fit for you then ETS will consider reimbursing you for a chair.

     Things are progressing, ever so slowly, on my work from home test. Some problems with Black Ice have not yet been
     solved. I just sent a memo to Glenn Stovall telling him that I will be out of the office on vacation until July 23, but to please
     keep at it. I've already had the phone company and Roadrunner to my house for the installations. Alma has provided me
     with a cell phone. The team has been discussing all the issues involved regarding communication, etc. when I am working
     from home. With the delays, it looks like the parallel with a backup in the office won't start until August. Thus, Nancy will
     be my backup for the parallel since she is the August backup. Jean will be covering my vacation as the July backup. My
     childcare arrangements will not change when I start working from home. Zach will continue his afternoon childcare routine
     and my husband, Steve, cares for him in the evening. My home office is upstairs in an unused bedroom. I've got two desks
     to cover my work computer and the home computer we already had. I'm concerned about the chair situation. My office chair
     doesn't offer the back support needed for full-time use that my Enron chair provides. Can I use my Enron chair at home? I
     will come in once a week on Tuesday afternoons for meetings and interface with my team. My team is supportive of me in         
     this opportunity and I am committed to providing excellent night owl coverage.
