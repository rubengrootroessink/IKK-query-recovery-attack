      Rick,

      Thanks.  I understand that the ESD is an annual simulated emergency d=
epressurization of the ETS compressor station on the lean and rich lines up=
stream of the Bushton Plant.  By operating the ESD valve, all the gas pipin=
g in the plant yard can be blown to atmosphere by Northern.  If that is don=
e, the Bushton Plant obviously goes down and loses the ability to service i=
ts customers for a period of time. =20

      You advised that in ESD simulations conducted in years past, we did n=
ot require the compressor to be fully blow down; we performed it in such a =
way that no depressurization at all was required, so the Bushton Plant was =
not out of service at all during the ESD simulations.  This year, however, =
someone in Northern's compliance section (maybe Pat Long's group) has requi=
red that the ESD simulation be conducted in such a way that partial depress=
urization of the yard piping will be necessary.  Northern has figured out a=
 way to do this such that the flow of gas to the Bushton Plant will be unin=
terrupted, with some small pressure changes.

     The ESD would normally last 15-30 minutes; however, Northern would als=
o like to take the opportunity to perform needed work on the Northern gener=
ators located
at the ETS compressor station as well.  This will extend the simulation per=
iod to about two hours.  During this time, Northern's measurement equipment=
 (the meters, the chromatograph, and the two Fisher Rocs) will be on batter=
y backup.  You mentioned that the big power hog would be the gas chromatogr=
aph.=09

    My gut is that we don't want to take any unnecessary chance that our ba=
ck-up batteries would fail and leave us in a position where we had to rely =
on Plant PTR. Accordingly, my suggestions is that we should immediately inv=
estigate renting a Honda generator or some other back-up power source, and =
call Jim Bowen of Instromet for his input.  Please remember that although J=
im was our expert in the arbitration, you don't want to just forward our in=
ternal memos and correspondence to him without checking with me first.

     I await the input of others.

    (Parenthetically, for the time being, I am asking that everyone put "No=
rthern v. ONEOK" in the Subject line of internal e-mails regarding gas meas=
urement at the Bushton Plant, given that we still have a lawsuit pending.  =
This applies whether or not the e-mail includes someone in Legal.)=09

Yesterday I visited with Mike Peschka and Casey Winter at the Bushton compr=
essor station, they mentioned a possible problem next week.  On October 11 =
the Bushton Plant will have a planned ESD.  A normal ESD would blow all pip=
ing down in the plant  yard, so no gas would flow to the Oneok processing p=
lant for a period of time.  This year certain blowdown valves will be block=
ed so gas will continue to flow to the Oneok processing plant, this will al=
low the Oneok plant to stay on.  Oneok requested that we maintain gas flows=
 to their plant, since they have no planned turn around this year.  The Bus=
hton measurement equipment will need to be functioning the entire time of t=
he ESD (this includes the chromatograph, Fisher Rocs, and the ultrasonic me=
ters), since gas will be flowing to the Oneok plant and back to us.  While =
the ETS compressor station is down, during the ESD, there will be work comp=
leted on the electrical equipment.  This work could take up to 5 hours, but=
 Casey hopes to complete the work in approximately 2 hours.  The back-up ba=
tteries will maintain power, to the measurement equipment, approximately 2 =
hours.  The potential problem is that if the work takes more than 2 hours t=
he batteries may fail, and we could lose measurement for a period of time. =
 Considering the Oneok measurement situation, we thought it might make sens=
e to notify you of this potential problem.  Thanks, please call if you have=
 questions.
