Oneok sends Northern helium volumes monthly attached to their Third Party Bushton Allocation Report. Oneok ran a test for November's Production which produced some volume (approximately 1000 mcf per Sherry Rogers /Oneok) to be reflected on their statement for November's production. Market Services will keep you undated each month by e-mail on any actual helium produced at the Bushton Plant.

If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 853-6600.
