This is the schedule so far for Mr. Formaggio, who has asked to meet with someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (dispatching, the nomination and balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major aspects of third-party-access implementation, including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines).

He was scheduled to arrive this afternoon, and will be staying at the Hyatt Regency.  

Thursday, 8/23

9:00 through	Arrive at Enron.  He was given either Ginger Dernehl or myself as initial contacts.  
   Lunch	Advise John Buchanan of arrival (X.37429).  
	John will come to 47 to escort Mauro down to 41 for presentations by Lynn Blair and others about ETS gas logistics.
	Then Mauro will meet with Dannis Bellard for a tour of Gas Control.

3:30-4:30	Meet with Julie Gomez, VP of Long-Term Fundamentals-Gas


Friday, 8/24

11:00-12:00	Meet with Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes, Government Affairs-The Americas

I am trying to arrange a meeting also with George Smith, either at about 2:00 on Thursday or on Friday morning.  He is a manager in the EWS logistics area who could talk about pipeline operation from the shipper perspective.
