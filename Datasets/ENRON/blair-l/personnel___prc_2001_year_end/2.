There is new information in our TEAM PROCEDURE BOOK ( The White Binder that has our lovely team picture on it) This information includes plant procedures for locations that NNG does not have set control on. This is a guideline that the after hours / weekend rep can use as a reference when gas controls calls with a problem. The phone numbers and contacts are up to date,  however some of the plant names should be updated. I'll work on that part next. Joe and I will also put this information in a common folder so the team can update and can keep things current. This will be in the book tabbed "PLANT PROCEDURES" . remember these are locations NNG has no set control.

thanks,

Joe Linhart
