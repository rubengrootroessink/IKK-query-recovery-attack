Attached is a list of proposed capital IT projects for 2002.  This list has been developed by the Commercial Support Systems group and is not intended to be a complete list.  Please review the list and let me know if there are additional projects to add or there is a concern with projects on the list.  I expect that we will discuss in Shelley's staff meeting tomorrow morning.  

Thanks, 

Brad
