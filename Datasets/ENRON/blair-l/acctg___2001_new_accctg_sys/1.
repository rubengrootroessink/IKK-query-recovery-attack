	Rob, attached is the Customizations Acctg Matrix. I inserted changes on the first page only as I had to leave the meeting yesterday and therefore do not know what else was changed.  Please read through the changes on the first page to see if you agree with them.  Please make changes where appropriate.  

Thanks and I will see you all next Thursday!!!

Jim
