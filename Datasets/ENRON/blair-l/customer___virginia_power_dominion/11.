This notice is for Market Area Deliveries.  If you are not delivering in the Market Area, then this shouldn't impact you.  The DDVC penalties are assessed on the Shipper.  If you are not the Shipper and are only selling gas to a Shipper, again, you should not be impacted.  If your supply cut causes a Shipper to incur penalties, then the recourse for the Shipper may be in the sales contract which is between you and the Shipper.

How would this hurt us if we were only selling gas at Demarc, or other pooling
pts?  Not at all correct?
