Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time?

If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from?
The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.?

and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.

> nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?
>
>         Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount
> or volume lower than scheduled amount
>                (2) RANK changed to a different number
>
>    2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in
> relation to mandatory monthly cash out?
>
>         Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E
>
>    3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc
> allocation?
>
>         Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only
> two points in the group
>
>    4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is
> allocated, can Virginia Power
>         switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and
> keep their gas flowing?
>
>         Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery
> IS included in a demarc allocation
>                because the transport tied to this storage
> nomination is physically coming from
>                       the field to the market area. (Greg we may
> not have been clear on this comment
>                on the conference call)
