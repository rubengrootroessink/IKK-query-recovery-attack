About the PAAs-

You may fill out one PAA form for all the folks that have the same justification.  In the name section type "Various - see attached list".  Then,  fill out the details on each person with a supplemental sheet.  Provided is a template.  

When complete, submit to Tracy Scott.  Hopefully, this will save some time.

Thanks,
