Lynn & Vernon....FYI...Below is Gerry's response to Vernon's 'Demarc Allocation / Trailbazer sourced gas' questions......that is if I asked the questions correctly.....
Does this get us to what we need or does it just lead to more questions? 

Let me know if I need to gather more answers.............

Vernon Mercaldo has asked for verification that.... 
1.) A shipper receiving gas at the Trailblazer interconnect and delivering said gas in the field will be excluded from a Demarc Allocation.
[Medeles, Gerry]  Yes that is correct.
 
2.) The same shipper receives gas at Trailblazer Interconnect transports the gas to Demarc Storage and  then the gas is sold to another party at Demarc Storage. The gas is then transported from Demarc storage to the field. Is this scenario also excluded from a demarc allocation?
[Medeles, Gerry]  Yes that is also exluded.  But when we look at the allocation we only look at the tranport to Demarc Storage and the transport away from Demarc storage.

3.) Would the activity be excluded from a Demarc Allocation if a different shipper was involved at the different points..i.e. Shipper A receives the gas at Trailblazer delivers the gas to Demarc storage . Shipper B picks it up at Demarc Storage and delivers it Demarc,. Shipper C picks up the gas at Demarc and delivers it somewhere in the field.... 
[Medeles, Gerry]  See response above.  The allocation process (at this time) does not look at any other Demarc to Demarc, activity.  Only the activity to Demarc and away from Demarc.
