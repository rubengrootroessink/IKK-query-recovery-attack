	Attached is the "Quick Tip" document that I have prepared to help us with the customer training.  Please review the document and I will set up a meeting next week to go over any questions or concerns.  Attached is the list of the customers that will be attending the training, let me know if there is specific customer or customers that you would rather visit with.  A schedule of the hands on training will be distributed at the time of registration.   

Thanks,

Maggie
