Here is the final version, which includes rate information for contract #27495 and rate verification for all other contracts under Item 1 by TK.  I received no other comments except for Rita's emails informing me that she and Mary Kay were OK with the preliminary report pending the rate updates.  Please let me know if you have any problems or questions.

Rita - Thanks for separating into individual files in preparation for mailout of the monthly filing.
