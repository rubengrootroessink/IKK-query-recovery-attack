Please see the attached Email from Mike Hogan, one of MEC's System Operator=
s. Obviously, we have a problem. Northern's actions over the last 10 days h=
ave been reckless, completely unacceptable and in violation of MEC's agreem=
ents, NNG's tariff and many years of operational precedent. In addition to =
the financial risk that NNG is assuming resulting from supply allocations i=
t has implemented based on hourly flow, NNG's restriction of MEC flow withi=
n its firm rights elevates NNG's risk to an extreme level. Under certain ci=
rcumstances, the actions that NNG has recently demonstrated may result in t=
he loss of service to a portion of MEC's distribution system. The fact that=
 neither you, members of your staff nor NNG operations personnel have been =
able to explain to any degree of specificity or accuracy the new operating =
practices that NNG has unilaterally and abruptly implemented is unconsciona=
ble. Accordingly, I have no alternative other than to request that NNG meet=
 the specific requirements of its tariff (including but not limited to Sect=
ion 19.A.6) by providing MEC with all information, including affidavits, ex=
plaining in detail NNG's restriction of flow and/or supply allocations on e=
ach day from May 30 through June 8. Please also consider this correspondenc=
e as a request for the same information  related to any future day where NN=
G takes such action.

As always, I am available to discuss MEC's position in detail.=20

After Mike Stoner worked on the control valve @ Vinton I had to put in a lo=
w set point and come up gradually to keep NNG's and MEC's control valves fr=
om fighting each other.  This was around 1915.  Around 2030 the control val=
ves started fighting each other again.  I waited for a while to see if they=
 would settle down.  They didn't.  I called NNG control (Richard) and reque=
sted he set in a slightly higher set point to help alleviate the problem.  =
He refused.  He said their orders were to set in 50,000/day (2083/hr) and n=
ot to exceed it.  I tried to explain that since we were under that hourly a=
verage earlier in the day he needed to set his a little higher so we could =
get in all the gas.  He refused.  I used a set point of 2083/hr to match NN=
G's and hopefully get the control valves in sync.  Therefore we are not goi=
ng to hit our target without doing a storage netting nom in the A.M.  The s=
oap opera continues.......................

Thanks,=20
