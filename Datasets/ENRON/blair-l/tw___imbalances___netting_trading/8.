Let's plan on meeting today after Steve's staff meeting to discuss.  The existing imbalances as of the effective date of the tariff OBA will have to be individually negotiated with the party to resolve separate and apart from any imbalance that occurs under the new OBA.  TW's tariff states that if the OBA party does not execute/sign the tariff OBA, they are still subject to the tariff OBA if they physically receive or deliver gas into/out of Transwestern's system. These relationships will have to be managed carefully from all sides to resolve the old imbalances while moving forward with the tariff OBA for new imbalances.  

Thanks, Kim.

A couple of items need to be discussed:

If these volumetric contracts are changed to dollar valued obas as of their new effective dates, how will the accumulated volume balances as of the effective date be handled.  Also, what will be our game plan if the parties refuse to acknowledge the tariff oba.

Dennis - The following parties' volumetric OBAs were provided notification of termination last Friday.  Each party will need a new OBA (TW tariff OBA) contract set up in the system.  Please refer to the information below to properly account for imbalances and paybacks as we move these parties from volumetric to dollar valued OBAs.
