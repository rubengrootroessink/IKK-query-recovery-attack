I sent the information to Tim Jones and he adjusted all of the documents with the 2002 numbers. I copied Donna Scott, Terry and Darrell on the 2002 numbers also. I have not heard back from Tim on any issues at this time, nor have I heard of any meetings.

Gentlemen, see attached proposed 2002 Partnership Budgets for our upcoming meeting (Dates Pending).  Any questions/concerns/changes, call me.

NOTE:  J. Buchanan, per our telco, I revised the Market Services Attach#3 to reflect 2001 budget plus 3.5% for 2002.
