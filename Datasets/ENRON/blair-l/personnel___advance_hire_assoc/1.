Lynn,
 I did an orientation on Nominations, Scheduling and Allocations with all three new hires.
Terry is working on the Compressor station field trip.
The teams are training as if the new hires were going to stay on their team.
South Central team has a training agenda for Cara they are going to share with TW and the North team.
Florida is waiting on May Lou to come back to have time to get Jacob to Gas Control.

Lynn, to summarize and remind us of the to do's from the luncheon.

Scott liked having a daily training agenda.
Terry and I should do the Nomination and Scheduling presentation to new hires that was done for IT.
Jacob needs to be scheduled to spend time in Gas Control
Lynn is going to contact Dan Pribble about taking new hires to a compressor station.
Teams need to be comfortable in training new hires in all aspects wheatear they know how long new hires will be on their team.

Other than that Scott and Jacob seemed satisfied with their training and progress in Customer Service.
