Lynn,  I had talked to shelley right before I went on vacation about some openings you had in the scheduling area.  I don't know if she mentioned this, but christopher (my son) and a friend of his from Mount Michael are interested in applying for them.  I forwarded Pat Barry's to Shelley and Mike Barry in marketing sent Christopher's to her.  Thought I'd let you know since it appeared that shelley was on vaction and I wasn't sure when she would return.  Let me know if Mike needs to send Christopher's directly to you also.   thanks for any consideration     
How is everything else going? Oneok decision was good, except for the meter error issue.   MK
