Attached is the prioritization list of the system enhancements from this morning's meeting.  As we discussed, the estimated timetable to implement these changes will be before the end of the year.  If there are delays in any of these items, whereby a December 30 deadline can't be met,  please let me know ASAP.  We intend to communicate to customers early next year as to our progress on these items and other customer service enhancements.  

In addition, I have attached the first set of FAQ's that will be distributed to customers and posted on the website.
