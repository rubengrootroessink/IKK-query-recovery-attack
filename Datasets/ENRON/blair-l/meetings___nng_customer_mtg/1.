Attached is the compilation of customer comments from the NNG customer meeting.  I have made a rough attempt at categorizing them.  Many of these concerns were discussed in the process improvement sessions.  There will be follow up meetings to prioritize and address these issues this week.  Please take some time to review these comments.
