Subject:=09RE: RER Dec '00 Receivable

Vicki & Bill,
Just wanted to let you know that Dari and I have reviewed this RER issue re=
garding the usage of SMS at alternate points.  We stand strong in our inter=
pretation of how SMS is applied at alternate points on an SOL day; however,=
 given that RER did in fact correct their usage of SMS once they were notif=
ied in February with an answer to their questions from December, we can see=
 the logic in waiving a portion of the accrued DDVCs.  At this point we are=
 more than happy to draft a letter to the customer, but we are looking to y=
ou to let us know how you would like to proceed.  If there is value in work=
ing with the customer on this issue, we will record an entry in the waiver =
log for RER.  We wouldn't be changing the manner in which SMS is applied du=
ring an SOL day at an alternate point, but we would be recognizing that cir=
cumstances warrant waiver in this situation.  At this time if you would pre=
fer not to waive the charges, we will proceed ahead with drafting a respons=
e to the customer.  Please let us know the direction you would like to take=
.

Ranelle & Dari

Subject:=09RER Dec '00 Receivable

Hey guys,

As an update to the RER Receivable, they have paid the outstanding dollars =
due on their November 2000 invoice; however, they continue to claim that No=
vember was paid in good faith (for whatever it's worth) and they have no in=
tention of paying the December 2000 invoice of approximately $132,000.

Back in May you asked whether or not RER had incurred similar charges the p=
rior heating season.  Lisa and I pulled the January 2000 DDVC/SMS Charges a=
nd indeed RER was not allocated or did not utilize SMS on SOL days when sch=
eduled deliveries at alternate points were below their Contract Entitlement=
.  However, the order of magnitude was significantly smaller with less end =
user points and the occurrence was comparably infrequent since it appears f=
rom the documentation that they tended to schedule long on most days during=
 January.

I think we need to move forward to resolve this issue.  I would very much a=
ppreciate your help in drafting a response to their request, per my e-mail =
below, to provide in writing our position and supporting provisions of the =
tariff.

Anyone other suggestions on an alternative approach?

Thanks much,
Vicki

Vicki,
Can you fax the letter that Doug sent to me (or if you have already sent it=
 to Dari, I can get a copy from her)?  My fax # is 402-398-7006.  I will ge=
t with Dari and Mary Darveaux on this.

I talked with Doug Stark at Reliant Energy Retail (RER) this afternoon rega=
rding their outstanding invoices for SMS/DDVC charges in Nov'00 and Dec'00 =
.  Pursuant to that conversation, Doug indicated that in good faith RER wil=
l agree to pay NNG for the Nov'00 charges of approx.$87,000; however, RER d=
oes not intend to pay the Dec'00 charges of approx. $132,000.  RER continue=
s to dispute NNG's position or tariff interpretation which does not allow S=
MS to be used at alternate points on SOL days when their FT contract is not=
 fully utilized.  I should say that they acknowledge or understand that int=
erpretation going forward; however, RER's position is that in the penalty p=
rovision sections of the tariff, it does not specifically address those cha=
rges at alternate points such that without further definition RER's interpr=
etation is appropriate.

I have communicated to RER that after thorough review, Northern strongly be=
lieves the SMS/DDVC charges are appropriately due.  However, RER did call t=
o discuss their November bill in mid-December and with our transition of pe=
ople, they did not get a response back from me until the end of January 200=
1.  Therefore, I could be convinced to negotiate a portion of the charges d=
ue for Dec'00; however, at this point, I would not recommend we agree to wa=
ive them in total.

Dari/Ranelle - Doug did request a letter from us which articulates our posi=
tion and includes supporting provisions of the tariff.  Also, he  sent a le=
tter dated March 1, 2001 with their position which I will fax to you if you=
 don't have a copy.  Some of the points in his letter have since been resol=
ved so please call to discuss if you reference the same.

Any other suggestions on how we should proceed?
