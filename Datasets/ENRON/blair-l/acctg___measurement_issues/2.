As we discussed, we have had inadequate measurement devices at several loca=
tions on the NNG pipeline system since the advent of FERC 636. Nominations,=
 penalties, and all monetary business issues are being conducted on a daily=
 basis, and we currently do not have the tools in the field to accommodate =
these daily transactions. Most of these locations are low volume stations t=
hat traditional economics probably do not support full blown EFM. However, =
there is an associated cost of doing business that can't be ignored as we h=
ave in the past. The Bullhorn AMR device is a compromise to EFM but would s=
atisfy the requirement for daily readings that are needed to calculate the =
volumes.  This issue has become very visible lately due to complaints from =
our customers and the fact that we are assessing penalties on systematicall=
y determined daily volumes. We need to begin replacing this antiquated tech=
nology as soon as possible via what ever funding mechanisms that are availa=
ble to us. We would probably begin with the most vocal customers and hopefu=
lly eliminate all PD charts in the very near future. The  attached document=
 briefly explains the problem that exists today. Let me know if you would l=
ike to discuss this further.
Thanks-
Gary
