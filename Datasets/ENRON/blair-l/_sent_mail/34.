Enron has recently implemented a contract with UPS to cover all of our overnight and shipping needs.  One of their major account directors would like to come and meet with us next Tuesday (since Monday's are so hectic) June 19th.  Please let me know what time would be convenient for you to watch a demo they would like to give us concerning their on-line services.  If, after reviewing the documents below, you feel like you would not require this overview, please advise.

Thank you,
Ricki
