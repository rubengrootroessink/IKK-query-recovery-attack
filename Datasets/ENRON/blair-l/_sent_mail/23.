Sharon, I am doing very well but cannot come back to work until
Tuesday.  They will remove all the drain tubes Monday.  
Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  I'll see you on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn

Just wanted to check in with you.  Hopefully by today you're feeling pretty good.  Be glad when you get back.  You know I'm stuck here with kids, what a way to start off the morning.  Just rolling along with my new Windows 2000/Outlook, takes some getting used to but we always adapt.  Get some rest and get back here!
