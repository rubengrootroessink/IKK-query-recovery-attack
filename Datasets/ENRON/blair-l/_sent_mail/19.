Ava,
A conference room will not be necessary. You will only need a computer
w/Internet access. 
Anthony Burgs (UPS), Mike Boyd (UPS) and Glenn Lewis (Enron) will be there
to walk you through the transition.  Mike will transfer all your files for
you and set up w/the UPS software (WorldShip). Let me know if you have any
questions. 
Thanks,
Verna

Would like to have UPS orientation on Monday, June 25th at 2pm.  Please
let me know if I will need to schedule a conference room.  
For Fed-Ex I have a software installed to print out my monthly labels do
you have a UPS software  where I could do the same and is it possible to
transfer all my information from Fed-Ex to UPS?  

Thanks,
Ava-35842
