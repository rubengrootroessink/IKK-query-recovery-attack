Ava & Alma, since I don't know what day's I will be in the office, I have decided to let the two of you set the date on the UPS on-line training.

There is a catch,,,,,,,,, if I miss the overview, you will have to train me....

Ava, would you please reply to Lewis and Verna and let them know what is convenient for you, since you have Reservation Invoices going out next week.

Thank you,
Ricki
