Subject:	Update NNG Doc System by Tuesday, June 19th


The NNG Doc System is now open and  ready for your updates on OBA imbalances.  Please input your updates before Tuesday, June 19th, 5pm.

The reason for the short timeframe is due to the WINDOWS 2000 upgrades on the nights of June 19 & 20 and the unavailability of the DOC system during this time.

Please see me if you have any questions.


Larry
