Attached are the volumes and related values(San Juan index) for the La Plata "A" Fuel from September 1996 through April 2001.   We need to meet to discuss the issues related to this potential liability of $367k(total volume * SJ index * .05) and subsequent liability.

I am in the Transaction Tax Section.  I talked to Rich Jolly.  He said you might have the volume, BTU and value of gas that was consumed in our Colorado compressor 
station(s) since the acquisition of the La Plata facility.  Can you call me at Ext. 35734 so we can discuss the details of this request?
