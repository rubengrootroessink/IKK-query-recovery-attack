Mike, since Terry is out this week, can you take the lead to find out
status of this report as you are checking to consistency with this report
and the automation of the storage report.  Let's discuss on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Modification to the new daily SCADA Report

Here are the stored procedures with their parameters in parenthesis.  Most of them are single selects and could be incorporated into SQL in the Excel add-in if desired.  I thought stored procedures would make it easier to separate support for the add-in from support for the code.  The stored procedures are all on the server ETSADHOC, database adhoctest, under my id (dpowell).  I think we want to get the DBA's to move these into a production environment so they are protected (ie: dbo in the etsadhoc database)?
