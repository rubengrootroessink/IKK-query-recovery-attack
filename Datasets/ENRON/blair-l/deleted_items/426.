I would have no idea of which customers would be sent cut notices or confirmation notices from cycle to cycle it depends on who would gets cut during each cycle. Also we have home office persons that depend on Email to communicate with customers which are Beverly Miller, Shirley Walden and Mary Lou Phillips. We also have in the office Cara Vaughan and Janet McDaniel. I still can not authorize a non emergency outage of Outlook during ETS normal business hours.

EMA,

A customer, John Buchanan with ETS, states that the outage must not start BEFORE 10:30 PM.  They have a scheduled maintenance cycle at 10:30 PM and they need to be able to send out confirmation emails to customers until that time.

Please communicate with John at 3-7429 and coordinate this outage.

Thanks,

Melody Gray
