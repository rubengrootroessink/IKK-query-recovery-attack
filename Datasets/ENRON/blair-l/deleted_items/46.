 Your inspirational quote for the day:  [IMAGE]     Hang Onto Each Other   =
[IMAGE]  Too often we feel alone. But there is always someone ready to take=
 our hand. There is a beautiful story of an overworked nurse who escorted a=
 tired, young man to her patient's bed -side. Leaning over and speaking lou=
dly to the elderly patient, she said, "Your son is here."   With great effo=
rt, his unfocussed eyes opened, then flickered shut again. The young man sq=
ueezed the aged hand in his and sat beside the bed. Throughout the night he=
 sat there, holding the old man's hand and whispering words of comfort.   B=
y morning's light, the patient had died. In moments, hospital staff swarmed=
 into the room to turn off machines and remove needles. The nurse stepped o=
ver to the young man's side and began to offer sympathy, but he interrupted=
 her.   "Who was that man?" he asked.   The startled nurse replied, "I thou=
ght he was your father!" "No, he was not my father", he answered. I never s=
aw him before in my life." "Then, why didn't you say something when I took =
you to him?"   "I realized he needed his son and his son wasn't here", the =
man explained. "And since he was too sick to recognize that I was not his s=
on, I knew he needed me."   Mother Teresa used to remind us that nobody sho=
uld have to die alone. Likewise, nobody should have to grieve alone or cry =
alone either. Or laugh alone or celebrate alone.   We are made to travel li=
fe's journey hand in hand. There is someone ready to grasp your hand today.=
 And someone hoping you will take theirs. Remember To Hang On To One Anothe=
