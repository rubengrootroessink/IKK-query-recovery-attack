We will be traveling all day Wednesday, November 21 and Monday November 26th.  My pager should work
most of that time. 
 
Otherwise you can reach me at 580-338-3929 (my sister in law Jan Goad) Wednesday night through Monday morning.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving and I'll see you on Tuesday.  Thanks. Lynn
