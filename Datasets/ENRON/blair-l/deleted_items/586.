Natural Gas Futures Dip as Cash Tumbles



    Natural gas futures for December delivery on the NYMEX dipped
only $0.039 to $2.813 last Wednesday with traders concerned about a
near-term rallying trend and possible colder weather soon. The
January contract settled at 2.991 per MMBtu, down $0.05. January fell
5.0 cents to settle at $2.991/MMBtu. Last Wednesday, the AGA reported
a higher than expected 15 Bcf storage injection, even so defensive
short covering was seen after the report, primarily from locals and
trades. There is now 3.132 Tcf in storage, more than the previous
high of 3.127 Tcf in  November 1998. In December of that year,
physical prices fell below $1 per MMBtu. The AGA revised the previous
week's injection from of 7 Bcf to 17 Bcf, accounting for the
additional 10 Bcf on the total. Physical prices plunged as marketers
discounted the long, low-demand holiday weekend. Expect more selling
today if sustained cold forecasts do not appear. The long holiday had
almost no industrial demand, so unless the cold is sustained, there
is little hope for higher prices. The huge gap between November cash
prices and December futures prices is a good indication that the
futures market is ripe for a huge sell-off as early as today, as it
follows cashs lead down. Natural gas for next day delivery across the
US and Canada tumbled $0.15  $0.30 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $1.93 per MMBtu.

California DWR Power Contracts May Lose Billions

    A California Department of Water Resources analysis says that
power it purchased at an average of $75 per MWh may have to be
unloaded for as little as $16 per MWh, possibly costing consumers as
much as $3.9 billion for unused power over the next 9 years. The
analysis compares DWR commitments under current power contracts to
estimates of power demand and market costs through 2010. According to
the analysis, the DWR, which buys power for the state's 3 investor-
owned utilities, may have to sell as much as 33% of the power bought
in some years at about an 80% loss. The DWR has signed about $43
billion in multiyear electricity contracts so far this year.

Enron's Japan Subsidiary Under Review

    The Japanese subsidiary of Enron is reviewing its business and
hopes to conclude its findings in the next couple of weeks. Enron
Japan is a wholly owned subsidiary. It began its own assessment about
a week ago. Enron Japan's business includes E Power Corp, a venture
set up in Japan by Enron and Orix Corp, a leasing company, which is
studying possible electric power plants. Shares of Enron plummeted
another 28% Wednesday even though it reached a critical agreement to 
extend a $690 million debt payment. Some continue to question whether
Dynegy's planned $8.9 billion acquisition will survive. The latest
problems started last week after Enron filed a document with the SEC
saying it would have to repay $690 million in debt by November 26th
because of decreased credit ratings. Enron Japan was established in
April 2000 and employs 60. It had hoped to eventually break into
Japan's power industry which is slowly growing more open.

Economic Experts to Report on Recession Today

    A panel from the National Bureau of Economic Research held a
teleconference last week to discuss whether or not the US has entered
its first recession in over 10 years and will announce the decision
on its website today. The group technically defines a recession as a
significant decline in activity spread across the economy lasting
more than a few months, visible in industrial production, employment,
real income and wholesale-retail trade. The elimination of 415,000
jobs in October, the highest in 5 years at 5.4% versus a 30-year low
of 3.9% a year ago, could lead the committee to announce a recession.
Industrial output peaked in September of last year, while
manufacturing and sales reached their top almost a year ago.
Industrial production fell at a faster rate in October than in almost
11 years, continuing a 13-month drop, according to the Federal
Reserve. Factory, wholesale and retail sales, adjusted for inflation,
topped out in August 2000 and fell for 8 out of the next 10 months.
In a signal that the slump may have bottomed-out, sales have risen
for the past 4 months. Additionally, incomes adjusted for inflation
have climbed in 9 out of the past 10 months contrary to the last
recession in which they fell for 6 out of 8 months. The implied yield
on the February federal funds futures, key indicators of the Feds
actions at its next 2 meetings is 1.91%, just 0.09% below the current
overnight rate and seems to indicate that investors do not think that
further rate reductions are in the offing. In addition, major stock
indexes have been higher for 7 of the past 9 weeks, with the Dow
Jones rising about 4% since September 11th. The Nasdaq has climbed
12% from September 10th levels and 10-year Treasury notes have risen
to 5% from a 3-year low of 4.18% on November 7th. The Blue Chip
Economic Indicator predicts that the economy will shrink by 1.9% in
the 4th-quarter and others forecast that a mild recession will
continue until the first quarter of 2002. The panel typically
requires at least 6 months of data beyond a peak in the economy
before it will consider pronouncing a recession.

California ISO Produces Plan to Meet FERC Order

    In a plan filed with the FERC last week, California's ISO has
come up with a schedule for the states Department of Water Resources
to pay off about $956 million in late payments to generators by
February 2002. The ISO oversees a daily power auction and acts as the
billing agent for sales. The operators have contended that the DWRs
status as credit guarantor for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern
California Edison relieved it of responsibility for making direct
payments. However earlier this month, the FERC declared the DWR as
scheduling coordinator, a typical designation for utilities, making
the water department liable for purchases it made on behalf of the
utilities, and gave the operators 15 days to submit a payment plan
for the period of January 17, 2001 to July 31, 2001. The utilities
still owe generators about $3.6 billion for power purchased over that
time and the DWR is owed about $2.7 billion for power supplied over
the same period, resulting in arrears of about $956 million. The
water department says it has reserved about $1.2 billion in
preparation for such a payment. The ISO says that the FERC-ordered
dual-billing system would be too complex and costly and asked that
the commission allow it to use the current system, under which all
payments would be disbursed by February 7th, 2 weeks ahead of the
FERCs schedule.

Enron Shares Fall on Takeover Concern

    Enron shares and bonds fell for a 3rd day on concern its weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy to try to cancel or rework the
takeover. Shares dropped $0.30, or 6%, to $4.71. They fell 45%
Tuesday and Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than
$9 billion in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4% bonds due in July 2006
were bid at $0.55 on the dollar, down from $0.62 on Wednesday.
Although there are continuing doubts about the deal, others say the
deal is solid and will be completed as soon as details are worked
out. Last Wednesday, Enron got a 3-week reprieve from lenders on a
$690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Also Dynegy's CEO says he was encouraged by
the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of
a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remains committed to
the purchase. Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in a
bid to help its finances with an injection of as much as $2 billion.
Under the November 9th terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy shares for each share held, currently making each share worth
$10.85.

New Investment Likely in Enron

Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group
are among the possible private equity investors in Enron to help the
company's balance sheet. Those firms have cash on hand and have
invested in energy companies in the past. Many of the larger, more
traditional buyout firms would find this deal attractive, analysts
say. Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment. Investors may inject as
much as $2 billion under arrangements that would protect them from
further declines in the stock price. The new investments would be in
Enron's Transwestern Pipeline. JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup have
also agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity
stake as part of a transaction to be completed today. KKR is the 2nd
biggest private equity firm with $24 billion in assets.
