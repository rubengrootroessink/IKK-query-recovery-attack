All,
We are in the process of undertaking a proof of concept project for using Business Object to produce the existing TMS reports in place of Crystal Reports.  Jennifer Lowry along with Andriy Mysyk will be providing project management services. Andriy and Matthew Minyard will provide Business Object expertise whereas Jennifer will provide Smalltalk support for this project.

Jennifer and Andriy are in the process of putting together a work/project plan.

Thanks
