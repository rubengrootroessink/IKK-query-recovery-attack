Cara is working on updating the report to accommodate the volumes impacted. Cara will add the "From" and "To" volumes as well as the difference.

	How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?

	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week.  

	Thanks. Lynn
