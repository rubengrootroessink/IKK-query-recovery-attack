Eastern New Mexico has terminated its agency agreement with Enron North America.  From now on, Coral will be agent for their shipper contract, 24754.  Eastern New Mexico and Coral are still discussing what to do with Eastern New Mexico's OBA agreement, 25190, but that will be settled before the end of the month.  

If you need to get in contact with them for nomination and scheduling issues you can reach Susie Horton (Coral) at 713-767-5406.  And for operational questions at their point (13199) or regarding their OBA imbalance, you can reach Ricky Britain (Eastern New Mexico) at 505-355-2468.

Thanks,
Amy
