Hasan,
I could not open this file. Gerry printed it for me. I was not sure I followed the test plan. Is it testing from Oct. 19th to Nov. 2nd?
Since we will have a new model office refresh to deal with on the Oct. 31st, we would like to push to be complete with testing by Wednesday. Oct. 31st, and plan for Thursday night migration which is Nov. 1st.

I will have Kathy Washington, Maggie Matheson, and myself testing for the next two weeks beginning Monday Oct. 22 nd testing through Nov. 1st. Will that work for your team? Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the project plan for TMS migration to SQL2K.

Couple of key items to note.  In order to create an implementation date, I took the liberty of allocating 2 weeks for user testing.  This could change based on customer input.  Additionally, Model Office refresh is very critical.  I have tentatively scheduled it for 10/17 and 10/18.  Any changes to either the Model office refresh dates or the testing schedule will impacting the implementation date.

thanks
