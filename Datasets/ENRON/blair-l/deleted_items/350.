Just wanted to reinterate to everyone especially those that may not be here today, I have put on your monitors the procedures that we will use next Tuesday, December 11 regarding the collection of the money for the Reservation invoices. We will be giving you a list Tuesday morning that will show all of the shippers that we sent Reservation invoices to on December 3.  Do not call them until we get that list to you.  We would like for you to highlight the shippers that you have called and then return the lists to us.  This will help us to ensure that everyone has been called.

Please note:  If your shipper currently knows our Lock Box number because they send checks, please be sure that you call these folks because we cannot let them use the Lock Box.  They can still send a check in, but they will need to send it to the P.O. Box 1188 for this building.  If possible, give them your room location so that it can come directly to you.  If you have any questions, please let either of us know.

Thanks,

Larry and Raetta
