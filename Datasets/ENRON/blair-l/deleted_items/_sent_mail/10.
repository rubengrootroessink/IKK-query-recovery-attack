Terry, can you have the teams getting Ava email addresses on the list
this week if Dennis does not already have them in PLE.

Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Customer Scheduler List Needed

TW is looking into having a couple of customer meetings, Management needs a list of schedulers for the customers that will be invited. There will probably be a West meeting and a meeting in Houston so they will be done geographically. I am providing the TW Christmas card list as a place to start, so add any new customers and make sure you include the Schedulers names.
I need this by Friday June 15th 4pm.

 

Thanks: John Buchanan
