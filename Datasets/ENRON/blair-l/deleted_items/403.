Crude Oil Futures Slip in Profit-Taking


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped
$0.37 to $20.90 per barrel yesterday, but remained near 6-week highs.
Traders attributed the losses to some profit-taking after crude
prices climbed by $1.65 per barrel on Wednesday. Speculation that
OPEC members will keep pumping over their quotas also pressured the
market downward. OPEC is expected to announce its 4th production cut
in a year today. It is expected to cut output by 1.5 million bpd
after receiving pledges from non-member producing countries to lower
exports by a combined total of 462,500 bpd. However, the 10 OPEC
members with quotas exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in
November. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and non-
members will be closer to 1.0  1.2 million bpd, which could be enough
to prevent crude oil inventories from rising. The production cuts are
aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPEC's
basket of crudes. The IEA has forecast that world oil demand will
rise next year by 600,000 bpd, about 30% below the demand growth rate
over the last decade. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the
NYMEX fell $0.0131 to $0.5815 per gallon. January gasoline futures on
the NYMEX dipped $0.0086 to $0.5927 per gallon. In London, Brent
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were up $1.01 to
$20.34 per barrel.

Canadian Oil Stocks Surge


    Canadian oil stocks surged yesterday morning as investors
welcomed apparent confirmation that OPEC would make its much
predicted production cut today. The Toronto Stock Exchange oil and
natural gas sub-index was up 1.89% at 9,047.34 just before noon. The
jump followed Saudi Arabia's oil minister's statement that OPEC would
announce a production cut of 1.5 million bpd. The Canadian markets
were closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the Christmas holiday. The
TSE's energy group topped the 9,000 level for the first time in more
than a month. Non-OPEC exporters Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and
Angola have together agreed to cut crude exports by 462,500 bpd.

Fitch Places Express Pipeline on Rating Watch Negative


    Fitch has placed the `A' rating of the $150 million 6.47% senior
secured notes and the `BBB' rating of the $250 million 7.39%
subordinated secured notes issued by Express Pipeline on Rating Watch
Negative. The action reflects the weakened fundamentals of the US
energy market and the resulting impact on the overall credit quality
of the crude shippers. In addition, the financial performance of
Express has been below original projections due to weakened demand in
its targeted regional markets. The Express notes were issued in
February 1998 to finance the construction of the Express Pipeline and
to repay the costs incurred in the acquisition and upgrading of the
Platte pipeline. The ability of Express to service its debt is
largely dependent upon the revenues received from the pipeline
transportation tariffs paid by various crude shippers under
contractual off-take arrangements. Express is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Alberta Energy. The Express Pipeline System consists of
two main segments, the Express and Platte pipelines. The Express
segment is 785 miles long beginning in Hardisty, Alberta and running
to Casper, WY. The Platte segment is 932 miles long beginning in
Casper and extending to Wood River, IL.

Nigeria Under Pressure to Comply with New Quotas


   At the OPEC meeting today in Cairo, Nigeria will likely receive
intense pressure to increase compliance with its official OPEC
limits. The cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut 1.5
million bpd from output along with almost 500,000 bpd of reductions
from non-OPEC producers at the meeting. The cartels overall
compliance with its self-imposed limits improved in November as the
10 members were 600,000 bpd over their limits. However, according to
its own data, Nigeria pumped 300,000 bpd in excess of its quota,
making it responsible for half the cheating. If OPEC cuts output by
an expected 1.5 million bpd, Nigeria's new quota would be about 1.79
million bpd, necessitating a 400,000 bpd cut, or 22% from its
November volumes. Nigeria's presidential adviser on energy will
takeover as OPEC President on January 1st, making it even more
important that it adhere to the quota. Some cartel members say that
full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have
asked non-members to make commitments and it is important for OPEC to
stick to set an example. It is unlikely that OPEC members will reach
full compliance during January. Sales commitments for the month have
already been made and although some members like Saudi Arabia have
flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes
already sold.

Russia's Oil Export Plan Leaves Loopholes


    Russia's 1st quarter oil export schedule makes it only appear
that the country will keep a promise to cut 150,000 bpd of exports in
a bid to help OPEC lift sagging crude prices. This week, it set an
export schedule to export 30.9 million tonnes of its own crude and
will ship 3.63 million tonnes of Kazakh and 725,000 tonnes of Azeri
crude in the 1st quarter of next year. Although the schedule looks
like a firm pledge to reduce exports, there is no benchmark figure to
which the schedule could be compared. Russian traders say that the
country's oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the
West because it pays more than domestic consumers. They point out
that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the
state pipeline Transneft, over 2 million tonnes per quarter bypass
Transneft. There are many ways to increase officially declared 1st
quarter volumes, for example, by allowing oil companies to export
cargoes not shipped in November and December due to storms. It is
also possible that Russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to
Ukraine and Belarus refineries, where their further shipments will be
hard to track.

OPEC Expected to Announce Production Cut Today

    OPEC is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to 1.5
million bpd from exports at a meeting in Cairo today. The output cut
is expected to be effective as of January 1st and last 3-6 months and
is aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPECs
basket of crudes. But some members of the cartel appear to be bowing
to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying
that they believe $20 to $22 is a reasonable level and that $25 is
not a reasonable price. The demand for oil is growing at its slowest
pace since 1984, forcing OPEC and non-aligned producers to cut
supplies. The IEA predicts that oil demand will grow by just 600,000
bpd, which is 30% lower than the average growth over the last decade.
However, many think that OPEC will fail because of the cartels poor
record of compliance to previously instituted reductions. OPEC
members exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in November.
If OPEC does not stick to its self-imposed limits, there is very
little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their
commitments. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and
non-members will be closer to between 1 million and 1.2 million bpd,
which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising.
