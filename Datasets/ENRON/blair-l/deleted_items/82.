Dear Trial Subscriber: The good folks at Kiodex forwarded to us a new white paper on trading risk management, "The Effective Energy Risk Management Program: Design and Implementation." They were kind enough top allow us to forward the new work on to subscribers -- the file is attached along with the necessary links. The paper was prepared to coincide with the official launch of it's hosted risk management application services, the RiskWorkbench, a product we've covered on a number of occasions. We plan to also run a feature with company CEO Martin Chavez this week as well. Until then, enjoy the white paper -- a very good read. 
Regards,
John Sodergreen
