I know most of you have read Shelley's email about the Performance Review process for year end.  I apologize for the short turnaround and that we have not had time to set down and
talk about the changes we are making.  I do believe the changes will be very beneficial and bring us a step closer to enhancing the process. 
 
I know you have a lot of questions and therefore on Tuesday, November 27, I will replace my team leader meeting with 3 meetings, one for each team.  I will start the first meeting at 1:30 p.m. In the meantime, if you have any questions that need to be answered immediately, please get with John or Terry and they will get you the answers.  Remember we are trying to simplify the process for everyone as well as getting valuable feedback on each employee.
 
In the meantime, please be thinking about your four selections and submit them by Tuesday, November 27th
at 5:00 p.m.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving and I'll see you on Tuesday.  Lynn
