There were no allocations for NNG for the gas day of 12/26, therefore the there is no information to display for allocations.  Before relaying this information on to the group, please check with Gary Spraggins, Darrell Schoolcraft, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan to verify there were no allocations on the pipes.  

Thanks,

Toby

All testing was completed.  We have confirmed with the ENW Resolution Center that the Exchange servers are up.  

NNG Allocations shows no information to display.  We are checking into the validity of that posting and will advise.
