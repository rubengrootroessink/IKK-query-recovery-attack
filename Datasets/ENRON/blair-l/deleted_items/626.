Lynn - Below is a list of people that Courtney Barker(in Marketing) sends a couple of reports on daily index prices to every month.   Courtney is now posting these reports on the Marketing Dashboard.   Would you like to give your employees below access to the Dashboard or does Courtney need to continue sending the reports via E:Mail?    Please advise us and we will be glad to follow through.   Thanks so much!  Martha

Courtney - Clarification on .... (They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?)      Are you referring to people in Market Services and if so, what level are they?  Martha

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker
