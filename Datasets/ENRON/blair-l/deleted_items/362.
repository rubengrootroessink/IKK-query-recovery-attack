John, please forward this note to anyone who previously had VPN access.  We would like to focus on reestablishing their access first.  Then, we can address any new requests after that.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.


We have been notified that in order to reestablish our VPN access, we must submit an eRequest.   Instructions for completing the eRequest are on the Solution Center website under Quick Reference on the left, and the link to the eRequest system is on the right side of the page.  Please assure that you check the manager's name that appears in the Manager Approval blank.  If this information is not correct, your request will be rejected. 

If you need any assistance, please give us a call at X54745.
