Several of your cost centers have non-payroll costs trailing payroll to work orders.  In order to maintain the integrity of the true capital costs, time coded outside your home cost center must be recorded to a FAR order or specific project, not a cost center.  Please remind your timekeepers or anyone responible for coding timesheets.

Thank you,

Nancy
