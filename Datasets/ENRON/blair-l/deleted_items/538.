l quote for the day:  [IMAGE]      Lesson For Life   [IMAGE]  During my sec=
ond month of nursing school,   our professor gave us a pop quiz. I   was a =
conscientious student and had breezed   through the questions, until I read=
 the last one:    "What is the first name of the woman  who cleans the scho=
ol?"    Surely this was some kind of joke.   I had seen the cleaning woman =
several times.   She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s,   but how would =
I know her name?    I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. =
  Just before class ended, one student   asked if the last question would  =
 count toward our quiz grade.    "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your=
   careers, you will meet many people.   All are significant. They deserve =
your   attention and care, even if all you do is   smile and say 'hello'." =
   I've never forgotten that lesson.   I've also never forgotten her name w=
as Dorothy.     [IMAGE]     [IMAGE] Check out our other inspirational conte=
