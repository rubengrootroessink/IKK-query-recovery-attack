Jo Williams left me a message this morning requesting that during the morning gas control meeting that when allocations are announced that the shippers that were cut be given without Marketing asking for the information.
 I had this information this morning but no one asked for it. 
I told Jo someone had been coming to the meetings with that information available and it had been given out when asked for but she failed to remember that. I guess we should just announce who got cut when we talk about the allocations and if it gets to be too much information Marketing will let us know.
