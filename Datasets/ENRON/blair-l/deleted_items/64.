Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what that address is and we'll get you set up.

Thanks!
Vernon

Vernon:
We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

Greg
