Mullinville Turbine - The turbine is available at this time, but they would like about 3 hours notice. They would like to do the turbine exchange next week if the system loads allow. This is the unit that was repaired in California. The one installed right now is a rental, and has to be returned by the first of the year.

Cunningham - They are doing their re-wiring of the PLC today and tomorrow. They can still inject or withdraw at this time. Thursday or Friday they would like to test the wiring job by actuating some valves. The station would have to been down 8 hours or so to do that. I told Rusty it will depend on the system requirements at that time.

Plainview Turbine - They started Monday installing the new starter and controls. They should have the work complete by Friday 11/30 if all goes well.

P3 Gray Co. - The tie-in for the new Gray Co. I/C is still scheduled for 11/29, and 11/30. P3 will be down during this outage. They will still be able to by-pass gas by the station.

If you have any questions give me a call.
