Tom,
Lynn is in California until next Wednesday October 24th so I need to arrange the flights for this trip. So far it looks like either day is good for the meeting on Nominations and Scheduling so I will arrange for Lynn and I to come to Omaha on the 29th. We will arrive around 12:30pm and our flight will leave Omaha around 6:30pm.  
Please let me know if there is any problems with this timeline.

Thanks: John Buchanan

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.
