Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155
higher Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for
continued cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest
had locals scurrying to cover their short positions. The March
contract gained $0.123 to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying
started early in the session, a reaction in part to Thursday's
liquidation on the January contract expiration. Clearing the books of
Enron-related hedging losers in time for year-end could also be
playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the volatility over the
past month has been triggered by larger books balancing their hedges.
Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to recontract supplies,
pushing the market with offers or with bids. Shuffling monthly
spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought at higher
prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop mid-
January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals.
The AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data
until Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this
winter, many traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this
week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have
began flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven
this year by the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this
year's filings to try to make sure other companies don't go the same
way as Enron. What is new this year is the auditor independence
proposals. Pension funds affiliated with the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals calling on companies not to
hire the same accounting firm to do both audit and non-audit work.
Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both audit and non-audit
services, a dual relationship that has raised questions about
Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual flood that
hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be included
in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In
2001 the SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to
exclude shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle
charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before
the state opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at
offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related
regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas
prices soared a year ago, the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas
utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because
of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state.
Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to
operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is approved by the PUC,
TXU will return $350 million to retail electric suppliers over 2
years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates.
TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million in the 4th
quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would eliminate
any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear
station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to
the utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements
approved by the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to
$90 per customer from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains
more than 60% of its customers after the first 2 years of
competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity

    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind
facility in Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain
Windpower. The project will include about 42 wind turbines, each
producing about 1.5 MW. The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest
wind turbine technology and will be the largest commercial wind
energy facility in the eastern US. The project is expected to be
operational by December 2002. It will interconnect with the Allegheny
Power System in the PJM West RTO and will be integrated with the PJM
RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed 20-year purchase agreements
for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project, 15 MW from the Mill
Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain Wind Farm near
Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio to 144
MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community
Energy and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind
projects. Large commercial customers, such as the University of
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University,
Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have
already purchased wind energy from Power Team and Community Energy
for periods from 15 years. Power Team's current renewable supply
portfolio includes wind, landfill gas, hydroelectric, and biomass
generation.

FERC Order Sets Direction in Midwest

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the
vehicle for a single, regional transmission organization in the
Midwest is an important decision.  It will spark the development of a
competitive regional power market in the Midwest, of particular
importance to energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a
customer coalition active in the federal arena. The Coalition of
Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio,
stated that FERC's decision paves the way for actual implementation
of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest
transmission grid, that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba,
Canada, up and running. The coordination so critical to system
reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now proceed on a
timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of
problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue
with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional
marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also
Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide
marketplace. The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance
RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out
in FERC's Order 2000. The Commission made plain that the Alliance
companies could continue with the formation of the for-profit
Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella. The significance of
this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single
organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of market
participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and
competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November
20th orders preventing several utilities from using their market-
pricing authority in areas where they have market power is as
critical to nurturing an effective market as the order for a single
Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from
Whitehorse, Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural
gas drilling. By utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its
reverse circulation center sampling technology to shallow low-
pressure gas drilling, the resulting formation damage is virtually
eliminated. The air circulates down between the inner and outer drill
pipe, drives the air hammer, and reverse circulates the rock cuttings
back up to surface. This virtually eliminates drilling damage to the
formation.
