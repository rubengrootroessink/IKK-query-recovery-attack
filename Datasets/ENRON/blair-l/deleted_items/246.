Lorna:

After several revisions the Carlton Resolution Report is ready to be put into production.  Please insure that this takes place over the weekend of Oct. 27-28.  As discussed, minor changes can be made when USES informs me what LE they will be using the Cardinal & USES obligation.

Thank you for your assistance in getting this ready for the Nov. 1 deadline.

Regards,

Nancy
