Lynn,

I assume this originates from your group.  How do we do this?

Vernon:
We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

Greg
