I have not sent out the letter to Alliant yet as I need to address this issue.  I'll need to wait for for your response.

        Chris, I only got info on the Mid Am Oct. charts.  I talked to Gary again yesterday and 
        ask for more information.  Hopefully I'll have something today.  Have you already 
        sent your letter to Alliant?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?
