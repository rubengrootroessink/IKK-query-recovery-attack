A worksheet is available in T:\COMMON\AR  GT_3Days COM08.xls of commodity invoices billed August 2001 accounting month that have not cleared AR. 

Please update the Excel worksheet by 5 p.m. on Thursday (10/18) to reflect any payments that have been received but not cleared in SAP or to report the date your shipper will remit payment. If your shipper is not paying or short paying the invoices, include the reason. Provide a copy of  your payment detail or SAP report to me to support unapplied payments. 

Also, there are 30 outstanding August 2001 DEMAND invoices totaling $84,487 that are outstanding. Please apply any payments immediately or advise me of any disputed issues concerning these invoices. (The affected analysts have been given a report of the invoices to be resolved.)

The new cash application process should be used to apply payments. (See T:\Common\Market Services Training\ARNettingProcedures.ppt  to get a copy of the procedures.) 

Let me know if you have questions or need assistance.
