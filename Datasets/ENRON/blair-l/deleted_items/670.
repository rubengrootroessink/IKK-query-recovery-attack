FYI.  We will still need to check into analog lines, and if there is a charge for the phones.
 
Thanks.  Jean

Jean:  I went through the configuration in the PBX out at the Aviation hangar and it should meet your needs with its current configuration.  I have enough spare ports to support up to 50 phones.  They also have their own voicemail system. We would however, have to provide the phones, but we should have enough in stock to prevent us from having to order more.  As mentioned in my voicemail, it is a completely stand alone system that does not require the downtown site to be operational.  If you guys decide to go this route, we will also have to look at the cabling out there to make sure that it would meet your needs.  I know at one time they had looked at making that a disaster recovery site for Enron, so I believe that is why it is sized the way it is.  Let me know if you have additional questions.  Thanks!

Kathy
