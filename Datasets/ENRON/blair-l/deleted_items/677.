1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.
