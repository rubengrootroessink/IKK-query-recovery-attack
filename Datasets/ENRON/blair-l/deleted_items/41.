Subject:	Follow up on the Nomination/Confirmation Process

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.
