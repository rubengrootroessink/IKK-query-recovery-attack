Lynn, the Commodity invoices are due on 12/24.  I believe Sandy King meant 12/24 rather than the 23rd.  However, I will be watching for the payment!

	Sherry does it matter that 12/23 is on a Sunday?  Thanks. Lynn

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.
