     [IMAGE]LABEL TO BUY OUT MARIAH CAREY CONTRACT     [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]   I=
t's been a rough year for Mariah Carey. The pop diva had an emotional and p=
hysical breakdown, and sales of her much-anticipated album Glitter were not=
 as sparkly as expected.   As a result, Carey's record label is reportedly =
trying to buy out the rest of her contract. Carey signed a deal with EMI-Vi=
rgin records earlier in the year for a reported amount of between $80 milli=
on and $118 million -- depending on whether she produced four or five album=
s for the label.   Another reported term of the deal between Carey and Virg=
in was that she receive a $20 million advance for each album, $6 million fo=
r production of music videos and $1.5 million to promote four singles.   Ho=
wever, Glitter was released at the wrong time -- on September 11 -- and sol=
d only 2 million copies worldwide. EMI-Virgin reportedly lost $10 million i=
n the process.   Now it is being reported that the label is looking to buy =
out the rest of Carey's contract, offering to pay the singer a one-time lum=
p sum, hoping to dissolve the previous deal.  [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE=
