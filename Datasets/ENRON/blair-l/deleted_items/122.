Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on
the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on
Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on
monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with
Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review
procedures for any changes.

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough
to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance
from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could
reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will
review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious
to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of
This email.

Thanks Lynn
