Yes. John aked me to attend the conference call along with Steve and Terry and....as Steve notes below, Kent is aware of the issue. I suspect that Kent and Sue have talked about the matter but I have copied Sue on this note just in case....

Lynn, we had a conference call with Kelly and Jeff yesterday. Chris was on the call also. We got nowhere, so then Kent and Steve Kirk called them later and explained how the process works and that we can't "reserve" capacity for them. They hung up on Steve and Kent. Shelley has been brought up to speed. thanks. sj

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to "schedule" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.
