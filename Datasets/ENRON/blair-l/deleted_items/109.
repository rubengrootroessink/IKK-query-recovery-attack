Subject:	Shipper Scheduled Quanties Report.

Per my telephone conversation with Toby this morning, I am writing this e:mail to give my comments on
the new Shipper Scheduled Quantities report.  

I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need for forecasting margins
and invoicing three shippers at this time.  Before the change, I was able to run 1 report for each of these 
shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new report does not give me month-to-date totals 
I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time 
consuming to run and analyze all these  reports.  As Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume 
will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.

Other comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.




Thanks!
