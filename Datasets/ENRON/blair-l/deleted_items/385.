I didn't know where to ask, so here goes.  Please advise me of  whom I need to contact.   I recently was going thru My dad and mother's belongings,  I  found a life insurance policy for my dad.  It was issued by  Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, thru Northern Natural Gas  Company to Lawrence Maitland Rowden in October of 1952.     I am trying to find out if it is still in affect,  as my dad  passed away in 1999.  Any help or guidance would be greatly  appreciated.   Michael Rowden ( surviving son) 7000 Millennium Dr. Fort Smith, AR  72916 (501-788-8907)  Work #
