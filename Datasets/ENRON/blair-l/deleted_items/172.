Scheduling issues or concerns from weekend:
 
Saturday - All three pipes experienced report problems due to a replication error. Was resolved for the shippers and operators. The IT person is looking into this issue futher for additional fixes.
 
Sunday - All three pipes, "Web site" went down for 40 minutes prior to the Intraday 1 deadline of 10 am. On call Reps. assisted customers by entering noms and confirming for a couple shippers and operators and extended the deadline by 25 minutes. IT person had to reboot the (X-12 Server) to resolve this issue.
 
Florida pipe also had a "Overage Alert Day of 5%" called for Sunday.
