they were face-to-face again, Sheen was quickly smitten.   "Charlie says sh=

her forehead because her beauty destroyed his concentration!" revealed the =
insider.   "When they first started dating about two months ago they kept i=

with talking about it.   "While they have gone out to restaurants and shops=
 together, they prefer to stay home. They watch movies and baseball and spe=
