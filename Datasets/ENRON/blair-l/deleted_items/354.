Subject: Update VPN/IPASS (remote access)


Everyone - We are currently looking into what our (ETS) options are with iPASS/VPN.  As of right now, VPN should work just like before.  Shirley Walden, Mary Lou Phillips and Beverly Miller should be able to work from home starting tomorrow.  I will test the VPN connectivity from home tonight.  I did work from home last night without any issues. 
 
I am also working with the Solution Center to send out the new instructions to everyone for remote access via phone dialing, as we only have one number available now.  
 
As of today, everyone has rights for remote access/VPN.  Please stop all e-requests for iPASS/VPN access.  I have approval from Net Works to give a spreadsheet for access instead of an e-request for each user.   
 
For future requests, Donna and I are working on a easier way to give/get approval via e-requests.   We will communicate the new process soon.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or issues.  
 
Thanks.  Jean
