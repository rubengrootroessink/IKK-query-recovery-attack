FYI,

I got a call form Larry at Bushton. He said they having trouble with a pump in the treater plant. They haven?t received the spare pump yet, so there could be a possibility that the treater plant could be down this weekend. Which means Lyons would be down. They just wanted to give us a heads up, so we can figure this in our weekend plan.
