FYI - The NNG and TW customer team reps have called all of their counterparts to remind/alert/ask them to doublecheck to ensure their accounts payable and treasury people have Citibank set up as our bank to receive their wire payments this week.  We are feeling pretty good about our notification process...  We will distribute control reports to management.
