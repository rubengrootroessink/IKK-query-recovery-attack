I received a call today from the CMS Beaver plant and they have shut their process plant down due to gas prices. They do not know at this time  when they will start back processing . This is the same thing that happen last December. They have assured us that the gas that they are delivering to us is going through a Dehy and a mole sieve to knock any water out. The BTU of the gas received on the C-line will be running around 1150 BTU. We will need to keep a close watch on the C-line suction water content during this time. This is the first call I have received about a processing plant shutting down due to price this month.
