Charlie,

I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed upon difference.

Charlie sent me the following message.
"If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the "settlement number" would be 567,546.5!"
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for "PTR", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

	Dari, Harry and I have run through the numbers and how we will show the difference on the
	books and agree with your number. Thanks. Lynn

Dari,

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.  The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.

9/12/2001	88,335			90,910			2,575
9/13/2001	92,175			95,968			3,793
9/14/2001	93,525			96,151			2,626
9/15/2001	95,422			98,994			3,572
