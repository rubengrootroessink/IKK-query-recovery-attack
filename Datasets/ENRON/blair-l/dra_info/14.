Dale and I joined in on an INGAA conference call this morning. There were many parties (maybe 30) on the line, but I didn't hear anyone else identify themselves from Enron. The topic of the call was enhanced security for facilities in light of the recent events, and a small discussion related to the recent "worm" problems. The discussion was led by Terry Boss and someone named Greg from INGAA, whose last name I didn't catch. 
The gist of the meeting was that there has been a Security Task Group identifed. Names and companies participating were not given on the call.   
INGAA wants the goal of this group to achieve consistent and effective communications to the various Government agencies with regard to steps being taken to enhance security. The agencies identified that will have a say in this are: DOT, DOE, FERC, and the new Home Defense agency.
Four other goals were listed: 1) Determine how to achieve cost recovery
			      2) Share Best Practices
		                  3) Research and Development
			      4) Public Communication and Education

There was a discussion to determine if companies would be willing to share best practices in this area. Several companies, Iroquois, Williston Basin, Trans Canada, Williams, El Paso, Duke indicated that they would be willing to share. At that point several companies volunteered what they have done. It ranged from the extreme--Iroquois is manning all facilities, putting new and tougher chains and locks on valves and gates, security cameras at all facilities, etc. to El Paso, which indicated they are studying several things but for the most part they are on "heightened awareness." 

Concerning the virus or worm in the SCADA system, it appears that systems utilizing UNIX are vulnerable if they also have some interaction with the Internet. No solution or fix was discussed. The effects of contamination are missing data from the RTU's and inability to send setpoints.
