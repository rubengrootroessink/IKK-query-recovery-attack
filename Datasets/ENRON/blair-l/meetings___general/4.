Hi Ladies!

I think I have now mentioned to all of you that it would be great to get
together on the Saturday prior to our meeting.  My current thought is to
have the three of you travel together on the ferry from SF to Marin.  I
would pick you up and we could visit the wine country for lunch.  Sound like
a plan?

I'll provide more details later, but here is some important information:
The ferry leaves from SF at 10:45 a.m. (there are other times, but we
wouldn't make lunch).

So, what do you think?  Doable?
