Lynn,
Glad you all were able to work that out.  I will add Theresa as an invitee
for Monday and as a substitute for Sunday in case of a cancellation.

I think that the agenda item you suggested will be covered under "Balancing
solutions for problems caused by timing issues in the Intraday 2 cycle."  We
want to address how people solve remaining imbalances after ID2 is over.

Looking forward to seeing you all,

Todd Hudson
Information Systems Analyst

	Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
	ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
	group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
	email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
	Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
cancellation.

	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
"mis matches" across interconnecting
	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
	if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these
mismatches.  If you would like
	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
Thanks. Lynn
