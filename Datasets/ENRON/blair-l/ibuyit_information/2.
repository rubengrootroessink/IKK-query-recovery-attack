eProcurement

You have been identified as a future user of eProcurement.  eProcurement is
coming to Enron Transportation Services on Monday,  July 2nd!

Keep this information to help you transition to the new eProcurement
system.

When should I use eProcurement?
Use eProcurement to buy:
*  O&M expense materials, fleet, stand-by, and IT hardware items
*  Office supplies will be unavailable July 2nd but are coming soon!

How does eProcurement work?
*  Go to <http://ibuyit.enron.com> and logon to eProcurement.
*  Use the catalog or a template to fill the shopping cart and order the
items.
*  The request will go to a buyer for fulfillment.  It's that easy!

If the shopping cart requires additional approval:
*  The shopping cart will automatically be routed for approval based on the
requestor's reporting structure and the monetary approval limits of their
business unit.
*  The approver will receive e-mail notification that there is a shopping
cart that requires their approval.
*  The approver will log onto eProcurement and accept or reject the
shopping cart.
*  Upon rejection, the requestor will receive e-mail notification that
their shopping cart was rejected.
*  Upon approval, the shopping cart will be forwarded to a buyer, and then
fulfilled.
*  Note:  if the shopping cart exceeds your spend limit, or contains fleet,
stand-by or IT hardware items it will require additional approval/review.
