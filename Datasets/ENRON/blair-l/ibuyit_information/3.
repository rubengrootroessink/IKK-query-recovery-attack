Enron Transportation Services
iBuyit
Spend and Approval Guidelines
Effective July 1, 2001

It is important that our business unit has a consistent, documented approach to spending to maximize our return on every dollar spent.  Enron Transportation Services will follow the spend and approval guidelines for the iBuyit eProcurement application.  Please review these new guidelines carefully and modify your purchase activities accordingly.

Many of you currently use iBuyit eProcurement to purchase IT hardware, and others began to use the tool on July 2, 2001, to purchase office supplies.  iBuyit eProcurement will automatically route purchase requests for approval based on our spend/approval guidelines.

Spend limit:  Defines the amount that each Job Title can spend without additional approval.	   				

Approval limit:  Defines the authority that each Job Title has to approve others' purchases.

	Example 1:  Specialist
	Any person in this job group could create and submit a requisition for up to $1,000 without any further approval.
			
	Example 2:  Director
	Any person in this job group could create and submit a requisition for up to $2,500 without any further approval and could 	approve others' requisitions up to $100,000.

Purchasing Review:  All IT equipment purchase requests require monetary approval and additional IT Technical review to ensure the request is aligned with Enron's IT strategy and standards.

Delegation Authority:  The iBuyit system allows a delegation process.  Approval can be delegated through substitution.  This substitution allows the delegation of approval authority, but not spend authority, up to the level of the delegator.

***ETS Approval Authorization Requirements supersede the iBuyit Spend & Approval Limit Guidelines for all commitments which obligate an ETS Business Unit.
