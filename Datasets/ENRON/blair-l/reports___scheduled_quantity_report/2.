Subject:	Latest Shipper to Call -- RE: Scheduled Quantities Report

Cinergy's Paulette, who handles NNG, and Belinda, who handles TWPL, have just telephoned to ask what happened to these reports -- they use them to monitor month to date totals, distributions, and third party package information.  They are begging for the reports to return.

Brooks uses these for documentation as well for all of their agencies.  (TransCanada).

Thanks,
S.

John/Terry/Raetta/Larry,

OGE and Aquila use the month to date volumes on the schedule volume reports. I also use them to send to Mark Walden for the NNG Admin. contract every month. If the report needs to be different for some reason can the old one be put back in place for those of us that use it regularly? I hope consideration is given to reinstating the former contents of this report. It sounds like there are several people (both external and internal) who would like to be able to access the data that used to appear on the scheduled quantities reports. 

Just giving some extra feedback on the subject!

thanks,
Chris G

This is currently under discussion but no decision has been made yet, try and work with the customer with the new report.

FYI - CMS Continental is asking for this report to be re-instated.
