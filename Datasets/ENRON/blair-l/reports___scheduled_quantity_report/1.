I have two questions about the Service Requester Scheduled Quantity report
that came on line this week:

1.  Does it have to be legal size?  The previous report was very readable
and it was 8 1/2 x 11, landscape

2.  This report gives no month-to-date totals and now I have to get two
reports on each pipeline every day in order to reconcile our system
correctly.  Is there any way the first page of the old report could be added
to this report so that month-to-date totals can be seen?
