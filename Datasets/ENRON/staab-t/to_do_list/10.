Attached are the schedules that we summarized the payment differences for
Questar and CIG gas payments. We received a wire transfer from Enron on
January 29, 2001 in the amount of $120,247.55. Is this the payment of this
amount??? If so, please explain the difference of $16,905.09. My email is
JWimp@enervestdgo.com Telephone # 970-247-1500 ext. 209.
