Sinclair paid ENA for August, September and October the following:

	1st 30,000/month	@$3.58
	remaining volumes	@NX3 - $.43

The only deal ticket received shows the price to be NX3 - $.43 for the term of the deal.  Anne Bike spoke to Paul Lucci and he remembers that Nicole triggered the deal for the three months in question, but he's not too sure about the $3.58.  Could you please check to see if you have any notes regarding this trigger and let me know as soon as possible.  Client Services is trying to resolve this issue this week.

If the trigger price is correct I will get Anne Bike to correct Sitara.
