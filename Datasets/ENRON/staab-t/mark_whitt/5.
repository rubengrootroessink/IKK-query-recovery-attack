Mark,
We have a couple of options.  We can do an on-line version which will be available in Jan. or we can send someone up to do a version for you in Denver.  I'm fine waiting until the on-line version is up and running.  Let me know what you prefer.  Thanks much.

Do I need to send all of my people?  Can we have a Denver class and combine it with the 60 employees at Crestone?

Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.  Workplace harassment conflicts with Enron's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.
