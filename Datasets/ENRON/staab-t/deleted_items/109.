"I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as I had today," McNair said.   "I'm not going to go out and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue."     The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=1152&"><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>
, RB PIT - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/27/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bettis is still listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals after missing Pittsburgh's last three games with a groin injury.   He skipped Wednesday's practice, as he has done most of the season, even when healthy.   "I can't really predict the future, so I take it day by day," Bettis said. "I'm not 100 percent yet. I just want to keep improving and take it day by day."  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=133297&"><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/27/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=12429&"><B>Matt Hasselbeck</B></A>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=12436&"><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>

Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=1094&"><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Team Dick <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith is day to day with a hip injury.

Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=1871&"><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=1321&"><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - Team Chick <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Walls is day to day with a knee injury.

He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3473&key=1220&"><B>Rod Smith</B></A>, WR DEN - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/26/01</FONT><BR>

Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. <BR>

Rice had a solid game against San Diego, posting six catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. Rice has once again become a solid Fantasy player in Oakland, and will help many owners during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Carswell has been an up-and-down player for Denver. He won't give Fantasy owners consistent production during the postseason.<BR>

Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. "I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me," Mathis told the <I>Times-Picayune</I>. "I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately." Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. <BR>

Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs. <BR>
