Subject: Fwd: bad joke.  <G>

A bald man with a wooden leg gets invited to a  
Halloween party. 
He doesn't know what costume to wear to hide his  bald 
head and his leg 
so he 
writes to a costume company to explain  his problem. 
A few days later he received a parcel with the  
following note: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a pirate's outfit.  
The spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head 
and, with your  
wooden 
leg, you will be just right as a pirate. 
Very truly  yours, Acme Costume Co. 
The man thinks this is terrible because they  have just 
emphasized his 
wooden 
leg and so he writes a letter of  complaint. A week 
goes by and he 
receives 
another parcel and a  note, which says: 
Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a monk's habit. The  
long robe will cover 
your 
wooden leg and, with your bald head, you  will really 
look the part. 
Very truly yours, Acme Costume Co.  
Now the man is really upset since they have gone from 
emphasizing  his 
wooden 
leg to emphasizing his bald head so again he writes 
the  company another 
nasty letter of complaint. 
The next day he gets a  small parcel and a note which 
reads: 
Dear Sir, 
Please find the  enclosed bottle of molasses. Pour the 
molasses over 
your 
bald  head, stick your wooden leg up your hinnie and go as 
a caramel apple.  
Very truly yours, 
Acme Costume Co  >>
