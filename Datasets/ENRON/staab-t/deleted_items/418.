Dear Theresa Staab,

I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the
situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety
Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and
flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the
accident.

In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a
precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail
fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on
Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed
approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any
problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for
the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will
communicate those results.

On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone
for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's
tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The
unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire
nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 

I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge
to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident
but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing
across our system.

On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle,
thanks for your support.

Sincerely, 

Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines
