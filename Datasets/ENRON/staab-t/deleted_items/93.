So what are the doctors saying is wrong?  Are you going to have to come to the states or will you be able to go home for Christmas?

Hi Theresa,
I now have daily access to e-mail. I'm staying at a
home which is nice. I had therapy today after they did
an epedural in my back. They will give me injections
in the line they left in my back for five days.
Hopefully after that I will be able to do therapy
without the nerve pain block. Vicky and the boys went
back to Holland today and she thinks that she will be
back next week sometime. What is the deal with your
job now? Are they going to keep the company running?
Thats the way it sounds like here. The best thing for
me right now is that I'm out of pain. Well, I will
keep in touch. Jeff
