******* DON'T OPEN THE ATTACHMENT UNTIL YOU READ THE JOKE

A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead show up for the same job interview.

The brunette is the first one to go in, and after filling out the forms
and
going through the questions, the interviewer decides to ask her a last
question: "How many D's are there in "INDIANA JONES""?

The brunette thinks for a second and responds "One". The interviewer
sends
her back with a promise that he'll get back to her after he had
interviewed
the remaining candidates.

The redhead is the next one, and the process goes about the same, and at
the
end: "How many D's are there in INDIANA JONES". She immediately says
"One".

The interviewer says "ok, we'll let you know".

Then the blonde comes into the room, goes through the questions, and
finally
gets asked "How many D's are there in INDIANA JONES". She gets a very
serious look on her face and starts counting her fingers, muttering:
"2, 4, 6 ..hmmm - wait... 2, 4, 6 .... can I borrow your calculator
please?

After going through 15 minutes of intense calculating, she finally comes
up
with the answer: "Thirty two"

The interviewer is stunned and asks her: "Ok, now tell me, how the hell
did
you arrive at this answer?"
