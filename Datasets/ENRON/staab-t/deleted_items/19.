Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. "He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that," Billick said. "The only thing that would change that is if he chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury." </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1004&"><B>Chris Chandler</B></A>, QB ATL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/20/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week.

Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=12484&"><B>Joe Jurevicius</B></A>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday.

<FONT SIZE=2>Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=133462&"><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma?afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1152&"><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. "But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games." Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=12436&"><B>Skip Hicks</B></A>, RB TEN - Grid Iron Goons <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the <I>Nashville Tennessean</I>
. "We're going to play Skip more," Fisher said. "We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1069&"><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=133462&"><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1070&"><B>Gus Frerotte</B></A>, QB DEN - Really Rottens <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT>
</FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=235220&"><B>James Jackson</B></A>, RB CLE - Uran Man <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1681&"><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1025&"><B>Scott Mitchell</B></A>, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=133415&"><B>Akili Smith</B></A>
, QB CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1177&"><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a ha!
nd!
 injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT>
</FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=12375&"><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1645&"><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1186&"><B>Bert Emanuel</B></A>, WR DET - Blue Balls <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=2>Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against Pittsburgh.

Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday. <BR>

<A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1321&"><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, Reserve TE<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR>
Walls missed practice on Monday due to an ankle injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects his veteran tight end to be available for Sunday's game against St. Louis. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1291&"><B>Jerry Rice</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR>
Rice had a solid game against San Diego, posting six catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. Rice has once again become a solid Fantasy player in Oakland, and will help many owners during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=133260&"><B>Tim Couch</B></A>, Reserve QB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR>
Couch had a terrible game against Jacksonville, posting only 184 yards passing with an interception. He is far too unreliable to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://football291.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=782&key=1782&"><B>Tiki Barber</B></A>, Active RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR>
Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Look for Dyson to be a solid No. 2 receiver this week. He might not score, but should catch a lot of passes. <BR>

Owens practiced for the first time this week on Thursday, and he is expected to play. "He's just treating (his injuries) like crazy. He's resting during the week and trying to get something done later in the week," Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. "His ankles are feeling much better and he's just dealing with the hip pointer."<BR>

Carswell has been an up-and-down player for Denver. He won't give Fantasy owners consistent production during the postseason.<BR>

Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. "I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me," Mathis told the <I>Times-Picayune</I>. "I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately." Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. <BR>
