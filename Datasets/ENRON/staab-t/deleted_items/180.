I can't seem to find it. I received Howell, Devon, North Central and EJW, but I don't see the Enron Statement for Sept.

Theresa - Please resend.  Sorry.

Amy:
Have you sent the Crestone Gathering sale spreadsheet to me for Sept.?  I've sort of lost track of what all I've received.  I still have it in draft status, so I don't think I've received it yet.  This has been a hectic week (and it's only Tuesday!).
