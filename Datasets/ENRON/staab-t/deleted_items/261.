Subject: The Letter 

This is really good 

To Osama and the Boys, from an American Wife and Mother 
             
            Yo, Osama! 

            Well, the government finally named you as a suspect, so I 
guess it's fair to talk about you now.  Thought you had us, didn't you? 
What a laugh!  You did more to unify this country than George 
Washington. 



            See, we Americans had gotten sort of distracted.  We 
worried about things like lockboxes, taxes, and who was committing hanky 
panky with whom.  We were too stressed to reach out to one another, to 
sit down and talk with our kids, to call our spouses at work and tell 
them we loved them.  We were MUCH too busy to even think about giving 
blood or going to the hardware store to buy and hang an American flag. 



            You changed all that, Osama, you and your gang of creeps. 
I met my neighbors in the park across the street tonight.  We talked 
quietly while everybody gathered.  Then we lit our candles and just 
stood there silently, holding them.  Without anybody saying anything, we 
walked back to our neighborhood and set them on our doorsteps.  They are 
still burning.  You will never be able to put them out. 



            See, Osama?  You think you get ticked off when someone 
messes with your culture, your beliefs, your country?  Just wait a 
minute you flea bitten miserable excuse for human DNA!  You haven't seen 
anything like the anger of a MOTHER who's son has to go off to defend 
their homeland against your cowardice and hatred. You haven't seen 
anything like the WIFE of a fireman, policeman or EMT who clings to hope 
wondering if he'll ever return from trying to help his fellowman in your 
moment of destruction. 



            You haven't seen anything like the WOMAN who will keep her 
family, and her neighbors family, and her best friend's family, and 
country's family going when hope and energy falls low.  You haven't seen 
anything like the good OLE GIRL who weeps tears of agony for family's 
she's never known or never will meet, just because she cares. 



            You think the American MEN are bad?  You just better thank 
your lucky stars that you aren't dealing with one of us American WOMEN 
right now.  Trust me, the men are the ones showing restraint.  I have 
heard the best ideas of just how graphically you need to be disposed of 
lately in the beauty shop, nail salon and the grocery store lines. 



            I've had more meaningful conversations with my teenager 
this week than in the last couple of years combined.  Tonight I was 
driving her to a friend's house when the voice of Lee Greenwood came 
over the radio singing "I'm Proud to Be an American."  We were stuck in 
traffic, and normally we would have been snapping at one another.  She 
started singing along softly with the radio.  I joined in.  By the 
second verse we were singing at the top of our voices with the windows 
rolled down.  People stuck in traffic on either side of us joined in. 
By the time we were finally able to move a little, perfect strangers 
were wiping their eyes, blowing their horns and shouting good wishes to 
one another. 



            I hung an American flag on my house yesterday for the first 
time in my life.  I'd like to get another one, but there are no flags or 
anything else red, white, or blue left in any store in this town.  My 
daughter and I did find some white and blue ribbon in the sewing box. 
Tomorrow we're going to make a huge blue-and-white bow and fasten it to 
the front grille of the car. 



            I called my husband at work today just to tell him I loved 
him.  I hadn't done that for a while - too busy, I guess.  It felt 
wonderful.  We are going to send some money to a fund to help the 
victims.  Tonight at the dinner table we talked about the various 
charities and tried to decide which one was best.  Normally we just eat 
and run.  It was the best dinner table conversation we've had in a long 
time.  We finally decided on a fund that's been set up for the children 
of the rescue workers who were killed in New York City.  We'd never 
given much thought to appreciating all they do for us before now. 



            My husband and I are on a waiting list to give blood. 
It'll be awhile before our names come up; there are over 500 people 
ahead of us.  There's been a shortage of blood in this area.  I wouldn't 
be surprised if the blood donated all across this country eventually 
saves more people than you killed.  That would be a fitting memorial to 
those who died. 




            We're sticking together. Our politicians are rising to the 
occasion. Rudy Giuliani and George W. Bush never looked half as 
statesmanlike as they have this week.  Partisan bickering?  What's that? 
 Half the Congress stood on the steps of the Capitol the other night and 
sang "God Bless America." 



            See, Osama, you underestimated us. And maybe for too long 
we've been underestimating ourselves.  This is the greatest, strongest, 
richest, most beautiful country in the world.  Our firefighters, 
policemen, EMTs, and people like the ones on the plane that crashed in 
Pennsylvania have reminded us that we're also the bravest and most 
determined. 



            You can't destroy us, and you can't stop us.  Because we're 
coming, Osama. 



            Just thought you oughta know.  And, just to show you how 
good hearted we Americans are, I will end by saying THANK YOU.  Not for 
the lives taken, for which we now mourn, nor for the destruction, but 
for instilling back into the hearts of every American, young and old, 
black, white, red, or yellow, what we always knew deep down.  We are 
strong. We are brave.  We are ONE NATION, UNITED UNDER GOD.  We will 
overcome this as we have always overcame those moments that tested our 
very being. 



            And, Osama, I say this, all the while asking God to forgive 
ME, for I do not feel any compassion or have any mercy on your soul, 
but...may you and all your cowardly friends soon sit happily in those 
front row seats you have reserved in Hell.
