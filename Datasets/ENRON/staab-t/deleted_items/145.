Accounting has received a wire that they are now looking for backup.
Their initial review indicates that the pricing seems low.  I know that
pricing is pretty pitiful, but Gas Daily monthly average for Sept was
about $1.55 per MM.  Please forward the backup today if possible so we
can review.  Thanks............
