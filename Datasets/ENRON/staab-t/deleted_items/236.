Latest NFL Player News

Peerless Price <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Texas Terminators Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league! =g! etbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1072&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from "out" to "doubtful" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than ! he! hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. "Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,"' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. "I would not agree with that at this time," Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar Kin! g.! Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Patrick Jeffers, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235174&> , QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Dont Mess Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn ! Je! fferson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 10/17/01
Moss is! l! isted as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start. 

Shane Matthews <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you! s! tart any Broncos running back.

Stacey Mack <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5! &r! andom=3411&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1032&>, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too produ! ct! ive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1222&>, WR DET - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. "We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought," Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle." Drop Moore if he was on your Fantas! y ! team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's "workhorse" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Travis Henry <http://football215.f! an! tasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=235216&>, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.

Team Chick Player News

Randy Moss <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12576&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Joey Galloway <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Tony Richardson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1471&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.

Tiki Barber <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1782&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Hines Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=12795&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Terrell Owens <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1290&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.

Saints <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=18&>, Active DT Updated 10/14/01
Defensive end Joe Johnson (quadriceps) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Carolina. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. 

Rich Gannon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1034&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Gannon should have a fine game against the Colts. Indianapolis will have a lot of trouble handling wideouts Tim Brown and Jerry Rice.

Jerry Rice <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1291&>, Active WR Updated 10/12/01
Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.

Wesley Walls <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1321&>, Active TE Updated 10/12/01
Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against New Orleans. 

Rickey Dudley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1357&>, Active TE Updated 10/09/01
The Browns have placed Dudley on injured reserve with a foot injury, officially ending his season. Drop him if he was on your Fantasy roster.

Tim Couch <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=133260&>, Active QB Updated 10/05/01
Couch has been inadequate as a starter, mainly because his receivers have struggled to get open. Look for this trend to continue when he faces the San Diego. 

Richie Anderson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1141&>, Active RB Updated 08/28/01
Anderson has returned to practice after suffering a concussion in last week's preseason game. Keep him in mind as a No. 4 Fantasy RB.

Derrick Mayes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1227&>, Active WR Updated 07/04/01
Published reports have stated that Mayes could be signed by the Kansas City Chiefs within the next week. Mayes, who played for the Seattle Seahawks last season, would compete for the No. 2 wideout spot should he sign a contract with the team. The Chiefs are also reportedly interested in Charlie Jones and Kirby Dar Dar, and it is expected that they will sign at least one them as well. Mayes has the talent to be a good reserve wideout on your Fantasy team, but he's worth no more than a late-round flier at this point. 

Matt Stover <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3411&key=1377&>, Active K Updated 12/08/00
Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.
