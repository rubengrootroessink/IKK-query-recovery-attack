Okay Guys -  Call me CRAZY!

I don't know what I did, but I had the wrong Gas Daily pricing in the spreadsheet for September.

Please accept my apology... One would have thought I'd have this down pat by now.

Sorry about this.  I hope this is the last revision for September.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
