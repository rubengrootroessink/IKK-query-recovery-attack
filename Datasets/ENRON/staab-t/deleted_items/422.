Good Morning,
Well, it looks like you definitely will need to bring rain coats, umbrellas etc.  I just checked the 10 day forecast and it shows rain or scattered showers Wed. 11/21 - Sun. 11/25.  The local forecasters are showing rain for Thanksgiving here.   Hopefully it will change before then, last week they said it was going to rain this weekend and now it's going to be sunny and 70's. 

Love,
Mom
