Latest NFL Player News

Todd Pinkston <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187621&>, WR PHI - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/24/01
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.

Joe Jurevicius <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=62! 0&! key=12484&>, WR NYG - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/24/01
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be availa! bl! e," said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/24/01
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for ! Su! nday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. ! He! was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable! m! atchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getba! d&! owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will ! ac! tivate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline! .c! om/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. "All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction," head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. "It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week." Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football209.! fa! ntasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=620&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.
