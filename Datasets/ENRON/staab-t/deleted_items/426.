>On her

> > "Oh yes, daddy. You know that I love you."
> >
> > "Then give me your pearls."
> >
> > "Oh, daddy, not my pearls. But you can have

> >
> > "That's okay, Honey, daddy loves you. Good night."

> > About a week later, after the story time, Jenny's

> > "Then give me your pearls."
> >
> > "Oh Daddy, not my pearls. But you can have my baby

> > The brand new one I got for my birthday. She is

> >
> > "That's okay. Sleep well. God bless you, little

> > loves you." And as always, he brushed her cheek
>with a gentle kiss.
> >
> > A few nights later when her daddy came in, Jenny
>was sitting

> >
> > "What is it, Jenny? What's the matter?"
> >
> > Jenny didn't say anything but lifted her little
>hand up to her
> > daddy. And when she opened it, there was her little
>pearl
> > necklace. With a little quiver, she finally said,
>"Here, daddy,

> > He was just waiting for her to give up the
>dime-store stuff so
> > he could give her the genuine treasure.
