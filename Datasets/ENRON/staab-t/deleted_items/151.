Latest NFL Player News 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01 
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. "They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be," Jeffers said. "I'm excited. It's another step along the way." Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01 
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Terry Allen  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01 
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/25/01 
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01 
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01
