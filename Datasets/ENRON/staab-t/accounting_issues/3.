Did you add this onto the August invoice? If so, can you send me an updated version of that as well?
Thanks! I'll let you know how it comes across.

Valerie,

I have adjusted the July invoice to account for the 4500 MMBtu that we delivered to Greeley on July 27, 28, 29 off of PSCO.

I also corrected a mistake on the 3rd party utilization fee.

Please redraft and let me know if everything looks ok.

Thanks,
Theresa

(I will be e-mailing this revised July along with August to Greeley).
