Theresa,

Paul Lucci wanted me to send you an update .   Rainbow Gas, Chris Faul, has requested refund for their prepayment but they still owe
for the penalty charges and actuals -  I received $8,604.00 from Chris Faul , this will leave a balance of $10,177.00.  Do you want me
to deduct the balance from the refund or do you want to call John Childers 281-646-0232 to go over the balances - Last time I spoke with
him - he was not going to pay the penalty charage plus we do not agree on the volumes (actuals).  I will wait until I hear from you.  You can 
reach me at 713-853-5667.

Thanks,

Linda Ewing

Attached is the spreadsheet showing the calculation for the penalty charge.  Please let me know if you have any questions concerning it.

After you have entered the charge, please let myself and Linda Ewing (713-853-5667) know so Linda can invoice the penalty to the customer.

Thanks!
