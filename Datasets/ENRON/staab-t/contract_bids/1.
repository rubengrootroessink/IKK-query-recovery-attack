POGO has asked us to help them evaluate their gathering/transportation/marketing options on a new exploratory play they are entering in the Big Horn Basin.  The prospect is inTownship 54N, Range 102W, Section 4.  They control a rather large acreage block in this area.  They have asked for a map of the area highlighting the gathering lines, Interstate pipelines and Lost Creek.  Their desire would be to connect this gas to Lost Creek once the production and reserves justify it.  In the meantime we would probably need to work with an existing system or there may be an opportunity for  you to build over to CIG if possible.  If you have designs on taking Lost Creek north, this might fit in nicely.
Let's get togther on Monday and start to develop a map and a plan.

As usual, our interest is in purchasing the gas from them.  The POGO Marketing management seems to be really good to work with.

Thanks,

Mark
