Theresa, 

I put the EJW deal into Sitara  and the # is 1131581.  Please let me know of the GD physical deal of 92 mmbtu/d.  I explained to Paul that we need to have the deal #'s for the Kennedy Oil deal done last week.  It needs to be in Sitara if it is already in TAGG.  If it is not in Sitara, it causes and imbalance of my positions.  

Thanks. Let me know about the deal #'s.
