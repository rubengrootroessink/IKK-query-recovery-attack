Paul and Thersa,
Needed to check on a couple of things before I get to far into November.  

Paul - have you heard or seen anything from Gerald in the contracts?  I
would think that the contracts would be a mode point at this stage since the
deal ended 10/31.  Would you please check with your people and get back to
me on the status of these contracts and documents still floating around?


Thersa - I need to know what the phyiscal balance for Young Storage is at
10/31.  Can you send me the balance and the Young Storage invoice for
October?  I need to know the storage balance as soon as possible.  You
should have that before the invoice arrives.


Thanks...Robert
