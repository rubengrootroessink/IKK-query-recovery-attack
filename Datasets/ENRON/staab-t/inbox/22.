On contract #LC-IT-002, there is an additional receipt and delivery on 09/13/01 for 7000 dth.  
For the imbalance to be correct, we have to have 7,000 dth delivered, but neither WIC or CIG
is showing this, and its causing an interconnect.  Can you please let me know where this needs
to be delivered to?
 
Also, have you heard anything from PSCO?
 
Thanks, Gloria
