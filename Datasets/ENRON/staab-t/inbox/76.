Hi Theresa,

We're under A TON of pressure this month to get our money in the door on time and as close to invoice amount as possible. I want to make sure these people have absolutely no reason to pay us late. As soon as you have the spreadsheet done, please email it to me so I can tie it to the system. Thanks for your help!!!
