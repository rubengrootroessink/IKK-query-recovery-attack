Theresa,
as per Stacey Richardson's email changes can not be made in the system unless legal documentation of counterparty name change is provided to contract administration.

Thanks,

Sean,

There have been quite a few name changes from various KN counterparties in the recent past, but no one in the group can remember seeing anything recently or can find any such documentation.  GCP hasn't been changed, so they apparently haven't gotten the documentation either...
