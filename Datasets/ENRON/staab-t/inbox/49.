All deals done into FUGG should be papered to CMS Field Services.  Once the gas passes beyond GlenRock physically, the entity will change to CMS M,S & T.

Paul,

Deal # 1022414 with CMS Marketing, Services, & Trading for Sep production gas sales on FUGG has you listed as the deal maker or contact.  Both CMS Marketing, Services, &Trading and CMS Field Services, Inc. Settlements groups believe this deal was actually made with CMS Field Services, Inc.  Therefore, I believe this deal needs to be changed to reflect the correct counterparty name.  Please advise or change as necessary.

Furthermore, deal # 1020432 for Sep production gas sales on FUGG has the same problem.  I cannot determine whether you are the deal maker on this deal, but it requires a similar change to CMS Field Services, Inc.  Both deals are Denver deals.

Please let me know if you have questions or when this is complete.

Sean - Please add anything where possible.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
