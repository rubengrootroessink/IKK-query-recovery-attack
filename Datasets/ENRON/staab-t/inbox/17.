Walt
  We are nominating figures at this time  thinking that prices should be around $2.00/mcf in Nov.  If by the end of  Oct., it appears that we can't make a profit by producing in November because of  continuing low prices, we will amend our nomination to a lower figure or a  complete shut-in as we did this month.  If you need more information, you  can give Stan Smith a call at 307 673-1500. 
                                 Thanks,
                                  Bill Courtney
