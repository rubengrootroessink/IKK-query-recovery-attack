Thank you.

I have sent your note to Sean Riordan.  He should be able to make the necessary changes.

All deals done into FUGG should be papered to CMS Field Services.  Once the gas passes beyond GlenRock physically, the entity will change to CMS M,S & T.

Paul,

Deal # 1022414 with CMS Marketing, Services, & Trading for Sep production gas sales on FUGG has you listed as the deal maker or contact.  Both CMS Marketing, Services, &Trading and CMS Field Services, Inc. Settlements groups believe this deal was actually made with CMS Field Services, Inc.  Therefore, I believe this deal needs to be changed to reflect the correct counterparty name.  Please advise or change as necessary.

Furthermore, deal # 1020432 for Sep production gas sales on FUGG has the same problem.  I cannot determine whether you are the deal maker on this deal, but it requires a similar change to CMS Field Services, Inc.  Both deals are Denver deals.

Please let me know if you have questions or when this is complete.

Sean - Please add anything where possible.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
