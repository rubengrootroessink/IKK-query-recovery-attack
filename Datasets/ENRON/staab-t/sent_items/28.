Mom,
That's sounds fine to me.  Would they go horse back riding that day or a different day?  Where they live will there be things for the kids to do?  It sounds like they have a lot of kids around so there should be things for them to do.

I talked to Jan this morning about a bigger cabin and the 10 person one is the biggest one.  She called and reserved another 4 person one for $100.  I'm gonna call Tim and let him know that he and Dawn can have that one.

I'll call you at work too  because I'm never sure if you get these e-mails from me.

Theresa

Hi There!
I got an email message from Sandy this morning and she has a good idea.  She wants Dad to make chicken booyah for us all at their house on Saturday. What do you think?

Here's part of her message;
Love,
Mom

Hi Carmen,

Still having problems with virus here, so our email has been up and down.
 
Verle told me your family is coming for Thanksgiving, how exciting! I have
about 27 coming for sure and maybe 7 more. My other two nephews and their
families have told grandma they want to come, but I have not heard from
them.   I was hoping Mike was willing to make boulia (sp?) maybe on
Saturday.  We could do it at my house.  If he will cook I will buy! That
would be so much fun, that way we could meet your family and you could meet the rest of Verle's.  I would love to take Dawn and Sara riding. When will
you know for sure if they are coming?

Well, I had better get to work.  Thanks for all the email.

See ya, Sandy
