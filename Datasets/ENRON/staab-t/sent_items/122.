Amy,
I just now opened my e-mail (7:30)  - I've been trying to figure out where you were because I saw the capacity reports and the Gas Daily.  I thought you left to go get breakfast.  DARN!.
 
I hope you feel better.   I wouldn't worry about coming in today.  Ty needs to work on our model before we could start anything anyway.
 
See you tomorrow.
 
Theresa

Theresa,
 
I ran the capacity reports and sent out the pricing sheet.   You should find a copy of the Gas Daily and the CIG reports on the printer.  I have a touch of food poisoning this morning but I may be in later.  I am connected to the network and just working from my house right now.... Call my cell phone if  you need anything or have any questions  I have been sick since yesterday afternoon so I am hoping that whatever I ate is almost out of my system.  
 
Thanks
Amy
