Green Bay, WI:
Green Bay Packers football practice was delayed on Wednesday for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Head Coach Mike Sherman immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate.
After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually the goal line.
Practiced resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not likely to encounter the substance again.
