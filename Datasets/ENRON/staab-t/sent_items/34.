Crestone should not be charging us for UA/4 (Unaccounted for). Our IT-002 contract is "all inclusive" which means no fuel or UA/4.  Walt and Scott will be fixing our statement and our # in the system is correct.
 
We will forward it to you as soon as we get it.

Thanks for sending this.  But what is this UA4?  The cumulative imbalance in Unify is 3,292 and this report
is showing 3,997.  Difference is 705 (UA4)....
