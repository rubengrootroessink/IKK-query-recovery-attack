Valerie,
The prices look fine in Sitara.  I cannot figure out where these prices are coming from.  Do you know who we could contact regarding the input of these prices into Sitara?  (IF CIG and CIG GD)

Theresa,

I've redrafted and we're still off--even more now. Since we're ok on volumes now, it's got to be pricing somewhere. Please look over and let me know.....

thanks!

The only revision is the 15th on the Gas Daily volume.  It is 775 not 264.

Thanks.
