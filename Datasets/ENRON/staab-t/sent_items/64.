I didn't mean to get you so bent out of shape.  I'll bug Holloway and let you know what he says.

I do have to wait until Nicole calls me back to see who she wants to trade for.  If she calls me yet today, I'll let you know.

Well, I am never a slouch in this league either.  And if you haven't looked
lately, you're in deep shit this year.  Now let's quit bull shitting and get
down to it.  I am all about Win-Win here.  If your reasonable, I'll be
reasonable.  

Send me your address.  I'll send you a check.  All I have ever done is ask
Holloway to pay you with what he owes me for my finishes in the league.
Sorry it took so long.  I'll take up my problem with weak Scott H.

Thanks, 
Jernigan

Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no
reason.

We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries
so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  

I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush
us.

We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.

And by the way - where's our $60?????

OK.  Since yall are so slow to think, here are a few ideas.  You have
two
solid WR's in Moss and Owens.  I have two solid RBs in L. Smith and C.
Dillon.  

Or let's get creative.  I can solidify your Giant's RB situation with R.
Dayne and another second tier RB for one of the above.  

Let's think out of the box.  That dear in the head lights look is why
yall
are in the position your in right now.

I want a good receiver.  You need a RB.
