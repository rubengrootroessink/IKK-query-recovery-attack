Chris,
I left you a voice mail also, but I wanted to let you know I do know about these transactions.

Please give me a call.
Thanks

Hi Theresa,
Do you know anything about two entries that hit co. 63K buying from 364 for 69,461 MM's and 52,221.  They were for production period Sept & Oct 2000.  They appear to be coming out of Unify, but I cannot see them.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks
