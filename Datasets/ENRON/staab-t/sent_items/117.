I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the Enron Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

That sounds great!  Can you fax the 08/01 invoices to me at 713-646-8420?
Thanks, Gloria

Gloria,
Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,
Theresa

There is an interconnect between WIC and FUGG for 09/01.  The WIC # ties to the
statement.  Can you please check the FUGG # ?  
Right now, I have some extra time.  I would love to help you guys with this imbalance.
Could I take a look at 08/01?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

Gloria,
Amy Felling here is working on current month and I'll continue on prior month variances.  We'll let you know the status of current month by tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks,

Theresa - here's the latest by month of the imbalance.  Please let me know if
there is any way that I can help you.  Could I look at current month, while you
look at the past stuff?  Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria
