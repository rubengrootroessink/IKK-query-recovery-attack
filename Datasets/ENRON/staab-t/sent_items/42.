Megan,
We only bought this on KN for the 30th.  I think it should be fixed now.  Let me know if it doesn't go away.

Thanks for keeping your eyes out there on our stuff!.

Theresa

Theresa:
Please check Devon SFS deal 933399 on KNE for 8/01.  We paid them for 8,000 on 8/30, but I am now seeing 8,000 on the 31st.  Do we need to pay for the 31st?  Deal 933399 does not have day 31 for KNE, so the volume is not pulling into settlements.  I see the extra 8,000 in volume management.  If it needs to be paid, we will need to add the day to the deal.
