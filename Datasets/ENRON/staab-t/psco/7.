ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS, SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS:


Weekend imbalance payback restrictions to PSCo will be lifted effective Gas Day November 3rd, until further notice and as system operations allow.  Plant Operators must confirm imbalance payback volumes to  PSCo by no later than 10:30 AM one business day in advance; payback volumes not previously confirmed will be cut and PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants that are over-delivering into the system without permission to do so.

Shippers/Nominating Agents can nominate imbalance payback gas to PSCo for the weekends following the normal nomination schedule.  If you have any questions regarding those nominations, please contact your Transportation Specialist.

PSCo's ability to accept imbalance nominations is subject to operational considerations; you will be notified via PSCo's EBB if imbalance payback restrictions are implemented again.

We appreciate your assistance in managing your gas load requirements responsibly.  Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns pertaining to your scheduling needs.
