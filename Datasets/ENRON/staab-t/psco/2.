PSCo files for decrease in the Gas Cost Adjustment ("GCA"):
  

Monday, September 17, PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to decrease the Gas Cost Adjustment component of its sales rates, which, if approved are expected to become effective October 1, 2001. This GCA decrease reflects the decrease in market price of natural gas.  In addition to the decrease in the gas sales GCA, a slight increase in the GCA applied to gas transportation service has also been requested, to reflect an increase in the upstream transportation and storage charges applicable to gas transportation customers.

The proposed new GCA's requested by PSCo are:

CG:	GCA = $3.504/Dth, for a new total CG commodity rate of $4.481/Dth.  
IG:	GCA = $3.285/Dth, for a new total IG commodity rate of $3.749/Dth
TF/TI:	GCA = $.055/Dth (current transportation GCA = $.047/Dth)

A Transportation Summary Sheet of the proposed rates is posted on the Web site for informational purposes.

IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Remember that GCA costs noted above and in the Transportation Summary Sheet reflect the proposed rates filed by PSCo, and are subject to revision and/or approval by the PUC before rates become final.  Notice identifying the new GCA rates will be posted on this website upon PUC final approval.
