ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS:

----EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY----


Due to the continuing warm weather and other operational considerations, Public Service Company (PSCo) cannot accept either:

Imbalance payback gas from Shippers/Nominating Agents
More gas than PSCo's transport customers will consume each day
3.	More gas than the volume currently confirmed from each plant into PSCo's system each day


Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo will activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas day NOVEMBER 9 AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo. 

Additionally, in order to avoid an OFO for over-deliveries (previously known as an OBP), Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate more gas than they will consume each day into PSCo's system.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.


Sincerely,


Monica Nedbalski
