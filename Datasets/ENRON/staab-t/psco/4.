ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS, SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS:

To help avoid the possibility of upcoming weekend OBPs, it is critical that Shippers, Nominating Agents and Plant Operators do not  schedule imbalance payback gas or deliver more gas than what is confirmed into Public Service Company's (PSCo's) system for each weekend, until further notice. 

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days September 21 (8AM MT Friday) through September 23 (8 AM MT Monday, September 24). 

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback gas to PSCo for gas days September 22 - 23.  Any imbalance payback gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  


Sincerely,

Monica Nedbalski
Senior Transportation Specialist
