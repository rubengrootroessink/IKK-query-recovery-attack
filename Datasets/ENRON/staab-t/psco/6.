PUC approves decrease in sales Gas Cost Adjustment ("GCA"):
  

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has approved PSCo's application to decrease the Gas Cost Adjustment component of its sales rates, effective October 1, 2001. In addition to the decrease in the gas sales GCA, a slight increase in the GCA applied to gas transportation service has also been approved.

Following is a sampling of the new GCA's:

CG:	GCA = $3.504/Dth, for a new total CG commodity rate of $4.481/Dth.  
IG:	GCA = $3.285/Dth, for a new total IG commodity rate of $3.749/Dth
TF/TI:	GCA = $.055/Dth (current transportation GCA = $.047/Dth)

A Transportation Summary Sheet of the approved rates is also available on the Website for informational purposes.
