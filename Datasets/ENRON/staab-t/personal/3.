I'm not sure that we would have anything right now here at Enron North
America, however, their may be opportunities at Crestone Energy / Bear Paw
(Northern Border) (all still Enron).  They are in another office at 16th
and Market headed by Brian Bierbach (720) 946-3612.

I'll mention it to Mark also.

Talk to you soon.

Do you think there might be a fit for me at Enron?  I talked to Mark Whitt
for a while after you left, and he seems like a nice guy, but I never asked
him about a job.  What do you think?
