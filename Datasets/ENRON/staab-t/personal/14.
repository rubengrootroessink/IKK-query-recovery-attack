A message from Vicky

Subject:	Hello from Vicky

<< The Candle:
I asked God for water, he gave me an ocean.
I asked God for a flower, he gave me a garden.
I asked God for a tree, he gave me a forest.
I asked God for a friend, he gave me YOU.
"There is not enough darkness in the world
to put out the light of one candle."

The Candle of Love, Hope and Friendship
