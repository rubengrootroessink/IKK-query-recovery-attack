Paul, 

Citizens has executed the new CIG contracts for its NNT and TF-1 service.  Copies will be forwarded to you from Flagstaff.  The contract delivery MDQ's are as follows: 

Contract No.            Type           MDQ 
331710000               TF-1           8,375 Nov - March 
                                               5,954  Apr, May, Sep, Oct 
                                               3,130  Jun - Aug 

331750000                 TF-1         2,175  Jan - Dec 

31029000                  NNT-1        6,579  Nov - Jan 
                                                6,441  Feb 
                                                5,151  Mar 
                                                3,750  Apr 
                                                2,519  May 
                                                   838  Jun 
                                                   972  Jul 
                                                   987  Aug 
                                                3,618  Sep 
                                                6,250  Oct 

In my earlier email on this subject, I had informed you that Citizens would have one TF-1 contract for 10,550.  As you can see, this is not the case.  A last minute change by CIG resulted in the two TF-1 contracts being continue except for changes for storage injection, which unfortunately I do not have, and the elimination of the discount on contract 331750000. 

Prior to October 1, 2001, this contract's reservation charge was fully discounted.  Effective October 1, Citizens will be paying full tariff rates.  As a result of paying full rates on Contract 331750000, the contract capacity is to be used in the capacity release computation. 

My apologies for not getting this information  to you sooner, but we were just made aware of the changes by CIG. 

Should you have any questions, please let Sean Breen or myself know. 

Sincerely, 

John
