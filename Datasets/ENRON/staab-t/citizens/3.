Paul, 

Below are the NNT service levels that will become effective October 1, 2001.

November                6,579 
December                6,579 
January                   6,579 
February                  6,441 
March                      5,151 
April                        3,750 
May                        2,519

August                       987

Additionally, I would like to confirm that Citizens' CIG TF-1 service effective October 1, 2001, will be 10,550 Dth/day.  Citizens will no longer have a sculpted service. 

Should you have any questions, please let me know.
