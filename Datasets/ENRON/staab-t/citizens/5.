Subject: Citizens - Deliveries to White Rock for LGSI/Woodward


Good morning Paul, 

I would like to do a little follow-up on our discussion last week regarding ENA deliveries to White Rock for the account of LGSI/Woodward.   

From discussion with Woodward today, I understand that ENA prior to the sale of LGSI to Atmos rendered a separate invoice to LGSI for gas delivered to White Rock for the account of LGSI.  Since the sale, Woodward has been invoiced by ENA for those deliveries. 

I understand that ENA has been LGSI/Woodward's supplier since May 2001 for its requirements on the Citizens' Arkansas Valley system.  Citizens needs to know for the time period May 2000 to current how much gas ENA has delivered to White Rock for LGSI/Woodward's account and under whose transportation agreement on the CIG system were those deliveries made. 

This information is urgently needed and we would appreciate your timely assistance in responding to this request.  Please forward the information to me with a copy to Craig Lipke. 

Should you have any questions, please give me a call. 

Best Regards, 

John 
For Citizens
