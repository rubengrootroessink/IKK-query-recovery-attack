Theresa.

I would assume that a documented agreement exists between ENA and Citizens 
that sets forth the monthly volume and hedged priced.  I would like a copy of 
that agreement, if it exists.  In absence of any such agreement, I would like 
to have a copy of anything documentation that will help Citizens validate the 
hedging transactions for the months July, August, and September 2000.  

Thanks for your assistance.

John
