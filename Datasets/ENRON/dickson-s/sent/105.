I am working on getting the Bowie contract.  Meanwhile, I spoke to the B & J 
attorney.  He asked if Enron wanted to continue to buy the gas.  I told him 
that his client should contact you directly so that you guys could discuss 
price.

Bowie, Inc. left me this e-mail this morning.  He would like to have a copy 
of his gas purchase agreement.  Per bowie, the contract number might be 
96-022415.

Thanks

Jim
