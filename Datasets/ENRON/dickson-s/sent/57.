Gregg, 

I have three minor changes to the agreement.  I have attached a red-line 
version reflecting my changes.

One more for the pile.  IDACORP has requested that 100% of the guaranty they 
receive on behalf of enovate to be issued by Peoples.  Peoples has prepared 
the attached reimbursement agreement which would obligate ENA to 50% of any 
payments made by Peoples under their guaranty.  We have issued several of 
these, going both directions.  Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have 
any questions.  Can you please review the reimbursement agreement, and if 
acceptable, prepare execution copies with initials?  This has a lower level 
of priority than the storage deals with Nicor and Coral which begin April 1.  

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks - Gregg
