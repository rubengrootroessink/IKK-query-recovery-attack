Stacy -

I will have to look at the ICE agreement and see if we can add affiliates to 
the agreement.  Since the agreement was negotiated, if they cannot add us to 
the current agreement, then they should be able to submit a similar version 
for enovate to use.

Mark, 

The traders at enovate in the Chicago office would like to be able to use the 
ICE system.  I understand that you are the person who should review these 
agreements.  If you are not the right person, please let me know.  I am 
sending a second e-mail that goes with this one.  Feel free to call me for 
any additional information that you might need.
