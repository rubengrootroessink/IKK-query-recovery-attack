Attached is the latest version of the above-referenced document.  It contains 
the changes requested by NUI.  I understand from Rudwell that he and Laura 
have agreed on the credit numbers and I have incorporated the numbers that 
they have agreed on.  Please call me at (713) 853-5705 should you have any 
questions.

Stacy
