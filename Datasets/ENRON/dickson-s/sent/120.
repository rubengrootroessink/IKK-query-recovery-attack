Mark, 

The traders at enovate in the Chicago office would like to be able to use the 
ICE system.  I understand that you are the person who should review these 
agreements.  If you are not the right person, please let me know.  I am 
sending a second e-mail that goes with this one.  Feel free to call me for 
any additional information that you might need.
