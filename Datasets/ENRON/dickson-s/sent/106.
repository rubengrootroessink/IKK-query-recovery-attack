 Attached is a GISB agreement for MCN.  It incorporates the three
revisions requested by MCN, namely (a) specify on the cover sheet that there
are "special provisions" consisting of one page; (b) add "and recorded under
Section 13.11" to the language at the top of Appendix 1, and (c) change the
word "Transporter" to "Transporter(s)" in Appendix 1, Section 11.2, last
word.

 Contact and other MCN information needs to be filled in on the cover
sheet.
