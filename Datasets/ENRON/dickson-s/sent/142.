Kim, 

I am sorry I have not called to see how you are doing.  How are you? How is 
Olivia and the rest of the family?  How is the house coming along?  

We are doing fine.  Meredith is sitting and eating some solid foods.  She is 
at a very fun age.  I am going to Chicago tomorrow on business.  I am going 
to have dinner with Esther on Thursday night.  

Talk to you soon.

Stacy
