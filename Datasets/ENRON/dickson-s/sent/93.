Paul, 

Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which 
incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There 
was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have 
also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for 
April.  Please review and give me your comments.

Stacy
