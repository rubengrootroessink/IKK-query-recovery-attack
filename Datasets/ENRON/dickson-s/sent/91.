Gregg, 

My thoughts on Allegheny's changes to the Master are similar to Mary's.  I am 
generally fine with the changes except 1) I would counter with lowering the 
liquidated damages to 10 cents (ultimately, this is a business decision)  and 
2) I would tell them that we need arbitration.  In some respects, it is more 
likely that disputes would arise under this type of deal so it is even more 
important to have arbitration. Please let me know if you want me to talk to 
anyone at Allegheny about their changes.

Stacy

 Attached, for your review, are my comments on Allegheny' proposed
revisions to the enovate Master Agreement.  The short answer is that I do
not oppose any of the changes, but there are at least two items that I
consider business decisions.
