Hi Debra!

As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the 
Master Firm agreement they received from 
Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as 
soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold 
and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you.


Thanks
Rudwell.

Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of
the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is
the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC.

The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent
with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to
enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and
discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put
closure to this agreement in the very near future.
