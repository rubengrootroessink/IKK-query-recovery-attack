Well MSN has found another partner but of course there are details to be 
worked out.  We do not know exactly when they will have services back but it 
will be in another few months.  We are currently talking to some other 
providers.  We will let you know more info as we get it or sign some 
contracts.  Thanks for your patience.

Stacey, 

I was in the MSN DSL pilot.  As you know MSN is no longer providing DSL 
through Northpoint.  You told me that Enron would not subsidize SWB DSL 
service which is what MSN suggested I sign up for.  What did Enron decide to 
do about DSL?  I could not tell from the ClickAtHome intranet.
