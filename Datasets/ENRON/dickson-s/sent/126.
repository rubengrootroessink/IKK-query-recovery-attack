Stacy - 
After speaking with Rudwell about the credit amendment to the Master, I have 
made revisions to the attached document to reflect our conversation.  
Basically, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is an independently rated 
entity.  As such, we will not be receiving a Parent Guarantee on their 
behalf.  I think I have removed the references to the parent guarantee, but 
can you please review the attached to make sure I did not miss anything.  

Rudwell - If I mistated anything, please let us know.

Thanks - 

Gregg

Firm Agreement covering the credit provisions.  Please review and give me 
your comments.
