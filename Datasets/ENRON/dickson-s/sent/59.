To prepare the confirmation for this deal, we need to make a few changes to 
the standard form:

1. Incorporate the revolver document  Articles 3-7 by reference that I 
forwarded earlier.  I think this is the easiest way. We will need to make the 
appropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at 
the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we need 
(name of agreement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.  
Since NUI must already comply with all of this for the bank, it should not be 
too burdensome for them.  If they push back, I have marked the specific 
sections that we need to include at a minimum.

2. We need to delete the reference to the collateral threshold and 
requirement to post performance assurance in the Master.

3. Do we need to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have 
redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?  Or can we just state 
that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the 
Master, if applicable?

Can you think of anything else that I am missing?

Mark, please send me the updated model.

Call me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
