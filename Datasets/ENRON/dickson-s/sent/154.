Congratulations on the new job and promotion.  I did not respond to you 
sooner because I was on vacation in Arkansas last week .  I will try to call 
you soon.  Can you do lunch now that you have a new job?

Hey.  I've been so busy.  Most of May was a whirlwind.  John's sister,
Lynn, got married two weekends ago.  Then, we went on vacation for the past
week to Kiahwah.  Oh, and I switched jobs.   I am now the Managing Director
of our internal trading platform.  I miss Jennifer, she was really great to
work with.  Such a nice person.

How have you been?  How is Merideth?  I took a cute picture of her sleeping
from when you were over and she had tired herself out from crying (hee,
hee).  Anything else new with you?  Paige had her baby.  A little boy named
William after his pop.  She has taken to motherhood and absolutely loves
it.  She's even talking about #2 already.  She's always been a kind of
crazy that way!

Call me when you get a chance.  I still have the same work number
(713-207-1341) and John is out traveling all week so I have time to chat at
night, too (713-432-0470).  Not that I wouldn't have time to chat if he was
around!

Talk to you soon!

Renee
