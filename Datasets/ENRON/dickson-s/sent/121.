 Cary,

 Thanks for making time to see me today. Please accept this email as
notification that the $500 monthly user fee will be waived through October
31st, 2001. We will provide you with at least 60 days prior notification
before initiating any "User Fees" thereafter. However,  this does not
include commission charges for trades made on IntercontinentalExchange.

 Feel free to contact me if you have questions concerning our
Participation Agreement or with any other matter. Let me know who to speak
to about getting a demo system installed so that you can practice before
going live.

 We look forward to having you join The ICE soon!
