I have asked Pat Radford to put the enovate Master Firm and the enovate GISB 
in Attorney's Forms.  Until she is able to do that, you can find these forms 
as follows:

1) The Master Firm is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovate master 
firm.doc
2) The GISB is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovateGISB.doc

Please let me know if you have any problems locating these documents.

Stacy
