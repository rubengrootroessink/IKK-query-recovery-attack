Deirdre,

Given the credit quality of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) no 
credit terms will need to be placed in the GISB.

Russell - 

We are trying to get a 5 month sale in place with WEPCO - and Stacy Dickson 
said it would be possible to do the sale under a GISB if credit provisions 
were attached under the special provision section.  

The deal we are interested in is a 5,000/day sale at ANR/Alliance with a 
price of Nymex plus $0.14.  They would like the right to fix Nymex at any 
time.  What credit terms would you require (material adverse change, letter 
of credit) would you guys need?

Thanks - 

Deirdre
