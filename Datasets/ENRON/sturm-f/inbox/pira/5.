Danielle,

My name is Fletch Sturm and I run the Midwest/Southest power desk reporting to Kevin Presto at the new UBS Warburg Energy.  Kevin has asked me to be the contact to PIRA for all of power and gas.  I'm in the process of gathering information on their services as well as internal requests for specific reports, etc.  Chris Gaskill has informed me that there may be legal issues regarding Enron history with PIRA and that all negotiations over services/fees need to go through the market data group.  Is this an old Enron problem and not a UBS issue?  Please inform.

Thanks,

Fletch
