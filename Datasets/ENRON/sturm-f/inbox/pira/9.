Hi  Fletcher,
 
 Allan Stewart asked me to contact you. Weappreciate yourinterest in PIRA Energy  Group's energy analytical services.   
 
Attached  is a description of PIRA's service offerings and an Excel file showing a  price matrix with annual fees.   Our base retainer service is for up to 10  users at one site (office location) under a site license agreement. One retainer  is $25,000 (e.g., natural gas), two retainers are $35,000 (e.g.,  electricity and natural gas) and three retainers are $40,000 (add  oil).  Fees for additional services such as emissions market  intelligence and the daily electricity demand forecast are shown to the right of  the main table. Clients with users of PIRA's services in multiple offices  can arrange a site license for higher usage.
PIRA's clients range from the top 20 natural gas and  power marketers, to every major gas and oil producer, to  large financial institutions, to energy end users.   
Feel  free to call or write about the services.  My colleagues and I would be delighted to  have UBS Warburg as a client.  
Victoria
