Ben and Fletcher -- I would be interested in knowing your comments on the portions of this dealing with TVA.  The proposed legislation would eliminate the "fence" restricting wholesale competition.  It also provides that TVA may only conduct retail sales to certain customers inside the TVA area, and that TVA can construct generation only to meet the demands of certain wholesale customers inside the TVA area.  It would bring the TVA transmission system under FERC jurisdiction and authorized it to participate in an RTO.  TVA would also be made subject to certain Federal antitrust laws.   If you open the second document, the relevant portions are summarized beginning on page 9.

Attached are: (1) highlights summary; (2) section-by-section summary; and (3) almost 150 pages of leg text (PDF doc) on Chairman Barton's draft electricity restructuring bill.  The RTO and bundled/unbundled sections will be provided "soon" (they day) (I am meeting with Mr. Barton's staff in a half hour), but there are "voluntary RTO" provisions in the incentive pricing section since they lifted that language from Burr-Sawyer legislation.  Mr. Barton has publicly said his addedum will mandate RTO participation at some point; I should know more after the meeting.  The draft below addresses a variety of issues, including TVA, BPA, etc., among others, that we also care about.  There is a retail consumer aggregation feature toward the end.  If you could look at the summary and section-by-section and let me know particular areas of interest/concern for further review that would be helpful.  Barton is taking comments through this week and next week.
