Fletcher,

We talked a few minutes ago about this Ameren V. Cinergy Peak spread (bid:
-0.40 / offer 0.00) product.

Does this translates that a Counter Party can buy in Ameren at a $0.40
discount to the Cinergy Price and sell in Cinergy at the market index price?

Please confirm.  Thanks,

Dave Boone
