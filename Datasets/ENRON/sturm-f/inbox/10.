Fletch:

The Bridge/Telerate system will not be migrated to the UBS infrastructure.  I noticed you had an account but wasn't sure if you actually use the application?  Let me know and I will have a Kobra (Reuters)  trainer help setup anything you are not able to pull up into the Kobra app.

thanks,

Danielle
