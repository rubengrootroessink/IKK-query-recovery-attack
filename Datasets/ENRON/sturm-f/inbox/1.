BILLING FOR RETAIL ENERGY--A HURDLE FOR MARKETERS AND FOR A STRONG MARKETPLACE

The ability to effectively bill customers remains a central, fundamental
requirement for a retail energy marketer. Although the billing function is
central to the relationship among marketers, utilities, and customers, the
diversity of market rules and lack of national standards continue to hamper the
marketplace.

*  Underestimation of the billing function's complexity spelled disaster for
marketers at the outset of retail customer choice.

*  Billing's initial promise of a new profit center has been a bittersweet
experience to date, but progress is being made.

*  Recent efforts to develop nationwide standards could remove many hurdles
from the retail marketplace.
