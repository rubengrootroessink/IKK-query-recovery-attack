Title: Atlantic Basin Distillate Market Update

***********************************************************************

ATLANTIC BASIN DISTILLATE MARGINS PRESSURED BY WEAK DEMAND AND AMPLE STOCKS

In stark contrast to last winter's exceptional strength, spot distillate-to-
crude price differentials in Atlantic Basin markets are likely to stay weak:

Demand is down relative to a year ago, resulting from declining air travel, 
mild temperatures in North America, and much lower North American natural gas 
prices.

* Inventory levels are comfortable, with primary inventories in the United 
States and consumer stocks in Germany particularly high.

* Market psychology is preoccupied with the weak economy and downside risks, 
whereas a year ago a psychology of shortage prevailed in energy markets.
