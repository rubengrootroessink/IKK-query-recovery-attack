John,

The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to 
Sitara and Tagg.  I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells 
me they should be ready tomorrow.

Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the 
product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.  For now, 
we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.

Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as 
US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis 
filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format:

  US GAS BASIS      GD/D SoCal - HHub

The only product that will be different is the Nymex to daily swap which will 
be:

  US GAS BASIS      NXL1 - GD/D HHub

Any questions or comments,

Fletch
