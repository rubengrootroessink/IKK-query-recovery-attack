Louise,

I mentioned an idea to Jeff Shankman the other day about providing some 
charting and other types of tools to EOL users and he asked me to get with 
you.  He said you were already working on some additions to the website.  I 
would really like to participate in the development of these tools, so please 
let me know when I can get with you and discuss my ideas.

Thanks,

Fletch Sturm
