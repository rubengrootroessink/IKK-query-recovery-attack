jenny,
i'd really like to be able to set my curves through Dec '03 without having to 
freak with that g.d. contango weighting table in the MW4 file.  the market 
changes so fast during the day that i don't have time to switch between my 
MWSum and MW4 files fast enough to keep up with it.  i have a section in the 
MWSum spreadsheet where i keep all of the quick calcs on the calendars, so i 
could link that to the MW4 file like i'm doing through Oct '02.  come by 
tomorrow (Fri) and i'll show you what the h i'm talking about.
