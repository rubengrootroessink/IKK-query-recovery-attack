good morning!

just wondering if you've talked to Gas Daily yet and if you need anything 
more from me...also, i'd like to see what you're going to give to them (G.D.) 
with regard to facts about the products, EOL, etc...  we'd like to launch the 
products on Fri and have the article appear on Mon because the audience 
should be bigger than Fri.
