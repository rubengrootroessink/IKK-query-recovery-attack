Melba,

I'm sorry I haven't replied sooner, but there is a decision to be made about 
what type of product these should fall under...Gas Daily, or Basis.  We're 
afraid that if we categorize them as Gas Daily, then anyone who logs onto the 
site looking for basis would miss these products altogether.  The "US GAS 
DAILY  HeHub - CHIC" is cleary the best description for the website.  I'll 
get back to you as soon as we make a decision.
