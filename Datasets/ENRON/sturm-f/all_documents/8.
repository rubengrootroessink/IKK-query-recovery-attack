Notice No. 00-421
December 12, 2000

MEMORANDUM

TO:       ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM:          Neal L. Wolkoff
          Executive Vice President

DATE:          December 12, 2000

RE:       Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on
NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;

The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an
Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors
and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules
apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution), remains in effect
and will continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified
otherwise by the Exchange.

As background, on October 6, 2000, the Exchange issued a Notice to Members
(#347), advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this
Resolution.  The Resolution, which became effective with the commencement
of the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday, October 8, 2000, has amended
on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as
those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is
included below.

The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation
of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By
significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading
activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;, the Resolution reduces the
possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied
functionality.

The Resolution amends, on a temporary basis, Exchange price fluctuation
limit rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX
ACCESS&#61495;.

Thus, the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas
are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution.

The Resolution amends the Exchange's price fluctuation limit rules with
regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways:

(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange
futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial
and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two
contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with
limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the
applicable rule.

(2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months
for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures
contract.

(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or
offer, trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted
immediately, rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for
five minutes. During the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session,
the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to
incorporate expanded price limits.

(4) As a clarification, the Resolution suspends use of certain "haircuts"
narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically,
NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX
ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the
base point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the
RTH session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will
continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.
However, Rule 6.56 reduces applicable price limits by certain specified
percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as
the base point for establishing limits. Such "haircuts" are not being used
under the Resolution; the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts
following the expiration of the Resolution.

Finally, the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange
practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;
traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular
Trading Hours (RTH) trading, then the RTH session would open with expanded
price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This
practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution
is in effect, even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading
during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not
hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.


*    *    *    *
As noted, these temporary amendments to the Exchange's price limits shall
expire on February 1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the
Exchange.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE
FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc:

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with
limits) shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures
contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low
price fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted
immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the
President's designee.  Following resumption of trading, the price limits in
effect shall be 200% of the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event
that a limit is touched during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc
session, the market shall be halted briefly, and price limits shall be
expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded
for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price
fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the
RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided
under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading
occurred during the NYMEX ACCESSc trading session.
