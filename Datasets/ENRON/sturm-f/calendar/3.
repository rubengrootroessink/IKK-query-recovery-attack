All, 
Per Fletch, 2:30 seems to work for today's meeting.  TJ will send the room number around.  I've put together a short agenda and presentation to work from.  It'd probably be useful if everyone would bring information from the various customer lists we've been working on, as well as ideas on product offerings.
 
Thanks,
Dale

Let's meet today at 2:30pm if that's ok with you and the other guys including Larry and Maria.  I'll book it upstairs here and provide you with the room#.

TJ,

Could you please book a room for 7 and reply?  Thanks, who is?
