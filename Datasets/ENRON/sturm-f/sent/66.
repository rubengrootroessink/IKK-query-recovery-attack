Douglas,

Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not 
really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty 
of swap transactions.  Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for 
both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.  Thanks 
again,

Fletcher Sturm
