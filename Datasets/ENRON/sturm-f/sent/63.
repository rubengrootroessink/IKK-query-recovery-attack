Sheri,

Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.  I'd like to have 
her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the 
website.  I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't 
know about the others.  In addition, her trades (stack manager customer 
trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).  If 
you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.

Thanks,

Fletcher Sturm
