Jeff,

Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have 
time(?).  I just wanted to brief you first.

I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 
8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk 
meetings.  This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since 
changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be 
fresh in everyone's mind.  Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in 
basis until 8:30?  I think it would be worth it.
I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups 
(origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a 
regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's 
basis positions.  Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to 
involve and maybe notify them of my intentions?
Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain 
strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured 
positions?  I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being 
"cluttered up" in different books (i.e.  the P/L from these trades would be 
my focus instead of managed by other traders.)  
Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?  It seems 
like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.

Talk to you soon,

Fletch
