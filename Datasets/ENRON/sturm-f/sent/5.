Jeff,

With little physical knowledge of the transmission and generation 
constraints, etc., it's going to be difficult for me to say, geographically, 
where I think the boundaries ought to be.  However, I think the market would 
always prefer a simple layout, something like MISO - West, - Central, - East, 
- South.  To me, I think that would cover the basic areas that trade 
differently in terms of price.
