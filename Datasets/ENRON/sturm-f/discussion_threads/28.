Crestar, further to our conversation and the subsequant deal with Crestar, 
please find attached the term sheet that was used to discuss the specifics of 
the deal. 

As discussed, you will need to incorporate some of these details into the 
confirm between ENA and Crestar. 

The legal document will be binding but this doc is the premise of the 
discussions. 

Call me if you have any quesitons.  Barry
