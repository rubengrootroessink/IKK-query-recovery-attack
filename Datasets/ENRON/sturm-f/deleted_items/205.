No changes.

The first major Arctic air mass of the year will push into the northern
Plains early to mid next week. Most of Canada will also be much, much colder
than it has been. Check temperatures in Calgary next week and see what I
mean.  Overall, a stormy and much cooler weather pattern for the nation next
week, but the major cold air will hold up in the northern Plains and Upper
Midwest. In agreements with our thoughts from Wednesday, the cold air will
NOT blast into the East and South next week, and it will remain mild in
these areas.

The weather will continue to be stormy in the longer range and turning
gradually colder. I believe the MRF is still too mild looking in early
December, but I still don't believe any major cold reaches the East Coast or
the Deep South before December 5. After that, I continue with my thoughts
that overall, cold weather will overwhelm much of the nation east of the
Rockies after December 5 and by December 15. I still cannot tell how cold or
any of the details as it is still a long way off. I am basing my thoughts
more on the European model here as it SHOULD do better in this weather
pattern.

Earth Sat seems reasonable in their 6 to 10 today, but in my opinion, it
will probably turn out to be colder in the 11 to 15 day across the Plains
and Midwest than they are showing.
