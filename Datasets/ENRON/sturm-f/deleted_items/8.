LIBYA--ON THE SLOW ROAD TO REMOVING SANCTIONS

September 11 has had the unexpected effect of increasing the likelihood of a
normalization of relations between Libya and the outside world, as Colonel
Muammar Qadhafi as taken this tragedy as an opportunity to cooperate in the war
against terrorism.

* In a few weeks the Special Court should rule on the appeal of the Libyan who
has been condemned for the bombing of the Pan Am flight in December 1988. This
verdict will open the door for decisive negotiations.

* Agreement on the responsibility of Libya and on the principle of
compensations seems within reach although a final decision on the compensation
package might prove more difficult.

* While American oil companies are waiting for the normalization of relations
with Libya, non-US companies are stepping up their presence in the country.
Whatever the delays, the Libyan Leader seems ready to wait, and the threat of
nationalization of the assets of American companies has receded.
