Sounds good...  I'll just find you on the floor and we can talk at your desk or grab a room.  I have an overall IT update meeting with Lloyd, Stacey, Corry, Thresa, Rika, etc... at 1:30 in ECS05776 that you are also welcome to attend if interested...

Thanks,  Steve

Steve,

It looks as if we're going to be trading effective Mon (2/11).  I'm looking for some assurance that we'll have at least the basics ready to go with regard to position manager.  Can you update?  Thanks,

Fletch
