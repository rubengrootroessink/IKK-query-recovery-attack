Hello Fletch:

Sorry to bother you with this, but I really do not know of any applications
outside of our internal apps and thought maybe you would know.

Let me know.


Thanks and enjoy the New year.
Daniel


QUESTION:

I have a little project on the side:

Q: Any way to get a copy of a tuned down version of  their crack crude oil
 gasoline, heating oil futures arbitrage spread program/ position keeping,
 profit and loss software for my hedge fund I am putting together?

     Their currency trading position keeping system? or hedge trading system

     they have a ltd partnership futures/ spot position keeping profit and
loss position keeping system

     if not there: is there a small set of vendors you know of through your
     experience that offer trading position keeping and mark to market with
     prices from online internet pricing firm exchanges that would update
positions of my hedge fund.
