Tjae, there are 5 new Chappel Hill Broker Lines on the guy's phones.  They only need to log on and off to access them.  The lines are assigned as follows:
 
 
CHAP #1 - Rob Stalford - DONE
CHAP #2 - Russle Ballato
CHAP #3 - Mike Carson
CHAP #4 - Fletch Sturm
CHAP #5 - John Suarez
 
We will be on the floor all day today moving the first wave of traders, so if they need any help, we will be around.
 
Thanks - DAC
