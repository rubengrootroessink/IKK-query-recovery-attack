As the "head of whipping employees into submission" on the United Way for EWS...just kidding.

Honestly, in the process of scanning the EWS employee list, I noticed that you hadn't had an opportunity to go online and make a pledge, yet.  So  thought I would pass the access information on to you again and encourage you to take a few minutes to go online and pledge.

To access the United Way system....

Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/ and complete your online pledge.  You will need your GIS ID, which is your "9" number not your "P" number and your password.  If you have never accessed global apps, then your password is your Date of Birth (Format is YYYYMMDD - i.e., June 9, 1962 is 19620609).

If you are still having difficulty, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"

Or, you can also call the HRGIM Help Desk at ext. 3-5666 for assistance.

If you don't have time to do it, send me an e-mail with your pledge amount and I will do it for you.  Then the system will send you a confirmation for your records.

EWS is way behind on participation and dollars contributed.  We need your help!

Thanks.

Eric
