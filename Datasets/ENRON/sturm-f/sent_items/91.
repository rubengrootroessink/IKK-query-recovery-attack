Rika,

I talked to Jon and he is under contract.  I'll talk to Kevin about it and get back to you.

Fletch,

Please let me know what you think.  I talked with Kevin and he mentioned no, since he may not be under contract 

Thanks 

Rika

Fletch,

Could you please grant me access to the East Power Fundamentals site in an effort to coordinate our gas and power views.

Thanks,

Jon
