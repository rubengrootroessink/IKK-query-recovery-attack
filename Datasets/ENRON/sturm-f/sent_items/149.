Just passing along some information from the Chicago office.  You may alrea=
dy know this, but here is what I have heard.

Peoples Energy/Dominion's Elwood plant is currently being inspected and rep=
aired for cracks in the turbine blades.  The problem was explained to me as=
 a result of a new blade grinding process being performed by a third party =
which has affected a large batch (potentially 153 units) of GE FA's (150MW'=
s).  The Elwood plant is one of the first units to be inspected and repaire=
d (Dominion had 2 units done prior to Elwood).  The inspection can be done =
on-site but involves removal and non-destructive testing of each blade (the=
re are 92 blades in this section of the FA) and is subject to availability =
of replacement blades and trained personnel.  The Elwood plant has taken ap=
proximately one week working two twelve hour shifts.  One turbine required =
replacement of all blades.  GE is currently telling FA customers that they =
should conduct inspections at the customer's earliest convenience due to pr=
oblems experienced in testing and through field verifications (Elwood).  Th=
ey have not suggested any failure rates as a result of this problem.  I am =
assuming that most customers will choose to postpone inspections depending =
on the particular offtake structure. =20

I will pass along any additional information I hear regarding this situatio=
n.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gregg
