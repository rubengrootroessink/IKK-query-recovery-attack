Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.
