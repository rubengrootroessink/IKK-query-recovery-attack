Tomcat,

Sorry it's taken so long, but finally made contact with a guy at Williams regarding your interest.  His name is Michael Westbrock and he's the term ComEd trader.  I just forwarded your resume to him after speaking with him over the phone.  His e-mail is michael.westbrock@williams.com and his phone # is (918) 573-8752.  He said feel free to follow up with him directly later this week after he's had time to look into it.

Good luck,

Fletch
