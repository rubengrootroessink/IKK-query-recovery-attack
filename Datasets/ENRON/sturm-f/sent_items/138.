I have decided that I would like this product to be set up the other way around where it is quoted as ComEd vs Cin.  I realize that it will show up as a negative spread, but I have other basis (spread) locations in mind that trade over Cinergy and can see how it will be confusing to some people in the industry.

The changes, except for the scheduling changes, have been included in the proposed final version of this East Power Physical Spread product and as requested confirm that I currently have no further issues with this product. 

The quicker we can get the scheduling language added the better, especially from the trader's perspective.
