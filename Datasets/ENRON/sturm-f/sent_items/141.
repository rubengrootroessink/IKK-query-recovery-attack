Jeff,

Thanks for the referral.  My book should still be available on amazon.com, barnes&nobel.com, and at pennwell.com  If not, I don't know where else to get it.  Things are great with us...hope so with you too!

Fletch

Hi Fletch!  I have an associate in my group that is very interested in the trading side of the biz.  Where can I get one of your books, and when I get one can you do a little personalization for her from the "energy God??"  Hope all is well with you, Toni, and the kiddo's.
