Mike,
 
I've talked with Kevin about adding another term-trading position position on my desk (TVA, the one we spoke about), and we're still not sure at this stage if that's the best place to allocate talent just yet.  For sure, when business is up to the level it was before the crash last year, that's definitely somewhere we'll need to add, but for right now we're still assessing.  As I said before, the dust is still settling (i.e. shuffling people and positions) so I still need a couple more days to see what the best fit for you might be.
 
Thanks,
 
Fletch

Fletch,
 
Talked with Hunter Shively today; think that it went well.  Thank you for setting it up.  I would like to re-stress my interest in working for your group in East Power.
 
What is the next step?
