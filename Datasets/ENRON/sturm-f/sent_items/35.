Allan,

My name is Fletch Sturm, formerly with the wholesale trading group at Enron, now UBS Warburg Energy.  I worked closely with Rogers Herndon in East Power for most of last year (you might remember me) and wanted to see if we could begin some sort of dialog in terms of an agreement to retain your services here at UBS.  Kevin Presto has asked me to be the main contact to you on behalf of perhaps both the gas and power tading groups.  I look forward to discussing this arrangement with you further at your earliest convenience.  My contact information is as follows:

Fletcher J. Sturm
Executive Director
UBS Warburg Energy
(713) 853-9684 work
(713) 562-4207 cell
fsturm@enron.com  (temporary)

Thanks,

Fletch
