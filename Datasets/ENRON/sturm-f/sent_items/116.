I'm fairly busy this week, but could manage half an hour today from 3:30 to 4:00...otherwise, it'll have to be next week sometime.  Let me know over the phone...I may not have time to check my e-mail for the rest of the day.

Fletch:

I am on the EWS risk management power desk reporting to Rogers Herndon.  My territories include MAIN, ECAR and MAPP.  As you may already know, we are currently gearing up to physically serve retail load in the Midwest (mainly into Commonwealth Edison, Illinois Power, CG&E and Columbus Southern).  If you have time, would it be possible to meet with you and discuss the issues associated with buying power in these markets.  We currently have a substantial position in Illinois and are expecting to gain a fair amount of load in CG&E.

Thank you,

Guy Sharfman
