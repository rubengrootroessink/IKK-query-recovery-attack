Fletch -

I'm sending this to you per Jennifer's request.  It's available on the EGM Fundy site at http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/framework/default.asp.  Within publications select External Pubs>Daily Reports>ATS Report.  Or you may view the most recent edition in the following attachment.

Please note, there was not a report yesterday due to the Memorial Day holiday, so the most current one is from Friday.
