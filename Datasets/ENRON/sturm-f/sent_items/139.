5.	GE Looking to Restructure Generating Capacity Financing

General Electric is reportedly "deeply concerned" about the stability of
financing generating capacity in the US.  (GE has over 70% of the gas
turbine market.)  GE is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is
not raising its prices due to concerns about instability.  Sources believe
that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will
have to be restrucured in five years.
