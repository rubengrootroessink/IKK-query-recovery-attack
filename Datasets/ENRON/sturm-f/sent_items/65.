Evan,

Thanks for the party pic!  I bought one of those Sony digital cameras for Toni for Christmas.  I jumped up for the one with a mini CD.  We'll see how she likes it.  As for lunch, it looks like we'll have to make it some other time as I have lunch with my group today, I'm leaving before lunch tomorrow, and I'm taking Fri off.  Oh, the life of a Ch.11 employee...later, 

Fletch
