yea, I went to the website and they don't have the actual contract there.  I need to get a hard copy.  I'll call Tana.  Thanks.

I've got a meeting at 1:00 but here's the website.  Not sure if it has the actual contract.  When I get back I will look some more and I have a call into Tana Jones (paralegal) to see if she has a hard copy.
