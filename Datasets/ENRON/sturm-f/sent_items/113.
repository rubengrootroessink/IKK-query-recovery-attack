Dwight,

I wanted to get an update from you on the status of your RFP process.
In our former discussion, you had indicated that we were short-listed
and that I would be receiving some additional information as far as next
steps.  I understood that the second phase would be happening within a
couple of weeks.  I just wanted to see where you were in your process at
this point.  Thanks.
