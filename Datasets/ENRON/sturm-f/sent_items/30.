Dan,

Tomcat's a good guy who's eager to work his way up on an energy trading floor.  Thanks for your help on that.  I'm looking forward to buying you a few beers when you come down again.

I will pass Tomcat's resume on to other managers here at WIlliams. Everyone a little bit on eggshells here. I'm sure I'll be back in Houston soon. Would like to get together.
