Greg,

Wow!  What a deal!  I just wanted to thank you again for everything these past few months.  I can only imagine the toll all of this has taken on you and your family.  Everyone is very excited about the opportunity you and Hutch' have given us and we're confident we'll be successful.  Thanks again and good luck to us all!

Fletch
