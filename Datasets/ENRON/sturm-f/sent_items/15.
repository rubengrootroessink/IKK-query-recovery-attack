Yes, 1:30 is good.  I'm on the 6th floor in the new building back by the windows in the trading area.  There are plenty of conference rooms around here.  I'll see you then.  Thanks,
Fletch

Danielle,

I'd like to meet with you sometime today (I have a meeting from 10:00 - 11:30) to discuss what we're services we're talking to PIRA about for both gas and power.  Please let me know what time you can meet.  Thanks,

Fletch
