I printed out what you sent me earlier, have not read it yet, and can only meet after 3:30.  That's the best I can do.

Fletch - I'm leaving mid-aftn today to catch a flight to Ohio.  I will be on vacation the rest of this week and next week (attending my brother's wedding and other family functions).   I will give you a call when i get back (unless you can meet early this aftn).

Thanks,

Lisa
