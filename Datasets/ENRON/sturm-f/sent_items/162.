I'll gladly stop in to say hello sometime after 10:30am if that works.

PowerEx will be coming to Houston and would like to meet us on Nov. 7 9:00-11:00.

They are the marketing and trading sub of BC Hydro and have dealt before with our Calgary and Portland offices. They are now opening an office in Toronto and wish to transact more in MAPP, NEPOOL, PJM and SPP. The purpose of their visit is an informal meet n' greet to establish contact with people at Enron.

They will be coming with their Head of Origination and Head of Trading.

Please let me know if you or someone from your group would like to attend.

Thanks,

Dave
