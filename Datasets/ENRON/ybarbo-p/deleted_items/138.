Aditya Birla group pitches for picking stake in Dabhol project, Sourav Maju=
mdar & Namrata Singh=20

 The Aditya Vikram Birla group is understood to have put in a statement of =
interest for the beleaguered 2,184-mw Dabhol power project. This has create=
d a new twist to the Dabhol saga, which has been beset with uncertainties f=
rom the very beginning. The move comes close on the heels of the AV Birla g=
roup's decision last week to pick up Reliance Industries' over 10 per cent =
stake in construction and engineering major, Larsen & Toubro, for a conside=
ration of Rs 766.50 crore. Industry sources conjecture that the Birlas migh=
t also be interested in jointly bidding for an 85-per cent stake in Dabhol =
Power Company (DPC) along with the Tatas. Tata group company Tata Power has=
 already evinced a keen interest in bidding for the project, with the only =
other player in the fray being Mumbai's power utility major, BSES.=20

Tata Power and BSES have already commissioned a due diligence study as a pr=
ecursor to the bidding process. Birla group officials were unavailable for =
comment. Birla's interest in Dabhol has thrown up a fresh dimension to the =
DPC story even as it unfolds. The Birla group has a presence in the power s=
ector with Rosa Power. The 567-mw Rosa Power project is a joint venture bet=
ween the AV Birla group, which has a majority holding, and UK-based PowerGe=
n. The possibility of a joint bid along with the Tatas, if it were to happe=
n, would make this a second mega venture for the two major corporate groups=
 in India. The two groups had last year struck a mega merger deal with the =
telecom venture, Birla-AT&T-Tata. However, it is not known as to which of t=
he Birla group companies would be employed for the task of bidding for Dabh=
ol.=20

The 85 per cent stake in DPC under consideration includes the holdings of E=
nron Corporation, Bechtel Enterprises Inc. and General Electric, all US-bas=
ed companies. MSEB, which is currently waging a legal battle with DPC over =
non-payment of dues, holds a 30-per cent stake in the 740-mw phase-I of the=
 Dabhol project. The crux of the problem with the languishing project is un=
affordable tariff rates, which the promoters are currently deliberating on =
as to how this could be reduced. The 1,444-mw phase-II of the project has b=
een stalled midway. The bidding process for the stake under consideration w=
ould be critical with Enron, which was earlier demanding a price of $1.2 bi=
llion for exiting the project, agreeing to scale down the price demand by a=
lmost 30 per cent. Globally, parent Enron Corporation is being acquired by =
Houston-based Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion.=20

The arbitration proceedings initiated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) aga=

ifting of venue, a high-level team led by the state principal energy secret=

al for deciding future timetable to take up arbitration proceedings there. =
Official sources told The Financial Express that Mr Lal is accompanied by t=
he state government solicitors Rafia Dada, Atual Harayani and Daraious Kham=
bata. The state government team would hold talks with its arbitrator Quenti=
n Loh, DPC's arbitrator Andrew John Rogers QC (formerly chief judge of the =
commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales) and the arbitr=
ation tribunal head Lord Mustill. The meeting deserves special significance=
 especially when the DPC has agreed for due diligence by the Tata Power and=
 BSES after signing a separate confidentiality agreement with it.=20

This was agreed at a three-day meeting convened by the financial institutio=
ns at Singapore from November 8. Mr Lal's meeting with the arbitration trib=
unal is also crucial as the London Court through its ex-parte order of Octo=
ber 10 has restrained the state government from filing any suit in the Indi=
an courts or tribunals against the DPC. Sources said that the government th=
rough its arbitrator would make a strong plea that the arbitration proceedi=
ngs should await the outcome of the arbitration process between the DPC and=
 the MSEB in order to save both time and duplication. "This is in view of t=
he fact that the parties are the same and the disputes emanate from the sam=
e set of facts and contractual obligations of the parties and the arbitrato=
rs named by both the parties for all the three arbitrations (DPC has served=
 arbitration notices against the state government for latter's default in t=
he implementation of state support agreement, supplemental state support ag=
reement and state guarantee agreement) are the same," sources said. It must=
 be noted here that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC=

MSEB to skip DPC board meet=20

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided against attendin=

ovember 30. The board will reportedly discuss issuing of the final terminat=
ion notice (FTN). According to senior MSEB officials, the board is against =
the Enron-promoted DPC's proposal to grant the company's Managing Director =
rights to issue FTN according to his discretion. DPC has yet to approach it=
s lenders for a go-ahead to issue the FTN, which will end the stint of the =
controversy-plagued 2,184-MW power company in the country. "The decision to=
 issue final termination in turn means wiping out the very existence of the=

one person. The entire board of directors should vote on it,'' a senior MSE=
B official told Business Line. Another reason for the board's decision to n=

is that MSEB does not have voting rights despite being a 15 per cent stakeh=

The Enron scandal
Enron's root problem was in its investment activities, says A V Rajwade

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." - James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm=
. As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of m=
anagement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate discl=
osure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events ove=
r a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its =
share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC=
) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest rep=
orts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong=
? No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India=
, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, els=
ewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance=
 and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures wo=
uld make an excellent case study!)=20

But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked. Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its ac=
counts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and incre=
asing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating=
 was downgraded. It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of=
 power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the =
CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the inves=
tee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidatio=
n of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured o=
f equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fal=
l below agreed threshold(s).=20

All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius. Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleg=
ed superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmic=
ks were blessed by the company's auditors - one of the Big Five firms, whic=
h was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services b=
y Enron last year. The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became=
 necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on r=
eview, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on,=
 rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in questio=
n are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough.=20

But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. Perhaps because it was too=
 arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their =
opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? =
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts, but few questioned the management ag=
gressively on the subject.=20

Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times - =
trading assets was what the "masters of the universe" did, not the boring o=
ld business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron management itself =
was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in po=
wer and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that "we are on the sid=
e of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We are bringing th=
e benefits of choice and free markets to the world." (The quotation is from=
 an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious exit from Enr=
on a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20

For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks. Surely the role of "mar=
kets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, between producer and cons=
umer? One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that valu=
es, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget this is just a euphe=
mism for the speculator) over the producer - whether in the bond, currency =
or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed obviously have a r=
ole to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the lef=
t?=20

Hurry while stocks last
BSES and Tata Power, the two companies which are interested in buying out E=
nron's stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), should hurry up an=
d make their offers soon. Failing that, a consortium of financial instituti=
ons should get together to bid for the equity as a strategic investment, to=
 be sold off when prospects improve. There is a clearance sale at Houston a=
nd India must rush while stocks last. Enron is in deep financial trouble at=
 home, where debts of close to $700 million have to be paid soon. The Houst=
on-based energy giant is struggling to put together credit worth $1 billion=
, but less than half has come through. A merger with Dynegy, a smaller riva=
l, could also be in trouble. All of this means that Enron will be happy to =
see cash upfront, even at a substantial discount to the $1.1 billion valuat=
ion for DPC. Reports say that Indian FIs think $700 to $800 million is a re=
asonable price, but the payments would be staggered over five years or so. =
Given Enron's current cash crunch, it would be better to haggle for an even=
 lower price, but agree to pay all the money upfront.=20

Acquiring DPC for a fraction of its original equity value will mean that de=
bt will also have to be restructured drastically - all lenders have to take=
 drastic haircuts - otherwise gearing will swell beyond all reasonable prop=
ortion. With equity and debt written down, Dabhol power will become cheaper=
. That will be good news, but India should wait before declaring this a mil=
estone of power reforms. It isn't. The fundamental problems that make power=
 projects high risk investments remain unresolved. Jurisdiction is scattere=
d between central and state governments, power pricing is politically deter=
mined, theft is rampant and state electricity boards (SEBs) are bankrupt.=
=20

Private power producers may soon be allowed to sell electricity to non-SEB =
bulk buyers, but that won't solve basic political and administrative proble=
ms. The real reforms have to take place in the states, where nothing is hap=
pening. A lot of hullabaloo was made about power reforms in Orissa. Yet AES=
 tried to opt out because its distribution company faced enormous resistanc=
e while collecting dues from consumers. A recent World Bank study shows ref=
orm claims by states like Andhra are mostly hollow: rural power supply is p=
atchy, of poor quality and has failed to justify people's expectations. Thi=

Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow=20

A long weekend of work faced Dynegy and proposed acquisition Enron, whose w=
orsening stock woes on Friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renego=
tiated or collapse entirely. Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were exp=
ected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival E=
nron's complex books, as both parties race against the decline in Enron's s=
tock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires. Enr=
on shares ended down more than 5 per cent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the clo=
se of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy sha=
res closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 per cent, to $40.40.

Dynegy on November 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But=
, after falling 45 per cent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out o=
f cash before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about =
$4.03 billion. At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is wort=
h about $10.85 a share -- more than twice Enron's current share price. Exec=
utives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the revi=
ew, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter said. The sour=
ces said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday afternoon, and =
that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is fin=
ished. But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as =
a "material adverse change" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases o=
f Dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers s=
ay. "You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 per cen=
t spread on the deal," said one analyst. "There's unquestionably continued =
malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegot=
iate with Enron." UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a re=
search report that the likelihood was "soaring" that Dynegy might discover =
a material adverse change. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her =
knowledge, Dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition. She r=
epeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million to $=
1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet. Dyn=
egy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the com=
pany remains optimistic about the merger.

TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION

Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business -- the =
crown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets -- could cause low fourth-quar=
ter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its=
 profitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dy=
negy. Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem m=
ore likely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a mo=
ve they said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankr=
uptcy. This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped =
away from the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankr=
uptcy filing was highly possible. Traders, speaking on condition on anonymi=
ty, said they expected Dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the gr=
owing share price gap. Enron's depleted market value and the shrinking volu=
me in its EnronOnline trading system makes it more likely Dynegy could pull=
 out, traders said.

Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-ter=
m deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company'=
s credit rating would soon improve. Enron's bonds on Friday were again talk=
ed at junk-bond levels, but even lower than before. Enron's 6.4 per cent no=
tes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 cent=
s on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, accor=
ding to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 per cent an=
d 17 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent =
on the dollar to just over 33 cents.

Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit =
trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers won=
der how Enron has avoided it. "A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do =
with an investment-grade security," said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells =

Enron avoids junk status, NEW YORK

It is rare that holding onto investment-grade credit ratings means as much =
to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader Enron, and some ob=
servers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long. "The sum =
of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds," said Scot=
t Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he=
 invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. "A bond trading in the=
 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security." Enron's 6.4 per =
cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 c=
ents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, a =
trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 per cent and 17 per cent.

Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 per cent this year. Since October 16=
, when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downwa=
rd, its shares have fallen 86 per cent, and its bonds by nearly half. Houst=
on-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dyne=
gy, has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings restatements=
, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle. Its advisers were e=
xpected this weekend to pore over the company's books, which could lead to =
a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the matter said. Moody=
's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecured de=
bt ratings twice in the last month to their current Baa3" and "BBB-minus," =
their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating to "BBB=
-minus," and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.

The stakes could hardly be higher.=20

A downgrade to "junk" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force =
it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, =
and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said. Enron s=
aid in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of availabl=
e cash and credit lines. S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces "liquidity is=
sues," but enjoys an "alignment of interests" with its banks and a near-ter=
m financial position that "is expected to be sufficient" to allow the Dyneg=
y merger. Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that "our present 'BBB-minus'=
 rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lendin=
g banks." If Dynegy walks away, it said, "Enron's credit situation seems un=
tenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible."

Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next y=
ear, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later sai=
d it got a three-week reprieve. Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones =
Ratings in Philadelphia, likened Enron's ratings situation to those of Cali=
fornia's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern Califor=

Devil in the details, Devangshu datta=20

Looking at the market now, it's almost as though September 11 never happene=
d. The indices are back above September 12 trading levels,local investors a=
re trading enthusiastically, volume and price recovery is evident across th=
e board. Maybe this is because Kabul has fallen and Kandahar is within a we=
ek of collapse. But the USSR had control of every Afghan population centre =
within 24 hours of the 1979 airlift invasion. It already had a puppet regim=
e in place. The Red Army withdrew after eight more years of bitter fighting=
 and 35,000 casualties! It would thus take a historical ignoramus to assume=
 that this war will end with the capture of Kandahar. Other signals are eve=
n more disquieting. Every FII appears to be in the process of either pullin=
g out totally or cutting back on its Indian presence. There could be severa=
l reasons. The US slowdown has been cited, so has Enron. Whatever the reaso=
ns, it is an amazing turnaround of sentiment, given that 2001 began with th=
e FIIs pumping in money. There could be pressure on Indian reserves in the =
next fiscal and that could have prompted the currency downgrade. The market=
 revival is a little puzzling when one examines details. ICE stocks that ha=
ve delivered poor Q2 results have moved up sharply whereas ICE stocks that =
have delivered decent results have not. There are strong rumours that opera=
tors are trying to ramp up prices, lure in smalltimers and offload the K-10=
 stocks they've held since March.=20

Old economy movements could more credibly be ascribed to value-buying. But =
even here, a lot of action is based on rumour mongering. Some MNC is about =
to make an open offer, somebody else is going to divest a loss making divis=
ion. That sort of thing seems a little pronounced at the moment. Undoubtedl=
y there are value-based buys available. But value based buying requires the=
 strictest adherence to discipline and it's interesting to apply standard p=
arameters to the market as a whole. The Nifty is trading at a price-earning=
s ratio of 14 plus, it has a price book value ratio of 2.25 and a dividend =
yield of 1.6 per cent at current rates. This is an economy where returns of=
 approximately 6.7 per cent are safely available from short-term debt and i=
nflation is around 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent. Long term debt returns range=
 up to about 11 per cent for the savvy trader and around 9.5 per cent for t=
he passive investor.=20

A value investor would thus look to see if his projections suggested the fo=
llowing: First that EPS growth will beat at least 15 per cent, second that =
the P-BV is historically low and returns from capital gains plus dividend y=
ield would beat 15 per cent over the next year. Assuming constant inflation=
, and adjusting for dividend, the Nifty would have to improve by 12 per cen=
t to 15 per cent to meet the capital gains target. Overall EPS growth beati=
ng 15 per cent looks doubtful. P-BV is on the low side. A further index imp=
rovement of 15 per cent also looks a stretch. Broad-based buying thus seems=
 a 50-50 shot unless the investor waits much longer.=20

Enron staff sue as pension savings evaporate=20

AFTER climbing utility poles in all kinds of weather for 35 years, Roy Rina=
rd was hoping to retire in a few years, but that was before the collapse in=
 Enron's stock price devoured his retirement savings. "I'm basically wiped =
out," said Rinard, 54, who works for Portland General Electric, an Oregon u=
tility company acquired by the Houston-based energy trading giant in 1997. =
"I'm right back to ground zero and I'll have to go on working as long as I =
can," said Rinard, who suffers from arthritis and a lung condition that lea=
ves him short of breath. Encouraged by Enron's then-strong performance and =
the company's bullish view of its future prospects, Rinard moved all of the=
 money invested in his 401(k) retirement account into Enron stock earlier t=
his year.But it proved to be a costly decision as the value of his account =
fell from $470,000 a year ago to around $40,000 today. Rinard now hopes a l=
awsuit filed in US District Court in Houston will recover at least some of =
his money. The suit, filed on behalf of Enron employees by Seattle-based la=
w firm Hagens Berman, alleges that Enron breached its fiduciary duty by enc=
ouraging its employees to invest heavily in Enron stock without warning the=
m of the risks of doing so.

Enron's stock, which peaked at $90 in August 2000, closed at $4.74 on Frida=
y, after falling sharply in recent weeks amid a series of damaging financia=
l disclosures. A broadly similar suit filed by the Keller Rohrback law firm=
, also Seattle based, alleges that another Enron employee, Pamela Tittle, l=
ost $140,000 on Enron stock held in her retirement account. According to th=
at suit, the Enron retirement savings plan had assets worth $2.1 billion at=
 the end of last year, including $1.3 billion, or 62 per cent of the total,=
 in Enron stock.

DOUBTS EMERGE ABOUT DYNEGY DEAL

Enron, a former Wall Street favorite, agreed to be bought out earlier this =
month by smaller energy trading rival Dynegy Inc., but continuing problems =
at Enron have caused some analysts to question whether the deal will be com=
pleted. Doubts have also been expressed about a planned sale of Portland Ge=
neral to Northwest Natural Gas. Hagens Berman plans to seek class-action st=
atus for its suit and says 21,000 Enron employees could be eligible to join=
 it. The suit alleges that Enron "locked down" 401(k) retirement accounts o=
n October 17, preventing employees from changing the investments they held =
in their accounts until November 19.

During that period Enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years an=
d took a charge of $1.2 billion against stockholders' equity as a result of=
 off-balance-sheet deals that would later come under investigation by US re=
gulators. In that time, Enron shares fell from $30.72 at the close of tradi=
ng October 16 to $11.69 on November 19. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said =
employees' access to the accounts was blocked as part of a previously plann=
ed change in the administration of the retirement plan and that the measure=
 was in effect from October 26. to November 19.Steve Lacey, a 45-year-old e=
mergency repair dispatcher who has worked for Portland General Electric for=
 21 years, said the measure came at a time when bad news about Enron was fl=
ying thick and fast, driving the stock price down at a dizzying pace. "We c=
ouldn't take our money out of Enron stock into another portfolio. Basically=
 they had us locked down to where we had no say over our own future," he sa=
id.

Lacey declined to quantify his own losses but said he and many of his colle=
agues had invested most of their retirement funds in Enron stock because it=
 had performed better in the past than the other investments available unde=
r the Enron plan. Denne said Enron employees were normally able to choose a=
mong 18 different investment options, but Enron's matching contributions we=
re always made in the form of its own stock. Lacey said he felt sorry for o=
lder colleagues at Portland General who had suffered a heavy financial blow=
 just before they were due to retire, adding that he was only beginning to =
realize how serious the consequences could be for himself. "My goal was to =
have an extremely comfortable retirement and that may be a little clouded n=
ow," he said.( REUTERS )

Enron deal may be reworked=20

LONG weekend of work faced Dynegy and proposed acquisition Enron, whose wor=

ted to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enr=

Pune-based NGO wants limited role for Merc in setting MSEB tariff, Sanjay J=
og=20

The Pune-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Prayas alongwith Mumbai =
Grahak Panchayat, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and Akhil Bharatiya Grahak P=
anchayat have jointly appealed to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Co=
mmission (Merc) that the Maharashtra government should not be accorded spec=
ial privileges and its role in the determination of tariff of Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) should be limited. These organisations have p=
ointed out that unless the state government was prepared to compensate MSEB=
 in the manner determined by Merc, it has no authority to interfere in the =
tariff determination process. "Though under section 39 of the Electricity R=
egulatory Commission Act (ERCA), the state government has the authority to =
issue policy directives to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Ser=
c), section 29 clearly specifies that the Serc has to determine the tariff =
and also specifies certain guidelines for the same," organisation said. The=
se organisations have observed that guidelines for determining tariff do no=
t include any "policy directive" from the state government. Commenting on t=
he state government's affidavit suggesting reduction in the 19 per cent tar=
iff hike proposed by MSEB for 2001-02, they have called upon Merc not to ac=
cept any variation in tariff proposed by the state government as "policy di=
rective."=20

These organisations have expressed surprise over the state government's sub=
mission that there was a difference between the government and MSEB. They h=
ave also questioned the state government's request that the Merc should tak=
e an appropriate steps in order to ensure agreement between state governmen=
t and MSEB. These organisations, also, have made it clear that the tariff d=
etermination was under the exclusive domain of Merc and it has to give an o=
rder based only on the evidence that comes before it through various affida=
vits and submissions. "The ERCA does not allow any other role or mechanism =
for Merc or any other party in the context of tariff revision. As such, we =
request Merc from taking any steps to help MSEB and the state government re=
ach an agreement. This aspect be left to the state government and MSEB," th=
ey added. Sources said that the state government is likely to make a fresh =
affidavit on giving policy directives to the Merc as well as providing comp=
ensation to the MSEB by November 28.=20

Maharashtra may have to pay Rs 60000 crore to MSEB: Godbole=20

Maharashtra may have to pay a whopping Rs 60,000 crore to the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) if it fails to resolve the Enron imbroglio am=
icably, Madhav Godbole, chairman of the energy review committee, has said. =
Godbole blamed the inefficiencies of state-run undertakings for the Enron c=
risis and said the only way to avoid a recurrence was to privatise MSEB. Po=
liticians and the employees' union would oppose privatisation of MSEB, but =
its dismal performance and growing transmission and distribution losses hav=
e left little option but to go for privatisation in a phased manner, Godbol=
e said. He urged the people to mount pressure on the state government on th=
e issue and stressed it was necessary to avoid such disasters.=20

Delivering the second E F Schumacher memorial lecture here, instituted by N=
agpur University in association with Dr Padmakar Sapre, Godbole painted a v=
ery gloomy picture of Maharashtra's economy, noting that the state was on t=
he verge of bankruptcy owing to "suicidal policies followed by successive g=
overnments." Speaking on 'financial management of Maharashtra: problems and=
 perspectives,' Godbole stressed the need to introduce stringent policies t=
o get over the messy financial situation. He advocated re-introduction of z=
ero-based budgeting and fixing priority, so as to curb unnecessary expendit=
ure. Godbole said, despite ten years of economic liberalisation, very littl=
e has changed. Fiscal deficit in 1990-91 was 9.49 per cent, and it remains =
where it was. Revenue deficit had gone up from 4.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent=
 in 2000-2001.=20

The public sector savings have touched an all-time low of 1.2 per cent and =
consumption expenditure was on the rise. Godbole pointed out that 58 per ce=
nt of the state budget was spent on wages and 23 per cent on payment of int=
erest leaving very little for capital investment. He claimed that Maharasht=
ra was doling out Rs 18,000 crore as subsidies under various heads and has =
become the highest subsidy-providing state in the country. When Central ass=
istance was dwindling due to the new formula of allocation from a Central p=
ool, states such as Maharashtra would receive a lesser share in coming year=
s, he said.=20

He came down heavily on the misuse of state funds by co-operative societies=
 and charged that a promoter had to invest only 2 per cent amount while the=
 rest was made good by the state government. Heavy spending on higher educa=
tion must be stopped forthwith, he said, adding that the society must learn=
 to take care of such sectors by itself without burdening the state. The mo=
ney thus saved should instead be diverted towards primary education, he sai=
d. Godbole pointed out that the annual budget was irrelevant because of inc=
reasing off-budget transactions, which were out of public scrutiny. He said=
, due to overall mismanagement, the state government was forced to resort t=
o go for overdrafts for a period of 37 days in 2000-2001.=20

Godbole said populist schemes such as the monopoly cotton procurement schem=
e (MCPS) had no place in a globalised economy and its rising losses were a =
matter of great worry. He criticised the state government for delinking cot=
ton price from the prevailing market price and stated that the basic purpos=
e behind MCPS had been lost in the race for reaping electoral gains. Godbol=
e strongly advocate enactment of a 'Budgetary and Financial State Managemen=
t Act' to check unnecessary expenditure and fiscal discipline. He criticise=
d the state government for extending loan counter-guarantees to various und=
ertakings under its control.=20

Till date, the state government had extended counter-guarantees for loans w=
orth Rs 2.34 lakh crore, he said. "This was done when the total annual rece=
ipts of the state were merely Rs 35,000 crore," he said. Godbole advocated =
downsizing of the government and a ban on fresh recruitment. An attractive =
voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) should be offered to employees and contra=
ct-system be introduced, he said. He also supported the concept of contribu=
tory pension for employees and pointed out that under the present scheme, t=
he state government was burdened with paying a sum of Rs. 2600 crore to fiv=
e lakh pensioners. A state expenditure commission must be set up immediatel=
y for reviewing of expenses incurred by the state on permanent basis, Godbo=
le suggested. Nagpur University vice-chancellor Arun Satputaley presided ov=
er the function.=20

THE ASIAN AGE, Saturday, November 24, 2001
BJP loan costs state Rs 6,000 cr, Olga Tellis=20
Maharashtra is still reeling financially from the three major actions of it=
s predecessor government. One, it ran up debts of Rs 40,000 crores in five =
years; two, it formally permitted the second phase of the Dabhol power proj=
ect after declaring that it would throw Dabhol Phase 1 into the Arabian Sea=
; and three, it hurriedly announced the implementation of the Fifth Pay Com=
mission award. Maharashtra is paying Rs 6,000 crores in annual interest on =
bonds and loans that the predecessor Sena-BJP government accumulated during=
 its five-year rule. Senior Congressman and Cabinet minister for labour Sat=
ish Chaturvedi said the Congress ruled the state for 35 of the 41 years tha=
t the state has been in existence. During these 35 years, the total debt bu=
ilt up by Congress governments was about Rs 15,000 crores. As against this,=
 the Sena-BJP in five years borrowed merrily and issued bonds for approxima=
tely Rs 45,000 crores. So its successor Democratic Front government, led by=
 the Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar Congress respectively, is paying a cripp=
ling Rs 6,000 crores interest annually within specified time limits. Speaki=
ng to The Asian Age, Mr Chaturvedi said that at stake is more than Maharash=
tra's prestige as the favoured industrial destination of the country for th=
e rest of the world because, if the state falls back on its interest paymen=
ts, it will also restrict its capacity to borrow.=20

Maharashtra's annual budget is Rs 16,000 crores. Out of this, Rs 6,000 cror=
es goes straight away as interest payment. The second burden left behind by=
 the Sena-BJP is the permission given to Enron to go ahead with phase two o=
f the Dabhol power project, besides increasing the total capacity of the pl=
ant. This phase two will impose an annual encumbrance of Rs 6,000 crores, w=
hether or not the state uses the power. The state, as the senior minister s=
ays, "absolutely cannot survive this financial burden that will be imposed =
when phase two of Dabhol comes on stream." The state does not want the proj=
ect but the financial institutions led by IDBI, who are caught in a trap, w=
ould want the project to be completed so they don't have any liabilities th=
at will arise with the lenders if the project is scrapped. IDBI has stood g=
uarantee for Rs 5,500 crores. Additionally, if the state loses the arbitrat=
ion proceedings currently on in London, the claims on it will be around Rs =
500 crores.=20

The third and equally devastating financial burden is the acceptance of the=
 Fifth Pay Commission award which the Sena-BJP government announced shortly=
 before its term ended. Paying just 50 per cent of the DA has cost the gove=
rnment around Rs 250 crores to Rs 300 crores. The government has not paid t=
he workers' bonus as it would have cost Rs 750 crores and this does not inc=
lude the pensions, which would run into several hundred crores. Maharashtra=
 is among the three states that have accepted the Fifth Pay Commission, the=
 others being Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The state also has a problem meeting =
commitments given to cotton growers who dominate the Vidarbha region. The l=
oss to the government in the monopoly purchase of cotton is said to be arou=
nd Rs 800 crores.=20

The Centre has announced a support price of Rs 1,800 per quintal while the =
state is committed to purchase cotton at Rs 2,300 per quintal. The price of=
 cotton in the market is Rs 1,400 for imported cotton. There are about 22-l=
akh to 23-lakh bales of cotton lying in the market yard. If the government =
disposes of this cotton at the market price, it will lose Rs 350 crores. So=
 the government has to arrange for Rs 3,500 crores for the cotton monopoly =
scheme. The state is also in a Catch-22 situation as far as the state-run t=
extile mills are concerned. The government is currently spending Rs 20 lakh=
s per day running nine textile mills. Two mills out of these have now been =
shut and the workers given VRS, which cost the government around Rs 20 cror=
es to Rs 30 crores. If they are to close down the seven others, they will h=
ave to arrange finance of Rs 250 crores. So their dilemma is whether to con=
tinue to pay Rs 20 lakhs a day or get this lumpsum of Rs 250 crores and clo=
se the mills at one go.
