Former SC judge Kurdukar to investigate Dabhol deal, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra government on Monday has finally appointed the retired Supreme Court judge Sadashiv Kurdukar to head the judicial commission to probe into the multi-crore Dabhol Power Company (DPC) deal. Mr Kurdukar's name has been finalised at a meeting between the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and state energy minister Padmasinh Patil. The commission is expected to complete its inquiry within six months since its appointment.. The formal announcement in this regard is expected after the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday. State government sources told The Financial Express that Mr Kurdukar's name has been shortlisted from the list of 15 judges by the law and judiciary department. Though former Supreme Court chief justice YV Chandrachud, former SC justices Sujata Manohar and PB Sawant were on forefront, they have believed to have expressed their inability to take on the job in view of their preoccupations.
