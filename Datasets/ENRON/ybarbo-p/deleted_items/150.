A.V. Birla 'not keen' on Dabhol=20

THE A.V. Birla group today said it is not interested in buying a stake in t=
he Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Co (DPC), although it appears to have studie=
d the power project. In a statement, the group said it has ``looked'' at th=
e Dabhol project but is ``not interested in pursuing an equity investment i=
n DPC.'' Currently, financial institutions are considering proposals put fo=
rth by Tata Power Co and BSES Ltd to pick up Enron's 65 per cent stake in D=
PC. However, Ms Jayawantiben Mehta, Union Minister of State for Power, has =
said that any third party stepping in to bid for Enron would be welcomed by=
 the Government as that would increase competition, thereby reducing price.=
 Ms Mehta was responding to queries by mediapersons on the reported entry o=
f a third bidder for DPC on the sidelines of a banking and finance seminar =
here. ``Our only mission is to increase generation of power and make it ava=
ilable at cheaper prices. Buying power from Enron is an option only if the =
power tariff is reasonable,'' Ms Mehta said.=20

Regarding the sale of Enron's stake in DPC, she said there was a specific t=
ime-frame assigned for completing the due diligence process. ``Once the pro=
cess is complete it will not take time to finalise a deal,'' she said. Talk=
ing about the disbursements for the Accelerated Power Development Project (=
APDP), Ms Mehta admitted to delays in disbursements earlier but the Governm=
ent has learnt from these mistakes and will try to make the process quicker=
, she said. She added, ``The Government has decided to allocate Rs 113.95 c=
rore to Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport Company (BEST) for the year=
 2001-2002 for transmission, distribution and convergence purposes. The dis=
bursements will be made shortly. A special account will be opened for these=
 funds with the State Government. This money is to be used within a period =
of one year but BEST will be given additional funds as and when they need i=
t.'' The total allocation for Maharashtra under APDP is more than Rs 300 cr=
ore.=20

DPC board meet on course despite MSEB dissent note, Sanjay Jog

Dabhol Power Company (DPC), notwithstanding the dissent note filed by the M=
aharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), is firm on holding its board mee=
ting on November 30 in London to authorise Enron India managing director K =
Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB. MSEB chairman V=
inay Bansal and state principal secretary VM Lal, who are directors on the =
DPC board, have decided not to attend the meeting. DPC spokesperson Jimmy M=
ogal confirmed that the DPC board meeting would take place as per schedule.=
 "The November 30 meeting will take place as it is a statutory company law =
requirement," he told The Financial Express. Mr Mogal, however, declined to=
 comment on the receipt of a dissent note from the MSEB blaming DPC for its=
 mismanagement which led to a situation for the issuance of a final termina=
tion notice. According to MSEB sources, it has questioned the holding of No=
vember 30 meeting especially when it had cancelled the previous board meeti=
ng scheduled for November 19 in London at the last minute. MSEB has also de=
manded a change in the venue of the meeting from London to Mumbai. The stat=
e electricity board has also taken an objection for the ensuing meeting esp=
ecially when the Bombay high court has already restrained DPC from issuing =
a final termination notice to it in its November 9 ad interim order granted=
 on a civil suit filed by financial institutions.

MSEB has reiterated its claim that it was DPC's successive material misrepr=
esentation and default on the availability of power which led to the presen=
t situation. Had DPC corrected its capacity availability after the MSEB imp=
osed rebate for the first time in February, the situation would not have re=
ached this stage, sources added. MSEB also blamed DPC for non-payment of re=
bate of Rs 401 crore imposed by it for the default on the availability of p=
ower on January 28. Furthermore, it also defaulted on February 13 and March=
 29 and failed to pay successive rebates revised thereafter. The November 3=
0 meeting would also take up issues related to asset preservation, financia=
l position of phase-I, debt servicing of phase-II and opening of letter of =
credit for the charter. Meanwhile, MSEB technical director (corporate plann=
ing) Prem Paunikar, who is also on the DPC board, has resigned for personal=
 reasons. He will be relieved on November 29. Mr Paunikar will be replaced =
by Mr Gurcharan Singh, who is currently in charge of hydrogrid.

November 30: The countdown begins for Dabhol, S Ravindran Mumbai=20

Global lenders to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are meeting=
 in London on November 30 to consider authorising the firm to serve a final=
 termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). On t=
he same day, the DPC board will meet in London to consider authorising mana=

ven if Cline gets the nod from the board, he will not be in a position to s=
erve the notice unless the lenders give the go-ahead. "We have decided to m=
eet on November 30 as it is convenient for us. The DPC board meeting is a p=
ure coincidence," sources in the lenders' consortium said. The meeting assu=
mes significance as it is being held in the backdrop of a Mumbai High Court=
 injunction restraining DPC from serving the final termination notice. The =
lenders are planning to consult their lawyers, White Case, on the feasibili=

MSEB denies sops to DPC buyer=20

THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board has turned down IDBI-led FIs' plea =
to slice out one of its distribution circles to gift to the buyer of Enron'=
s Dabhol Power Company as part of a payment security mechanism. This has th=
e potential to derail the ongoing discussions with the two prospective bidd=
ers as Tata Power and BSES are unlikely to proceed with the deal without su=
ch a viable model in place. "So far, all the discussions between the FIs an=
d the utilities were based on the assumption that MSEB and the state govern=
ment would agree to this lollipop," said a senior FI official. MSEB chairma=
n Vinay Bansal confirmed he had received a proposal from FIs. "The model is=
 not agreeable to us. We simply can't afford to part ways with any of our d=
istribution circles. That will jeopardise MSEB's cashflows."

Life after Enron

OBITUARIES for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) were premature. With every pa=
ssing week, it appears that the 2,100 MW power project in Maharashtra is li=
kely to be reincarnated in a new, improved avatar. The domestic troubles of=
 Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that owns 65 per cent of DPC equity,=
 have actually made DPC more attractive to local buyers. The Aditya Vikram =
Birla group now joins BSES and Tata Power as suitors for the stake of Enron=
, and maybe the additional 20 per cent equally owned by GE and Bechtel, whi=
ch are also keen to exit. Enron initially valued DPC equity at $1.1 billion=
. However, it has become clear that it will have to take a discount on this=
: the final figure could come down to $700 million or even less. The prospe=
ct of buying out a state-of-the-art power plant at a very attractive price =
has attracted companies like BSES, Tata Power and now, the AV Birla group.=
=20

What Enron needs now is cash: finances of the Houston giant are shaky and i=
t has to arrange credit for nearly $700 million debt quickly. Given that, I=
ndian buyers can winkle out an even bigger discount by agreeing to pay the =
money up front, instead of in instalments. Inevitably, lenders will also ha=
ve to write down interest on debt, or even take some writeoffs to bring deb=
t in line with lower equity valuation. Once the financial restructuring is =
complete, DPC power will become affordable. Or will it? Arguably, electrici=
ty has been India's most reform-proof sector. This resistance to change has=
 deep roots: in administrative collapse, populist politics, the dominance o=
f the public sector at the Centre and states; in corruption, regulatory fai=
lure or apathy and with consumers who are used to getting power free. To ma=
ke DPC - or any power project - viable in the long run, consumers have to s=
tart paying for electricity. Failing that, utilities should cut them off. T=
his will need a great deal of support from state administrations. SEBs have=
 to be privatised. If the new Electricity Bill is made into law, states wil=
l have the freedom to privatise distribution without amending local laws, I=
PPs will be able to sell power to consumers. This is a large reform program=
me which will need serious political will at all levels of government to im=
plement. Yet, experience has shown that nothing less will work.=20

ONGC board meet holds key to Panna Mukta operatorship, Prasanna Upadhyay

The thorny issue of the operatorship rights for the Panna Mukta Tapti oil a=
nd gas fields is coming to a head as the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (O=
NGC) board is slated to meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue threadbare. Th=
e hopes of British Gas (BG), which has decided to buy out the 30 per cent E=
nron stake in the oil fields, rests largely on the board meeting, as BG has=
 made it clear that it will go through the deal only if it gets sole operat=
orship. However, ONGC, which holds 40 per cent in the fields, and Reliance,=
 the other 30 per cent stakeholder, have both pitched for operatorship righ=
ts. Only if the ONGC board agrees to allow BG to take the rights can the de=
al be carried forward from BG's end. ONGC chairman Subir Raha could not be =
reached for comments by The Financial Express despite several attempts.

According to sources close to BG, the company is confident that ONGC would =
agree to transfer of operatorship from Enron to BG. These sources said that=
 BG would pick up Enron's stake in the oil fields, subject to transfer of o=
peratorship and till the issue was resolved the question of paying up the $=
388 million for the deal did not arise. While there is talk that Enron may =
be wanting BG to hurry up with the payment for the deal in view of Enron's =
global problems, there was no independent confirmation of this from either =
BG or from Enron. An official spokesperson of Enron in India declined to co=
mment on the issue. "The company has clarified that the deal is subject to =
operatorship otherwise it is off from our side," the sources close to BG sa=
id. While sources close to BG added that Reliance has agreed for transfer o=
f operatorship from Enron to BG, a Reliance spokesperson, when contacted, c=
ategorically denied that Reliance had given a green signal for transfer of =
the operatorship to BG.=20

While BG is confident that ONGC would agree for transfer of operatorship to=
 it, ONGC's unions have said that the oil major has enormous experience in =
the field and had also discovered the fields. According to sources, to reso=
lve the issue, the suggestion of joint venture operatorship was raised from=
 some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners could be inclu=
ded in the operatorship. Another suggestion was that the three fields shoul=
d be distributed to the three partners. However, BG is sticking to its dema=
nd for sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas=
 and 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has been taken over by Dyn=
egy Inc has decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as part of its gl=
obal strategy.=20

Man arrested for issuing e-mail threat to Enron ( carried only by the onlin=

PUNE- If you're thinking of sending scary, anonymous emails, think again.Th=
e police are fast catching up on the technology to trace such mails. On Fri=
day, the Ratnagiri police arrested Pune-based computer professional Habibud=
din Sheikh 20). A former employee of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC) Shei=
kh had sent an email threatening to blow up DPC's Guhagar plant. According =
to the Ratnagiri police, DPC received the threatening mail last month.The c=
ompany was being targeted because it was a venture of the American giant En=
ron, the mail said. Superintendent of police Vinaykumar Chaube immediately =
formed a special team and tracked the mail down to a cybercafe in Wanowrie =
in Pune. The cybercafe records revealed that Sheikh had used the cyber cafe=
 at the time and day on which the mail was received by DPC.The investigator=
s were already working on the hunch that the mail must have been the handiw=
ork of one of the 1,000 workers retrenched by the company. Sheikh's handwri=
ting in the company's records too matched.
