BSES to complete DPC due diligence by January

BSES Ltd will begin due diligence of the 2,184 mw Dabhol power project in a=
 fortnight. The process, aimed at assessing the right price for buying 85 p=
er cent stake in the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's (DPC), will be c=
ompleted by January. Speaking to reporters on Monday, BSES chairman and man=
aging director RV Shahi said, "The due diligence process will take six to e=
ight weeks after signing of the confidentiality agreement." According to Mr=
 Shahi, his company would be signing the confidentiality agreement, a pre-r=
equisite for beginning due diligence, in another ten days. BSES has sent it=
s comments on various clauses of the agreement to DPC. The company would ap=
point three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal d=
ue diligence of the $2.9-billion project, he said on the sidelines of a sem=
inar on natural gas.=20

It would also be constituting an internal task force for doing parallel gro=
und work. The whole exercise would involve assessing the value of DPC's ass=
ets and liabilities besides finding out further investment needed to comple=
te the 1,444 mw Phase-II. Stating that the Dabhol power project as its stan=
ds was not viable, Mr Shahi said that BSES will be going in for financial r=
e-engineering and renegotiation of the gas supply agreement for Phase-II be=
fore taking over the project. DPC had signed a 20 year contract with Oman L=
NG for 1.6 million tonnes per year and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquification Company =
for 480,000 tonnes. He said the total cost of power generation has to be br=
ought down to Rs 2.60-2.70 per unit for making it viable. For this fuel cos=
t and capital cost has to be brought down, he added. BSES has shown interes=
t in acquiring 85 per cent stake of Enron, Bechtel and GE in the Dabhol pro=
ject at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by the Indian fin=
ancial institutions. It will fix a price for taking over the stake once due=
 dilligence is completed. After signing the confidentiality agreement BSES =
will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and=
 other assets and legal wrangles. Before taking any decision on the acquisi=
tion price of the distressed company.=20

Maharshtra stand on Enron is vindicated, Seema Mustafa=20

The Maharashtra government's refusal to accept Enron's claim of bringing in=
 capital cost of $2.8 billion into the controversial Dabhol Power Corporati=
on has been vindicated by reports of large-scale fraudulent practices by th=
e company in the United States. At present under inquiry by the US Stock Ex=
change Commission, Enron has been virtually wiped out with Dynegy, a Chevro=
n and Texaco company, having reportedly bought Enron for a paltry $9.12 bil=
lion stock swap. Enron's share value plummeted from $90 last year to $7 thi=
s month following disclosures that its senior officials had been transferri=
ng funds to their own pri vate companies without reflecting this in the bal=
ance sheets for the last five years. Enron's chief financial officer was fo=
und involved in the scam and was sacked, although this move could not save =
the company, which has been unable to explain the big gap in its balance sh=
eets. It is reported to have gone down taking $72 billion in shareholders' =
wealth with it. In fact, the President and CEO of Halliburton, Mr Dave Lesa=
r, is on record as saying that Enron's "credibility is finished because the=
y did not provide financial information and, therefore, investor confidence=
 declined." Halliburton claims to be the world's largest provider of produc=
ts and services to petrol and energy industries, functioning in 120 countri=
es with US vice-president Dick Cheney being the earlier CEO of the company.=
=20

The UK, following the expose, has brought Enron's Wessex Water operations i=
n the country under scrutiny with the entire range of utility and energy as=
sets being given a close look. Pressure is being exerted on the Maharashtra=
 government now to ensure that the records are opened and the entire deal i=
nvestigated. Mr Probir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum, which had le=
d a major campaign against the Enron power project here, said the US compan=
y has survived entirely "on energy trading and influence brokering." It had=
 extremely close contacts with the Republican party, including former Presi=
dent George Bush.=20

There was tremendous pressure on India to withdraw its objections and clear=
 the project, particularly after the Bush administration assumed power. The=
 new US ambassador to India, Mr Robert Blackwill, is on record saying that =
India-US relations could be summed up in just five alphabets: "Enron." In f=
act, shortly after assuming office in New Delhi, the ambassador addressed s=
everal business and corporate meetings and pushed for the quick clearance o=
f the stalled Enron project. The Maharashtra government, which had cancelle=
d the seven-year-old power purchase agreement with Enron, was in the middle=
 of court proceedings with the company. It is now expected to resume discus=
sions with Dynegy, although it is in a position to ensure that all records =
are made available and the project thoroughly investigated. Enron's capital=
 cost claim, despite the fact that it was not supported by statistics, was =
accepted by the state government under the then chief minister, Mr Sharad P=
awar.=20

Enron went ahead with the construction of Phase I. In 1995, the Shiv Sena-B=
JP government cancelled the project. Within six months the same government =
revived it. The government claimed that this was because Enron had agreed t=
o reduce the capital cost to $2.5 billion. But, as was pointed out by the O=
pposition parties here and has been accepted by the state government now, t=
he Dabhol Power Corporation had borrowed at least $2.05 billion from Indian=
 and foreign institutions, with the result that the total equity component =
was actually only $450 million. Of this the Maharashtra State Electricity B=
oard had put in $130 million as its own equity, thus, leaving only $320 mil=
lion equity put in by Enron.=20

MSEB seeks refund of Rs 1,200 cr from DPC, Sanjay Jog=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) on Monday appealed to the Bo=
mbay High Court that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) be ordered to pay it an amo=
unt of Rs 1,200 crore towards the excess payment of capacity charges during=
 May 1999 and April 2001. According to MSEB, of the total payment of Rs 3,4=
99 crore towards the power purchases, the capacity charge amounted to Rs 2,=
087 crore. The average purchasing rate per unit of Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw) =
power in 2000-01 has been about Rs 7.30 while its payment for the Phase-II =
(if and when commissioned) would have been in the range of Rs 500 crore per=
 month.=20

MSEB has denied that it has failed or neglected to make payments to DPC und=
er the power purchase agreement (PPA) from time to time and whenever the pa=
yments were made after the due dates, interest was paid to DPC. "It is DPC =
that has defaulted in paying the rebate due to MSEB for the default and mat=
erial misrepresentation on the availability of power without any basis what=
soever. The DPC's refusal to pay/adjust the rebate in terms of the express =
provision of the PPA of undisputed facts is obdurate and wrongful," it said=
.=20

MSEB in its counter affidavit has prayed that DPC's writ petition challengi=
ng the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC)=
 to adjudicate upon dispute and difference between MSEB and DPC be dismisse=
d at cost. The Bombay High Court division bench comprising justices Ajit Sh=
ah and Sharad Bobde would begin hearing on the DPC's writ petition from Dec=
ember 11 following the Supreme Court's order of August 6 to settle the MERC=
 jurisdiction issue. The filing of counter affidavit by MSEB today coincide=
s with the completion of six months period after the issuance of two prelim=
inary termination notices by DPC on May 19. DPC, which has already issued a=
nother two preliminary termination notices to MSEB on September 10 however,=
 has been restrained from serving a final termination notice to MSEB by the=
 Bombay High Court on November 9 over a civil suit filed by Indian financia=
l institutions.=20

MSEB further said that the DPC cannot be permitted to go ahead with the arb=
itration when the statute requires that its dispute with DPC be adjudicated=
 upon only by the Merc. "DPC is an Indian company doing business in India a=
nd subject to Indian laws and an utility within the meaning of the Electric=
ity Regulatory Commission Act (ERCA)," MSEB added. MSEB has strongly denied=
 DPC's apprehension that it would not get a proper or fair hearing before t=
he MERC. It further said that "MERC has both the competence3, expertise and=
 regulatory responsibility to adjudicate upon the disputes raised in the MS=
EB's petition filed on May 25 before the MERC," it said.=20

According to MSEB, the disputes it has raised before the MERC involve techn=
ical, commercial and legal issues and it would clearly have consequences/ra=
mifications, which directly bear on matters which have exclusively been ent=
rusted to the MERC under section 22 (1) and 29 of The ERCA. "The MERC, whic=
h is fully competent in every respect to adjudicate upon, is an expert body=
 with special knowledge and experience in matters relating to electricity i=
n Maharashtra state," MSEB said. MSEB said that adjudicating functions/powe=
rs/jurisdiction have been conferred on the MERC in respect of disputes and =
differences between utilities.=20

THE DECCAN HERALD, Tuesday, November 20, 2001
DPC deadline expires for issuing final termination notice
The six-month deadline set by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to issue the final termination =
notice (FTN) expired today. The power major, however, has been restrained b=
y the Bombay High Court from initiating the process till December 3. Had th=
e DPC issued FTN today, it would have irrevocably bound all parties to endi=
ng the contract without going in for any alternative, an option which is st=
ill open. DPC, on April 19, slapped a preliminary termination notice (PTN) =
on MSEB, due to what it called continuing default in payment of dues by the=
 board on several occasions and political interference to the detriment of =
its business operations. As per the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed b=
etween DPC and MSEB, the PTN gave six months to both parties to resolve the=
 dispute, or else, allows the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and=
 claim damages.While the possibility of DPC issuing the final termination n=
otice was real, a dramatic intervention by the Indian financial institution=
s (FIs) led by IDBI, which moved the high court on November 5, have given a=
 temporary reprieve to the MSEB. The FIs and banks pleaded for an injunctio=
n against DPC and sought reopening of the Dabhol plant The intervention by =
FIs so incensed DPC that it called off the two-day meeting with the represe=
ntatives of the FIs in Singapore in protest .

However, it was persuaded to participate in the meeting, which was aimed at=
 finding a buyer of Enron's stake in the company. Two private power majors,=
 Tata Power and BSES, have shown interest in picking up Enron's stake, but =
at a discounted price The high court, which heard the preliminary arguments=
 of the FIs and DPC on November 9, restrained DPC from issuing the FTN anda=
djourned the hearing till December 3. DPC sources told Deccan Herald the hi=
gh court order means the PTN notice period will continue till December 3 an=
d the company would initiate termination process on that day, if the high c=
ourt allowed it to do so. DPC has claimed that the damages it would claim o=
n final termination of the contract would run around Rs 24,000 crore. This =
figure too has been disputed by the MSEB and the state government. MSEB, on=
 its part, stopped drawing power from Dabhol plant from May 29 onwards, whi=

Greenfield-DPC time-charter pact set to be scrapped, P. Manoj=20

THE time-charter party agreement signed between Greenfield Shipping Company=
 and Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is set to be scrapped as an outcome of the =
controversy surrounding the Enron-promoted troubled power plant in Maharash=
tra. With Dabhol's LNG facility yet to go on stream, DPC will not be able t=
o deploy the 1,37,000 cubic metre capacity tanker `LNG Laxmi' once the prom=
oters of Greenfield deliver it to the charterer as per the charter party ag=
reement signed between the two. The charter party agreement states that the=
 charterer will have to take delivery of the tanker within 45 days of being=
 delivered by the shipowners and operators. ``A failure by the charterer to=
 take delivery of the tanker within the stipulated 45 days would automatica=
lly rescind the charter party agreement", sources familiar with the develop=
ments told Business Line.=20

Greenfield and DPC had entered into a time-charter agreement wherein DPC wi=
ll time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for a period of 20 years at a charter hire rate=
 of $ 98,600 per day for transporting gas from Oman to its LNG facility in =
Dabhol, Maharashtra. Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent s=
takeholder in Greenfield. The promoters of Greenfield took possession of th=
e LNG carrier on November 15 after paying the last instalment of $ 55 milli=
on from Mitsubishi shipyard at Nagasaki in Japan, overcoming certain last-m=
inute hiccups. Since DPC is not in a position to take physical delivery of =
the tanker, the promoters of Greenfield are going through the formalities t=
o full-fill contractual obligations. After the 45 days time limit is exhaus=
ted and the time charter contract between Greenfield and DPC automatically =
annulled, the promoters of Greenfield will be able to time-charter `LNG Lax=
mi' to a new charterer.=20

In the meanwhile, Greenfield was able to locate a new charterer in the form=
 of Oman Government, which will time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for 20 years at a =
charter hire rate of a little over $ 70,000 per day as well as pick-up a 50=
 per cent stake in Greenfield. Enron-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc., on=
e of the original promoters of Greenfield with a 20 per cent stake worth $ =
11 million, has sold its entire stake to Oman Government. Besides, the lead=
-partner in the consortium, Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines have parted with ha=
lf of its 60 per cent holding in Greenfield amounting to 30 per cent in fav=
our of Oman Government. Oman Government will contribute $ 27.5 million for =
acquiring 50 per cent stake in Greenfield. It will sub-charter `LNG Laxmi' =
to Oman LNG in which it holds a 51 per cent stake. Oman LNG is expected to =
deploy `LNG Laxmi' to transport some of its LNG cargo sold on c.i.f basis t=
o destinations including Britain and Korea, the sources said. A new time-ch=
arter party agreement between Greenfield and Oman Government will be inked =
after the DPC contract is revoked. Oman Government is currently thrashing o=
ut the finer details of the charter agreement with Oman LNG in which Shell,=
Total and Mitsubishi has equity stakes. `` This will ensure that LNG Laxmi =
is gainfully employed without being allowed to remain idle``, the sources s=
aid.

Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage

Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage with a=
 rival, Dynegy, a fourth its size Lay: time to play dead? Enron, the most a=
dmired company in the US six years in a row, has been consigned to the dust=
bin of history and business school case studies. Once the darling of Wall S=
treet for its aggressive no-holds-barred growth, its stock was languishing =
at historical lows of $7.21 last week, a steep fall of 90 per cent from its=
 peak last October, representing a notional loss of $80 billion. In the las=
t six weeks alone, its stock plunged by over 400 per cent.Kenneth Lay, the =
politically-connected chairman who counts on the United States' First as we=
ll as Second Families (Vice-President Dick Cheney) as close friends, and th=
e acknowledged power behind 'deregulation', has faced a nightmare over the =
last three weeks.

Following a series of stories first published in The Wall Street Journal an=
d The New York Times, Enron's stock went into a tailspin and it never recov=
ered. The strawalbeit a heavy onethat broke the camel's back was a $1.01 bi=
llion charge on its pro-forma statement of earnings. Subsequently, it has e=
merged that most of Enron's purported earnings were bogus and accounting ju=
gglery is the most charitable explanation. The company has formally acknowl=
edged that its audited statements of earnings for the last three years were=
 of no consequence! It appears that several limited partnerships (LJM and L=
JM2 in particular, apparently named after Star Wars film characters), in wh=
ich officers of Enron had substantive financial interests, were key element=
s in its concocted business numbers. Enron had till now gotten way with the=
 business equivalent of murder. To illustrate, in the matter of appointment=
 of key regulatory figures in the US, the California power debacle in which=
 the conservative California governor went as far as saying that nothing wo=
uld please him more to see Kenneth Lay in a prison cell with a fellow cellm=
ate greeting him with "Hi Honey, my name is Spike," and its international o=
perationsthe debacles in India, Indonesia, Nigeria etc, etc, the failures o=
f its very expensive forays into the broadband and water businesseswere in =
a sense forgivable. What was unforgivable was the ultimate crime of siphoni=
ng off shareholders' money through these limited partnerships and brazenly =
lying to Wall Street.

With a daily decline in its share prices ($37 to $7 in two weeks), the fail=
ure of white knights to emerge (such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Holdings=
, on which Enron had pinned some hope), its bonds being only notionally abo=
ve junk status (trading in two weeks from 101 to 65 cents on the dollar) an=
d, consequently, the potential collapse of its trading business where it ac=
ts as a trusted counter party, Enron had no choice but to agree to what app=
ears to be a shotgun marriage with a rival, Dynegy, a fourth of its size. T=
he almost overnight surrender and the fact that the final price for Enron w=
as as low as $8 billion represents a collapse unparalleled in recent busine=
ss history.
=20
This merger, slated to occur over the next six to nine months, subject to a=
 series of caveats, may or may not take place as there could very well be s=
everal unpleasant surprises in store. Among these are the pending Securitie=
s and Exchange (SEC) investigation (in which the Enron counsel is a former =
colleague of the investigating officer!), the several dozen class-action su=
its filed over the last three weeks against Enron, its directors, Lay and s=
everal officers as well as its auditors Arthur Andersen, and, of course, ap=
propriate regulatory approval.

In my opinion, the key surprise may very well be the several as-yet secret =
limited partnerships. If these are ever made public, the reverberations thr=
oughout the US business spectrum may be too unpleasant. In any event, the c=
onsequences of these events do not appear to have sunk in in India. Given t=
he huge, and what appears to be a very difficult-to-service debt, of $22 bi=
llion from various forays that Enron has engaged in in the last three years=
 (raised from $15 billion the week before), it is likely a solution crafted=
 to the needs and limitations of all parties may be feasible given appropri=
ate spine. Spine on India's part, that is.The terms that were proposed by E=
nron for a settlement of the Dabhol issuea payment of $1.2 billion, now bro=
ught down to $850 millionare clearly unacceptable. The missile that Enron h=
as now aimed at India has not been comprehended either by the state apparat=
us or the media.
=20
It rests in an order issued by the London High Court, which, inter alia, pr=
ohibits the government of Maharashtra from even opening its mouth about Enr=
on, even in an Indian court or tribunal. There are several, in my opinion, =
historically unprecedented consequences of this. This craven, abject surren=
der of sovereignty is a result of a consent agreement the erstwhile BJP-Shi=
v Sena government signed a year after the fraudulent 'renegotiations'. This=
 is a truly unpardonable crime and should be sufficient reason to send the =
'renegotiators' to jail.

In any event, given a series of interests, inter alia the interests of Shar=
ad Pawar (who negotiated the first Enron contract) and consequently the pre=
sent state government, the danger that Indian financial institutions, in pa=
rticular IDBI, may simply go under for lending without any due diligence to=
 this over-invoiced project, the Damocles sword hanging over Maharashtra in=
 the form of the London High Court order and so on, it may be in the best i=
nterests of all parties concerned to iron out an appropriate transparent ag=
reement that has India's and the public interest at its core, a comprehensi=
ve settlement, given the effective non-existence of Enron at this moment in=
 history
