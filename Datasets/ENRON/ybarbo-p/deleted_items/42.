Enron to pull out of LNG shipping venture for Laxmi=20

Before the final countdown begins for US energy major Enron's actual exit f=
rom Dabhol Power Company (DPC), it has decided to quit the greenfield shipp=
ing venture for Laxmi, the liquefied natural gas carrier expected to reach =
Indian shores on November 15. "Enron's affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc ha=
s expressed a desire to its partners to exit the special purpose vehicle fo=
r Laxmi in lieu of its decision to move out of the controversial DPC", ship=
ping industry sources said here today. =20

An Enron India spokesperson declined to comment over the development. The S=
hipping Corporation of India (SCI) has a 20 per cent stake in the $220 mill=
ion project while Mitsui OSK Lines holds 60 per cent and the balance rests =
with Atlantic. Earlier, SCI chairman P K Srivastava had said they were conf=
ident of taking delivery of the vessel on November 15, despite the ANZ Inve=
stment Bank-led consortium's decision not to disburse the last tranche of $=
55 million. "The 135,000 cubic metre capacity tanker, costing $189 million,=
 is ready for delivery and we are currently in talks with banks and parties=
 involved in this project", sources said. SCI and Mitsui OSK Lines have a t=
ime charter for 10 years with DPC to transport LNG from Oman to Dabhol. The=
 consortium of 14 banks has already disbursed $110 million, they added.=20

Sources said SCI and OSK Lines have not ruled out alternatives such as depl=
oying the vessel in the spot market due to the approaching winter demand fo=
r the liquid fuel and existing shortage of LNG vessels in the international=
 market. "LNG is an emerging fuel in international spot market and the cons=
ortium has already initiated exploratory steps. The reserves for winter sea=
son would be filled soon and there is lot of demand for such vessels", they=
 said. "The multinational has already diverted its focus more on the future=
s trading aspects of the fuel. Given the present uncertainties, there is an=
 unwarranted delay in the project, and so the carrier "Laxmi" would be used=
 for chartering the natural gas to other countries from the middle east", t=
hey explained. Registered in Malta, Laxmi was expected to carry two million=
 tonne of LNG per annum to Dabhol to fire the power plant. The $800 million=
 LNG terminal, which has a storage capacity of five million tonne of natura=
l gas per year, was equipped to re-gassify the fuel and supply it to DPC wh=
ile remaining to other bulk users. For LNG supply, DPC has signed a 20 year=
 contract for 2.1 million tonne per year of the fuel with Oman LNG (1.6 mil=
lion tonne per year) and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (480,000 tonne =
per year), the sources added.=20
