Indian lenders to take over IFCI's exposure in DPC
=20
IDBI-led consortium of Indian lenders to Enron's Dabhol Power Company, has =
agreed "in-principle" to take over IFCI's exposure in the troubled project =
following expiry of the deadline given by Japanese Export Credit Agency to =
encash the counter guarantees. "We have already in-principle agreed to prov=
ide a counter-guarantee for the loan given by any member of the consortium,=
 if its capital adequacy ratio dives below the prescribed Reserve Bank of I=
ndia's norm", senior IDBI official said. Last month, alarmed by DPC's defau=

warned its Indian counterparts that it would be compelled to encash their g=
uarantees after October 26, 2001, if IFCI's exposure of Rs 454 crore was no=
t covered by other FIs. "We will communicate to JBIC that after infusion of=
 Rs 1,000 crore by the Union government in IFCI, the FI's car will increase=
 to 9 per cent and trigger point has not yet arrived whereby the Japanese a=
gency could encash the guarantees," the official said. He said the issue wo=
uld be discussed at length at DPC's lenders meet to be held on November 2, =
2001, and three in London. "The Indian lenders will try and impress upon JB=
IC that IFCI is out of danger and there is no dire need for taking over its=
 exposure in the present circumstances," he added.

Enron fires finance director

US energy major Enron has ousted its finance director amid an investigation=
 by the American government into the company's business practices. Finance =
director Andrew Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jef=
frey McMahon, former treasurer, the company said. "In my continued discussi=
ons with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring inve=
stor confidence would require us to replace Andy," said Enron chairman Kenn=
eth Lay. Billions of dollars worth of transactions between Enron and "limit=
ed partnerships" controlled by Fastow were being examined by the Securities=
 & Exchange Commission, a report in the Times daily said on Friday. Enron, =
based in Houston, has annual revenues of more than $100 billion, and is inv=
olved in a quarter of US' electricity and natural gas trades. Fastow's depa=
rture follows the abrupt resignation of Jeff Skilling as chief executive in=
 August for "personal reasons".=20
Lay, who is thought to have played a role in US President George W Bush's d=
ecision to drop the Kyoto accord on global warming, was brought out of reti=
rement once again to lead Enron. Shares in Enron hit a six-year low on Wedn=
esday due to the SEC investigation coupled with a $618-million third-quarte=
r loss and $1-billion charge for failed investments.

Reliance shelves LNG project, Anto T Joseph=20

THE DABHOL imbroglio and the current uncertainty in the liquefied natural g=
as market has forced the Reliance Group to put its $5-billion LNG project o=
n the backburner.=20

The petroleum and petrochemicals major had signed an MoU in February 2001 w=
ith British Petroleum and National Iranian Oil Company, for an eight-millio=
n tonne per annum LNG project. The decision to slow down implementation of =
the LNG project is believed to have taken after the Reliance-BP-NIOC consor=
tium completed a feasibility study for the proposed project.=20

Reliance and BP would hold a 25 per cent stake each in the project, and the=
 remaining stake will be with NIOC if and when the project is implemented. =
A Reliance spokesperson, however, said the company was going ahead with the=
 project. The Reliance gameplan was to upgrade capacity at its Jamnagar ter=
minal. The Jamnagar port is ideally equipped to handle LNG as there is no n=
eed for building costly breakwater and dredging facilities, which makes LNG=
 handling much more economical and competitive.=20

The proposed project is the largest so far in India and a whole network con=
sisting of the liquefaction plant, regassification plant, LNG terminal and =
transportation facilities was supposed to come up.=20

Sources said Reliance was finding it difficult to put in place contracts an=
d agreements because of the lack of potential end users.=20

"After Enron's Dabhol Power Company ran into a severe payment crisis, in th=
e process exposing the unviability of LNG as an alternate fuel for base loa=
d plant, India is unlikely to see setting up of any LNG-based projects. Man=
y LNG players i who have already executing their projects, but have suddenl=
y found themselves saddled with many problems," said an industry source.=20

Trouble in Enron drives online energy trade to the edge, Gelu Sulugiuc=20

ENRON almost daily revelations of fresh troubles has prompted concerns its =
powerful position in online energy trading could prompt a credit crunch and=
 rock the fast-growing industry. Though experts said yesterday that EnronOn=
line, Enron's Web trading platform, should survive, investors are skittish =
about the No 1 US natural gas and electricity marketer.=20

Since last week Enron has shed more than $13 billion in market value as sha=
res plunged, forcing it on Wednesday to replace its chief financial officer=
, who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regu=
lators.=20

In the latest blow, credit rating agency Fitch yesterday placed Enron debt =
securities on negative credit watch, saying the erosion of investor confide=
nce, if unabated, would impair the company's access to capital markets.=20

"We put them on a list of concerns two months ago and made sure our books w=
ere balanced just as the first stage of precaution," said one energy trader=
 active on EnronOnline. About 60 per cent of all transactions by Enron are =
captured through EnronOnline, and so far traders have kept faith.=20

On Wednesday, EnronOnline - in which trades always involve Enron as either =
the buyer or seller - conducted 8,000 transactions through its site, with a=
 notional value of $4 billion, more than daily its average of $3.5 billion.=
=20

"People are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios f=
or the winter and to protect themselves from price volatility," said Vance =
Meyer, an Enron spokesman.=20

Not even Enron itself anticipated the success of EnronOnline, which enjoys =
the highest volume of any platform in the cut-throat field of Internet ener=
gy trade. Initially, the company set a yearly trading volume target of $30 =
billion to 40 billion - business it now does in 10 days alone.=20

Yet traders worry Enron's spectacular fall from grace could make it a less =
solid counterparty in certain eyes after transactions with two limited part=
erships run by Andrew Fastow sparked investigations by the US Securities an=
d Exchange Commission. Enron replaced Fastow as its CFE on Wednesday in the=
 hope it would restore investor confidence.=20

"I haven't seen any sign of them slowing down or not making a good market o=
n EnronOnline, but until things get squared away, I will keep a tight leash=
 on the credit issue," one trader said. "The only thing that bothers me is =
it takes a lot of capital to do what they're doing, and with the stock pric=
e down, I wonder how much credit they have left," he added.=20

Enron said this week that it can tap a $3.35 billion credit line to support=
 its trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in ca=
sh flow depending on commodity prices.=20

"In the event of a 'push-comes-to-shove' liquidity crunch, we believe the c=
ompany could generate substantial cash by selling a variety of other assets=
," said Ron Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg.=20

If EnronOnline does lose steam, the big winner will be its main rival Atlan=
ta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - which already routinely trades m=
ore than $1 billion a day. "This (recent news) shows there may be some kink=
s in the armor and some people may stop using EnronOnline," said Kyle Coope=
r, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Clearly ICE could benefit or any other=
 alternative online platform."=20

EnronOnline is still a force to be reckoned with, experts said. "Enron clea=
rly will survive and EnronOnline will still remain a dominant force" in Int=
ernet energy trading, said Barone. Nonetheless, traders are playing it safe=

Petronet LNG may up enhance Dahej capacity

PETRONET LNG, a joint venture of four public sector oil and gas majors, is =
considering doubling the capacity of its under-construction Dahej liquefied=
 natural gas terminal in Gujarat to 10 million tonnes.=20

"We are considering a proposal of doubling the present 5 million tonnes cap=
acity of Dahej terminal as we see tremendous demand in the future," said Su=
resh Mathur, chief executive officer and managing director, Petronet LNG.=
=20

While the subject is under study, Petronet LNG will firm up plans once the =
Dahej terminal nears completion. A joint venture of Oil & Natural Gas Corpo=
ration, Gas Authority of India, Bharat Petroleum and IndianOil, Petronet LN=
G is planning another terminal of 2.5 million tonnes capacity at Kochi in K=
erala.=20

French gas major Gaz de France and RasGas of Qatar, which will supply LNG t=
o the terminals for a 25-year period beginning 2003, also hold equity stake=
 in the Petronet LNG. The Dahej project involves the construction of a rega=
sification terminal, a liquefaction train in Qatar to be built by RasGas an=
d two methane tankers. A consortium led by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Indust=
ries of Japan is executing the $317-million engineering, procurement and co=
nstruction contract at Dahej.=20

Work on the Dahej terminal, expected to begin operation by December 2003, w=
as progressing on schedule and on cost, said Mathur. "Around 2,000 people h=
ave been mobilised for the construction of the jetty and storage tanks."=20

The capacity enhancement would involve construction on an additional storag=
e tank with an investment of around $70 million. While Petronet LNG has the=
 option to acquire the 5-million-tonne capacity Dhabol LNG terminal of US e=
nergy major Enron Corporation, Mathur denied there were any such plan.=20

Enron's LNG terminal at Dabhol was set up to supply regassified LNG to Dabh=
ol Power Corporation for use in its power plant, and the remainder to other=
 bulk users. In the wake of the tussle over power dues with Maharashtra Sta=
te Electric Board, one of the partners in Dabhol Power, Enron is trying to =
sell off both projects.=20

Indian consumption of natural gas has risen faster than any other fuel in r=
ecent years. From only 0.6 trillion cubic feet per year in 1995, natural ga=
s use was nearly 0.8 Tcf in 1999 and is projected to reach 1.3 Tcf in 2005 =
and 1.8 Tcf in 2010.=20

With domestic gas production far short of demand, India is encouraging proj=
ects for import of LNG. The government is of the view that the dozen or so =
terminal projects in the pipeline would be able to meet the needs of gas-fi=
red electric power plants and bring down the cost of power generation. (IAN=

Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3=20
 Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron have called a meet=
ing next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project=
, a banking source said on Saturday. They will examine offers that two Indi=
an companies have put forward for buying the US energy giant's 65 per cent =
stake, and those of two other US firms, in Dabhol Power Company, which is b=
uilding the controversial project, the source said.

The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank, B=
ank of America, will be held on November 3, the source added. At stake is n=
ot just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's la=
rgest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment =
of Enron, General Electric and Bechtel. All three companies are founders of=
 DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state governmen=
t to set up the plant on its coast.

The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 per cent complete, was abruptly stopped=
 in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility=
 MSEB.

MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. Dabhol, in turn, accus=
ed MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary noti=
ce to terminate the power purchase contract.

Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =
final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That=
 six month period expires on November 19.

Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 per cent of Dabhol, further announced th=
at it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Ind=
ian government.

TIME RUNNING OUT

The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would als=
o discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novem=
ber 19.

"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as=
 saying. The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter pro=
ceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. "The widespread view amon=
g the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands=
 down," the paper added.

A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. The source said the =
meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far.

The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity,=
 but two Indian companies, BSES and Tata Power, have shown interest.  They =
have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the fou=
nders agree to sell their stake at a discount.

Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power=
 and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 per =
cent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.

Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less t=
han $1 billion, the paper added. Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not =
immediately available for comment.( REUTERS )

Loans to DPC based on MSEB's letter of credit: Bank of America
=20
Bank of America (BoA), which is the onshore trustee for the secured parties=
 of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in an application before the Supreme Court,=
 has said that the secured lenders in making their loans to the "distressed=
" 2,184 mw Dabhol project has relied on the validity of the letter of credi=
t (L/C) established by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and t=
he non-payment under the L/C would inevitably result in non-payment of the =
lender's debt. The trustee submitted that "had the secured lenders known th=
at the MSEB would seek to prevent the honouring of the L/C, they would not =
have made the loans to the project."=20

The BoA in its application has appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) to implea=
d it as a respondent in the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the MSEB =
on September 17 challenging the Mumbai High Court allowing the DPC to invok=
e the L/C of Rs 136 crore for the recovery of the April bill from MSEB. The=
 BoA has prayed that the SC should dismiss the MSEB's SLP and also vacate i=
ts (Supreme Court) order of September 21 staying the Mumbai High Court orde=
r. The BoA has pooh-poohed MSEB's argument that it would suffer irreparable=
 harm if payment under the L/C was made. "The trustee respectfully submits =
that harm to MSEB is not a relevant consideration to the payment by Canara =
Bank to the trustee under the L/C which is a separate contract made and ass=
igned before the controversy arose between the MSEB and DPC."=20

The BoA has reiterated its plea that the SC, which would hold a hearing on =
November 2, should dismiss MSEB's SLP and grant interim relief as it would =
be directly affected by any order passed by the apex court. In this case, t=
he trustee as beneficiary has sought to draw funds (Rs 136 crore) payable t=
o it under the irrevocable L/C dated May 12, 1999 and signed by Canara Bank=
, which has not disputed its obligation to pay. The Mumbai High Court in it=
s September 14 order properly determined that under settled principles of I=
ndian law governing L/C, no injunction can be issued absent "extraordinary =
circumstances that require clear proof by the beneficiary and knowledge of =
clear fraud by the issuing bank."

Enron in talks with banks over new credit line=20

NEW YORK: Enron Corp, which has been seeking to curb fears that it faces a =
credit crunch, is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar cr=
edit line, the Wall Street Journal online edition reported on Friday.

The report comes after Enron said on late Thursday that it had drawn on its=
 committed lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidi=
ty. The Journal said the company had drawn down about $3 billion, the major=
ity of its available bank credit lines.

The Journal said on Friday that the company will use most of the money draw=
n from its credit lines to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstandi=
ng commercial paper.

Enron CFO Jef McMahon said in a statement on Thursday that the decision to =
draw on the credit lines was designed to alleviate concerns about the compa=
ny's liquidity.

On Wednesday, Enron was forced to replace its former CFO, Andrew Fastow, wh=
o was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulato=
rs. There have been disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet =
transactions with two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the SEC i=
s now looking into for possible conflict of interest.( REUTERS )
