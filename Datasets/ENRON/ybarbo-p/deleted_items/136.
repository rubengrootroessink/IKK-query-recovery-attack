DPC board to meet in London on Nov 30, Sanjay Jog
...expected to authorise Wade Cline to issue final termination notice to MS=
EB

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is involved in the process of selling=
 its stakes in the distressed Dabhol project, has reconvened its board meet=
ing on November 30 in London, for authorising Enron India managing director=
 K Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to Maharashtra State Elec=
tricity Board (MSEB). The MSEB and state government, which have a represent=
ation on the DPC board, are likely to skip the ensuing board meeting. The D=
PC, following the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc and the Bombay High Co=
urt's order of November 9 restraining it from serving a final termination n=
otice to MSEB until further order, had cancelled the board meeting original=
ly slated for November 19 in Houston. The MSEB, which holds 30 per cent equ=
ity in the Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw), had taken a serious objection of the No=
vember 19 meeting and had asked DPC to cancel it following the Bombay High =
Court order. Curiously, MSEB has decided to soon send a dissent note to the=
 DPC saying that the stage of issuing final termination notice had come mai=
nly because of DPC's mismanagement.=20

MSEB, which wants to expose DPC's default on the availability of power, in =
its dissent note would also ask the DPC to change the venue of the board me=
eting from London to India. MSEB sources told The Financial Express on Thur=
sday that it has received an intimation from DPC on the proposed board meet=
ing to be held in London. Sources said that it would ask DPC why it suddenl=
y cancelled the Houston meeting and rescheduled it for November 30. MSEB is=
 also likely to question the "wasteful expenditure" involved in the cancell=
ation and reorganisation of the board meeting especially when DPC has been =
complaining about a financial crunch faced by it, following the closure of =
the Dabhol project after the suspension of power by MSEB on May 29. MSEB wo=
uld also pointed out that though there were slippages in the payment of its=
 power purchase bills, it has paid it with interest. Ironically, DPC, which=
 defaulted on the availability of power, refused to accept the April bill a=
nd neither paid the rebate imposed by MSEB for material misrepresentation a=
nd default. The November 30 meeting would also take up issues related to as=
sess preservation, 12 months preservation, financial position of DPC with r=
egard to Dabhol Phase-I, failure in the payment of interest to lenders. The=
 meet would also hold discussion on safeguarding the legal positions of DPC=
 directors, opening of letter of credit of $295 million for shipping. If DP=
C fails to do so there is a likelihood that it may lose the ship arranged f=
or the supply liquified natural gas.=20

Mumbai, Nov 22: Dynegy Inc spokesperson John Sousa has said that Enron-owne=
d assets especially the 2,184 mw Dabhol project would continue to be manage=
d by Enron through the closing of merger, which is expected to be complete =
in the second or third quarter of 2002.  "We are currently beginning the Dy=
negy-Enron merger integration process. Assets currently owned by Enron will=
 continue to be managed by Enron through the closing of our merger, which i=
s expected in 6 to 9 months," he said.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday, November 23, 2001
NGO pegs DPC cost at Rs 1,500 cr=20

The Prayas Energy Group, a research-oriented NGO, has pegged the cost of th=
e Dabhol project at Rs 1,500 crore ($320 million). This figure contrasts sh=
arply with the estimate of Rs 3,800 crore ($800 million) reported to be und=
er consideration by Indian financial institutions. The NGO recently evaluat=
ed the project's worth following news reports about the Dabhol Power Compan=
y selling the stake of its three MNC promoters -Enron, General Electric and=
 Bechtel -for about $ 800 million, after a 30 per cent discounting.

According to Prayas, if Enron is not willing to settle for a reasonable fig=
ure, the Indian financial institutions may come under pressure to absorb th=
e difference to put a full- stop to the endless rounds of controversy the p=
roject has been attracting. ``This is evident in the proposals being discus=
sed, envisaging that the FIs would buy the equity as a warehouse and sell i=
t later. The loss would obviously be theirs,'' says Shantanu Dixit, one of =
the researchers for the group. ``Based on our analysis of the renegotiation=
 committee's report of 1995, the affidavit by the then chief minister Manoh=
ar Joshi in August 1996 in the Bombay high court, and the present financing=
 structure of the project, it could be concluded that the fair cost of equi=
ty of the foreign promoters is not more than $320 million (Rs 1,500 crore),=
'' he says. This estimate is based on the assumption that DPC completes the=
 project in the next six months, without any additional loans. Giving a bre=
ak-up of the estimate, a statement released by the Prayas mentions that in =
the detailed project report submitted to the Central Electricity Authority =
in 1993, Enron has claimed a capital cost of US $ 2,828 million. Following =
re-negotiations in 1996, the Shiv Sena-BJP government claimed this cost had=
 been pared down to U.S. $2,500 million. This is mentioned on Page 3 of the=
 re-negotiation committee's report, which says that ``Enron and DPC represe=
ntatives have given their written consent'' to this reduction.

But, by 1999, DPC's cumulative loans from Indian and foreign institutions w=
ere nearly $2,050 million. This implies that the total equity component of =
the project is only $450 million. Of this, the equity of Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board (MSEB) is $130 million. This brings the total equity put =
in by the foreign promoters to about $320 million. The report points out th=
at on several occasions, Enron has guaranteed completion of the project wit=
hin the agreed cost. ``Hence, any equity claim higher than this amount is u=
njustified and need not be entertained,'' it says. ``In other words, buying=
 the foreign promoter's stake for a price more than $320 million would amou=
nt to a paying a premium to Enron and not discount,'' observes Mr Dixit.

The report notes that just before the work on the project was suspended owi=
ng to the disputes between the MSEB and the DPC, DPC had said the project c=
ost had escalated and it would complete the project at a cost of $3,326 mil=
lion. ``This astonishing cost overrun of $826 million (or 33 per cent of th=
e project cost) is unbelievable, and has to be the result of Enron's ineffi=
ciency,'' says Mr Dixit. It further hiked this figure to $3,690 million, ci=
ting cost overruns since the project was not completed as per schedule. Thi=
s, despite the fact that a few months before the suspension of work, DPC ha=
d claimed that more than 90 per cent of the project was complete. It has no=
w claimed additional costs of $360 million, that is 14 per cent cost overru=
n for completion of the project.

The cumulative difference is of $1,190 million or a cost increase of Rs 5,5=
00 crore, says the report. Now, if this difference has to be accounted for =
in any new power purchase agreement that may be worked out in the future, i=
t would come in for scrutiny by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Comm=
ission. ``There is every likelihood that the MERC would disallow it since i=
t overrides the mutually agreed figure of $2,500 million,'' says Mr Dixit. =
In that case, the relevant party -most probably the government or the finan=
cial institutions -would willy-nilly have to absorb the additional costs cl=
aimed and incur such a needless and huge loss, he says.

SEES SOLUTION BY MID-DECEMBER; OPERATORSHIP JV OPTION THROWN UP
BG extends Panna Mukta deal with Enron, Sourav Majumdar

British Gas (BG), which has decided to acquire the 30 per cent stake held b=
y Enron in the Panna Mukta Tapti oil and gas fields for about $388 million,=
 has extended the deal indefinitely, pinning its hopes on getting sole oper=
atorship rights for the fields by mid-December. The deal to buy the stake i=
s conditional upon BG getting the operatorship rights which were with Enron=
, and was supposed to have been clinched by October end. BG is now hoping t=
hat the issue will be sorted out by the middle of next month. The other joi=
nt venture partners in the Panna Mukta Tapti fields are Oil and Natural Gas=
 Corporation (ONGC) with a 40 per cent stake, and Reliance with another 30 =
per cent. Both ONGC and Reliance have also staked claim to the operatorship=
 rights.But even as BG holds firm on getting sole operatorship, two other o=
ptions have been thrown up.=20

One option is that of setting up a joint venture operatorship company with =
the three joint venture partners holding stakes reflecting their ownership =
of the mother venture.The other option is to hand over one field each to ea=
ch of the three joint venture partners. However, for BG, it's still a "sole=
 operatorship or nothing" approach. While BG India chief Nigel Shaw was not=
 available for comment, sources close to BG in India confirmed to The Finan=
cial Express that the deal had been extended in view of the hopes that the =
entire issue would be amicably resolved by the middle of December. "For BG,=
 the stance is clear: it wants sole operatorship rights," the sources said.

They said the operatorship issue was critical to the running of the fields,=
 and, therefore, there was no question of continuing with it unless BG got =
the rights. On the other hand, petroleum minister Ram Naik is of the view t=
hat merely because Enron is selling its stake to BG, it does not mean the r=
ights can be transferred automatically to the new buyer. Mr Naik had earlie=
r said that the right of first refusal for operatorship rights was with the=
 other two partners in the joint venture. ONGC's unions have also backed th=
e corporation's claim to operatorship rights, saying that it has enormous e=
xperience in the field and had also discovered the fields. Reliance, on the=
 other hand, staked its claim citing experience and also the fact that it h=
as got 25 blocks in NELP I,II and III.

According to sources associated with the entire issue, the joint venture op=
eratorship company had come up as a suggested solution to the operatorship =
tangle from some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners cou=
ld be kept in the picture. If this was not feasible, the other suggestion w=
as to distribute the three fields to the three partners. "That way, there w=
ould be some benchmarking possible as each partner would then operate one b=
lock," sources said. BG, however, is not willing to concede anything less t=
han sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas an=
d 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has just been taken over by D=
ynegy Inc., had already decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as pa=
rt of its global strategy. The US energy major was keen to move quickly on =
the Panna Mukta Tapti front, since it was already locked in intense deliber=
ations on another of its major Indian assets, the troubled Dabhol Power Com=
pany (DPC).=20

Enron shares in quicksand as merger doubts rise, C BRYSON HULL

Enron Corporation said on Wednesday it secured the remaining $450 million o=
f a new $1 billion credit line, but the news did little to reassure investo=
rs it can stay afloat long enough to complete its merger with rival Dynegy =
Inc. Shares of the Houston-based energy giant were off 26per cent, despite =
the announcement in which Enron also said it had pushed back the deadline f=
or repaying a $690 million debt to mid-December from a deadline of next Tue=
sday. Enron's shares fell 23 per cent on Tuesday, after it raised credit co=
ncerns in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The Dynegy=
 deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen over that time=
 period. Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have =
a number of exit opportunities," said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Micha=
el Barbis. In Wednesday's statement, Enron said it is in feverish talks wit=
h its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its =
commitment to the Dynegy deal, tagged at $9 billion in stock."We continue t=
o believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, em=
ployees, and lenders," Enron chairman and chief executive Ken Lay said. Enr=
on's shares were down $1.83, or 26 per cent, at $5.16 on Wednesday afternoo=
n. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for=
 the second day in a row.

Shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebounding somewhat a=
fter the announcement of the new loan. Accounting for stock splits, that is=
 the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1.9=
5, or 4.68 per cent, at $39.75. Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer=
 Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new $450 million loan and the de=
bt extension for the $690 million. "We are continuing our confirmatory due =
diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to co=
mplete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement," h=
e said in a statement. Watson said Chevron Texaco, which owns 26 per cent o=
f Dynegy, reiterated its 'full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined managemen=
t approach to complete the merger and to build a new company into an indust=
ry leader.'=20

Privately, analysts were calling the odds of a successful merger lower in t=
he wake of new negative news made in a US Securities and Exchange filing. M=
ost analysts called the chances of success even, where most had called the =
odds of success at 60-70 per cent earlier. Wall Street analysts said Enron =
is losing market share because of credit concerns from its trading partners=
 and questions over Dynegy Inc's takeover offer. "Enron is definitely losin=
g market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to run the business have now =
increased. The market perceives Enron as needing more cash," said Barbis. G=
oldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform on Tuesday, and =
took both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dyn=
egy - $1.5 billion - 'appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron=
 customers.' The bad news in Monday's filing with the SEC included the acce=
leration of the $690 million debt because of the credit downgrade, a new re=
duction in third-quarter earnings, word that Enron has only about $1.5 bill=
ion cash on hand after new infusions of $5.5 billion over the past few week=

THE HINDU BUSINESS LINE, Friday, November 23, 2001
EU urged to ease market access, NEW YORK, ( carried only by the online edit=
ion)

ENRON Corp, the beleaguered energy trading company, plans to use its minori=
ty interests in power plants to secure a restructured $690 million loan agr=
eement, a source familiar with the plan said. The Houston-based Enron, whic=
h has agreed to be bought by rival Dynegy Inc in a stock-swap merger, discl=
osed in regulatory filings on Monday that it needed to provide collateral f=
or the loan by November 27 or pay it off at an accelerated rate due to a re=
cent ratings downgrade. This week, Citigroup Inc, which arranged the origin=
al $690 million loan, worked with the nearly 20 other banks to extend the p=
ayment schedule to mid-December, the source added. Discussions on repricing=
 the loan are continuing, but the rate is likely to be similar to the terms=
 of a new $1 billion line of credit for Enron, details of which Enron discl=
osed here. Enron said it secured the remaining $450 million in credit for t=
his previously announced $1 billion line. The loan was lead by Citibank, wh=
ich is advising Enron in its merger with Dynegy through its Salomon Smith B=
arney brokerage, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, which is also advising Enron o=
n its merger with Dynegy.=20

Worries over a possible default on the $690-million loan and Enron's abilit=
y to fund payments on its looming debt are part of the reason Enron's stock=
 skidded on Tuesday and Wednesday. Enron needs to repay about $9 billion in=
 loans by the end of next year, according to regulatory filings. A lot of t=
he banks were concerned, but all liquidity events can be dealt with a littl=
e patience," the source said. "I don't think there is too much risk of a de=
fault." Citibank arranged the original $690 million "special purpose vehicl=
e" loan facility to finance Enron's investments in stakes in power business=
es, both domestic and internationally. Reviewing operations in Japan: Enron=
 Corp, which has seen its share price fall to a decade low, is reviewing it=
s operations in Japan, including an option to sell the business to a third =
party, a spokeswoman at Enron's Japanese unit in Tokyo said. Japanese media=
 said the Enron group, facing financial difficulties and frustrated by the =
slow progress of Japan's liberalisation of its power market, was considerin=
g withdrawing from the local market. Japanese energy companies have also be=
en hurt by increased competition and slow demand due to the weak economy. "=
Enron Corp is reviewing its operations in Japan...considering every possibi=
lity including retaining the operations or selling a part of it," the spoke=
swoman said. The company will likely finalise its plans within five or six =
weeks, she said. Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999, when it =
established affiliate E Power Corp, hoping to benefit from Japan's deregula=
tion of the retail market.
