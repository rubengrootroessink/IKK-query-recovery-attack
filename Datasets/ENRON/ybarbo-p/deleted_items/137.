Dabhol agrees to due diligence: BSES chief=20

THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has agreed to the due diligen=
ce of its 2,184-MW project, Mr R.V. Shahi, Chairman and Managing Director, =
BSES Ltd, has said. The DPC management has agreed to facilitate the due dil=
igence but has asked us (Tata Power and BSES Ltd) to enter a confidentialit=
y agreement with the company, which is only fair, Mr Shahi told newspersons=
 on the sidelines of a seminar here on Wednesday. He said Tata Power and BS=
ES had received a draft of the confidentiality agreement from DPC soon afte=
r they submitted their proposal to buy the power project, at the Singapore =
meeting. An issue like valuation and share transfer cannot be done unless t=
he buyers get to examine details. Due diligence is a pre-requisite for the =
sale process to continue, Mr Shahi said. He said the companies would sign t=
he confidentiality clause within the next two-three weeks while the due dil=
igence process will take about six-eight weeks. Lenders to DPC, foreign spo=
nsors, prospective buyers, the Centre, and other interested parties had met=
 in Singapore earlier this month to discuss the sale of the company. The DP=
C spokesperson declined comment on the matter. Next week, DPC officials are=
 scheduled to meet its other offshore sponsors General Electric and Bechtel=
 which hold 30 per cent stake each in DPC, to discuss the sale of the asset=

DPC sponsors meet in US next week to discuss due diligence (Carried only by=
 the online edition)

 SENIOR officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three for=
eign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company, will meet in Houston ne=
xt week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of due d=
iligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Power Co=
mpany and BSES. "The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given their go-a=
head for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence due dilig=
ence. They are scheduled to meet before this month-end to decide their next=
 step regarding the Dabhol project," sources close to the sponsors said her=
e on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or deny =
the development. Sources said the sponsors' decision would be conveyed to t=
he Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian lenders by=
 first week of December. "Contradictory to recent announcements by Indian l=
enders and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to sign the con=
fidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will, after all, depe=
nd on the three foreign sponsors' approval," they pointed out. Both Tatas a=
nd BSES would need their approval and cooperation to commence due diligence=
, sources emphasised.

Tata Power Ltd managing director Adi Engineer confirmed they were yet to co=
mmence DPC due diligence. "We are waiting to sign the confidentiality agree=
ment with DPC sponsors after which Tata Power Ltd would take at least a few=
 months to complete the process," Adi Engineer said. Sources termed the mee=
t as "critical" in deciding the future course of events in resolving the is=
sues surrounding the $3-billion power project. "Enron, GE and Bechtel had r=
aised the issue of continuing costs of fundings during the three-day marath=
on Singapore meet, risen as a result of the Indian and foreign lenders' ref=
usal to disburse additional funds," they informed. The proposed due-diligen=
ce was expected to take another two-three months, sources said, adding situ=
ation had become "more fragile" with Maharashtra State Electricity Board no=
t drawing power since May 29 and lenders stopping disbursements to the 2,81=
4-mw project March onwards. "This has resulted in the beleaguered DPC also =
being unable to meet its loan repayment commitments in September and Octobe=
r," they added. During the Singapore meet, the three foreign sponsors had a=
lso expressed their grave concern about bearing additional expenses as the =
due diligence process would take its own time and incur significant costs, =
only adding to deterioration of assets and their cost burden, the sources s=
aid.

Yesterday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing director R V Shahi had announced =
that the company was likely to complete the due diligence of the Dabhol pro=
ject by January end next year. Shahi said BSES has returned the draft of co=
nfidentiality agreement with comments to DPC. BSES would appoint three sepa=
rate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence alo=
ng with an internal task force to do parallel ground work, he said. (PTI)

EMBATTLED US power major Enron may be forced to sell its stake in the Dabho=

 was earlier quoted as saying that India would have to face economic sancti=

Enron crisis deepens, bankruptcy looms (Carried only by the online edition)

The crisis of confidence ravaging cash-strapped Enron deepened on Wednesday=
 amid mounting concerns that a proposed rescue by rival Dynegy could fall t=
hrough, threatening the energy giant with bankruptcy. While the Houston-bas=
ed energy giant said it secured the remaining $450 million of a new $1 bill=
ion credit line and pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million de=
bt, its shares fell a further 28 per cent, after falling 23 per cent on Tue=
sday. "If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situat=
ion seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," rating agenc=
y Fitch Investors said. UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said, "Bankruptcy wo=
uld not be out of the question if the merger fell through or ran into obsta=
cles." "We believe the odds of Enron incurring a material adverse change on=
 its operations is soaring," Barone said in a research note, saying that Dy=
negy may invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of=
 the $9 billion agreement. In a statement, Enron said it was in feverish ta=
lks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirm=
ed its commitment to the Dynegy deal. "We continue to believe that this mer=
ger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders," =
Enron chairman and chief Executive Ken Lay said. JP Morgan Chase vice chair=
man James Lee said in the same statement that Chase believes its interests =
and those of Enron and its other primary lenders are aligned, and that the =
bank would "develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to a=
nd through its merger with Dynegy."

SHARES HIT 1989 LEVELS
Enron's shares fell $1.98, or 28 per cent, to close at $5.01. It was the mo=
st actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for the second day =
in a row. The shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebound=
ing slightly after Enron's announcement. Accounting for stock splits, that =
is the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1=
.94, or 4.65 per cent, at $39.76. Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Offic=
er Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new loan and debt extension. H=
e said in a statement that Dynegy was working to "accelerate the regulatory=
 approvals required to complete the merger". Watson said ChevronTexaco, whi=
ch owns 26 per cent of Dynegy, reiterated its "full confidence" in Dynegy's=
 ability to complete the merger. Privately, analysts were calling the odds =
of success lower since Enron made a filing with the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission on Monday alerting investors to its credit crunch.

Most analysts interviewed by Reuters called the chances even, where earlier=
 they had called odds of success at 60-70 per cent. However, one analyst sa=
id he thought emotion was driving the current stock moves, and that it come=
s despite three powerful factors in favor of the deal. "The bottom line, En=
ron needs this to happen, Dynegy wants this to happen, and ChevronTexaco is=
 supportive of it happening," Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Laune=
r said. Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform, and to=
ok both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dyneg=
y -- $1.5 billion -- "appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron=
 customers." Enron's trading partners, now more publicly than before, on Tu=
esday said they were treading carefully.
"We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron.=
 Everyday, our credit people are watching," said Al Butkus, a vice presiden=
t with Kansas City-based Utilicorp United.The trading business, Enron's cro=
wn jewel and the part most coveted by Dynegy, relies on volume for profitab=
ility, and Enron has said it was possible that the lower volumes would hamp=
er fourth-quarter earnings. One indicator of Enron's shape was the fact tha=
t its bonds are now being quoted by price, like junk bonds, rather than by =
how much extra yield they carry over US treasuries, like investment-grade b=
onds.

The company's 6.4 per cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes m=
aturing in 2009 were respectively bid Wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cent=
s on the dollar, each down from the high-60s on Tuesday. Their yields to ma=
turity were a respective 19 and 16 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon conver=
tible bonds traded Wednesday at just over 34 cents on the dollar, down from=
 38 cents on Tuesday.

Enron closes a decade low at $7=20

THE LATEST negative disclosures from Enron on Tuesday speared its stock pri=
ce, which crashed to a decade low after new debt problems and an earnings r=
evision emerged a day earlier. Shares of Enron closed down $2.07, or 22.8 p=
er cent, at $6.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $6.55 duri=
ng the day -- a low not seen since May 1991. Enron was far and away the day=
's most active stock, with more than 62.8 million shares changing hands. Vo=
lume was more than double the second most active issue, Xerox Corp.

Meanwhile, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said it may again cut the=
 Houston company's BBB-minus rating, which could trigger those debt payoffs=
. But the agency said Enron's liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its =
merger with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy, announced November 9. "This is=
 as high a high-wire act as I have ever seen," analyst John Olson of invest=
ment house Sanders Morris Harris said. "If this merger is to survive, equit=
y investors will need to have a reason to buy the stock and their confidenc=
e will need to be restored, because the equity investor has been leading th=
e way down." Enron's hellish Tuesday on the market came after the company m=
ade new disclosures in a US Securities and Exchange document, filed after t=
he market closed on Monday. Most pressing was news that Enron has until Nov=
ember 26 to put up $690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnersh=
ip. Otherwise, the partnership could begin liquidating assets, including a =
Brazilian gas company which Enron plans to sell to raise $250 million. In t=
he SEC filing, known as a Form 10-Q, Enron said it was suffering a decrease=
 in trading volumes, particularly in longer-term deals.

TRADING VOLUME DOWN

Since the trading business -- Enron's crown jewel and the segment most cove=
ted by Dynegy -- is low-margin, volume drives its profitability. It is too =
early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitabil=
ity, Enron said, but analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said Dyn=
egy will watch the volume drop carefully. "If it has a long-term effect, it=
 will definitely impact the value Dynegy will put on this business," he sai=
d. Dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lowe=
r volumes, and whether it was aware of the $690 million debt before it made=
 its deal to acquire Enron. "We are in due diligence and Enron's 10-Q is a =
part of that process," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said.

Meade said the filing yet again showed Enron's penchant for making disclosu=
res bit-by-bit. Of note was its latest downward revision of its third-quart=
er earnings, he said. "The restatements are coming out piecemeal as they fi=
nd them, and my guess is they don't know the full extent. We think further =
revisions are likely," Meade said. One analyst who follows Enron said the S=
EC filing painted a darker picture of the company's cash position, given th=
at it had $2.3 billion on hand as of Nov. 16. "It shows that the cash drain=
 on the company looks to be very significant," said the analyst, who asked =
not to be identified.

Standard & Poor's said Enron currently has about $1.5 billion in cash, but =
that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $1.5 billion from the Dynegy me=
rger, $550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets, and $3 billion from=
 its revolving credit lines. Another $450 pipeline-backed loan is expected =
in a day or two, and Enron said it expects $500 million of private equity i=
nvestment plus $800 million from asset sales. Enron owes $9.15 billion by t=
he end of next year, and its total liability for debt and other obligations=
 is $16.86 billion, according to the SEC filing. Its merger with Dynegy is =
expected to close by the third quarter of 2002, raising the possibility tha=
t an Enron without investment-grade credit might not have the liquidity to =
survive that long.

Enron acknowledged as much in the SEC filing, stating starkly that it would=
 be unlikely to "to continue as a going concern," if a credit rating cut tr=
iggers the early payoff of $3.9 billion in debts to partnerships to which i=
t belongs. Enron said that if its rating were cut, it would work out other =
payment arrangements. S&P said a similar effort being undertaken in the cas=
e of the $690 million debt will likely be successful "given the alignment o=
f the interests between Enron and the banks." Enron spokesman Vance Meyer s=
aid the company had received verbal indications that the deadline on that d=
ebt was going to be extended, but it details had yet to be worked out.( REU=

Unprecedented defence ties on way: Blackwill

US envoy Robert D Blackwill has said, "conclusive acceleration" of Indo-US =
defence cooperation is progressing, "in an unprecedented way". Mr Blackwill=
 listed, "joint exercises, education, intelligence, civilian nuclear safety=
 cooperation, a joint cyber terrorism initiative, and military to military =
cooperation", as areas where the two countries will be engaged in during a =
flurry of visits over the next 2-3 weeks. This includes chief of US Pacific=
 command Admiral Dennis Blair and US under secretary of defence Douglas Fei=
th. Mr Feith is the third senior-most official at the Pentagon. Mr Blackwil=
l also made direct references to "sale of arms" and "spares", as areas whic=
h will see future cooperation. He was speaking at the Foreign Correspondent=
s\' Club here. Even as he read out, "an ennumerative list of strategic coop=
eration in the months and years ahead," the envoy cautioned that won't give=
 "a flat promise" on such matters. "Fundamentally, it is for both sides to =
earn each other's trust. Yes, the US has had an episodic and an ad hoc appr=
oach in the past, but then September 11 has changed our position on terrori=
sm, as it has for the entire world. Is there any use in insisting on a hist=
orical approach lifted from the Cold War? But having said all this, I can't=
 give a flat promise to any country. US policies are in the hands of our pe=
ople, who in turn express themselves through their representatives".=20

Asked if unprecedented cooperation meant that Enron was no longer 'a five l=
etter word' jarring the Indo-US commercial dialogue, Mr Blackwill cautioned=
, "Enron remains a problem. We hope there will be a quick, and mutually acc=
eptable resolution. The problem continues to pass a very dark shadow. That =
remains true to this day". In a reaction, Indo-American Chamber of Commerce=
 regional president Bimal Sareen, who was in the audience, endorsed Mr Blac=
kwill's assessment. "It is extremely critical for the (Indian) government t=
o take a proactive stand on an expeditious solution...Enron is casting a cl=
oud over foreign investment," Mr Sareen told The Financial Express. "Of cou=
rse, expansion of commercial relations into defence, and more security coop=
eration will greatly help in renewal of confidence," Mr Sareen added.=20

On a more general note, Mr Blackwill said the regime on high tech commerce =
will be allowed to flow "on the assumption of approval rather than denial".=
 On terrorism, the envoy showed heightened understanding of what India has =
repeatedly complained about. "There are no exceptions in this war. We won't=
 allow terrorism against the US. Nor will we allow terrorism against India.=
 So, without (addressing concerns of) India, this war (against the Al Qaeda=
) won't be complete otherwise. US and India are in this battle together. An=
d as secretary of defence Don Rumsfeld has said on Fox TV, there is no diff=
erence between terrorist networks....a terrorist is a terrorist is a terror=
ist. He can never be a freedom fighter. Also, no country will be allowed to=
 provide a sanctuary to terrorists". On Afghanistan, Mr Blackwill said, "th=
e US sees India as a central player in the assistance once the war is over"=
 He talked of the forthcoming visits of US special coordinator Richard Haas=
, and US envoy on Afghanistan James Dobbins to India and defended the exclu=
sion of 'moderate Taliban' elements in the forthcoming Berlin conclave, quo=
ting US national security advisor Condoleeza Rice. In Ms Rice's view, "mode=

Fitch thumbs down to India currency ratings (Carried only by the online edi=
tion)

International rating agency, Fitch, on Wednesday downgraded India's soverei=
gn foreign and local currency ratings to 'BB' and 'BB+', respectively, from=
 'BB+' and 'BBB-' (triple B minus). However, the rating agency changed its =
outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' in recognition of India's continuing ex=
ternal strengths. Fitch said that this rating action -- presaged by a chang=
e in the outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' in May 2001 -- has been prompt=
ed by India's continued fiscal profligacy, while an unfavourable political =
environment is hindering economic reforms. Further, while changing its outl=
ook to 'stable' from 'negative', Fitch cautions that \"the outlook for the =
local currency rating remains negative because of high and rising domestic =
debt and weak public finances.\"=20

The rating downgrades reflect the absence of any significant improvement in=
 India's public finances and slow progress on disinvestment. Persistent gen=
eral government deficits of over 9 per cent of GDP are the highest among 'B=
B' Fitch-rated sovereigns. "The agency believes that fiscal consolidation e=
nvisioned for 2001 is unlikely to materialise due to revenue shortfalls ari=
sing from the current economic slowdown and the inability of the government=
 to cut expenditures. More importantly, the composition of the fiscal defic=
it has deteriorated, with a sizable part of the revenue deficit attributabl=
e to rising public consumption. Interest payments constitute 50% of revenue=
s and leave little room for social and capital spending,\" said Fitch Sover=
eign's director, Paul Rawkins.=20

Like China, India's large domestic market and the closed nature of its econ=
omy makes it less vulnerable to external shocks. Nonetheless, it is unlikel=
y to escape unscathed from the current global economic downturn. Declining =
exports have already induced a dramatic slowdown in industrial production a=
nd capital spending. Lower oil prices and sluggish non-oil imports should, =
however, help to contain the deterioration in current account deficit, whic=
h remains manageable at around 1 per cent of GDP. India's 'BB' foreign curr=
ency rating balances this factor plus continuing improvements in its extern=
al solvency and liquidity ratios against a prospective deterioration in the=
 foreign investment climate (and hence non-debt creating flows) consequent =
upon the Enron case.
