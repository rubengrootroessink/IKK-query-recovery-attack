Anti-Enron lobby takes a knock as state excludes Aney from lawyers panel, S=
anjay Jog

The anti-Enron lobby has received a major setback following the Maharashtra=
 government's decision not to include senior advocate Shrihari Aney's name =
in the panel of lawyers which would brief the state's solicitors DLA and th=
e Queen's counsel Lord Alexander to challenge the London court's ex-parte o=
rder restraining the government from filing any suit in the Indian court or=
 tribunal against the international arbitration proceedings initiated by th=
e Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The state government's panel would comprise o=
f its solicitors Rafiq Dada, Amit Harayani and Darious Khambata. The team w=
ould leave for London in the first week of November. State government sourc=
es told The Financial Express that Mr Dada, Mr Harayani and Mr Khambata wou=
ld brief the government's solicitor DLA and its Queen's counsel Lord Alexan=
der. The government was in the process of preparing its petition challengin=
g the October 10 order of London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Divis=
ion, Commercial Court). Sources said that the axe has fallen on Mr Aney fol=
lowing his outburst against the government on September 18 for exclusion of=
 fraud in the proposed civil suit to be filed against DPC in the Mumbai hig=
h court. Mr Aney's views in this regard has been publicly supported by the =
anti Enron lobby which had alleged that certain forces in the government we=
re "diluting" the Dabhol suit. Mr Aney, who had withdrawn his resignation a=
s the government's counsel after his meeting with the state energy minister=
 Padmasinh Patil, had stressed the need for including fraud, issues related=
 to public interest, public policy and absence of legal sanction in the civ=
il suit "in order to put forward a complete, fruitful and effective case ag=
ainst the DPC." Analysts believe that the government did not want to face f=
urther embarrassment and decided to drop Mr Aney's name from its panel visi=
ting London. The DPC in its defence had quaoted Mr Aney's observations befo=
re the London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Cou=
rt) before seeking an injunction. According to DPC, "there are some indicat=
ions as to state government's intended position in the Indian press reports=
. In particular, it appears that the state government are void and to reply=
 upon grounds of fraud, public policy, public interest and misrepresentatio=
n." Quoting the newspaper report, the DPC said "the state government's lawy=
er was reported as proposing a broad based suit which should pray that the =
high court declare the three contracts with DPC as unforceable and void and=
 that this argument should be based on a number of factors. "DPC made mater=
ial misrepresentation to MSEB about the plant's capabilities.=20

BG offers ONGC equity in Brazil for Mukta-Panna, Soma Banerjee=20

BRITISH Gas (BG) has offered ONGC equity in its exploration acreage in Braz=
il and a settlement in the cash call dispute in lieu for the operatorship o=
f the Tapti Panna and Mukta oilfields which is being claimed by ONGC and Re=
liance following the sale of Enron's equity to BG. The Britain-based gas ma=
jor had set a deadline of October 31 to settle the issue over operatorship.=
=20

In return for the package BG has asked ONGC towaive its right to seek the r=
emoval of EOGIL, acquired by British Gas, asoperator following the change o=
f control. The operatorship of the fields are a crucial issue to all the eq=
uity holders as it is an extra source of revenue. Niger Shaw, the vice-pres=
ident BG India had said that the deal to buy out Enron Oil and Gas India 30=
 per cent stake would fall through if BG was not given the operatorship of =
the oilfields.=20

EOGIL was the operator of these fields and BG had bought the company with t=
he understanding that the operatorship of the field would be transferred to=
 the new equity holder. However, both ONGC and Reliance the other equity ho=
lders in the project have staked claim to the operatorship. The production =
sharing committee has entailed that the issue of operatorship has to be dec=
ided on a consensus by the equity holders of the project.=20

Shaw also confirmed that negotiations were on with both the equity holders =
and BG would put down what it could offer in return. However, still the dis=
cussions were still being held, he declined to give any details. BG, which =
has sealed this deal for a whopping $388 million and is hoping to expand it=
s capacity by investing $250 million, is trying to make its offer lucrative=
 so as to waive the opposition by ONGC and Reliance.=20

In a recent communication to ONGC the company has assured its commitment to=
 the adoption of a very different style of working, imposed in the past. Fu=
rther, in order to ensure that the two companies have a good working relati=
on, BG has made an offer to ONGC by which the latter could have a greater i=
nvolvement in the operation of the fields.=20

US regulators probing Enron deals, stock slides 20 pc
Shares of Enron Corp slumped more than 20 per cent on Monday after it said =
US regulators are looking into some of its transactions, the latest in a se=
ries of blows for the company whose new chief executive officer resigned un=
expectedly in August. A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and sel=
ler of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss a request for inform=
ation by the US Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating=
. The SEC also declined to provide details. Investor confidence in the comp=
any has been rocked by recent reports in The Wall Street Journal about tran=
sactions between Enron and two limited partnerships that were run until rec=
ently by Enron's Chief Financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The Journal said t=
he deal raised "conflict-of-interest" questions but Enron has rejected any =
such suggestion, saying the deals were disclosed in SEC filings and approve=
d by its board and internal and external auditors. A former Wall Street fav=
ourite that has fallen from grace during the last 12 months, Enron reported=
 its first quarterly loss in more than four years last week after taking $1=
.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. Enron has s=
uffered a series of high-profile setbacks, ranging from problems at its bro=
adband telecommunications business, a payments dispute at an Indian power p=
lant project and the departure of CEO Jeff Skilling after only six months i=
n the job. Its stock closed down $5.40, or almost 21 per cent, at $ 20.65, =
slicing $4.1 billion from its market capitalisation and making it the New Y=
ork Stock Exchange's biggest percentage loser of the day. At one point the =
shares fell below $20 for the first time in 46 months. Monday's slide follo=
wed heavy losses for Enron's stock last week.=20

AES approaches Indian govt for payment dues

AFTER Enron, it is the turn of US-based AES to seek the Indian Prime Minist=
er's help to settle its grievances with the Orissa government. In a letter =
to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES president Dennis W Bakke said his company's de=
termination to continue in India was being tested by the government of Oris=
sa . The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press=
 on Tuesday, was dated October 1, and appeared to have been faxed to the of=
fice of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Virginia-based energy comp=
any operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 per cent of the Orissa Po=
wer Generation Corp and manages the main power distribution company in the =
state. AES is the other major American power company besides Enron to have =
made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investme=
nt in the power sector in the early 1990s. In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpay=
ee's attention to the "expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimid=
ation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management" by the state =
government and its agencies.The letter also complained about government-run=
 agencies failing to pay Rs 210 crore ($44 million) in bills.=20

"If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine =
the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India," Bakke wrote. "Whil=
e AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like=
 to serve, our determination to continue is being tested." The Prime Office=
 said it was not ready to comment on the report. Officials of the Orissa go=
vernment were not available to respond to Bakke's charges in view of a Hind=
u festival. AES has already offered to withdraw from the distribution compa=
ny -- known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, i=
t has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity=
 generation. If AES decides to pull out completely, it will the third Ameri=
can company to do so. Cogentrix quit a power project in southern India befo=
re it was started, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of withdrawi=
ng from the Dabhol Power Project, India's biggest-ever foreign investment p=
roject, in Maharashtra. On September 14, Enron chairman Kenneth L Lay wrote=
 a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5=
 billion relating to the Dabhol Power dispute and questioned India's abilit=
y to honor its contracts. Lay had also warned that India may find it hard t=
o attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute wi=
