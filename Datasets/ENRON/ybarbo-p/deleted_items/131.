DPC sponsors meet next week for due diligence talks=20
Senior officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three fore=
ign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), will meet in Houst=
on next week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of =
due diligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Pow=
er Company and BSES Ltd. "The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given t=
heir go-ahead for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence =
due diligence. They are scheduled to meet before this month end to decide t=
heir next step regarding Dabhol project," sources close to the sponsors sai=
d here on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or =
deny the development. Sources said that the sponsors' decision would be con=
veyed to the Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian =
lenders by first week of December. "Contradictory to recent announcements b=
y Indian lenders, and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to s=
ign the confidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will after=
 all depend on the three foreign sponsors' approval," they pointed out.
Both Tatas and BSES would need their approval and co-operation to commence =
due diligence, sources emphasised. Tata Power managing director Adi Enginee=
r confirmed that they were yet to commence DPC due diligence. "We are waiti=
ng to sign the confidentiality agreement with DPC sponsors after which Tata=
 Power would take at least a few months to complete the process," Engineer =
said. Sources termed the meet as critical in deciding the future course of =
events in resolving the issues surrounding the $3 billion power project. "E=
nron, GE and Bechtel had raised the issue of continuing costs of fundings d=
uring the three-day marathon Singapore meet, risen as a result of the India=
n and foreign lenders' refusal to disburse additional funds," they informed=
.
The proposed due-diligence was expected to take another two-three months, s=
ources said, adding the situation had become more fragile with the Maharash=
tra State Electricity Board not drawing power since May 29 and lenders stop=
ping disbursements to the 2,814 mw project March onwards. "This has resulte=
d in the beleagured DPC also being unable to meet its loan repayment commit=
ments in September and October," they added. During the Singapore meet, the=
 three foreign sponsors had also expressed their grave concern about bearin=
g additional expenses as the due diligence process would take its own time =
and incur significant costs, only adding to deterioration of assets and the=
ir cost burden, the sources said. On Monday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing=
 director R.V. Shahi had announced that the company was likely to complete =
the due diligence of the Dabhol project by January end next year. Shahi sai=
d that BSES had returned the draft of confidentiality agreement with commen=
ts to DPC. BSES would appoint three separate consultants for doing technica=
l, financial and legal due diligence along with an internal task force to d=
o parallel ground work, he said.( PTI )

BSES inches forward in DPC race=20

BSES has inched a step forward in the race to acquire Enron's stake in Dabh=
ol Power Company. The company, which is one of the bidders for Enron's stak=
e has approached the heads of financial institutions for funding of the pro=
ject after the change in ownership. Irrespective of who the new stake-holde=
r is, they would need the Fis to lend to them to see the completion of the =
project. The heads of institutions are at present considering the BSES requ=
est though a view is yet to be taken on the issue. BSES apart, Tata Power i=
s the other serious contender for the project.

The Fis have been sounding out the both BSES and Tata Power as the governme=
nt feels that buying out the plant could be good proposition if some of the=
 tariff issues are sorted out. R V Shahi, chairman-cum-managing director of=
 BSES said after his meeting Singapore last week that talks were progressin=
g and the company would soon get on with the next stage. BSES, is likely to=
 complete due diligence of the 2,184 MW Dabhol Power project by January end=
 next year. "The due diligence process will take 6-8 weeks after signing of=
 the confidentiality agreement with Enron promoted DPC," BSES CMD R V Shahi=
 told reporters here. Shahi said BSES has returned the draft of confidentia=
lity agreement with comments to DPC. The confidentiality agreement, a pre-r=
equisite for beginning due diligence of DPC to assess the value of its asse=
ts, investments needed to complete the 1,444 MW Phase-II and its liabilitie=
s, would in all probability be signed by the end of this month.BSES would a=
ppoint three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal =
due diligence of the 2.9 billion dollar project, he said, adding that simul=
taneously an internal task force would also be appointed to do parallel gro=
und work. Shahi said the company has shown interest in acquiring 85 per cen=
t stake of Enron, Bechtel and GE in the Dabhol project at the recently conc=
luded Singapore meeting convened by FIs. After signing the confidentiality =
agreement BSES will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loan=

on the acquisition price.

Enron in talks to sell off data centre, Arun Kumar=20

Beleaguered energy major Enron is said to be in negotiations with at least =
two prospective Indian buyers for selling its $18 million Internet Data Cen=
tre (IDC) located at Mumbai. This is the second Indian investment that Enro=
n is looking to exit from. It is already in the midst of a possible selloff=
 of its stake in the controversial Dabhol Power Co. When contacted, an Enro=
n India spokesperson said "as part of our policy we do not discuss this iss=
ue with the media. As you are aware such issues are part of our global stra=
tegy, but we are not desperate to sell".=20

However sources maintained that the company was talking to at least two bid=
ders, one being a leading Mumbai real estate firm, and that talks were curr=
ently hedged on pricing issues. The reason for the selloff move is part of =
Enron's decision to exit from India, the sources added. The move is also be=
ing fuelled by the recent $9.5 billion acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc. =
According to the sources, Enron may sell IDC at below cost. It had invested=
 over $18 million (over Rs 90 crore) to develop the 30,000 sq. ft. data cen=
ter, which caters to a host of new economy firms, including Hungama.com and=
 Gateway System. The sources added Enron had considered roping in a strateg=
ic equity partner for IDC and, since that did not happen, "it has now decid=
ed to exit from this business".=20

Enron India had announced grand plans for setting up a nationwide fiber opt=
ic cable backbone to tap rising demand for bandwidth. After the company aba=
ndoned this plan, speculation was rife that it would divest its data center=
 sooner or later. Analysts said the center is a standalone business globall=
y and Enron was left with no option but to take bandwidth on lease from oth=
ers. This increased the project cost, they observed. The company had origin=
ally planned to set up five more data centers in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai,=
 Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.=20

Enron restates Q3 earnings=20

S embattled Enron examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-=
quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to =
87 cents. The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-mil=
lion obligation that could come due November 27. Enron spokesman Mark Palme=
r said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would lik=
e to have it restructured and extended. "We are working with the lenders to=
 restructure or extend the term on the obligation," he said. Palmer said th=
e obligation could come due because of Enron's lowered credit rating. When =
the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the "limited partne=
rship agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become du=
e beginning next week."=20

Houston-based Enron, which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to escape a r=
ecent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increase=
d nine-month earnings by a cent to 20 cents a share. Dynegy is purchasing t=
he company for $7.8 billion in stock. In a filing with the Securities and E=
xchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen =
LLP hasn't finalised its review of the company's financial statements becau=
se of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's =
board of directors. "We are continuing to review the transactions in questi=
on and are making progress with our investigation," said William K Powers J=
r., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas S=
chool of Law. The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, =
backed by major investor ChevronTexaco, will also assume $13 billion of Enr=
on debt. Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 p=
er cent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an=
 acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigati=
ng partnerships run by company officials. (AP)
