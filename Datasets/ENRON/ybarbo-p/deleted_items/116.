A survival kit for Tata Power, BSES, S Ravindran Mumbai=20

The two domestic power biggies_Tata Power and BSES_are vying for Enron's 65=
 per cent stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in what seems like a crit=
ical battle for survival for both. Tata Power, it appears, has two primary =
reasons to bid for Dabhol Power: one, it gets a ready built plant when all =
its other projects are on paper; two, it also pre-empts arch rival BSES. Th=
is is the more important issue, for if BSES gets DPC, it will stop lifting =
500 mw of power from Tata Power. For the latter, this could be tragic since=
 it cannot possibly find a buyer for the excess power in the vicinity, espe=
cially since the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) says it has eno=
ugh generation capacity of its own.=20

BSES, on the other hand, apart from dealing a severe blow to Tata Power, ma=
y also be able take a relook at several of the other contentious projects o=
n hand. "If BSES were to gain control of the 2,184 mw power project, it wou=
ld source the required 500 mw power from this project and stop buying it fr=
om the Tatas. Already, after BSES set up the 500 mw Dahanu power plant in M=
aharashtra, it has been buying consistently less power from the Tatas," say=
 independent observers in the power industry. But a senior Tata executive d=
efends the company's position. "Our power plants have been built through Wo=
rld Bank funding which has been guaranteed by the Union government. Under t=
hese circumstances, power would have to be evacuated till the loans are rep=
aid. We have time till 2014 when our licence expires," he said. But gaining=
 control of DPC is hardly a simple issue. Urmik Chhaya, power analyst at Ko=
tak Securities says: "Any company which takes over this project will have t=
o raise huge funds. How are they going to do that? The other question is wh=
ere will they sell the power and what will be the payment security mechanis=
m? These are the fundamental questions that will have to be addressed befor=
e any takeover of the project can be contemplated."=20

But Chhaya points out that DPC will be crucial to Tata Power's overall game=
plan. "After next year, how does Tata Power grow its power business?" One e=
stimate has it that anyone wanting to take over the power project will have=
 to pay a minimum of $700 million. "Assuming both companies bid at this res=
erve price, even at an exchange rate of Rs 47.50 to the dollar, they will h=
ave to pay Rs 3,325 crore. This is around 50 per cent of Tata Power's balan=
ce sheet size of Rs 6,465.95 crore and around 75 per cent of BSES's balance=
 sheet size of Rs 4,327.40 crore. How will these two companies raise the mo=
ney?" says an analyst.=20

However, a senior BSES executive points out that the company has a low gear=
ing with a debt-equity ratio of 0.25:1. "Raising Rs 2,000 crore at short no=
tice is no problem at all. After all, what is the use of such a low debt-eq=
uity ratio otherwise," this executive asks. Tata group sources also say tha=
t raising finance is the least of their worries. "We are the country's larg=
est independent power producer with an installed generation capacity of ove=
r 2,000 mw. We can always raise money on the strength of our balance sheet,=
" say Tata group executives. However, a change in management control at DPC=
 will have to be accompanied by a series of legislative changes. First, if =
the new owner is not allowed to sell power outside Maharashtra, the project=
 is unlikely to make any sense for the buyer. Particularly, as the state go=
vernment has made it clear that it can absorb only 740 mw of the proposed 2=
,184 mw installed capacity. This will mean giving the Dabhol project a mega=
-power status. This is far from easy as this will need an amendment by Parl=
iament as the project was not set up through the competitive bidding route =
but through a memorandum of understanding.=20

HC restrains Centre from encashing guarantees=20

In an ad-interim order, Mumbai High Court has restrained the Centre and cus=
toms authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by State Bank of Indi=
a in regard to customs duty payable by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporat=
ion for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in it=
s Dabhol plant. The ex-parte injunction was granted by Justice D G Karnik o=
n November 15 on a petition filed by DPC challenging the showcause notice i=
ssued by customs authorities asking the company to pay Rs 245 crore as impo=
rt duty on the equipment. The Court also restrained the SBI to make payment=
 under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of DPC. The Judge, however=
, allowed DPC to file an appeal before customs, excise and gold appellate t=
ribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order. He also r=
uled that the ex-parte injunction order shall automatically stand vacated f=
rom December 15 subject to the orders that may be passed by the tribunal. M=
eanwhile, the court directed DPC to keep the bank guarantee enforceable.=20

DPC cancels Houston board meet, Sanjay Jog=20

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is yet to recover from=
 the shock following its acquisition by Dynegy last week, has cancelled its=
 board meeting scheduled for November 19. The DPC board, which consists of =
two directors from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and one r=
epresenting the state government, was to meet on Monday at Houston to deleg=
ate necessary powers to the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for =
issuing a final termination notice to the MSEB. The DPC company secretary, =
in a faxed communication, has informed the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal and t=
he state principal energy secretary Vinay Mohan Lal that the board meeting =
slated for Monday has been cancelled until further announcement.=20

Curiously, the DPC communication is silent over the reason for the cancella=
tion of the November 19 meeting. Mr Bansal told The Financial Express on Su=
nday, "I have been intimated by the DPC that November 19 meeting has been c=
ancelled." When contacted, DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal declined to comment. M=
SEB, which holds 30 per cent stakes in the Dabhol phase-I (740 mw) in its l=
etter of November 12 had asked the DPC not to hold a board meeting on Novem=
ber 19 in view of the Mumbai High Court restraining the DPC from issuing a =
final termination notice until further orders. The High Court in its judgem=
ent delivered on November 9 over a civil suit filed by the Indian financial=
 institutions (IFIs) has slated the next hearing on December 3.=20

Analysts said that the DPC's decision to cancel the November 19 meeting was=
 quite expected as the company was aware that the situation in the wake of =
Enron's aquisition by Dynegy was fluid and it would need some time to take =
stock of the situation. Further, the Mumbai High Court's order, which gave =
a much-needed repreive to the MSEB as well as IFIs, came as a major setback=
 to the DPC, which had already served an asset transfer notice to the MSEB =
on December 5. The MSEB had already communicated to the DPC that it would n=
ot be party to the DPC's decision to appoint a valuer after the issuance of=
 asset transfer notice since it has rescinded the power purchase agreement =
on May 29 following a material misrepresentation and default on the availab=
ility of power by DPC. The IFIs had prayed that the issuance of final termi=
nation notice by DPC to MSEB would jeopardise their interest as well as inv=
estments in the "distressed" Dabhol project.=20

The November 19 meeting was also to take up issues related to the asset pre=
servation, the financial position of DPC relating to the phase-I, debt serv=
icing, safeguarding the legal position of its directors and opening of lett=
er of credit for shipping. The DPC board was quite worried especially over =
the upkeep of the Dabhol plant, which has been closed since May 29 when MSE=
B suspended power purchases. The construction contractors have also suspend=
ed construction works on Dabhol phase-II (1,444 mw) from June 17 in view of=
 DPC's inability to make their payments. The DPC board would also have take=
n up the issue relating to the DPC's decision to pull out of the Dabhol pro=
ject. The company, which had decided to sale its stakes at $1.2 billion, re=
cently expressed its desire to reduce it at around $850 million.=20

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, November 19, 2001
Blackout in the power sector, A V Rajwade=20

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well. Clearly, sep=
arating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe it helps priv=
atisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set in Thatcherit=
e Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the experience h=
as not been consistent all over.=20

Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator. Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack su=
ffered from poor management, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, et=
c. Several serious accidents occurred and fixing responsibility became diff=
icult. The "reform" did not work, and Railtrack was put back under public c=
ontrol last month.=20

What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic." Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, =
were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of =
privatisation. CESCO defaulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmissi=
on company, which in turn defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all =
CESCO's cash inflows are now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay sala=
ries. For all practical purposes, the distribution companies seem to be in =
a difficult situation, perhaps beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a tot=
al mess. The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unifi=
ed SEB is less efficient than trifurcated companies _ it is the political u=
nwillingness to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For =
a while, cross subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising t=
he household and the agricultural segments.=20

However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices _ but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, pu=
nish power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is=
 cut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as=
, sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for sub=
stantive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want t=
o get out!=20

Enron too wants out _ but it has many more problems in its home country, ov=
er and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publi=
city for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (=
see World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in E=
nron's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic t=
rading platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversific=
ation in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark=
's exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skil=
ling, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20

To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron. After its ratings were downgraded,=
 Enron is desperate for liquidity and anxious to dispose its assets. DPCL w=
as already on the platter; now a sale has become even more urgent. Reported=
ly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are the lending institutions. Clearly=
, if a settlement is to be reached, this is the optimum time. But one is no=
t very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved, and bureaucr=
acies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decision-making pro=
cesses make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal does take place=
, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It is much safer =
for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and Delhi to allow =
the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", whatever the c=
osts! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian politicians respon=
d to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.
