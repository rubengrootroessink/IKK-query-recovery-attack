Maharashtra cautioned on Dabhol stand-off

THE financial standing of the Maharashtra Government would be certainly imp=
aired if the power purchase agreement (PPA) between Dabhol Power Company an=
d the State Electricity Board is not successfully renegotiated, according t=
o rating agency CARE. Commenting on the State finances while rating a Rs 60=
0-crore bond issue of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporatio=
n (MKVDC), CARE said fiscal reforms assume greater urgency because the cred=
it quality of the State would be impacted if there is a devolution of liabi=
lities guaranteed by it in the PPA. Ballpark estimates place the size of th=
e States' immediate liabilities at Rs 17,000 crore. If the worst case scena=
rio is realised, the Government's liquidity position and financial flexibil=
ity will be acutely impaired.=20

However, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), to which the asset=
s would stand transferred if the State decides to take over the project, wi=
ll have the option of inviting third parties to participate in the venture =
minimising the State's liabilities. A CARE official said even if a third pa=
rty is involved in the project, the State would have to take a sizeable hit=
 on capital employed. He put the loss burden on Maharashtra at around Rs 8,=
000-9,000 crore. CARE said the guarantees given by the Government to its sp=
ecial purpose vehicles' borrowings have risen substantially. The total outs=
tanding liabilities of Maharashtra as a proportion of the net State domesti=
c product have increased to 29.1 per cent (estimated) in 2000-01 from 19 pe=
r cent in 1996- 97.The State's financial position calls for fiscal consolid=
ation through improvement in revenue performance and restructuring of expen=
diture, it said. Meanwhile, the agency has assigned a rating of A+(SO) to t=
he MKVDC issue. The long-term taxable bonds have a bullet payment at the en=
d of 10 years. MKVDC has, so far, raised about Rs 1,100 crores in debt issu=
es. This is the first issue in the current year.

ICRA downgrades MSEB over Dabhol fracas

Rating agency ICRA has downgraded the rating assigned to Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board's (MSEB's) bond programmes aggregating to Rs 2,015 crore,=
 from 'LAA-' (SO) to 'LA+' (SO). The rating has been placed under rating wa=
tch. "The revised rating indicates adequate safety. The rating is based on =
the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Government of Maharashtra (G=
oM)," ICRA said. The revised rating reflects the continued uncertainty on t=
he timing and likely manner of settlement of MSEB's payment dispute with Da=
bhol Power Company (DPC), and its impact on the financial position of MSEB =
and GoM. Though MSEB had stopped making payments to DPC, the latter had bee=
n sending monthly bills to the board. DPC had recently sent the August and =
September bills totalling Rs 209 crore. It had sent the bill arguing that t=
he capacity payments will accrue every month. The downgrade has come at a t=
ime when the High Court decided to hear from December 11 a petition filed b=
y DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Co=
mmission (MERC) to adjudicate its dispute with MSEB. ICRA has revised the r=
ating asigned to the Rs 150 crore non-convertible debenture programme of Ji=
ndal Iron & Steel Company Limited (JISCO) to LA- (SO) from LAA- (SO). The r=
ating has been placed under 'Rating Watch'. The revised rating indicates ad=
equate safety. The rating is based and irrevocable guarantee from IFCI Limi=
ted for payment of principal and interest on the debentures.=20

'SCI can invest more in Greenfield', P. Manoj=20

THE Shipping Ministry has no reservations on Shipping Corporation of India =
(SCI) investing another $11 million as its share to bridge the $55-million =
gap in the project cost of Greenfield Shipping Company. With less than a mo=
nth left to take possession of the LNG tanker on the scheduled delivery dat=
e of November 15, the board of SCI has not been able to take a final view o=
n sinking a further $11 million in proportion to its equity holding of 20 p=
er cent in the joint venture consortium. Professional members on the board =
of SCI are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the company manage=
ment on investing an extra $11 million and save the project from going into=
 payment default..

These members have counter-argued that the project has turned unviable due =
to the uncertainty surrounding the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), making the p=
rospect of earning the original charter hire rate of $98,600 per day look b=
leak. The Shipping Ministry, which controls the SCI, feels that the State-o=
wned company has no other option but to invest the additional amount of $11=
 million and bail out the tanker from the clutches of the lenders. ``The SC=
I has two worst choices before it. One is to pump in another $11 million to=
 save the project from going into default and earn a return of 4 to 5 per c=
ent. The second option is to refuse further investment and earn no returns =
at all besides running the risk of losing its equity investment of $11 mill=
ion. The SCI will have to make the best of the two worst choices,'' Governm=
ent sources told Business Line.=20

While the SCI will not invest the extra $11 million immediately, it is plan=
ning to issue a letter of comfort to Mitsui O.S.K.Lines, the lead partner i=
n the consortium, stating that it was prepared to accept the liability in f=
uture. This will pave the way for Mitsui to put in the entire $55 million t=
o bridge the gap in project cost and proceed with taking delivery of the LN=
G carrier. The amount given by Mitsui towards the share of the other two pa=
rtners totalling $22 million ($11 million each for SCI and Atlantic Commerc=
ial Inc) will be in the form of a loan. In future, this amount will have to=
 be reimbursed to Mitsui with interest. The Shipping Ministry feels that al=
lowing bankers to confiscate the LNG vessel due to non-payment of the last =
tranche of project cost of $55 million would render SCI's equity investment=
 of $11 million infructuous. On confiscation of the vessel, the bankers wou=
ld immediately go about selling the vessel for recovering its investment of=
 $110 million alongwith interest which otherwise would have been paid by th=
e promoters over a period of time. ``Significantly, when you approach the m=
arket for selling a confiscated vessel, you won't even get the prevailing m=
arket price and would have to go for a distress sale,'' the sources said.=
=20

So, for an LNG tanker ordered for $220 million, the bankers would not be ab=
le to realise even the prevailing price for new buildings which is hovering=
 at around $160 to $170 million. Consequently, the bankers will recover the=
ir loan liability of $110 million with interest but the balance would be in=
sufficient for the three promoters to recoup their equity investment in ful=
l. ``Given this scenario, there is no point in looking at whether the extra=
 investment of the SCI would fetch the mandatory 12 per cent internal rate =
of return as stipulated by the Government for projects involving State-fund=
ing,'' the sources said. After providing $110 million for the project out o=
f a total loan commitment of $165 million, the bankers led by ANZ Investmen=
t Bank had suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, d=
eclaring an event of default due to the controversy surrounding the project=
. The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company can now take possession of t=
he tanker only on paying the remaining $55 million. The tanker is being bui=
lt to ferry LNG from Oman to DPC.=20

Deshmukh Govt. completes a difficult two years, Mahesh Vijapurkar=20

To the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, two years of runn=
ing an eight-party coalition, despite a numerically strong over-anxious Opp=
osition snipping at his heels, is in itself an achievement. The arrangement=
, in which the Congress(I) and the NCP are major partners, completes two ye=
ars in office today. The key constituents of the Democratic Front (DF) had =
actually begun to show strains of running a coalition. At one point, the NC=
P, despite its mature leadership, dissociated itself from a Cabinet decisio=
n on the sensitive issue of setting up a probe against the Enron deal. To i=
t, the timing was inappropriate. The Congress(I) couldn't hide its glee at =
the Government's discomfiture.=20

The Congress(I) too is not averse to backing out from decisions. It agreed =
to the move to reconsider enforcing higher rates for water - irrigation, dr=
inking, industrial and when water is a raw material, as in mineral water pr=
oduction - at the coordination committee meeting of all ruling parties, bec=
ause of pressure from within and from the NCP. The NCP and the Congress(I) =
are aware of the limitations of coalition politics and would like to be in =
the driver's seat. The two have often said it was their duty to form a part=
nership to keep the BJP-Shiv Sena out of power. Or else, the State would ha=
ve seen the saffron parties consolidate. Battling such odds is tough for al=
l players, each with its own agenda on which they are unwilling to compromi=
se. The Opposition scorns at the Government. Says Mr. Gopinath Munde, BJP l=
eader: ``How can a Government backtrack on decisions like these? Can such a=
 Government be considered credible? I think it is all in poor taste. Disown=
ing collective responsibility is unconstitutional. I am saddened at this si=
tuation. This is no Government.''=20

Mr. Deshmukh says the Government is trying to limit the damage done to the =
State's finances by the predecessor dispensation of the BJP and the Shiv Se=
na. Once it became known that the Government was almost bankrupt, investmen=
t arrivals ceased. There has been no major investment for two years. To its=
 credit, the Government has taken some brave decisions in two years: not pa=
ying bonus to Government employees whose salary accounts for Rs. 1,300 cror=
es, cutting DA, banning the SIMI despite a coalition partner's objections a=
nd not budging when Enron rattled its sabre and, in fact, ceasing to buy po=
wer from it. But, unfortunately, it is the inter-party rivalry that draws t=
he attention of the newspapers.
