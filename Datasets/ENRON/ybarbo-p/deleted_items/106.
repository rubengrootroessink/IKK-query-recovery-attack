BSES moves ministry over Enron's stake in DPC, S Ravindran=20

After a series of flip flops, power major BSES has formally communicated to=
 the Union government that it is interested in buying out Enron's stake in =
the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). It has, however, added the now-familiar rid=
er that the capital cost of the project should be brought down. BSES chairm=
an and managing director R V Shahi said, "We have formally told the ministr=
ies of power, finance and financial institutions Industrial Development Ban=
k of India, ICICI and the State Bank of India that we are interested in the=
 project. The communication was despatched last Saturday." Shahi also said =
that a financial re-engineering of the $3 billion, 2,184-mw power project w=
as necessary so that the cost of power was affordable.=20

Analysts, however, queried the seriousness of BSES's intentions in view of =
the various conflicting statements made earlier by Shahi. He has made publi=
c statements that the company is interested in the project but has denied t=
hem in communications to the Bombay Stock Exchange. Sources familiar with a=
n earlier round of discussions with Enron say that BSES had offered to buy =
the equity at a 90 per cent discount. This would have meant BSES paying onl=
y around $120 million for the 85 per cent stake that Enron and its two US p=
artners -- General Electric and Bechtel -- hold in the company. The three p=
artners have so far invested around $1.2 billion in the project. Tata Power=
 managing director Adi J Engineer insisted that the company was still inter=
ested in the Dabhol project. "We have not held any serious discussions on t=
he issue in the last fortnight but discussions will resume shortly. There i=
s no roadblock and the final outcome will depend upon the sacrifices willin=
g to be made by all the stokeholders in the project," he said. Engineer ref=
used to divulge further details. The lenders to the project have mooted a t=
hree-pronged formula for the sale of power from the Dabhol power project. T=
he entire power from the 740-mw first phase of the project should be bought=
 by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Half the power from the 1,444-=
mw second phase will be bought by the central government utility, National =
Thermal Power Corporation, while the other half will be sold within Maharah=
stra for which a dedicated region will be allotted to Tata Power.=20

Maha to challenge London court order on DPC

THE MAHARASHTRA government has decided to challenge the injunction order is=
sued by the commercial court in London restraining the state from filing su=
its against the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in India. The DPC had obtained t=
he injunction on October11. "The state government has decided to challenge =
the order as we feel that the concerned court should have heard the state a=
s well. Within a week we would be presenting our case," the state chief min=
ister Vilasrao Deshmukh said here on Wednesday. The ex-parte order relates =
to arbitration proceedings between the state government and DPC with respec=
t to state guarantee, state support and supplemental state support agreemen=
ts. It prevented the state government from taking any legal action in India=
, challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. M=
r Deshmukh today also reiterated his government's resolve not to draw elect=
ricity from DPC. "There is no logic in buying DPC power at higher rate and =
selling it with much lower rates," Deshmukh said. According to Deshmukh, du=
e to recent rainfall, the demand for electricity has gone down considerably=
 and the state electricity board is supplying power without interruption. M=
eanwhile, the government today expressed its resolve to initiate a judicial=
 probe into the entire Enron deal. "The probe would begin in few weeks ," D=
eshmukh said. The state has already requested the Chief Justice of the Mumb=
ai High Court to appoint a judge for the probe.=20

GAIL keen on Dabhol LNG terminal project, Balaji C. Mouli=20

GAS Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) has written to both the Petroleum Ministr=
y and the Power Ministry evincing interest in the 5 million tonnes per annu=
m (mmtpa) LNG regassification terminal of the Dabhol Power Company, accordi=
ng to Government officials. In a recent communique to the two Ministries, i=
t has asked the financial institutions to set up a meeting to enable it rev=
iew the financial details of the LNG project. The financial data on the LNG=
 project solely rests with Bechtel, GE and Enron.As a first step towards ex=
amining the financial data, GAIL will require to enter into a confidentiali=
ty clause agreement with the present project sponsors to access the data.

Meanwhile, the financial institutions are awaiting the results of political=
 parleys between the Centre and the Maharashtra Government towards bringing=
 the latter into a `solution finding' mode to implement a financial restruc=
turing package and resolve the Dabhol crisis. Once this is done, the FIs wi=
ll freeze the financial package - involving sacrifices undertaken by the pr=
esent stakeholders - and again elicit market response towards bettering the=
 Tatas' proposition. Although the FIs had earlier scouted the market and fo=
und only the Tatas evincing interest in the project, it would again offer t=
he Dabhol project to the market to ensure that the concessions on the part =
of the State are not awarded on a nomination basis.The foreign lenders have=
 pointed out that they would not be agreeable to the domestic FIs spearhead=
ing the salvage operation finally resulting in transfer of ownership of the=
 power plant. Hence, the Government is mulling a high-level committee to im=
plement the process leading to transfer of ownership.=20

NCP to be blamed (Letters to the Editor)

Sir, - Mr. Prem Shankar Jha's article `Dabhol and the do nothing Government=
' (Oct. 16) is interesting. The blame for the present situation should squa=
rely rest on the NCP Government in Maharashtra. The Congress, to square poi=
nts with Mr. Pawar, has created problems in implementing the second phase. =
With 90 per cent work complete, it is not in the national interest to give =
it up at this stage. It is time the Prime Minister devoted some attention t=
o resolving the issue. The Centre should ask the NTPC to take over the resp=
onsibility of running this unit by providing financial help. The Government=
 should sit with the DPC and settle for a final takeover and finish the wor=
k and start generating power.=20

Govt rejects Coke's plea on waiving IPO=20

Government said today that it would not accede to Coca-Cola's request for e=
xemption from mandatory divestment of equity, as this would be tantamount t=
o 'favouritism'. "It (the agreement signed between Coca-Cola and the govern=
ment of India at the time of company's entry) won't be changed. They wanted=
 it to be changed, but this can't be for a particular company. It will amou=
nt to favouritism," Commerce and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran told repo=
rters here.Replying to a query at the Annual Economic Editors' Conference o=
n whether government could reconsider Coca-Cola's proposal, he said "MoU no=
rms are the same for everybody. These cannot be changed for one single comp=
any.

Mr Maran also dismissed dispute surrounding Enron's Dabhol Power project as=
 isolated, saying such cases were unlikely to affect Foreign Direct Investm=
ent inflows into India. "Enron is only an isolated incident... There are ma=
ny success stories on FDI front," Mr Maran said, adding even the Enron issu=
e was not closed and negotiations were on to resolve the crisis. He said En=
ron's Dabhol Power Project was financed by domestic institutions to the ext=
ent of up to 80 per cent and this was a matter of concern for the country. =
Government is yet to communicate its decision on the Coke's request for wai=
ver of 49 per cent disinvestment from it Indian holding or alternatively a =
five year moratorium till July, 2007.
=20
Asked about reports that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had =
allowed a moratorium, Industry Secretary Govindrajan told PTI "we have not =
communicated any decision to the company so far." Coke has cited mounting l=
osses, which have wiped out its networth by a whopping 66 per cent on Rs 3,=
200 crore investment since 1993 in Indian operations, as the main reason fo=
r seeking disinvestment waiver.Company officials had earlier claimed that t=
he Indian venture would strive to break even during the current financial y=
ear with Rs 4,000 crore turnover target but will take some more time to wip=
e out the accumulated losses. A 66 per cent erosion in networth means deval=
uation in the book value of Coke's 10-rupee share by the same proportion, a=
 situation unacceptable for a company which claims numero uno position in t=
he Indian soft drinks market.
