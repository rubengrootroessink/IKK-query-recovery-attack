Subject: EcoElectrica =02=05 Conditions of Use


Per Gene Massey's request following up this morning's telephone conversatio=
n=20
with Dan, I attach a discussion draft of a matrix summarizing the coverage=
=20
(as to risks/obligations/liabilities) of the draft Conditions of Use in=20
relation to coverage under law in the absence of the Conditions of Use=20
document.  We understand that this matrix will be the basis of a telephone=
=20
discussion on these issues.
