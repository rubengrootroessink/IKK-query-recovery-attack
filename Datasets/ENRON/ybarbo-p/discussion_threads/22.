Todd - I have some questions on the COU.

   Is there a relevant "Port Authority" at the EcoElectrica terminal?  If not,
   why is this contained in the document?
   In Section 2.1, is there an Attachment "A"?
   Do the LNG Interests have an Emergency Response Plan?  Does this Plan have
   references to actions required in 7.1?
   Do the insurance requirements of the "vessel interests" duplicate or 
override
   what is required of Cabot LNG in Section 6.2 of the sales contract?  Should
   the LNG interests provide same insurance documentation?
   Ditto Section 12

These are my simple questions not intended to begin a negotiation.  I am only
trying to gather all information.  Please call me for other comments.

Jane
