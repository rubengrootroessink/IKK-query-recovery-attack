Brad-
I put together this schedule of dates for delivery windows at Lake Charles 
assuming that the Oman lifting dates were already set.  I split the round 
trip time between Oman load dates to get to the desired CMS window.  If there 
are no delays, it should normally take about 25 days one way from the first 
day of the Oman window based on 1.5 days to load, 1.5 days at Suez, and 22 
days transit (9,210 miles at 17.5 mph).  Splitting the round trip time gives 
us a little leeway in case of delays.

 Oman Window  Desired CMS Window
 May 12-14  June 8-10
 July 5-7   July 30 - Aug 1
 Aug 25-27  Sept 19-21
 Oct 14-16  Nov 8-10
 Dec 4-6   Dec 29-31

If the May lifting is the first cargo put on board the Hoegh Galleon, we need 
to add an extra day for cool down.  If the March 18-20 window is the first 
one, we would want to split the time there for a CMS window of April 14-16, 
which is the window we already have.
