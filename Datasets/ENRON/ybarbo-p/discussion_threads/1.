Gentlemen,

As our March cargo has been diverted to Lake Charles I do not see the need 
for a conference call today. I will nominate tentative date for April and May 
which we can revise next month. As an  indication I will nominate the 1-5 
April followed by another cargo 35-40 days later. These dates are consistent 
with the current planned outage and a dispatch rate of between 76% and 85%. 
If anybody has and any questions or comments please let me know.

TP
