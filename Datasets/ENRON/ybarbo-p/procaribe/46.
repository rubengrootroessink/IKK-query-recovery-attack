Is 3 cents enough,  I think 25% for brokering a deal is too much

Pdvsa just revert with their comments and economies.  There is a difference of
0.9 usc/gallon.  Main reason for this is that they have to use a vessel of only 8,500 MT
 in order to be able to use it for the LPG distribution in Venezuela as well.
 We are going to have a meeting next monday July 2nd to discuss the proposal.
With  their numbers Enron still could receive about 4 usc/g ( 3 for ProCaribe).

Regards,

William Mauc?

Thanks for your comments.  I was just waiting on your approval to send the 
    information to Pdvsa ( without the proposal ), in order to reach with them
    an agreement on the incentives before proceeding with the negotiation.
    Eventhough I discussed with Paul these numbers I will contact him again
    to make sure he doesn?t have any further comments.

   I keep you posted,
   Regards,

   William Andr?s Mauc?

Well done and good luck.  When is your meeting?  Federico will you forward a copy of the Poten LPG study.  

William I do not know if you have read about the commitment PDVSA and the government have made to work together on energy issues but the President of the company was in PR last week and perhaps this could be spun into a good public relations move for PR and PDVSA.  In addition you should mention the amount of LPG that came from Africa into this terminal last year and that this deal could reduce the risk of this happening in the future.   Paul has this information.  

Thanks GSVC

Greg and Paul, please find attached a draft of the material to be use 
   in the meeting with Pdvsa.   The main variation of these numbers 
   with the latest Paul?s spreadsheet, are the Vessels Cost per day ,which
   I have adjusted according to the market indications given to one
   of the ship brokers being used by Pdvsa ( Marino Shipping Routes C.A).
    
   There are some information still missing about the terminals , which I appreciate
    that you find for me.

    I have agreed with Pdvsa to exchange all the information (without any Proposal)
    and once we have an agreement on the numbers ,then we will proceed with
    the negotiation of the proposal.
    
    Please review and reply to proceed accordingly.


   Regards,
