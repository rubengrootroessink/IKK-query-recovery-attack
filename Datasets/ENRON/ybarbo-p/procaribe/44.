Contractually: On the positive side, Section 7.3.1.1 says that "EcoElectric=
a and Terminal Operator shall use reasonable efforts to integrate Terminal =
Operator's then committed LPG purchases and supply arrangements into EcoEle=
ctrica's overall LPG purchase and supply program". However, Eco's borrowing=
 rights under Section 7.3.2.4 could give ProCaribe its biggest problem. Eco=
 can drawdown ProCaribe's inventories to 3250 MT as long as there is a vess=
el loading or en route with at least 8,000 MT of LPG for EcoElectrica. If t=
he cargo takes 14 days to arrive, ProCaribe's needs would be 6,300 MT durin=
g those 14 days. We need to have a provision in our deal with PDVSA that gi=
ves ProCaribe the option to receive 4,000 - 5,000 MT on short notice if Eco=
 declares a Second Period Supply Disruption.
=20
Mechanically: I cannot think of any reasons why ProCaribe would be unable t=
o supply both EcoElectrica and all of Puerto Rico's LPG distributors. The d=
ifference between what we are hoping for under the PDVSA agreement and what=
 ProCaribe was doing last year is the loading of an additional 175,000 gall=
ons (335 MT) per day into trucks. That would be an additional 16 trucks per=
 day. If EcoElectrica was at 100% output, they would be consuming 1900 MT p=
er day and the rest of the island would be using 450 MT per day. As long as=
 your heaters can warm-up a total of 2500 MT per day, you should be in the =
clear.
=20
Inventory Requirements: EcoElectrica, today, is at risk if there is an exte=
nded disruption in its LNG supply. That risk will be there, regardless of w=
hether or not ProCaribe does the PDVSA deal. Eco must keep a minimum supply=
 of 15 days of fuel on site. Typically, an LNG ship arrives when there is 6=
 days of LNG in the tank. That means that Eco must have 9 days of LPG and/o=
r diesel. As of August 31st, Eco had 5 days of LPG (9250 MT) and 4 days of =
diesel (2,800,000 gallons) on-site. If Eco were suddenly faced with a disru=
ption in LNG supply, Eco would call PDVSA for LPG and both Coastal and Amer=
ada Hess for diesel. Depending on availability, purchases would be made fro=
m those 3 suppliers to relieve the crisis. In the past, it has been much ea=
sier to arrange a short-notice diesel purchase than an LPG purchase. If nec=
essary, a larger LPG purchase could be arranged from Africa or the North Se=
a. Expect an advance notice of at least 35 days. Again, Eco has this risk e=
ven under today's operations.
=20
Logistics: I do not see the PDVSA deal as a negative factor from the logist=
ics point of view. PDVSA asks for fewer days of advance notice and seems to=
 be more flexible. If Eco were in a position of having to bring in large ca=
rgoes of LPG from across the Atlantic, the PDVSA deal may actually make the=
 logistics easier if PDVSA would be flexible in their deliveries.

Subject: Technical limitations with Eco LPG


Are there ANY technical limitations imposed by a potential sudden need to u=
se LPG at Eco that would get in the way of performance under the proposed P=
DVSA agreement?  What are the conditions that Eco would have to face for Pr=
ocaribe to experience storage or receiving constraints resulting from havin=
g to meet both Eco's and PDVSA's needs?
Thanks
