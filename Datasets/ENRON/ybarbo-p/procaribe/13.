Paul, we are done as per your proposal below.  We will invoice the full volume in four parcels, as follows:

2,600 MT @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)

2,800 MT @ 58.125 cents  (This will be a provisional invoice and will be adjusted to reflect Average June Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.25 cents per gallon)

2,900 MT @ 58.125 cents (This will be a provisional invoice and will adjusted to reflect Average July Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.00 cents per gallon)

1,768 MT @ 58.125 cents (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon  ($0.51125 + $0.07 = $0.58125))

Please confirm your agreement to the above by return.

Best regards,
Suzanne Clapp
