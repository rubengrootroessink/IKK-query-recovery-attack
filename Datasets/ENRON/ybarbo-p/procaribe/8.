To clarify the 15-day supply with Progas:  this is inventory that, for the most part, is already at Progas.  If there was any shortage, most likely it would be discounted from the purchase price, so no additional product would need to be delivered.

Paul

Progas pays for the 15 days.  
I assume that premium 1 means a penny and premium 2 means 2 pennies.  Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?

Miguel

How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.  Where are you on your investigation of making Procaribe and Eco free trade zones.  This should help you with your cash flow and transhipments since you do not pay taxes until you pay the taxes until you sell the product in PR.  Do you know how long it takes to do this?

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Paul

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the payment terms?  How are you with cash?

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco		1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas 	   210,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl?ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per month:
