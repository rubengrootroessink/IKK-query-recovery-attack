Greg,

Your assumption is not correct. The purchase contract calls for ProCaribe to pay the 3-day average Mont Belvieu around the bill of lading date plus 7 cents per gallon. Most likely that will be May 17, 18, and 21. I am proposing that the price formula be changed such that a % of the cargo will be a Fixed Price, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for May, another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for June, and another % will be based on average of the month Mont Belvieu for July.

Since the forward curve increases between May and July, you should expect that if your May volume is priced at avg. of May plus 7 cents, then the June volume will be priced at the average of June plus something less than 7 cents, and the July volume will be priced at average of July plus something also less than 7 cents.

I am sending a seperate e-mail regarding the current status of the pricing of this cargo.

Paul

Paul

Progas pays for the 15 days.  
I assume that premium 1 means a penny and premium 2 means 2 pennies.  Have you gone out to the market to check if you can get a better deal?  This means we are paying MB +9 in July.  Do you think we should expose ourselves to a bit of risk or cover ourselves?

Miguel

How long until you have the $800K to pay it ?  Is it 10 days or 30.  If it is not long then we should be able to delay payment by a few days.  Where are you on your investigation of making Procaribe and Eco free trade zones.  This should help you with your cash flow and transhipments since you do not pay taxes until you pay the taxes until you sell the product in PR.  Do you know how long it takes to do this?

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent and $164M of property tax.

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Paul

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the payment terms?  How are you with cash?
