William,

The attached spreadsheet contains an analysis that I did on the freight cost associated with delivering LPG from Venezuela to Empire versus delivering it to ProCaribe. The numbers could use some refining but show approximately a $30/MT cost difference for PDVSA. See the page titled "Transport". Let's discuss ASAP. I am at x-55855.
