On Friday, May 18th, 2001 Mr. Johnny Fern?ndez, Esq. Executive Director of Codezol (Foreign Trade Zone #163 at Ponce) invited us to a meeting.  Also present was Mr. Edmundo Rodr?guez, President and CEO of Nestor Reyes, Inc. which is the biggest customs broker in Puerto Rico and are also very much involved in developing sub zones for the foreign trade zones.  Mr. Fern?ndez highly recommends the use of the office of Nestor Reyes, Inc. because of their experience in these matters.  

The following law offices have contacted us:

According to Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez, Mr. Miller is the most experience lawyer in the field of foreign trade zones with 31 years of experience.  He has many customers in Puerto Rico,  knows Puerto Rico, and is a frequent traveller to the Island.  He will send a brochure about his company.

	Phone (203) 967-4140 Fax (203) 325-3056
	Mike Mitri, Esq.
	Bill Phelan, Esq.

These were the lawyers that helped Peerless get their sub zone.   According to Mr. Mitri they will charge ProCaribe between $60,000 to $65,000 for their services.  They will send us information regarding their office.

Mr. Fern?ndez and Mr. Rodr?guez recommends two sub zones one for ProCaribe and another for EcoEl?ctrica instead of one mainly because the different type of businesses.  We need a "story" that should be strong enough to convince the U.S. Customs in approving the sub zones.  When I mention ProCaribe's re-export capabilities, they both understand that we have a good "story".  They recommend Marshall Miller, Esq. to help us with our "story".  EcoEl?ctrica needs to put together a "story", and someone from their group should start to get involve in the fact finding like I am doing for ProCaribe.
