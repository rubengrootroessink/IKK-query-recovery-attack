Elio,

Looking at the 11,800 MT case of Puerto Rico versus the Mediterranean:

The numbers below indicate a $20/MT difference in freight versus the $7.50/MT difference that I mentioned earlier.

If Med. prices are $215/MT and Mont Belvieu is $0.39/gal., then a Puerto Rico delivery would look like either of the following two cases:

1.	($215 + $20)/521 = $0.451 per gallon or MB plus 6.1 cents ,i.e., 0.9 cents/gallon savings vs PDVSA

or 

2.	($215 + $7.5)/521 = $0.427 per gallon or MB plus 3.7 cents ,i.e., 3.3 cents/gallon savings vs PDVSA

There would be additional savings of 0.25 cents to 0.50 cents per gallon for both of the cases above if a West Africa supplier would do a fixed price deal and thus we would avoid going through Lee's Bid-Ask spread.  

Tomorrow we should refresh the Med. price and the MB price and get Bo to get a more exact freight differential. Then we can recalculate the numbers and see if this is worth pursuing.

Paul, in comparing freight rates for Med vs Caribs and Caribs vs Caribs (cargo size), I do see Bo's point.  

For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.:
	$50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and 
 	$60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs

however,

the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows:
	$30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and
	$40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs

So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to 
Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00.

Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better.

Let me know your thoughts.

Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.  I would hesitate to purchase from an alternative source lest they back off on other negotiations.

Best regards,
Suzanne
