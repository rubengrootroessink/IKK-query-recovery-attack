Suzanne,

Based on price quotes that I received today from Lee Jackson, please advise if you can modify the pricing of the latest cargo as follows:


Current:		 2,600 MT (1,354,600 gallons)    @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)

		Remainder of Cargo	@ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon  ($0.51125 + $0.07 = $0.58125)



Proposed:	2,600 MT (1,354,600 gallons)    @ 58.625 cents + (Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading minus Average Mont Belvieu for May 17, 18, 21)

		2,800 MT (1,458,800 gallons)    @ Average June Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.25 cents per gallon

		2,900 MT (1,510,900 gallons)    @ Average July Non-TET Mont Belvieu plus 6.00 cents per gallon

		Remainder of Cargo	@ Average Mont Belvieu for 3 days around bill of lading plus 7 cents per gallon  ($0.51125 + $0.07 = $0.58125)




Note:  Bill of Lading date was May 17, 2001

Basis:		521 Gallons/MT



Thanks,


Paul
