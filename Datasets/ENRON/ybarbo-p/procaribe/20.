Greg,

Please call me regarding this note. I just want to be sure that everyone is in agreement. Javier feels that EGM promised EGA a 5-cent margin on LPG sales to Humberto. The lower cost LPG therefore benefits the Progasco Sales Transaction & EGM rather than ProCaribe & EGA. Your thoughts???

Gentlemen,

It seems to me that the price should be MB plus $0.12 for every month. The last cargo purchase saw a value gain for ProCaribe through optimization of the pricing structure by using price swaps. The prices below transfer that value gain away from ProCaribe. I cannot tell if the value is being transferred to the Progasco sale or to Tropigas. Comments???

In order to provide Humberto the short term supply we have been talking about for a while, and to secure a 5-cent margin for Procaribe as agreed to with Mariella, we will sell him the product with the following terms:

Term:	4 months @ 1MM gal/mo.
Start Date:  On closing of Progasco sale (June)

Pricing: (depending on month of delivery)
	June		MB + 11.25
	July		MB + 11.00
	August		MB + 12.00
	September	MB + 12.00
	October		MB + 12.00

Miguel has a model contract approved by Coralina with the rest of the standard terms.  I suggest we send it to Humberto so he is ready to go by closing.
