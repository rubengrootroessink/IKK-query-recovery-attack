Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference 
between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity 
Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs 
$4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 
NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto 
Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. 
There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco 
if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. 
Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we 
can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the 
Early Spring Cargo.
