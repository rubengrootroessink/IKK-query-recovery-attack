If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the
