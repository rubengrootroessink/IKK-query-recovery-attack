Sempra discussed this with Michelle Lokay and she indicated that it was OK. We will initial the revised contract and deliver to you today.

Thanks,

Sempra sent back K# 27342 (30,000/d Ignacio to Blanco) and had added a footnote about alternate points at Max Rate inside and outside the path (which I forwarded to you).  This has not been activated as I'm waiting for you to approve/disapprove their change.
