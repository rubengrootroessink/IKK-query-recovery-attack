Subject: Re: COU Answers  

I suggest that you use this note in your response to Jane and that it really 
is not necessary to discuss further with Gene at this point BUT do not send 
the note as is. FYI -  On the subrogation issue I have sent you the language 
from the Malaysia COU where the relief from subrogation was amended to be 
reciprocal at the insistance of the Malaysians. So we have accepted this 
concept in other COUs. See note where Mike says that he assumes we would be 
o.k. with this kind of change except that the clause talks about an incident.
