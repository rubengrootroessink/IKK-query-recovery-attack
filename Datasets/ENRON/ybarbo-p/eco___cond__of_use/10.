Thanks Todd.  This is obviously an important document and I want to get 
something  in place asap---preferably before the next cargo of LNG.  Each 
cargo that comes in without this document in place weakens our position and 
increases our exposure if there is a problem while the ship is in port.

Subject: Cabot - COU

Gerg,

As you know, I have been insisting with Jane Michalek about the Conditions Of 
Use agreement for some time. For one reason or another they have been putting 
it off. Today they told me that they want to do the agreement jointly with 
us, the operators of the 'Matthew' and Weismuller the tug company. She also 
informed me that they are in the process of finalizing those contracts and 
should be forwarding them to Baker & Mckinnsey next week. After that they 
will be in a position to sit down with us and negotiate a COU. Also, I heard 
from them and my contacts inside Tractabel that they should close thier deal 
some time next week.

BR/TP
