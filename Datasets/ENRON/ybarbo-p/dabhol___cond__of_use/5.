Attached please find a copy of the COU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project.  Please remember that this document is custom-tuned to match-up with the liability, risk and insurance allocation mechanism set out in the MetGas LNG SPA.  This document would probably be a good starting point for the COU to be used under the Oman LNG SPA and the AdGas LNG SPA; however it will need to be coordinated with those documents and ultimately agreed by Greenfield's Marine P&I insurers.   We used Philip Weems of King & Spalding for outside legal assistance on this document (he has very valuable experience on these issues and documents) and recommend for the sake of efficiency and cost savings that we do so on any Dabhol Port COU as well. 

Kind regards,
Dan
