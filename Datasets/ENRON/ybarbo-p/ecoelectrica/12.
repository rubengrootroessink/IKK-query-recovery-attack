Wayne,

Everything looks good economically and contractually on this (I'll provide an update in another e-mail).

Touchy Area:  Rick Sierra suggests that we get Mariella Mahan's support on this and that we fully disclose the economics to her. Rick says that she will not move unless she fully understands who is making the $$$'s and why they are extracting those amounts. I think that our position is defensible. Who else could provide the replacement fuel at a lower price? Rick feels that she will be reasonable as long as Eco is treated fairly. We always have "Let's do what's best for Enron". 

Shall I initiate a discussion with Mariella?
