Jaime,

Seems like this could be a good deal for Eco. The pricing seems reasonable to me given the fact that Peerless will have money tied up on inventory that we will seldom use.

Questions:

1. what is the going rate for leasing tank capacity in the area?

2. will Peerless be storing No.2 (that meets our quality specs) in tanks in addition to Eco's? Do they plan to transfer diesel back and forth between those tanks? If so, how do we control quality?

3. how much Minimum Inventory will Peerless agree to? The more the better for Eco.


Note: The Platt's Index is Low Sulfur No.2 U.S. Gulf Coast - Waterborne

Dan - comments?

Paul

Dear Jamie,
 
I am attaching (as MS Word and as Lotus Wordpro) the  "Letter-Proposal" which Ed Maciula and I had promised to send you  after the meeting of Thursday, May 17. This same "letter-Proposal" is also being  mailed (the U.S. Postal Service type!) to you.
 
After you have had a chance to review it, please give Ed  or me a call so that either of us could offer clarifications (if  necessary), or, at least, see how we all might wish to proceed.
 
Thanks very much, again, for the meeting ...
Best regards,
 
AZMAT
