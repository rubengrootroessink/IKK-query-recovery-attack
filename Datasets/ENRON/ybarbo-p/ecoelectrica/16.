Dear Jamie,
 
I am attaching (as MS Word and as Lotus Wordpro) the  "Letter-Proposal" which Ed Maciula and I had promised to send you  after the meeting of Thursday, May 17. This same "letter-Proposal" is also being  mailed (the U.S. Postal Service type!) to you.
 
After you have had a chance to review it, please give Ed  or me a call so that either of us could offer clarifications (if  necessary), or, at least, see how we all might wish to proceed.
 
Thanks very much, again, for the meeting ...
Best regards,
 
AZMAT
