Subject:	Language for Notice to Cabot on Winter Cargo

This is the language that has been approved for the notice we would give to Cabot if we decide to notify them about replacing the Winter Cargo:

	Persuant to clause 12.3(b)(iv) of the LNG contract, EcoElectrica
	hereby gives notice to Cabot that it has the opportunity to secure
	replacement fuel for the 2002 Winter Cargo.

	If EcoElectrica does not receive, within the 10-day period allowed, a
	release by Cabot LNG of all rights it has under Section 12.3 not to deliver
	the 2002 Winter Cargo, that cargo shall be deleted from the ACQ and the
	other adjustments made as provided in Section 12.3(iv).

	Pursuant to Article 18, please acknowledge receipt of this notice.

Did the EXCOM group give approval to give the notice?  If so, we need to get together to discuss what to do next.

Dan
