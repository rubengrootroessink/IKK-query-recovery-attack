Dan

Further to your email of March 13th.
We are still awaiting a 90 day schedule from ALNG.

However, our immediate plans are as follows:
Methane Arctic into Penuelas on or about April 2nd
Matthew size cargo into Penuelas on or about April 26th

As soon as we receive the 90 day schedule from ALNG, we will respond to you.

best regards
Chris
