Dan/Paul:  In regards to the cargo into the Eco terminal on 26 April we have
chartered the LNGC Golar Freeze  Lloyds Number 7361922, for this delivery.  
The
Golar Freeze is 125,000 M3 Moss Rosenberg (Sphercial) design ship built in 
1977,
and operated by Osprey Maritime.  She frequently calls in the U.S. Gulf at 
Lake
Charles.  Her Air Draft does not allow the ship to call at Boston.

Some vessel specifics:

LOA           278.4  Meters
Beam          43.5  Meters
Draft             10.5 - 11 Meters
Class         DNV
DWT         66,200
Five Cargo tanks with ten cargo pumps
16 Inch liquid and vapor connections
Parallel Mid-body fwd from manifold c/l of vapor line = 38.9 meters

Ships side to manifold flange face = 3.5 meters
Manifold height above ballast draught = 15 meters
Distance between manifold connection c/l's = 2.52 meters

I will provide you both with further information in regards to the ESD
connection soonest, but I can confirm her connections work in Lake Charles.

Please let me know who will be your point of contact for this at the Eco
Terminal.

Thank You and Best Regards
Joe McKechnie
