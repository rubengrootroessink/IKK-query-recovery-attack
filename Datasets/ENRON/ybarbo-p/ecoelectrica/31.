Rudy-
In the contract it says that nominations for the following month are firm 
while the 60 and 90 day ranges are just estimates.  Since taking delivery of 
the smaller ship causes us to nominate another cargo within the same month, 
we were stipulating that only the first nomination is firm as the contract 
defines it.  With all that being said, we are still planning on working 
together as usual for a  schedule that works for both sides.
Regards,
Dan

Dan:

Could you confirm the reference in the following:

* This nomination not to count as firm per clause 7.2 (a) (v) due to April
4-8 delivery being a small cargo.

I don't understand your point.

Thanks,
Rudy
