Oscar-
These Letters of Prtotest are simply standard proceedure for ships in the trade and mean nothing unless we cause a delay beyond our allowed laytime (which we did not).  Even if we had exceeded our laytime, it is not usual to respond to these protests.  Instead we would document our side internally and wait for any demurrage claim which might arise.

As to the "Hilli", the last ETA at Lake Charles was Apr 18-19,  I will keep you updated of any changes.  I will also pass on Hector and Victor's names to Cabot for clearance to attend.

Regards,
Dan Masters

As per Rick Sierra and Victor Vega conversation on the above matter, EcoElectrica  request,                                                                                                                                   your assistance to write an answering document to this LOP, ready to Victor Vega's  signature.
                                                          
   
  The restriction and delay mentioned in the document,  were extraordinary events, caused by equipment malfunction, our operators did,
   their best effort to perform the transfer as fast and safe as usual. The transfer operation began on 4-05-01 at 12.20 PM and was finished at
   3:26 AM on 4-06-01, a total of 15 hours. The Contract grant 30 hours for this  operation, reason why this LOP doesn't proceeds   

PD. Let  me  know the most  recent ETA of the HILLI to Lake Charles on April . Victor Vega and   Hector Vega / PIC  will be at the discharge to survey the operation and get enought information to satisfy,  EcoElectrica  Safety and  Operating Procedures.
