Oscar-
These Letters of Prtotest are simply standard proceedure for ships in the 
trade and mean nothing unless we cause a delay beyond our allowed laytime 
(which we did not).  Even if we had exceeded our laytime, it is not usual to 
respond to these protests.  Instead we would document our side internally and 
wait for any demurrage claim which might arise.

As to the "Hilli", the last ETA at Lake Charles was Apr 18-19,  I will keep 
you updated of any changes.  I will also pass on Hector and Victor's names to 
Cabot for clearance to attend.

Regards,
Dan Masters

As per Rick Sierra and Victor Vega conversation on the above matter, 
EcoElectrica  
request,

  The restriction and delay mentioned in the document,  were extraordinary 
events, caused by equipment malfunction, our operators did,
   their best effort to perform the transfer as fast and safe as usual. The 
transfer operation began on 4-05-01 at 12.20 PM and was finished at
   3:26 AM on 4-06-01, a total of 15 hours. The Contract grant 30 hours for 
this  operation, reason why this LOP doesn't proceeds   

PD. Let  me  know the most  recent ETA of the HILLI to Lake Charles on April 
. Victor Vega and   Hector Vega / PIC  will be at the discharge to survey the 
operation and get enought information to satisfy,  EcoElectrica  Safety and
