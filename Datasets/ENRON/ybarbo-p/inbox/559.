Dabhol Power slaps asset transfer notice on MSEB

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in yet another attempt to legally corner th=
e Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), on Monday served an asset tra=
nsfer notice on the latter and thereby set in motion the valuation process =
of Dabhol's assets including the liquified natural gas (LNG) plant in conne=
ction with the termination of the power purchase agreement (PPA). However, =
MSEB, which has rescinded its PPA with DPC on May 29 for the material misre=
presentation and default on the availability of power, has decided not to t=
ake cognisance but take future course of action after seeking advice from i=
ts solicitors. "Consequently, DPC is left with little choice other than to =
serve the transfer notice on MSEB, which draws us closer to final terminati=
on of the PPA and the ultimate recovery of damages as allowed under the pro=
ject documents," the DPC said in a statement.=20

However, the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal in his reaction told The Financial =
Express that "the transfer notice served by DPC is quite an expected move. =
The company has resorted to this move to follow the PPA which we have alrea=
dy rescinded." "This action follows more than two years of late payments an=
d defaults in payments from MSEB and a repudiation of the PPA by MSEB. The =
transfer notice is an important step in the asset valuation process agreed =
to by all parties to the PPA and is necessary to protect the interests of D=
abhol's sponsors, lenders and other stakeholders. Following this transfer n=
otice, the final termination notice is likely to be served in the near futu=
re to continue the legal process against MSEB," the DPC said in its stateme=
nt. The MSEB would be required to pay damages of around Rs 35,000 crore tow=
ards revenue compensation and demobilisation costs.=20

According to DPC, it would still prefer to resolve this dispute amicably th=
rough a negotiated purchase by the Government of India and Indian financial=
 institutions (IFIs) of the foreign sponsors equity including offshore lend=
er's debt. However, ongoing discussions between DPC and GoI/IFIs are yieldi=
ng no significant progress towards a fair and reasonable solution, the comp=
any said. DPC, which has already served three preliminary termination notic=
es in May, September and October to the MSEB by declaring its intention to =
opt out of the distressed Dabhol project after recovery of at least $1.2 bi=
llion, has issued the transfer notice under Clause 17.8 (c) of PPA. After i=
ssuance of asset transfer notice, the DPC would launch the process of evalu=
ating the operating assets, preparation and auditing of provisional termina=
tion statement, preparation of legal documentation in order to issue a fina=
l termination statement in terms of schedule 11 of the PPA.=20

Independent accountants and valuers would be appointed by the party termina=
ting the PPA within 15 days of issuance of transfer notice. The provisional=
 termination statement would be prepared by the terminating party and submi=
tted to the accountants within 45 days of the transfer notice or if later, =
then within seven business days following the receipt of the valuer's certi=
ficates as per schedule 11 of the PPA. The accountants would be required to=
 issue a certificate to both parties certifying the same after reviewing th=
e basis of the provisional termination statement. Thereafter, a final termi=
nation would have to be prepared by the terminating party and submitted to =
the accountants prior to the transfer date (the date of serving final termi=
nation notice).=20

The Enron Virodhi Andolan convener Pradmuna Kaul has welcomed the DPC's dec=
ision to serve the asset transfer notice and termed it as an endgame of Enr=
on project. "We are concerned but the Government of India (GoI), Government=
 of Maharashtra (GoM) and MSEB are not putting out its cards to put Enron o=
n defensive. The GoI, GoM and MSEB should prepare a full case including fra=
ud, public interest and public policy against Enron in a bid to force the l=
atter to carry out fair and correct business calculation and asset valuatio=
n. Enron should not be allowed to claim fancy compensation under the asset =
transfer notice and final termination notice," he added.=20

MSEB objects to DPC move , Sanjay Jog=20

Mumbai, Nov 5IN a preemptive move, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board =
(MSEB) has taken a strong objection to the Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) mov=
e to serve asset transfer notice and appointment of experts, valuers and ac=
counts under the power purchase agreement (PPA) in view of its decision to =
rescind the PPA on May 29. MSEB, which recently heaved a sigh of relief aft=
er the Supreme Court (SC) on November 2 extended the status quo until Janua=
ry 2002, in its communication of August 23 to the DPC had made it clear tha=
t the question of appointment of any experts, valuers and accountants did n=
ot arise as it has already rescinded the PPA. "As the rescission alongwith =
other disputes and differences are pending final determination by the Mahar=
ashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), DPC ought to desist from t=
aking any step as suggested," MSEB said.=20

Accordingly, the board has already refused to participate or give its conse=
nt to such appointments. MSEB sources told The Financial Express that the D=
PC was seeking to take improper advantage of the stay of the proceedings be=
fore the MERC secured by the board. Also, the DPC was seeking to circumvent=
 and/or defeat the orders passed by the SC by resorting to issuance of prel=
iminary termination notices (PTN) and asset transfer notice. "By these acti=
ons, DPC is seeking to alter the status quo and is attempting to achieve in=
directly which the company has been restrained from doing directly," source=
s said.=20

The MSEB sources said that the board was of the opinion that in view of the=
 recent orders passed by the SC, MSEB has been prevented from proceeding fu=
rther with its case before the MERC until the issue relating to the Commiss=
ion's jurisdiction is decided by the Mumbai High Court. The preliminary ter=
mination notices issued in May, September and October were the subject matt=
er of MSEB's petition before the MERC. According to MSEB, DPC was driving t=
he board to give up its case relating to the rescission of the PPA and the =
illegality of the PTNs. MSEB reiterated that the disputes and differences o=
f non-payment raised by DPC through its PTNs were pending adjudication by t=
he MSEB in its petition filed on May 25 this year.=20

MSEB justifies rescinding PPA to panel, Sanjay Jog=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in its presentation before t=
he visiting Parliamentary Assurance Committee (PAC) on Monday justified its=
 decision to rescind power purchase agreement (PPA) and suspend power purch=
ases from Dabhol Power Company (DPC). "Today, despite installed capacity be=
ing only about 15,000 mw there is no base load shortage even without DPC," =
MSEB said. According to MSEB, it paid a whopping Rs 3,500 crore for the pur=
chase of 6,700 million units from DPC during May 1999 and April 01 and sold=
 the same power for Rs 1,000 crore at a paltry Rs 3 per unit (by incurring =
a loss of Rs 2,500 crore). As against this, MSEB had to purchase DPC power =
at around Rs 7 last year when a competing supply of 2,500 mw was available =
from eastern region at less than Rs 2 per unit to other states. MSEB chairm=
an Vinay Bansal accompanied by the state principal energy secretary VM Lal =
and MSEB officials told the visiting parliamentary assurance committee that=
 the merit order despatch issued by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Comm=
ission (Merc) required it to draw the most expensive DPC power. The order r=
estricted DPC power purchases to about 250 million units per month, which w=
as about 40 per cent plant load factor (PLF).=20

However, the PPA envisaged the plant as a base load station at 90 per cent =
PLF. The committee chairman and former union minister S Venugopal (Telugu D=
esam Party) after its interaction with the MSEB and state government offici=
als told The Financial Express that "the MSEB has made a presentation on it=
s functioning and also on its power purchase agreement with DPC. They have =
also submitted the Madhav Godbole committee reports. We will submit these r=
eports to the Government of India." Further, MSEB argued that it has been q=
uite punctual in the payment of power purchase bills to DPC and added that =
it had and would pay interest for delays. However, MSEB pointed out that DP=
C was correcting monthly availability statements despite admission of short=
fall in supply against declaration. DPC has yet to pay rebate served by MSE=
B for the default on the availability of power. According to MSEB, it has r=
escinded the PPA on May 29 for material misrepresentation by DPC. Ironicall=
y, other states were unwilling to make base load purchase commitments. On t=
he implementation of its memorandum of understanding with the Centre, MSEB =
said that it would complete the installation of 1,672 time of day meters by=
 December, implement 100 per cent metering after tariff correction and intr=
oduce computerised billing. According to MSEB, it has reduced the outstandi=
ng dues to below one month billing. In addition to this, implementation of =
Ahluwalia committee report would address another Rs 400 crore of dues.=20

Dabhol domestic lenders to meet in Singapore , S Ravindran=20

Foreign lenders to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are finall=
y set to give the go-ahead to the company for serving the final termination=
 notice (FTN) to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The deadli=
ne for DPC to serve the FTN expires on November 19, 2001. The FTN will be t=
he culmination of a series of measures that started with DPC serving the pr=
eliminary termination notice in May this year. In a related development, do=
mestic lenders to the 2,184 mw power project are meeting in Singapore on No=
vember 8 and 9 in a last-ditch effort to save the project.=20

Institutional sources said the lenders will take a close look at the offers=
 of BSES and the Tatas for the project. Given a choice, the banks and insti=
tutions are not willing to run the project themselves even if they are offe=
red the project at a hefty discount. "Our business is to lend and not to ru=
n a power project," said a senior banker. The latest provocation for the fo=
reign lenders is the ruling by the Supreme Court last week restraining DPC =
from encashing a Rs 136-crore letter of credit issued by the MSEB till Janu=
ary 2002. "It is a simple case. The letter of credit issue should be delink=
ed from the problems surrounding the project. Instead, MSEB has gone to cou=
rt and the matter has now got delayed. Under these circumstances it makes p=
erfect sense to serve the final termination notice," said sources in the fo=
reign lenders consortium. "DPC has already approached us seeking permission=
 to serve the FTN. So far, we had not taken a clear-cut decision. After the=
 Supreme Court ruling, we are very much inclined to assent to serving the F=
TN," sources added.=20

The overseas lenders have a combined exposure of about $1 billion in the $3=
 billion power project in Maharashtra. The foreign lenders include Bank of =
America, Citibank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Japanese Bank for Internatio=
nal Cooperation and ANZ Investment Bank. Even after the foreign lenders giv=
e their permission to serve the FTN, the path will not be paved for interna=
tional arbitration. MSEB and DPC are locked in a legal battle over the juri=
sdiction of various disputes between them. While MSEB is keen on the issue =
being resolved by the state power regulator, the Maharashtra Electricity Re=
gulatory Commission, the power company is keen on going to the Court of Arb=
itration in London.=20

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, November 06, 2001
Enron could sell major assets

 STRUGGLING energy giant Enron may have to sell power plants, pipelines and=
 even some of its energy trading assets as it seeks to head off a credit cr=
unch and restore investor confidence, investment bankers said. While Housto=
n-based Enron lined up $1 billion of new credit last Thursday, it still suf=
fered a second credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial=
 transactions that have triggered an investigation by the US Securities and=
 Exchange Commission. The deteriorating picture, including a drop of almost=
 70 per cent in its share price in less than a month, has close watchers of=
 the company saying it will probably have to break itself up if it is to st=
ay independent. "It will have to refocus on its core strengths and get out =
of other businesses," said one investment banker close to Enron. There is a=
lso the possibility of a full bid for the company given its market value ha=
s now sunk to less than $9 billion. On Sunday, Britain's Independent report=
ed that energy giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group may mount an $11 billion bid f=
or Enron.=20

Still, most bankers think such an opportunistic bid is unlikely given the q=
uestions hanging over Enron's balance sheet. During its third-quarter resul=
ts announcement last month, the company said it expected over a billion dol=
lars of writeoffs related to several soured investments, including broadban=
d communications and water utility interests. It also announced an extra $1=
.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity related to investments that were=
 not recorded on its balance sheet. The big challenge Enron now faces is to=
 decide what assets it could sell first and what is the best possible price=
 it can achieve from them, the bankers said. "In terms of classic corporate=
 finance, the question they should ask is: 'Do I get enough money that repr=
esents equity?'" said Alan McFarland, a Wall Street veteran and co-founder =
of merchant bank McFarland Dewey. (Reuters)
