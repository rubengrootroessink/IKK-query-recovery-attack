Subject: Rio Puerco Operating Issues 

Here's the "quick and dirty" on the strategies discussed on Monday.... 

Look at the TW 10" as the primary run..... investigate the possibility of installing 1/4" (thickness) orifice plates in both TW runs....If 1/4" plates are not possible, investigate meter run change-outs....TW to speed up the pid response on the "mushroom" regulators....
Take the TW "mushrooms" out of service and PNM to provide flow-control.... take the TW positive shut-in valve out of service.... PNM to provide shut in sequence with minimum flow parameters to be set at approx 12,000 - 15,000 mcfd rate....
Investigate joint venture ultrasonic installation.

Sorry for the delay in getting this out.... took my notebook out and put it in my truck, son took my truck..... or if you don't like that one.... my dog ate my papers..... had to use the paper to write an emergency note for an elderly couple.....
