Dan,

Please be advised that "Hoegh Galleon" have reported loosing water on stb
boiler.  Stb boiler is now closed down for investigation.  The vessel has
indication in that the superheater is leaking steam/water.  The chief eng. will
inspect the boiler as soon as possible after the boiler has been cooled down and
ready for entering (within 4 - 5 hrs).   Reverting as soon as anything known.

The vessel is now steaming on one boiler, doing abt 13 knots.  We still expect
to have eta Lake Charles on the 9th morning.  Confirming eta Lake Charles as
soon as the inspection is carried out.


Best regards

Kjell
Hoegh LNG
