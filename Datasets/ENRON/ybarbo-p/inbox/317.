Texaco, Moss Maritime, Bouygues, Ziff Energy Join Faculty of Washington DC LNG Meeting 
HOUSTON, TEXAS (June 5, 2001) On May 15, Texaco announced ambitious plans to build the world's first offshore LNG receiving terminal, just south of the Henry Hub off the coast of Louisiana.  The terminal would use existing gas pipelines connected to declining Gulf of Mexico fields to supply initially one billion cubic feet per day to the North American pipeline grid.  Texaco is an active proponent of building an LNG plant in Angola, where the company has made very large offshore discoveries of oil and associated gas and is investigating construction of an onshore liquefaction plant along with an offshore gravity-based structure for LNG storage and tanker loading.  (www.lngexpress.com)
"We're very pleased to have Mark Weller, the project manager of this U.S. offshore terminal, join our line up of speakers," said Bob Nimocks, president of Zeus Development Corporation and organizer of the conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American and Caribbean Gas Supply." (www.lngexpress.com/lng2001/index.asp) This conference will be held at the Crystal City Marriott, in Arlington, Virginia, from June 27-29, 2001.
"The Gulf of Mexico is an ideal location for the world's first offshore LNG facility. It has ample pipelines, supporting infrastructure and a wealth of talent eager to pull off such a feat. South Louisiana was where Billy Prince and his team constructed the world's first export liquefaction plant for the Chicago Stock Yards in the 1950s and ultimately sent the first ocean cargo of LNG to Canvey Island, UK."
Also joining the program are two speakers who have substantial experience in designing and constructing offshore facilities and are working on LNG storage and process designs: Thor Karisen, president of Moss Maritime LNG, and Patrick Genoud from Bouygues Offshore.  
"Moss and Bouygues are well respected names in the offshore energy and LNG industries," Nimocks added.  "Both have decades of experience with floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) systems for petroleum as well as insulated LNG storage for ships and shore-based facilities."
Ziff Energy Joins Program 
On the opening morning, Paul Ziff, CEO of Ziff Energy, will join economists from the U.S. Department of Energy, Jensen Associates, the Canadian Energy Board and Poten & Partners, to discuss potential demand curves for LNG in North America. (www.lngexpress.com/lng2001/index.asp)
"Ziff has extensive knowledge of gas production costs and delivery infrastructure throughout Canada and the United States" Nimocks noted. "He will add a valuable component to the expertise on gas supply and demand during the opening session."
