Paul,

You would have been very proud of me if you had seen how quickly I was able to understand (from the graph Elio showed me) the nature of the proposed hedge for Procaribe's next cargo.

How are we on locking up the cargo (ordering it) and putting the hedge in place?  How do the curves look like right now? Going down?

Also, Elio, how comfortable are you with Miguel's projected sales figures? What does it assume re: Humberto?

Thanks
