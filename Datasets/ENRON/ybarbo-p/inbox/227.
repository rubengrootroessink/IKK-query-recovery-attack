Not too late to save Enron project ,  Prem Shankar Jha=20

After months of tortured haggling and increasing bad blood, the Indian stat=
e and Enron, the giant American energy transnational, have reached a partin=
g of ways. Having failed to get the Maharashtra State Electricity Board pay=
 for the electricity it is buying from its Dabhol Power Compay; having fail=
ed to get the Maharashtra Government to honour its commitment to pay MSEB's=
 dues in case the latter is unable to do so, and having failed to make the =
Central Government honour its  counter-guarantee of MSEB's dues, Enron has =
served a preliminary notice of termination. This gives the two parties six =
months to settle the dispute. After that the Government will have to pay En=
ron a large sum in termination costs. If the MSEB fights this and loses, th=
e compensation and penalties could add up to Rs. 17,000 crores or one and a=
 half times the cost of the entire project. Predictably, the air is full of=
 brave statements by the Maharashtra Chief Minister, State officials, bank =
managers and Central Power Ministry officials, that this would be good ridd=
ance. The Central Government virtually said as much first by claiming that =
this was simply a dispute between a single power company and a State govern=
ment; then by refusing to honour its counter-guarantee of MSEB's dues, and =
finally by not sending its representative to the first meeting of the reneg=
otiating committee that the State Government thrust down Enron's throat on =
April 23.=20

By doing all this it implicitly endorsed the view expressed by the Godbole =
Committee that the power purchase agreement was faulty; that Enron had infl=
ated its costs and that the pricing system adopted was extortionate. The tr=
uth is that renegotiation alone cannot save the Enron project because it ca=
nnot bring the cost of power sold by it down to the level that the MSEB is =
being allowed by the State Government to pay. Here are the bald facts. Thir=
ty one per cent of the power generated by the MSEB is stolen or lost during=
 transmission. The balance 69 per cent is bought by 12 million paying consu=
mers, of whom, by government orders, 10 million receive subsidised electric=
ity. Chief of these are the so-called agriculturists who pay 16 to 25 per c=
ent of the average book value cost of generation, the smaller of the small =
scale industries, which pay a fraction less than the cost of generation, an=
d the bulk of the domestic consumers. The MSEB attempts to recover the loss=
 by making industry and commercial establishments pay almost double the cos=
t of generation.=20

But since a disproportionate share of these consumers is in Mumbai, where t=
hey are served by Tata Electric Companies and BSES, in spite of charging 20=
 per cent more from industrial consumers than they do, the MSEB has been un=
able to recover costs through cross-subsidisation. Between April 1997 and M=
arch 2000, a succession of populist and irresponsible governments have forc=
ed the MSEB to dole out Rs. 2,800 crores worth of subsidies. In 2000, the M=
SEB was incurring a cash loss of about Rs. 5 crores a day, that is, 14 per =
cent of the cost of generation. This was the situation in which Dabhol's fi=
rst phase came on stream in June 1999. Since at 90 per cent capacity utilis=
ation it would have added only 6 per cent to power generation and, even at =
Rs. 5 per unit, the MSEB would have been able to cover the extra cost of En=
ron power by raising average tariffs by a mere 5.5 per cent. But there has =
been no increase in tariff since September 1998. That is the reason why the=
 MSEB simply could not face the prospect of buying the additional power tha=
t Enron was capable of providing. It, therefore, sought to minimise its add=
itional loss by buying barely a third of the Dabhol's generating capacity. =
But since the capital charge was fixed, it found that this did not save muc=
h. That was when it baulked at paying and began to look for a way to break =
the power purchase agreement.=20

The Maharashtra Government's absolute refusal to reduce subsidies or curb p=
ower theft spells the death of private power generation, whether by Indian =
or foreign companies. This is because Maharashtra is no exception. Each and=
 every State electricity board is being prevented today from charging an ec=
onomic price for power by populist and unstable State governments, while th=
e Centre looks helplessly on. As a result, two foreign companies, Cogentrix=
 and Electricite de France, have already formally pulled out. Thirteen priv=
ate power projects with a generation capacity of 6,275 MW have not invested=
 a single rupee so far despite having achieved financial closure and obtain=
ed all necessary permissions. Among them is a third foreign investor, Daewo=
o. This has forced the participating banks to cancel their loans to 10 of t=
hem.=20

In Maharashtra, two more large plants, Ispat's 1,082 MW plant at Bhadravati=
 and Reliance's 437 MW plant at Patalganga, which were awaiting the outcome=
 of the Enron struggle, will now almost certainly be given up. All this is =
happening when the country faces a 10 per cent overall and 32 per cent defi=
cit in peak power supply. It is still not too late to salvage the Dabhol pr=
oject on terms that are fair to the MSEB as well as Enron. The Centre can b=
ring down the capital component of the electricity tariff by buying the CNG=
 terminal, port facilities and re-gasification plant from Enron, and bringi=
ng in a strategic partner to run it as a separate enterprise. This will bri=
ng the cost of the power project down from $2.8 billion to $2.2 billion. Th=
e capital charge on the MSEB will come down by over 20 per cent and, since =
capital charges are 55 to 60 per cent of the tariff, the cost of electricit=
y will come down by 12 per cent.=20

When the second phase of the plant is complete in six months or so, at 90 p=
er cent of capacity utilisation, the cost of power will come down to Rs. 3.=
15 to 3.20 per unit. This will be the lowest for a new plant in the country=
. Second, since only three quarters of the equity and debt capital have bee=
n raised abroad, and approximately the same proportion of running costs is =
incurred in foreign exchange, only this proportion of the total tariff shou=
ld be pegged to the exchange rate. This will substantially moderate the fut=
ure increase in power costs for Enron. But even this settlement will requir=
e the State Government to raise the average tariff to a point where it will=
 absorb the marginal cost of generating electricity from new plants. The Ce=
ntre will have to point this fact and take measures to enforce this rule of=
 pricing throughout the country.=20

Centre calls meet on May 25 to resolve termination notice crisis,  Sanjay J=
og

THE BJP-led Central government, which has come under severe attack for its =
not-to-worry attitude, has finally decided to act and has convened a crucia=
l meeting on May 25 to take stock of the situation in the wake of issuance =
of preliminary termination notice (PTN) by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) t=
o the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The meeting would be atte=
nded by the officials from the union ministries of finance, power, oil and =
natural gas, Maharashtra government and the MSEB. It is likely that the DPC=
 officials would also be invited for the May 25th meeting in a serious bid =
to send a "positive" signal across the world. Union minister of state for e=
nergy Jayavantiben Mehta confirmed the May 25 meeting and told The Financia=
l Express that the Centre would always try to help the state government fin=
d a way out.  "However, the signatories for the power purchase agreement - =
the MSEB and DPC - should  first try to overcome the crisis and then and th=
en only can the Centre intervene," Ms Mehta said. "Various options can be c=
onsidered to resolve the Dabhol imbroglio," Ms Mehta said in a telephonic c=
onversation. However, she declined to divulge any further details.

Sources said that Ms Mehta, in the absence of cabinet minister Suresh Prabh=
u who is abroad, took a lead and briefed Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpaye=
e and finance minister Yashwant Sinha after the issuance of the PTN by DPC.=
 Ms Mehta is believed to have stressed the need for a meeting of all partie=
s involved in the Dabhol project. The May 25 meet was fixed as Mr Prabhu is=
 expected to reach New Delhi on late May 23 or early May 24. In addition to=
 this, the Centre wants to wait until it receives a briefing from its nomin=
ee and former bureaucrat AV Gokak who would attend the May 23 meeting of th=
e Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee. In a related development, the MSE=
B on Monday has sent copies of the PTN to the respective union ministries f=
or their perusal. MSEB's top officials, comprising chairman Vinay Bansal on=
 Monday closeted with its legal advisors to examine the PTN and its impact.=
 State chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said that his government has also s=
ought legal opinion on the issuance of PTN.

FIs seek Centre's intervention in DPC-MSEB row

FOLLOWING Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's issuance of the preliminary=
 termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its Indian =
lenders have once again decided to seek the Centre's intervention to solve =
the imbroglio. "Like our earlier efforts, even this time, we wish that the =
Union government intervene and help defuse the entire crisis amicably," fin=
ancial institution sources said. Indian lenders, led by Industrial Developm=
ent Bank of India and a consortium of several banks -- including State Bank=
 of India and ICICI -- have lent around $1.4 billion of DPC's $3-billion, 2=
,184-mw project in Dabhol. In fact, the sources said, IDBI, along with the =
global lenders, had written to Union finance secretary Ajit Kumar in the fi=
rst week of this month, seeking the Centre's intervention to direct MSEB an=
d the Maharashtra government to pay dues of up to Rs 213 crore towards Nove=
mber and December 2000 bills "We had also asked the Centre to convince MSEB=
, and restrain it from issuing a termination notice to DPC," they  said.=20

However, Kumar in his reply, had put the ball in the lenders' court and ask=
ed the Indian FIs to take "the course deemed fit to them in this case". Wit=
h reference to the notice, sources said the Indian Fis had been very critic=
al of the move and that they had voted negative when DPC had sought for a m=
andate by May 18, during the three-day tele-conferencing of all the lenders=
. "We think the matter is a not a boxing match, but a commercial dispute, w=
hich could be solved by negotiations," they said. Expressing doubts about f=
urther funding to DPC, in view of the notice, sources said: "We have to thi=
nk whether they can disburse the remaining 20 per cent funds of around $250=
 million following the PTN." The Indian FIs were also upset about the fact =
that DPC did not wait for the voting scheduled to be completed on Monday, a=
s it had received the required mandate from ABN-AMRO-led offshore consortiu=
m. "We are sure that the foreign lenders must have exercised their vote on =
May 18 night itself, immediately after the end of the tele-conference," the=
y added. "This proves that DPC had already made up its mind over the PTN, b=
ut such a hasty step will not deter us Indian  lenders to vote against the =
PTN," the lenders said.=20

DPC had also convinced the foreign lenders that the state government had br=
eached the PPA and the very fact that the government constituted the review=
 committee indicated that it did not want to support the agreement, the sou=
rces said. Moreover, in DPC's April 25 London board-meet, an IDBI official =
had tried to convince the foreign counterparts to refrain from PTN, and req=
uested DPC to resort to re-negotiation. (PTI)

oard had decided to go ahead with its decision to slap yet another Rs 400 c=
rore penalty on DPC for mis-declaration and default on the availability of =
power. The proposed penalty is in the wake of DPC's inability to produce po=
wer on February 12 and March 13 as per MSEB's demand in stipulated time of =

Dabhol lenders draw blank with Finance Ministry , Shaji Vikraman , Balaji C=

THE Indian lenders to the Dabhol power project, led by Industrial Developme=
nt Bank of India (IDBI), have met with a cold response from the Finance Min=
istry to its request to the Government to help protect its loan exposure an=
d to honour the power purchase and counter-guarantee agreements. The domest=
ic lenders, who have a debt exposure of over $1 billion to the project, had=
 sought the intervention of the Government to resolve the deadlock over the=
 outstanding payment to the power utility from the Maharashtra State Electr=
icity Board (MSEB) and the Maharashtra Government. Indian financial institu=
tions and commercial banks will be in a spot of bother as they do not  enjo=
y the comfort of their exposure to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) being covered=
 under the counter guarantee agreement.=20

The threat to the FIs has now arisen because of the preliminary termination=
 notice under Sec.17 of the power purchase agreement has been served by the=
 project sponsor. The counter-guarantee agreement covers only the foreign l=
enders. According to the agreement, the foreign debt component equivalent t=
o the foreign equity in the project is guaranteed free of cost. For the rem=
aining part of the foreign  debt, the sponsor would have to pay an interest=
 charge of 1.2 per cent on a reducing balance basis.=20

The Indian lenders to the project is led by IDBI, which has advanced funds =
aggregating Rs 1,700 crore, and includes ICICI, IFCI, State Bank of India a=
nd Canara Bank. Besides the rupee loans, IDBI has provided a guarantee for =
a $200-million line of credit extended to DPC by the US Exim Bank. Accordin=
g to senior Government officials, the Ministry has taken the view that the =
Indian lenders would have to act on their own in this case as it is their c=
ommercial judgement which prevailed when the loan was disbursed at high int=
erest rates to DPC. ``Prior to sanctioning of the loan, they never approach=
ed the Government. After the mess, they want the Government to bail out the=
m. It only reflects their short-sighted approach,'' a Ministry official sai=
d. The consortium of lenders to the Dabhol project want the MSEB and the Ma=
harashtra Government to increase the escrow cover and also the line of cred=
it to DPC. The Maharashtra Government has, however, refused to oblige sayin=
g that the company had already invoked politicial force majeure.

The company had said that the Godbole committee report ``should not form th=
e basis for any future discussions''. ``They (DPC) have not informed us abo=
ut staying away from the meeting. So we will assume that they will be prese=
nt. But if they do not come, it will be the end of the dialogue for negotia=
tion,'' a senior State Government official said. The Centre's representativ=
e, Mr A.V. Gokak, will attend the May 23 meeting, the official said.=20

DPC had objected to the absence of the Centre's representative at the last =
meeting. ``GoI did not even bother to send a representative to the initial =
renegotiation committee meeting on May 11,'' the company had said when issu=
ing the preliminary termination notice. DPC's spokesperson declined to comm=
ent on being asked if the company's  representatives would attend the secon=
d meeting of the Godbole panel. Meanwhile, senior officials of the State Go=
vernment have expressed concern over neglect in appointing the third concil=
iator to enable the conciliation process between the Union Government and D=
PC. ``The conciliation process has to be completed within 60 days, which me=
ans the deadline falls on June 7,'' a senior State Government official said=
. ``But they're still looking for the third person,'' he said. In its state=
ment when issuing the preliminary termination notice on Saturday, the compa=
ny has put down the Union Government's ``failure to respond positively to D=
PC lenders' written requests for assurances'', as one of the reasons for is=
suing the notice.

Pawar urges Centre to buy Enron power

NATIONALIST Congress Party president Sharad Pawar has urged the Union Gover=
nment to play a supporting role in the Enron controversy by purchasing addi=
tional power from the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). Speaking to mediapersons,=
 Pawar said Maharashtra was not in a position to purchase 2000 MW of power =
from phase II of DPC and the Union Government should come forward to purcha=
se it. He said the government could purchase power from DPC as several stat=
es were facing a shortage. The NCP leader said the DPC had not taken a wise=
 step by sending a notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)=
. It should have sorted the issue through negotiations. When specifically a=
sked about the Godbole Committee set up by the Maharashtra government, Pawa=
r said the views of Godbole on the issue were known to all. But three of th=
e members resigned from the committee, putting a question mark on its funct=
ioning.

Pawar said it would be wise for both the DPC and Maharashtra government to =
solve the issue through discussions, instead of fighting a legal battle. As=
ked whether he would persuade the Union Government to change its stand, Paw=
ar said Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Energy Minister Padmasinh Pati=
l were making efforts in the same direction. He said the DPC should also ha=
ve brought down its purchase rates in view of the complications, adding tha=
t it would not be in the interests of Maharashtra if the matter was taken u=
p to the tribunal. He said the issue would send wrong signals to the foreig=
n investors, which will ultimately halt the economic growth of the country.

MSEB not to pay capacity charges until receipt of Rs 401-crore rebate from =
 DPC=20

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which would slap a rebate o=
f nearly Rs 800 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of=
 power in February and  March by the DPC, has threatened not to pay capacit=
y charges until DPC makes the payment of  rebate of Rs 401 crore charged fo=
r the January 28 default. MSEB sources told The Financial Express that it h=
as paid a whopping Rs 1,806 crore to DPC  towards capacity charges during M=
ay 1999 and February 2001, on a monthly basis.

However, the successive occurrences of shortfall in actual generation under=
mines the entire basis of the power purchase agreement (PPA) and the "MSEB =
is entitled to be discharged from further performance in terms of the PPA, =
due to DPC's failure to perform its obligations in terms of the PPA," sourc=
es said. MSEB on or about March 27, 2001 paid "under protest" the capacity =
payment of about Rs 83.04 crore for the month of February 2001, having take=
n a view that in terms of the PPA, the rebate would be adjusted in May 2001=
.  "However, given the fact that DPC has raised disputes in order to avoid =
and/or delay adjusting the rebates and the successive breaches by DPC, MSEB=
 may be entitled to be relieved of its future   obligations - making capaci=
ty payments until such disputes are finally determined," MSEB sources  said=
.

In view of DPC's admission with regard to failure on its part and its incap=
ability to adhere to the  provisions of Schedule 6, and/or the inability of=
 the Dabhol plant to perform according to the Dynamic Parameters and Operat=
ing Characteristics, DPC is not entitled to insist that its December 2000 b=
ill (Rs 102 crore) should be paid in full without any adjustment. According=
 to the MSEB, the clear intent of Clause 11 (b) (ii) of the PPA is that DPC=
 would compute the rebate in accordance with Clause 10.2 and the amounts wo=
uld be duly adjusted in the months of January, May and September, and that,=
 thereafter, if after such adjustment, further amounts are still payable to=
 MSEB, the same would be paid and/or adjusted against future capacity payme=
nts. "This breaks down if DPC refuses to calculate the rebate, make necessa=
ry adjustments, make payment, and resorts to the dispute resolution procedu=
re. Therefore, MSEB is entitled to adjust and/or withhold amounts as it has=
 a legitimate claim against DPC," sources said.

Finding new buyers key to DPC's future

THE MAHARASHTRA government and the Centre are exploring the possibility of =
an Indian company taking over the Dabhol Power Company, the subsidiary of U=
S energy major Enron that is mired in a major power tariff dispute with the=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board. According to Maharshtra government of=
ficials, the sale of Enron's stake in DPC to an Indian company in the priva=
te or public sector is being seen as the honorable way out of the dispute b=
etween the company, the government and the MSEB. According to a source, the=
 Maharashtra government is under pressure from lending agencies, foreign in=
vestors and the US government to save the $3-billion Dabhol project. Abando=
ning it could result in payouts of about Rs 17,000 crore to Enron, he said.=
=20

Under the counter guarantees provided by the Indian government, compensatio=
n would include returns on investment made by Enron in the DPC project. Fin=
ancial institutions like the Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI an=
d the State Bank of India could face major losses as they have given guaran=
tees to international lenders, officials say. Maharashtra has already begun=
 to cover its flanks by charging DPC with providing insufficient services a=
nd installing substandard equipment to prevent its facility from generating=
 95 per cent power. A penalty of Rs 401 crore was slapped on the company la=
st month for not providing power to MSEB at a notice of three hours. It has=
 now been decided that a notice for a similar penalty will be sent in June =
as well, officials here said.=20

MSEB officials have been quoted as saying that no bills would be paid to th=
e company after the April bill of Rs. 1.39 billion. The bills for the remai=
ning months would be  adjusted against the penalty.  With Enron hardening i=
ts stand, it is possible the company could stop power supply from June, the=
y indicated. Although the DPC has issued the preliminary termination  notic=
e, the actual process of terminating the PPA could  take as long as six mon=
ths. "This initiates the process of terminating the power purchase agreemen=
t with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board," DPC said.=20

Simultaneously, it said it was open to "constructive" negotiations on the i=
ssue. The DPC is demanding that the Central government participate in the n=
egotiations between Enron and MSEB or provide credit support to purchasers =
of its power as a  pre-condition to talks. "While a lasting and feasible so=
lution to this issue may be possible, it can only occur if the parties cont=
ractually bound to purchase DPC power (MSEB with guarantees from state and =
central government) are willing to either purchase themselves or find "othe=
r" creditworthy entities," the company said.=20

Enron also said the report of committee on renegotiating the power purchase=
 agreement should not be the basis for discussions. The stalemate in the pr=
oject follows the Maharashtra government disputing payments for power purch=
ased by the MSEB from the DPC. The government cleared its February and Marc=
h                                           outstanding of Rs 113 crore and=
 Rs 134 crore respectively but under protest. The DPC currently produces 74=
0 MW of power. This is to go up to 2,184 MW if and when the second phase of=
 the project goes on stream. (IANS)

DPC to gain from ST waiver on naphtha,  Sanjay Jog

THE Maharashtra government has waived the 5.4 per cent sales tax on   napht=
ha supplied by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for Dabhol Power Company (DPC).=
  Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that the  decision would be=
nefit not only DPC but also other  electricity utilities operating in the s=
tate. Although the  energy, finance and planning departments have cleared t=
he file pertaining to this issue, it would be taken up for  the Cabinet's a=
pproval only at its meeting on May 23.  Sources said instead of considering=
 the DPC's case in  isolation, the state government had taken a broader vie=
w  in offering the naphtha sales tax waiver to utilities operating in the s=
tate.

 "The objective is to refrain these utilities from procuring naphtha from G=
ujarat. Had these utilites   procured naphtha from Gujarat, the latter woul=
d have earned a revenue of over Rs 40 crore  annually," the sources added. =
Analysts said the state government's move would draw criticism  especially =
from the anti-Enron lobby. According to them, although it is a coincidence =
that the file in  this regard was cleared after the issuance of preliminary=
 termination notice (PTN), the government  would have to convince its const=
ituents which have been pressing for the scrapping of the Dabhol project.=
=20

Ironically, the state finance and planning department had, in the past, que=
stioned naphtha sales tax   waiver on the grounds that its approval for DPC=
 in particular would not be possible as the Shiv  Sena-BJP alliance governm=
ent had already reduced the sales tax on naphtha from 15 per cent to 4  per=
 cent in 1995. However, the department relented and is believed to have agr=
eed to clear the file by making it clear that the waiver will be applicable=
 to all utilities and not DPC in particular. Since  January this year, DPC =
has been pressing for the full waiver of sales tax on the 1.2 million tonne=
 of  naphtha procured from IOC during the calender year 2001.=20

The company had pointed out that any tax levied on the naphtha purchases wi=
ll lead to tariff  increase and would add to the burden on the consumers "a=
s the cost of fuel is passed to MSEB  under the power purchase agreement". =
DPC had said MSEB would have to bear an additional  burden of about Rs 71.5=
 crore in 2001 as a result of the net impact of local sales tax. "Given the=
 effect of a tariff increase for electricity consumers in the state, ... gr=
ant us full exemption of tax on  local purchase of naphtha by issuing neces=
sary notification under section 41 of Bombay Sales Tax  Act," the company p=
resident and ceo Neil Mcgregror had in one of his recent communications to =
 the state government said. Further, the energy department and MSEB had sup=
ported the DPC's  stand and had said MSEB was not in a position to take the=
 additional burden in view of its present  precarious finances. The MSEB ha=
d requested the state energy department that the finance department should =
clear sales tax waiver to DPC "as a special requirment."=20

Enron sells stake in Dolphin to UAE Offsets

US Enron has bowed out of a $3.5-billion project to route Qatari gas to the=
 United Arab Emirates and sold its stake in Dolphin Energy, the project cha=
irman and US firm announced on Monday. Enron sold its stake to the UAE Offs=
ets Group for an undisclosed amount. Richard Bergsieker, the US firm's Midd=
le East MD, told a news conference in Abu Dhabi that Enron did not believe =
it could add much to the project in its current stage. "As the project had =
evolved into a strong upstream gas supply project and gas transport and del=
ivery, we don't believe there is a lot of value that Enron can add," he exp=
lained. "The project requires longterm equity investment  in upstream and E=
nron is frankly not an upstream company."=20

DEL chairman Ahmed Ali al-Sayegh had earlier said Enron had agreed to trans=
fer its 24.5 per cent stake in Dolphin to UOG for an undisclosed amount, ra=
ising the UAE firm's stake to 75.5 per cent. TotalFinaElf holds the remaini=
ng stake. Patrick Rambaud, TotalFinaElf's senior vice-president for the Mid=
dle East,  said his firm has formally asked UOG to increase its own  stake =
in the project. Sayegh, however, said UOG is seeking a different partner. "=
We are studying the TotalFinaElf request...(but) there will be another part=
ner in the project," he said. "Starting  tomorrow, we will begin negotiatio=
ns with the global firms  who have shown interest in acquiring a state. The=
y are more than eight companies." He refused to name the firms but said "ev=
erybody who is working in the Gulf is interested. We are not in a hurry to =
choose a partner." Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet a=
greement" which outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the l=
ong-awaited $3.5bn project. The two sides aim to sign a production-sharing =
agreement  by the end of the third quarter '01. Sayegh said they would stic=
k to that deadline. "The latest date is mid-September," he added.=20

Qatar, which sits on the world's third largest gas reserves, is seeking to =
boost its natural gas exports to the Gulf after investing billions of dolla=
rs to tap its vast gas riches. The gas deal will entitle DEL to develop a t=
ract of Qatar's giant North Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet =
per day. UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the tract, drilling and =
setting up of production facilities. The remaining $1.5 billion would be in=
vested to lay a pipeline and set up receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Al=
i and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital=
 Abu Dhabi by late '04 or early '05. 1-1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would =
be used by utilities in Abu Dhabi and the remainder supplied to Dubai. DEL =
has started inviting local, regional and international companies to prequal=
ify for five contracts between May 19-23 following the establishment of a t=
echnical project team to oversee the implementation of the first cross-bord=
er gas pipeline project in the Middle East. Engineering and construction ma=

BUSINESS STANDARD, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
FOCUS: THE ENRON CONTROVERSY, Dabhol: more heat than light
A V Rajwade highlights some basic errors of omission and commission in the =
Enron deal
The general impression propagated by the critics of the Enron-promoted powe=
r project, and often accepted by the man on the street, is that MSEB and, a=
s a by-product, the citizens of Maharashtra, are victims of very high-cost =
power; that the agreements were signed at the behest of corrupt politicians=
; and that, therefore, the best course of action is to tear up the agreemen=
ts and forget about it. But the first phase of the power plant has been in =
operation for a few years, and the second phase is also reportedly 92 per c=
ent complete. These are genuine productive assets that the economy will eve=
ntually need, and cannot be wished away. Nor can the country afford to rene=
ge with impunity, solemnly undertaken financial obligations. In my regular =
weekly column (World Money, which appears on Mondays), I have been a suppor=
ter of foreign investment and had criticised the initial stance of the BJP-=
Shiv Sena government, which had terminated the contract, only to revive the=
 project on a much bigger scale, on the basis of the efforts of a renegotia=
tion committee appointed by it.=20
The controversy has once again become front-page news, given the inability =
of MSEB to pay the dues of Dabhol Power Company (DPC). In turn, the MSEB ha=
s served notices for what it claims are dues from DPC because of defaults, =
and the whole matter has become a first-class mess. The recent report of th=
e Godbole Committee is certainly a step in the right direction, and the gov=
ernment has appointed another group, once again led by Mr Godbole, to reneg=
otiate the contracts with DPC/Enron. Theoretically of course there are thre=
e possible culprits - politicians, a devious Enron that corrupted them, or =
a system whose competence (and professional commitment) was less than adequ=
ate to evaluate the project properly.=20
To be sure, the committee has, while commenting on how the tariff was shown=
 to be within government of India norms, felt "this combination of circumst=
ances to be beyond the realm of coincidence". This is the closest it has co=
me to questioning the motives of those involved. But before drawing conclus=
ions, consider some basic issues. Demand estimation: The report concludes t=
hat gross errors were committed in estimating the total amount and nature o=
f the demand for power in the state. The growth in the high tariff group ha=
s been very limited (surely this was foreseeable - at a particular MSEB tar=
iff, industry finds it cheaper to generate captive power), while low-tariff=
 demand has grown steadily.=20
Again, the report argues that, on the supply side, MSEB had enough generati=
ng capacity available for the so-called "base load", to meet which plants h=
ave to run 24 hours a day. MSEB really needed generating capacity, even acc=
ording to its own demand projections, for the intermediate and peak loads. =
While the fuel envisaged to be used in DPC is ideal to take care of this, t=
he plant load factor (PLF) used for cost and tariff calculations is complet=
ely unrealistic for such a power plant. Were these major errors in demand e=
stimation and so on or political failure or system weaknesses?=20
Return on equity: If there were gross errors in the demand-supply projectio=
n side, the assured 16 per cent return on equity, (at 68.5 per cent PLF) af=
ter tax, is also open to serious questioning. What is truly amazing is that=
 the return was the same in percentage terms irrespective of whether the eq=
uity was contributed in rupees, dollars or perhaps even yen -and that too i=
n the respective currencies! The Maharashtra government is not responsible =
for this: it is government of India policy, cleared at the highest minister=
ial levels. Before adopting the norm, did we use concepts like Capital Asse=
t Pricing Model (CAPM) which show that equity market returns in all countri=
es are not identical; that they crucially depend on the risk-free rate of i=
nterest which is different for each currency.=20
Again, there are robust benchmarks available for quantifying the political =
risk that a foreign direct investor faces (for example, the premium charged=
 for different countries by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Associati=
on of the World Bank). Was such analysis done before the 16 per cent tax-fr=
ee norm, and exchange-rate protected returns, were assured? If not, who is =
responsible? The discount rate: I started thinking about the discount rate =
used in the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), for the calculation of the fixe=
d charge, on a simple issue. If for the first phase, the fixed charge is Rs=
 95 crore per month or, say, Rs 1,000 crore per annum, and is payable for t=
he next 20 years, what should be the rate of discount at which the present =
value of these payments would be roughly Rs 3,000 crore, which is the cost =
of the first phase?=20
Moreover, the bulk of the fixed charge is indexed to the dollar-rupee excha=
nge rate - in other words, for all practical purposes, the fixed charge is =
a dollar-denominated outflow as far as MSEB is concerned. It seems that now=
here is the discount rate used for calculating the present value of the fix=
ed charge outflows specified or documented! Empirical analysis seems to ind=
icate that the rate is about 17 per cent per annum! It is worth noting that=
 even in the dark days of monetary tightness in 1996, a 17 per cent discoun=
t rate would be too high for simple rupee obligations guaranteed by the gov=
ernment of India - it is absurd for discounting a stream of what are effect=
ively dollar payments.=20
Elementary financial economics requires that for calculating the present va=
lue of a dollar stream, the discounting rate should be based on the US trea=
sury bond yields of corresponding duration. This has never been more than 7=
 per cent after 1994. For the desired present value, therefore, the correct=
 fixed charge needs to be perhaps 40 per cent of what it is now! There is a=
 similar logical flaw in the dollar-denominated O&M charges being subject t=
o Indian inflation. While the latter point has been commented on in the rep=
ort, the former has not been adequately weighed.=20
To be sure, this is something of a technical issue and one cannot expect th=
e average minister to understand it. The actual discount rate used has infl=
ated the fixed charges enormously: one suspects that Enron knew this, hence=
 the obvious efforts to hide the number. But surely the MSEB and other offi=
cials and advisers dealing with the negotiations, should have appreciated t=
he crucial importance of the number, and insisted on ascertaining the disco=
unt rate? It could of course be argued that the political pressure was such=
 that the civil servants were silenced from voicing any objections they may=
 have had on the various issues. Is there any evidence in the notings on va=
rious papers to support that the issues of financial economics pertaining t=
o the case had been pinpointed? How is it that the impracticability, nay im=
possibility, of more than half of MSEB's revenue being escrowed for a singl=
e plant was not noticed by anybody? Were not at least some of the issues im=
portant and significant enough for the financial health of MSEB, and indeed=
 the Maharashtra government, for at least one bureaucrat to stand up?
 A way out: The Godbole committee has recommended a package of proposals to=
 resolve the tangle. One would like to add a suggestion worth exploring. Th=
is is based on what happened in the now celebrated dispute between Procter =
& Gamble (P&G), the US multinational, and Bankers Trust Company (BTC) in th=
e United States. P&G had entered into various, complex derivative contracts=
 with BTC. When it incurred huge losses, it sued BTC on the grounds that it=
 was persuaded to sign contracts the implications of which it had not under=
stood properly, and that therefore the amounts already paid by it should be=
 refunded and the contracts voided.=20
Admittedly, this was a novel plea to be taken by a litigant of P&G's standi=
ng. Unfortunately, the case was settled out of court with BTC paying $ 100 =
million-plus to P&G. But if P&G can claim that it did not understand the im=
plications of a financial contract, so surely can MSEB, particularly in rel=
ation to discounting rate or the return on equity, and demand the contracts=
 be voided or renegotiated? But it is the Godbole Committee that should hav=
e the last word on the issue: "The Committee would like to state strongly t=
hat none of the solutions espoused for IPPs ... and DPC in particular is te=
nable without the reform of MSEB, especially its distribution business." Th=
at, perhaps, is the crux of the controversy.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
Business Unusual=20

Is India serious about the business of business? Two recent developments ra=
ise this question, and the answer may well determine whether India can achi=
eve its true economic potential or will continue to lurch along, doing  the=
 best it can under the circumstances. The first is the Dabhol Power Company=
's issuance of a pre-termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricit=
y Board. This is  the first step in a process that could eventually culmina=
te  with Enron pulling out of India. Many people might celebrate that, sinc=
e the deal has been riddled with  controversy right from the start. So, we =
should perhaps  remind ourselves why the need was felt for such a project  =
- because lack of power was accepted as one of the  primary infrastructural=
 problems in India. After all these years, things have only got worse. Than=
ks to politically-dictated tariffs, inefficiency and widespread theft, our =
state electricity boards collectively owe central  power utilities Rs 26,00=
0 crore. Given the financial woes of their primary consumer, the SEBs, prod=
ucers can hardly be blamed for seeking some sort of financial safeguards be=
fore they set up shop. The question then arises whether the safeguards Enro=
n sought were prohibitive. It is high time the Centre takes a clear stand o=
n the issue. It should either clearly state that the Enron deal is good for=
 India, in which case it should bend over backwards to save it. Or it shoul=
d flatly say the deal is unviable, and mount a public relations campaign to=
 minimise the effect of the contract being scrapped on other potential inve=
stors. But before that, it should explain why a Central counter-guarantee w=
as issued in the first  place.

The second development is the steadily intensifying confrontation between t=
he government and the trade unions. As in the case of Enron, there are two =
clearly polarised camps talking at, not to, each other. Predictably enough,=
 the unions are upset about the proposed move to make it easier for organis=
ations to fire workers. The fact that there is also a proposal to treble th=
e retrenchment compensation from 15 days to 45 days per year of completed s=
ervice is being ignored. The logic of reforming labour laws is well-known: =
it is necessary to make Indian industry globally competitive; it will make =
both the labour and capital markets more flexible, which will create faster=
 growth; states which are ostensibly labour-friendly only end up driving aw=
ay industry and increasing unemployment. Repeating these arguments, unfortu=
nately, amounts to preaching to the converted. People who support labour la=
w reforms already know all this, while the trade unions simply aren't willi=
ng to listen. So what can be done? The only way out is for the government t=
o bypass the self-appointed representatives of the disadvantaged, and start=
 hardselling reforms directly to this constituency. It should step up the c=
ommunication effort, rather than trying to present reforms as a fait accomp=
li, which can only generate suspicion and resentment. It should admit that =
in its effort to be a benevolent parent, it botches up too many things. So =
it makes more sense for it to focus on just a few things, like education, l=
aw and order, health and nutrition, and providing safety nets for the dispo=
ssessed. If the government can improve its performance in these areas, it m=
ight find people less fearful at the thought of taking  responsibility for =
themselves.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
What happens when ignorance is bliss=20

Ministry of Power ignored Planning Commission's advice on direct sale ,  G =
V Ramakrishna

One of the solutions to the problems associated with the power purchase agr=
eements (PPAs) between independent power producers (IPPs) and the state ele=
ctricity boards (SEBs) now being proposed is the direct sale of power by IP=
Ps to blue-chip industrial customers. The Godbole Committee also is reporte=
d to have suggested that this should be explored in the case of the Dabhol =
project. The idea is not new. It was in fact proposed when the writer was a=
 member of the Planning Commission in 1994 and was ignored by the power min=
istry in its preoccupation with the Enron  project and the need to justify =
the one-sided agreement as the only way of solving the power shortage in th=
e country.

The proposal made in 1994 also addressed the objection now being raised by =
the SEBs that such direct sale will diminish their revenues from industrial=
 high tariff users and their capacity to cross-subsidise the cost of power =
supplied to the low- or zero-tariff consumers in the domestic and agricultu=
ral sectors. The proposal was based on four parameters: SEB power capacity,=
 pattern of supply to various users, the tariff structure and the extent of=
 cross subsidisation. These parameters would determine how much additional =
power each state can afford and the extent to which direct supply can be ma=
de to industrial users. The outline of the proposal is as follows:

If, say, the existing power capacity in a state is 4000 mw and 25 per cent =
goes to industrial users, 35 per cent to the domestic sector and 40 per cen=
t to the agricultural sector, and the tariff structure requires government =
support even after cross-subsidisation, then the state should be told that =
if the SEB was prepared to yield 50 per cent of its industrial demand to th=
e IPP for direct supply, with the SEB charging for wheeling the power, the =
tariff rates should be raised for the non-industrial sectors and the state =
should be prepared to subsidise the loss of revenue, if it actually occurs,=
 to the SEB. The new capacity will then be determined not arbitrarily but w=
ith reference to ground realities in each state.

In short, the states will get additional power to the extent they need and =
deserve. There will be no excess capacity created by the IPP as in the case=
 of Maharashtra after DPC started generating in the first phase itself. It =
was also pointed out that by yielding a given percentage of demand from exi=
sting industrial users  the loss of demand would materialise only when the =
new project is completed by the IPP in about three years' time and not imme=
diately. In the meantime the state could attract new industries with refere=
nce to the additional capacity that will become available to it at the end =
of three years and, if such new demand materialises, there will be no net l=
oss of demand or revenue to the SEB.

The new arrangement will involve tripartite agreements between the IPP, the=
 industrial consumers and the SEB which will agree to wheel the power at a =
predetermined rate. The IPP can have the comfort of getting a PPA with the =
industrial consumers based on acceptable bank guarantees or escrow accounts=
 of the consumers. The consumers will have the comfort of getting the requi=
red quantity of power of the right quality. The SEB will also have time to =
set up new distribution facilities to wheel the power through dedicated lin=
es if necessary, and also to the new industries that will be set up to take=
 the loads that will be released by hiving off the existing industrial user=
s. SEBs can be net gainers by getting wheeling charges and by getting a mor=
e rational power tariff structure or government subsidy for cross-subsidisa=
tion.=20

Having thus established the quantum of additional capacity to be establishe=
d in each state, which can be calculated with reference to the parameters m=
entioned above, the IPPs should have been asked to send competitive bids fo=
r the determined capacity and not have memoranda of understanding (MoU) for=
 their own notional capacities at their own rates without any competition. =
This arrangement will enable states to get the right amount of additional p=
ower at competitive rates and also not need any state or central government=
 guarantees and will be a purely commercial transaction. There will also be=
 no occasion for the state to have surplus capacity arising from IPP-determ=
ined capacities based on government guarantees.

The other advantage will be that new capacities will be in the range of 400=
 to 6000 MW and they  can also be distributed among the states with referen=
ce to their demand patterns and willingness to rationalise their tariff str=
uctures. The states and their consumers will get power at competitive rates=
 and in the quantities they need and deserve. The Planning Commission propo=
sal had also worked out illustratively how the working of the proposal will=
 determine additional capacities in a few states and the beneficial impact =
on the finances of SEBs in these states.

No one has asked the power ministry to explain why this suggestion was not =
accepted. It was obviously for the reason that this would scuttle the arran=
gements they were keen to have with IPPs for gold-plated projects of high c=
apacity beyond the states' needs and at exorbitant rates of return. As the =
saying goes, you can wake up a sleeping man but not one who is pretending t=
o be asleep. As a result of the power ministry ignoring the proposal of the=
 Planning Commission the country is paying a high price and eventually the =
taxpayer and the consumer will carry the burden in one form  or another.

Direct transfer to industrial consumers at this stage will be possible only=
 if the power rates are acceptable to the consumers who are not committed t=
o take the power at rates determined under the one-sided agreement with Enr=
on. In fact they are asking for direct supply from some of the cheaper sour=
ces and the SEB is unwilling to pass on these demands to existing cheaper s=
ources and to buy power from the mast expensive source.=20

Learning by undoing=20

Taxpayers will pay for government's folly=20

For a lay person looking at the continuing controversy on Enron's Dabhol Po=
wer Company (DPC)  it might appear that it is the Maharashtra state electri=
city board (MSEB) and the state government that are at fault for not meetin=
g their contractual obligations under the power purchase agreement (PPA). I=
t would therefore seem natural that DPC has issued a pre-termination notice=
 to MSEB  since MSEB is not paying up on time. But is the story that simple=
? No. There are two reasons for saying this. The first relates to the struc=
ture of the PPA, and the second to the groundwork done by MSEB to sustain t=
he project. Both Madhav Godbole and EAS Sarma - chairman and member of  the=
 committee that advised the state government on the future course of the pr=
oject - are of the  view that a proper investigation should be carried out =
on the entire deal and into how such a PPA was agreed to. This suggestion d=
id not find a place in the final report as it was regarded to be beyond the=
 committee's terms of reference. Even after signing the PPA, the MSEB did n=
othing to improve its financial position to withstand the impact of the pro=
ject. This has now started to tell on the state which was once regarded as =
a haven for investments.

If the idea that the PPA be re-opened is accepted, the DPC forfeits all con=
tractual rights. The counter-guarantee will also automatically become nothi=
ng more than a scrap of paper. It is, therefore, not surprising that DPC is=
 not keen on following the recommendations of the Godbole report. Enron, th=
e main promoter of the project, is keen to wash its hands of the project an=
d repay its foreign lenders so as to maintain a clean image internationally=
. There should be no heartburn for the Indian financial institutions on thi=
s score, since this is precisely what they agreed to when they financed the=
 project and also offered guarantees to international lenders. In case the =
central government gets pinned down to paying the termination amount, the t=
axpayer, whose money it is which will be paid out, has a right to ask why, =
by whom and for what reason such a lopsided PPA was entered in the first pl=
ace. Why should the consumer be paying now for mistakes made by politicians=
 and government officials who were ostensibly walking up the so-called "lea=
rning curve" in the privatisation of power?

Enron unplugged

An effective dialogue can still save the Dabhol project

WHATEVER else might be said about Enron's preliminary notice to terminate i=
ts Dabhol power project contract, it does at least help to concentrate mind=
s. A  solution to the problem must be found in six months. That is the time=
 available before a final termination notice becomes due and final accounts=
 have to be settled. So Maharashtra and the Centre no longer have the optio=
n of letting things drift. A decision has to be taken and taken soon. It wi=
ll help that process if Maharashtra and the Centre develop a joint approach=
. That has not appeared to be the case so far. The Union Power ministry has=
 given the impression that the excessive cost of Dabhol power is really Mah=
arashtra's problem and there is not much it can do to help. That was the me=
ssage from the absence of a representative of the Centre at the May 11 meet=
ing of the re-negotiating committee. But with loans worth $1.4 billion from=
 domestic lenders at risk from termination of the project, and IDBI, ICICI =
and the State Bank of India hitting the panic button and urging the Finance=
 ministry to get involved, the prospects for focussed action by the Centre =
have improved.

Another round of talks with Enron is scheduled this week. There appear to b=
e two solutions to explore. Some experts have suggested that if Maharashtra=
 does not need more power and is struggling to pay for what is available fr=
om DPC at present, the only way out, when DPC Phase II goes on stream, is f=
or the power to be sold outside the state. The Union Power ministry has app=
arently studied alternative scenarios for the purchase of DPC power but not=
 found them feasible. When Enron says, despite the termination notice, it r=
emains interested in a constructive dialogue it has new buyers in mind and =
rules out the other solution which is the one Maharashtra has been working =
on. Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh insists on renegotiating terms and is =
supported in this by the Godbole committee which has pointed out how the hi=
gh cost of DPC power can be brought  down. Enron is set against renegotiati=
ng terms but needs to be persuaded to be open minded and to look at the ame=
nded terms Maharashtra is proposing.

Reworking terms, such as all costs being dollar-denominated, looks like the=
 only realistic way to break the impasse. If Maharashtra cannot afford to p=
urchase DPC power it is highly unlikely any other state government will; an=
d private corporations will undoubtedly look for and find better options. T=
he basic issue is as Deshmukh  says, the ''exorbitant power tariff''. The f=
irst solution - selling power outside Maharashtra - fails on that ground. A=
n effective dialogue with Enron will have to be conducted at a different le=
vel. It is more than a dispute about a commercial contract. The political l=
eaderships in New Delhi and Washington will be concerned about the fallout =
from this dispute on investment flows. New Delhi would like to see more for=
eign investment come to this country and Washington would like to see India=
's doors remain open to foreign and American investment. So both capitals s=
hould consult about ways of ending the dispute quickly.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
Messier and messier=20

GIVEN THE LEVEL of acrimony and mutual distrust, it is no surprise that Dab=
hol Power Company chose to issue a preliminary termination notice to the Ma=
harashtra State Electricity Board, initiating the process to invalidate the=
 power purchase agreement. It is only the latest in a logical sequence of s=
teps  taken by Enron, the principal promoter of Dabhol Power Company, over =
the last few months. The MSEB and the Maharashtra Government find themselve=
s in a corner only because they have been responding with too much of chest=
-thumping, macho rhetoric and too little of business and tactical sense. At=
 all times Enron seemed to be one step ahead of the MSEB.=20

There is a lot at stake in what happens to the project. The MSEB, the Mahar=
ashtra Government, the Centre and a whole lot of financial institutions -- =
IDBI, ICICI and SBI -- are in for trouble if Enron goes ahead and terminate=
s the power purchase agreement. That Enron was moving towards quitting the =
project was evident in April when DPC invoked the political force majeure c=
lause, while Enron also sought the lenders' approval to issue a notice of t=
ermination. Quitting the project also ties in with Enron's decision worldwi=
de to get out of managing assets and instead concentrating on trading in en=
ergy products.=20

Right from the time Enron was invited by the then Sharad Pawar Government i=
n 1992, the Dabhol project has been dogged by controversies. All political =
parties are equally responsible for the mess as politics has dominated the =
decision-making at all times, when pure economic and business sense should =
have prevailed. The present Democratic Front Government in Maharashtra, wan=
ting to get back at the Shiv Sena-BJP, got carried away and chose to fight =
its battle through the media.=20

Even now, there is time for negotiation. But for this the MSEB and the Maha=
rashtra Government, not to mention the Centre, should display sincerity. Th=
e effort should be to reopen the power purchase agreement, with Enron's con=
sent rather than unilaterally, and see how the tariff can be brought down. =
One, it is generally believed that the cost of the regassification facility=
 is for the entire five million tonnes per annum of gas that Enron proposed=
 to import and not for the quantum of gas that will be used by the power pl=
ant. The  negotiations should ensure that the fixed cost covers only that p=
art of the  regassification facility which is used by the power project.=20

Two, the rate of return for Dabhol Power Company is widely believed to be a=
bout  30 per cent, when other independent power producers get only around 1=
6 per cent. It must be seen if this can be brought down, at least to 20-25 =
per cent. However, even if the tariff is brought down substantially to, say=
, Rs 3.30 per unit, it is doubtful if the MSEB will have the revenues to pa=
y for all the power generated at 85 per cent plant load factor. For that to=
 happen, the MSEB should  be reformed -- the technical losses and theft mus=
t be drastically cut, and the  tariff rationalised to eliminate cross-subsi=
dy.=20

The preliminary termination notice may also be a chance for the MSEB and th=
e  Maharashtra Government to extricate themselves. However, they will need =
the cooperation of the Centre and the financial institutions. The notice sh=
ould not just be treated as an act of brinkmanship by Enron. The American p=
ower utility's willingness in coming to the negotiation table will be known=
 tomorrow, when the Godbole Committee is expected to meet. If and when Enro=
n decides to terminate the power purchase agreement, it is estimated that t=
he State will require about Rs 15,000 crore to pay off the utility.=20

Maharashtra has to convince all concerned that this is the best way out, th=
en auction the power plant and the gas terminal separately. In the process,=
 it may still end up with some loss. But that may be the better option than=
 being saddled with an asset with which the MSEB has no idea what to do. Th=
e MSEB and the State Government should use this opportunity to convince the=
 international lenders and investors that their problem is only with the pr=
esent owners of the power plant and that Maharashtra is as investor-friendl=
y as ever. For this to happen, politicians should take the backseat and let=
 professionals, perhaps a reputed consultant, not former or serving bureauc=
rats, do the  negotiations.

BUSINESS STANDARD, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
Enr-off and Enr-out

The Dabhol power project seems to be heading for a denouement, along two pa=
rallel  tracks. The company itself, there can be no doubt, is getting ready=
 to dump the project and   pull out, just weeks before trial runs are due t=
o start on the 1,444mw second phase (the  first phase of 740mw has already =
stopped producing power). Dabhol Power has presumably seen the obvious: tha=
t there is no way in which either the Maharashtra State Electricity Board o=
r the Maharashtra government will be able to meet  their contractual obliga=
tions and guarantees on power purchase. In its present form, therefore, the=
 project is as good as dead and one might as well recognise the fact.=20

Can the project be revived, and if so on what sustainable terms? A re-negot=
iation committee has been put together and will meet Dabhol's representativ=
es on Wednesday. But three members of the committee have already walked off=
, citing one reason or other, so the re-negotiation process hasn't got off =
to a propitious start. Then, given the unpromising history of earlier re-ne=
gotiations and the incompetence with which MSEB has handled its original ne=
gotiations, it is far from clear whether anything substantial can be extrac=
ted from Dabhol - especially if Dabhol is clear about the legal ground on w=
hich it stands.=20

One must presume that Dabhol's promoter, Enron, and its American lawyers ha=
ve sewn up a watertight deal, without the bungling that has typified the In=
dian handling of the matter.  So it is likely that the cost of killing the =
project will be heavy indeed, and perhaps  unbearable, for both MSEB and th=
e Maharashtra government. Keep in mind the cost of the project ($2.9 billio=
n, or about Rs 14,000 crore) plus the present value of future profits foreg=
one - and profits are said to be in the region of 30 per  cent of equity, e=
very year. The numbers are staggering. Is there a way to not pay such a bil=
l? Yes, there are two possible options. One is for MSEB to reform its power=
 tariff structure (90 per cent of its customers are subsidised), cut its tr=
ansmission losses (which are as high as 30 per cent), and then to persuade =
the central  government to allow Dabhol power to be sold to other users as =
well.=20

The Godbole committee's first report, submitted some six weeks ago, suggest=
s that if handled this way, Dabhol can still be made a workable proposition=
 - provided some re-negotiation of tariffs is done. Dabhol has said it is w=
illing to re-negotiate, but with its typical in-your-face style has asked f=
or the moon in return (among other things, tax breaks of all kinds). Since =
agreeing to such terms will only add to the existing scandal of past mis-ne=
gotiations,  and since MSEB is not about to reform itself in a hurry, the p=
rospects for successful  re-negotiation of a reasonable and workable tariff=
 are slim. The second way of avoiding footing an impossible bill is to go t=
he extra-commercial route, and use diplomatic pressure so as to force the c=
ompany to compromise substantially. But since Enron is among the firmest su=
pporters and biggest financiers of the new US  president, it is difficult t=
o see diplomatic pressure achieving very much, unless President Bush recogn=
ises a one-sided deal when he sees one, takes into account the bad odour th=
at might settle on other American companies and Indo-US relations in genera=
l, and leans gently on Enron to compromise. However, these are will-o'-the-=
wisp hopes and prayers, and no strategy can be predicated on their success.=
 What does that leave with MSEB and the Maharashtra government? The answer =
is: the Godbole report. On which, read on.=20
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS STANDARD, Tuesday, May 22, 2001
The Godbole findings

The Godbole committee's first report, submitted on 10 April, is an eye-open=
er to what can only be called a massive scandal. It leaves several players =
- MSEB, successive  Maharashtra governments, the Kirit Parikh re-negotiatio=
n exercise, the Central Electricity Authority, and other players in New Del=
hi - with no clothes on. MSEB claimed that it had negotiated a tariff that =
was lower than would result from applying the central government's standard=
 formula. But this was patently fraudulent, because the comparison was base=
d on wrong numbers, incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions =
(one rupee-dollar rate for the Dabhol tariff, another for calculating the  =
government formula), all of it designed to establish what was not true.=20

Asked in court why there had been no competitive bidding, the answer (belie=
ve it or not)  was that MSEB was not competent to handle competitive biddin=
g. But it was so wonderfully capable of handling direct tariff negotiations=
 that it eventually gave Dabhol a higher tariff than Enron had initially so=
ught, before the negotiations began! That's only for starters. There is muc=
h more in the Godbole report. On the basis of a passing comment in an FIPB =
meeting, that the project's costs were broadly in line with other similar p=
rojects, the power secretary in New Delhi tells the Central Electricity Aut=
hority that the CEA's techno-economic clearance is not required - though th=
is is statutorily mandated. The CEA agrees to this untenable proposition, b=
ut later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose =
minutes were not made available to the Godbole committee.=20

The re-gasification project that was made part of the power project had a c=
apacity to handle 5 million tonnes, though Dabhol itself needed only 2.1 mi=
llion tonnes. A port facility had similar excess capacity. Yet the entire c=
ost of these facilities was loaded on to Dabhol, along with the full cost o=
f the 20-year gas supply contract. Thus, as the Godbole committee observes,=
 what should have been a variable cost was converted to part of the fixed c=
ost, which MSEB would have to service through a capacity charge, whether an=
y power or gas was bought or not. Even the power requirements of Maharashtr=
a were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a warning from the World Bank t=
hat the Dabhol power would not be needed. This was done by assuming that in=
dustrial demand for power would grow overnight at twice the earlier rate, a=
nd that MSEB itself would overnight see a dramatic worsening of its operati=
ng  parameters. There is still more in the report, but the point should be =
obvious.=20

What the report shows is that the Dabhol contract can be subjected to legal=
 test (as in fact two members of the Godbole committee recommend), on the g=
rounds that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense=
 If a favourable judicial decision becomes possible, that should help mitig=
ate the costs of  winding up a truly scandalous project. For reasons that a=
re not clear, MSEB and the Maharashtra government have chosen not to go dow=
n this route. Perhaps they have greater and continuing faith in the re-nego=
tiation process.=20

Enron to quit India over unpaid bills POWER PROJECT COOLING-OFF PERIOD LOOK=
S UNLIKELY TO SETTLE ACRIMONIOUS DISPUTE=20
BETWEEN US  COMPANY AND BOMBAY CLI: KHOZEM MERCHANT

The US power company Enron is set to withdraw from India after a row over u=
npaid bills that has overshadowed the country's biggest single foreign dire=
ct investment. The Houston-based company has issued a "preliminary terminat=
ion notice" to its Bombay client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (=
MSEB), ending an acrimonious eight-year relationship. Enron's Dollars 2.9bn=
 (Pounds 2bn) power project near Bombay was a symbol of India's economic re=
forms but critics, including the World Bank, said its tariffs were excessiv=
e and the company was portrayed as a profiteering multinational. Enron's an=
nouncement at the weekend concludes a disappointing chapter in the history =
of India's power sector, which lies at the heart of attempts to improve gro=
wth and ease poverty. The British company PowerGen and Cogentrix of the US =
also quit recently, frustrated by red tape or because they were seeking hig=
her returns elsewhere.=20

A six-month cooling-off period - as mandated in the power purchase agreemen=
t - follows but is unlikely to yield progress. Enron will then issue a fina=
l termination notice and present a claim for compensation. "This is the end=
-game for Enron. It is a great day for us," said Pradyumna Kaul, a manageme=
nt consultant and leader of Enron Virodhi Andol (Anti-Enron Movement). "Ind=
ia produces electricity from coal at a unit cost of about Rs1 (about 1.5p).=
 Enron is using liquefied natural gas as a fuel and charging a unit cost of=
 Rs5. Neither Indians nor Indian manufacturers can afford Enron's expensive=
 energy," he said.=20

Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which operates the Bombay plant and in which En=
ron has a 65 per cent share, said that "after months of working to find a s=
olution, it is apparent that MSEB and the government of Maharashtra are unw=
illing to honour their commitments". DPC criticised the Indian government f=
or its "unwillingness to assist MSEB and the Maharashtra government in eith=
er buying power, or providing credit support behind other buyers". MSEB owe=
s the US company Dollars 45m for power consumed in December and January. Bu=
t the utility is refusing to pay until its claim for Rs4.2bn (Pounds 63m) f=
or "Enron's technical failures" is settled.=20

Enron, which has come under increasing pressure from its international lend=
ers to get tough with MSEB, has twice invoked the Indian government's guara=
ntee on unpaid bills. But in the most recent instance, New Delhi refused to=
 pay until MSEB's own claims were settled. Enron's tariff is typically thre=
e times higher than that of other independent power producers because of th=
e high cost of naphtha and a depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. =
Phase one of Enron's project, a 740MW plant fuelled by naphtha, came on str=
eam in May 1999, and phase two, a Dollars 1.87bn site of 1,624MW capacity d=
esigned to run on cheaper liquefied natural gas, will be completed in the n=
ext few months. Enron employs 11,000 people in India. www.ft.com/energy=20

Financial Times, May 21, 2001
 India's power struggles: Enron's plight could mark a turning point in Indi=
a's attempts to attract foreign investment, David Gardner:

The soap opera of Enron in India has reached a critical moment. Once again,=
 the US energy company is pitted against the state of Maharashtra, in weste=
rn India. But the twist this time is that Enron is threatening to pull the =
plug on the Dabhol Power Company, the single largest foreign investment in =
India. It is, at first sight, a wearisome repetition of earlier episodes. T=
he Dollars 2.9bn Dabhol deal has been in trouble before. In 1995, a rightwi=
ng Hindu nationalist coalition of the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata party =
- now the majority of the ruling coalition in New Delhi - ousted the Congre=
ss party government in Maharashtra and tore up the contract its predecessor=
s had signed. The project went ahead after Enron secured a sovereign guaran=
tee from the government of India to cover any failure to pay by the Maharas=
htra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's sole customer.=20

The first 740MW Dabhol plant is now functioning and a second 1,444MW phase =
is close to completion. But MSEB has been defaulting on payments since last=
 December and wishes to renegotiate the contract with Enron, claiming the e=
lectricity tariffs are unjustifiably high. This weekend Enron began proceed=
ings to terminate the agreement. The move triggers an arbitration process t=
hat could begin as soon as Wednesday between Dabhol and the MSEB. But Enron=
's actions are beginning to look like the first step towards withdrawal fro=
m the project, in which it has a 65 per cent stake. In the past 18 months, =
Cogentrix of the US, National Power of the UK, Daewoo of South Korea and El=
ectricite de France have all withdrawn from the Indian power sector. Of eig=
ht so-called "fast track" power projects authorised by New Delhi in the pas=
t decade, Enron's is the only one to have been commissioned.=20

Whatever the outcome, a great deal is at stake. The imbroglio could further=
 deter a barely detectable trickle of foreign direct investment into India.=
 It could blight India's urgent need to double its electricity generation. =
And it raises the question of the extent to which contracts are enforceable=
 in India - which alone could raise the risk premium future investors may s=
eek. Unless carefully handled, the controversy could damage India's ambitio=
n to raise growth by creating an investment-friendly environment, in spite =
of the success of industries such as software and pharmaceuticals. Kenneth =
Lay, Enron's chairman, said earlier this month that while his company had n=
o immediate plans to sell its Dabhol stake, the dispute "sends a very bad s=
ignal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties of investing in India=
, which is not what India needs right now". Several ministers, including Ya=
shwant Sinha, finance minister, have said they see no reason why Enron's ex=
perience should deter foreign investors. That is true only in the sense tha=
t there is very little foreign investment anyway. "The government is in den=
ial," one minister admits. Publishing foreign direct investment figures has=
 become "an annual embarrassment", he adds. India received an estimated Dol=
lars 2.6bn in inward investment last year, or 0.24 per cent of worldwide fo=
reign direct investment flows. Complete figures for 1999 show it received D=
ollars 2.2bn. China, its regional rival, received Dollars 63.4bn - includin=
g Hong Kong - according to the United Nations. In just as telling a contras=
t, Electricite de France, which pulled out of India after battling for seve=
n years to advance its 1,000MW Bhadravati project, is proceeding with a ser=
ies of power plants in China, Egypt and Mexico.=20

"We say we want foreign investment in the power industry and the policy say=
s 'yes, yes, yes'," says one civil servant who has soldiered long and hard =
to introduce reform. "But the practice, I'm afraid, is 'no, no, no'." The E=
nron project, its critics say, is particular. Although Dabhol's power purch=
asing agreement with the MSEB is confidential, it is widely believed to emb=
ody a "hurdle rate of return" - the after-tax, internal rate of return on e=
quity in dollars - in excess of 20 per cent. The normal rate sought by the =
dwindling investors in India's power industry is 16-18 per cent. In additio=
n, Dabhol's charges per kilowatt hour are higher than anticipated because i=
ts "load factor", or capacity usage, is much lower. The financially strappe=
d MSEB is buying less and Enron's contract allows it to apply variable char=
ges over the fewer units of output, raising the cost. There is an important=
 sense, however, in which all this is academic. India's state electricity b=
oards are de facto bankrupt. Whether the cost per unit is one rupee or 10, =
they cannot pay.=20

The problem is user charges. Most Indian farmers get free power, much of In=
dia's urban middle class steals power and too many of India's populist poli=
ticians are frightened of agreeing on a minimum common tariff that might be=
gin restoring the solvency of the state electricity boards and thus facilit=
ate investment. Many industrial users that could pay, angered by cross-subs=
idies they are charged for the inefficient system, have switched to secure =
"captive" capacity of their own, an estimated 10,000MW of which is now in p=
lace. While India needs to boost installed capacity by about 100,000MW by 2=
010, with no one to pay for electricity a mere 464MW was commissioned last =
year, according to Power Line, an industry newsletter. "It is self-defeatin=
g to try to attract an Enron without first putting your house in order," on=
e minister says. "It was always obvious that within the present set-up Maha=
rashtra would never be able to pay." Hari Dhaul, head of the Independent Po=
wer Producers of India, says restoring the solvency of "the (state electric=
ity boards) is priority number one; unless we do that, all talk of power an=
d infrastructure is academic." The government made a start when Mr Sinha, i=
n the February budget, announced a still-to-be-determined package of soft l=
oans  for states that reform their electricity boards and begin introducing=
 more realistic tariffs. But since then the government has floundered over =
a series of scandals - not a propitious climate for reform. The Enron case =
has the potential to become, if not another scandal, at least a blight. As =
a senior executive at a foreign power company puts it: "India needs modern =
infrastructure if it is ever to become a modern country. It needs foreign i=
nvestment to do part of it but that will only come if the perception become=
s that it is easy to invest in India." Copyright: The Financial Times Limit=

India's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country.=
 The project had serious drawbacks. But unless energy companies can expect =
a commercial return, they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructur=
e. Unless contracts are honoured, few foreign companies will consider India=
 as a place to do business. The Maharashtra state electricity board, the Da=
bhol plant's only customer, is refusing to pay its bills, arguing that the =
tariffs are unjustifiably inflated. Prices are certainly high. The plant, f=
uelled by expensive naphtha, is running way below capacity due to unexpecte=
dly low demand, further increasing unit costs. More difficult to judge is w=
hether this is within the terms of the contract, since Enron is keeping the=
 details confidential.=20

The argument over unit costs, though, is in any case less relevant than it =
might seem as most of India's state electricity boards, including Maharasht=
ra's, operate at a large loss. Many consumers pay highly subsidised rates. =
Many pay nothing. Bills go uncollected. Half of Delhi's electricity output =
is stolen, mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than light =
bulbs for the poor. Bankrupt state utilities are then periodically bailed o=
ut to the detriment of spending on health and education. India's state auth=
orities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff and a more targe=
ted form of subsidy. This may be unpopular, but the central government's of=
fer of Dollars 5.6bn, raised via a bond issue, to pay off the electricity b=
oards' debts should sweeten the pill. A new pricing regime is only the firs=
t step. Electricity generation, transmission and distribution should be unb=
undled and privatised. Contracts should be awarded through competition, not=
 by arrangement with the relevant political party. This would require much =
more transparency than many of India's politicians have been ready to conce=
de.=20

Enron's difficulties over the Dabhol plant, the largest foreign investment =
in India, have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar p=
rojects. This will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages =
that hinder economic development. But the effect will reverberate well beyo=
nd the energy sector. India receives a pitifully small slice of the world's=
 foreign direct investment. Infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one fac=
tor. But as important is the readiness of Indian politicians to manipulate =
foreign business for their own ends.=20

Maharashtra pays the price for bad governance: Dispute with Enron has calle=
d into question its status as India's preferred home for
investment, KHOZEM MERCHANT

Bal Thackeray's legacy as the power behind the throne of Maharashtra, India=
's richest state, included an informal "flyover index". As leader of the Sh=
iv Sena party
 that ruled Maharashtra in a coalition for four years from 1995, he sanctio=
ned 55 new road bridge flyovers at a cost of Rs180bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in Bomb=
ay, the financial capital. The flyover index, it was said, reflected the in=
ept government and fiscal profligacy with which his party's ruled ended in =
1999. "I don't much care for
 finance and foreign investment, I don't understand these things," Mr Thack=
eray told the Financial Times last year. The Hindu militant's comments dama=
ged investor sentiment already reeling from his warning of "blood on the st=
reets" if he was arrested for his role in communal riots a decade earlier. =
Shiv Sena is a regional party named after the Hindu warrior god, Shiva.=20

Debt and demagogy were the hallmarks of a man who embodied a regional asser=
tiveness that was at odds with an emerging reformist economics. It was in t=
his environment that the US power company, Enron, entered India with the co=
untry's largest ever direct investment and set the scene for a test of gove=
rnance. As afrustrated Enron inches closer to quitting India after a protra=
cted legal battle over contracts and payments, some are saying that here is=
 an outstanding example of how there is an economic price to be paid for be=
ing badly governed. Maharashtra has also lost a car factory investment to T=
amil Nadu and a business school to Hyderabad, both globally prestigious pro=
jects squandered amid charges of corruption. Now Maharashtra's status as th=
e preferred home for inward investment - helped by Bombay's status as the l=
eading business city in the country - is under pressure. Its volatile polit=
ics have undermined the rule of law and foreign investors
 are alarmed by official abuse of the sanctity of contract. "Good governanc=
e will bring in good investment; bad governance will attract bad investment=
," says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the Centre for Monitoring Indian=
 Economy, a think-tank in Bombay.=20

Both Enron and the state were condemned for the way they put in place the D=
ollars 2.9bn investment. Maharashtra "got expensive power generation before=
 solving the bigger problem of power distribution. This is bad governance a=
nd it led to bad administration," said Mr Vyas. The news has not all been b=
ad. For instance, from a standing start Maharashtra is now second only to B=
angalore as a centre for software services, in spite of the fact that it of=
fers no obvious comparative advantage, such as Bangalore's excellence in en=
gineering and sciences. This is partly explained by Maharashtra's historica=
lly sound civil administration, which despite the surrounding political vol=
atility, continues to work for, rather than against, business. A reformist =
and inclusive tradition befitting a port city attracted social campaigners =
as well as businesses fleeing the declining colonial capital of Calcutta.=
=20

Bombay's financial status, too, blossomed from its link with the Gujarati b=
rokering class, whose influence has only now been tamed after yet another s=
hare-price rigging scandal. "With these advantages, complacency set in," sa=
ys Professor Mangesh Korgaonker, who heads the management school at Bombay'=
s acclaimed Indian Institute of Technology. The state's growth rate of betw=
een 6-8 per cent over the past decade outstripped national performance. "Ma=
harashtra did not need to shout to gain investment, unlike its upstart riva=
ls. But the historic advantage has been shaken," says Prof Korgaonker. This=
 means that for the first time since the state emerged along with neighbour=
ing Gujarat from the larger territory of Bombay in the 1960s, Maharashtra i=
s losing out to rival states, where the rule of law and political stability=
 are strong attractions. The upshot is a renewed urgency to shift the state=
's axis from low-value manufacturing to IT,
media and entertainment, such as "Bollywood", as well as financial services=
.=20

The state is promoting these alternatives not only because of the potential=
ly damaging consequences of the Enron dispute on foreign direct investment =
or because a flawed financial system may deter investors. It is doing so be=
cause of property prices that are among the steepest in the world and an ov=
erburdened transport network, which together raise the costs of doing busin=
ess in Maharashtra. Implicit in this process is an attempt to secure best p=
ractices, via regulatory changes, in areas such as public accountability, i=
nvestor protection and corporate ethics. "The quality of governance now has=
 a market valuation," says Dr R Patil, the former managing director of the =
National Stock Exchange, a rare technology driven-bourse where Bombay's cor=
rupt broker oligarchy holds no sway. "Bombay First" embodies these sentimen=
ts. Modelled on asimilar initiative in London, "Bombay First" is an attempt=
 by the city's chamber of commerce and business to project the city as a re=
gional financial centre. The aim is to compete with Singapore and Hong Kong=
. That implies legislative changes to gain an offshore status. It also mean=
s easing pressure on property prices by releasing land for development nort=
h of costly central Bombay. Some of the city's biggest financial names have=
 already shifted operations north of Bombay, to a cluster known ambitiously=
 as the new financial district. But as Prof Korgaonker says, where business=
 is conducted may count for nothing without a change in how business is con=
ducted in the new Maharashtra.=20

Ally threatens to desert BJP coalition,  DAVID GARDNER

The government of Atal Behari Vajpayee, reeling from a series of scandals a=
nd regional election setbacks, faced a new crisis last night as a key ally =
threatened to desert it. The crisis, the result of regional squabbling in t=
he tiny, north-eastern state of Manipur bordering Burma, shows how vulnerab=
le Mr Vajpayee's Bharatiya=20
Janata party (BJP) has become to blackmail by its junior coalition partners=
. The Samata party said it would pull out of the New Delhi government after=
 the BJP abandoned the Manipur chief minister in a vote of confidence yeste=
rday in the regional assembly. The fall of the regional government also dra=
matised the loss of national authority of the BJP leadership, which had ins=
tructed its local members of parliament to support the Samata administratio=
n. Samata leaders in Delhi, however, chose to view the events as a "back-st=
abbing" by the BJP. Samata is still smarting from the resignation of its le=
ader, George Fernandes, as defence minister, and Jaya Jaitley, its party pr=
esident, caught up in a cash-for-arms scandal in March. The defection of 12=
 Samata MPs would further weaken Mr Vajpayee's coalition, at a time when se=
veral allies of the BJP are wondering whether they are being politically da=
maged by association with the Hindu revivalist party.=20

Needing 272 MPs to command a majority in parliament, Mr Vajpayee would be d=
own to 279 if Samata left. But that thin majority includes the 29 MPs of th=
e secularTelugu Desam party of Chandrababu Naidu, the reformist leader of A=
ndhra Pradesh. Even before the BJP's current troubles, Mr Naidu maintained =
a careful distance from the government while voting with the coalition. Tha=
t distance appears to be increasing. One reason is that the BJP is increasi=
ngly turning for help to itsshadowy parent organisation, the Rashtriya Sway=
amsevak Sangh (RSS), even though other RSS front organisations in the trade=
 unions and among farmers are leading a campaign to eviscerate the coalitio=
n's economic reform programme. The dismal outlook for reform, fears for the=
 government's stability and the weekend threat by Enron, the US power compa=
ny, to pull the plug on the biggest single foreign investment in India, com=
bined to unsettle markets yesterday. The rupee slid by 4 paise to Rs46.98 a=
gainst the dollar, close to the psychological barrier of Rs47. Concern abou=
t the Enron dispute, meanwhile, sharply depressed the share prices of leadi=
ng banks with exposure to the Dollars 2.9bn Dabhol power project near Bomba=
y, in which Enron has a 65 per cent stake. Enron announced on Saturday that=
 it had begun the legal process of withdrawing from its contract with the M=
aharashtra State Electricity Board, frustrated at its failure to pay for Da=
bhol's power. The state authorities raised the stakes yesterday - slapping =
a second Rs4bn (Pounds 59m) penalty on Enron for breaks in supply - ahead o=
f an arbitration meeting tomorrow.=20

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Power corrupts...

APROPOS of Enron's notice to the government of Maharashtra, Mumbai should a=
ct pragmatically instead of indulging in heroics and rhetoric. It should se=
t its own house in order, improve MSEB's functioning and quickly privatise.=
 If it fails to do these its threat to Enron will also be taken as just ano=
ther case of demanding kickbacks.=20
Mulo Gandhi, Pune=20

The record till date IT is sad really that Enron had to issue its pre-termi=
nation  notice. We should now ask whether MSEB would be able to construct s=
uch a project in record time. Corruption is rampant in MSEB. They may say E=
nron power is not needed, but you cannot even get a new connection easily. =
Interruptions are commonplace in rural areas (sometimes up to four times a =
week). Power thefts are commonplace too. Each day, on average, we pay MSEB =
about Rs 6 per unit for commercial connections. But most people would be wi=
lling to pay Rs 7 or so if they got clean, uninterrupted power. We have see=
n, for example, the vast cost overruns of many  of the official water manag=
ement projects. These overruns go up to 20 times, with delays stretching up=
 to 10 years -with no guarantee no results even then. All told, the governm=
ent is sending very wrong signals to the international community by raking =
up the Enron controversy. It should set its own house in order.=20
