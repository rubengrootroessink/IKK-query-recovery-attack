Centre seeks 60 days extension in Dabhol conciliation period , Santosh Tiwa=
ry=20

The Centre has asked Dabhol Power Company  (DPC) to extend the conciliation=
 period for settling the issue of payment of the December 2000 bill by Maha=
rashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).Top government sources told Business=
 Standard that the request seeks to extend the date by two months beyond th=
e present deadline of June 7 as the conciliators have decided to conduct pr=
oceedings on three consecutive days beginning July 23. They added that in t=
he absence of an extension of the conciliation period, the whole process wo=
uld come to a cropper even before starting. The delay in proceeding was mai=
nly on account of the differences in the appointment of a third conciliator=
, officials said.=20

After a delay of more than a month, the two parties have now agreed to appo=
int David AR Williams QC, a former judge of the New Zealand High Court as t=
he third conciliator. The conciliation between DPC and the central governme=
nt started on April 9, after DPC agreed to accept the Centre's stress on co=
nciliation  instead of arbitration, in response to its notice. While pointi=
ng out that the reason for delay in the conciliation process was the absenc=
e of a third conciliator, the Centre has now said that in order to allow th=
e conciliators to complete their job, it was necessary to extend the period=
 of conciliation. Sources said that the central government has asked DPC to=
 respond at the earliest, so that the government's conciliator could be inf=
ormed accordingly. Earlier, DPC had appointed Laurence Street as its concil=
iator for resolving the issue of non-payment of the December bill of Rs 102=
 crore with the central government. Street is a former Chief Justice of New=
 South Wales, Australia.=20

The Centre has appointed chairman Law Commission Justice BP Jeevan Reddy as=
 its conciliator. The notice to the Centre, on April 4, was issued by DPC a=
fter the former conveyed to the company that until the availability of the =
penalty issue was resolved, it did not intend to pay the December bill unde=
r the counter-guarantee. The MSEB has slapped a Rs 402-crore availability p=
enalty on DPC and has demanded adjustments for it against the outstanding b=
ills for December 2000 and January 2001.

MERC stays DPC arbitration=20

The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) on Tuesday evening=
 issued an injunction restraining the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) from proce=
eding with the arbitration process till June 14. Granting another ad-interi=
m relief to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the MERC has al=
so restrained DPC from operating the board's escrow account till June 14, w=
hen the next hearing is scheduled. The MERC conference room was packed with=
 reporters and anti-Enron groups, in addition to the counsel for DPC and MS=
EB. The proceedings, for most part of the day, revolved around the jurisdic=
tion of the MERC to adjudicate and arbitrate in the DPC imbroglio. The MSEB=
 on Friday petitioned the regulator over the apparent unavailability of pow=
er from DPC in violation of the power purchase agreement (PPA).

Advocate general Golham Vanhavatti, counsel  for MSEB, said: "Under clauses=
 6 and 7 of the PPA, DPC had represented that it would set up a  power plan=
t under specific characteristics and parameters. The DPC in its presentatio=
n to us had assured of a 180 minutes ramp up time from a cold start on the =
basis of which the availability declaration was made. On three occasions MS=
EB did not receive power from the DPC within this stipulated time frame." H=
e added that while DPC claimed that the MSEB could not give it despatch ins=
tructions according to agreed convention, any such convention to be enforce=
able would have to be in the form of an agreement signed by both the partie=
s, as per the PPA. DPC's counsel Atul Setalvad sought two weeks'time from t=
he commission to study the petition, which he claimed was effectively avail=
able to the DPC counsel only on Monday. Setalvad, however, said he was not =
in a position to give an assurance to the commission that DPC would not ope=
rate the escrow.=20

MSEB stops taking DPC power=20

MSEB stopped drawing power from DPC on Tuesday. Confirming the same, MSEB c=
hairman Vinay Bansal said: "DPC had written to our banks to activate the es=
crow. From 12 noon on Tuesday we have stopped drawing power from DPC. While=
 there is a clause for arbitration in the PPA with DPC, the law of the land=
 has superceded the same. We are beyond the agreement now." Senior MSEB off=
icials and those in the Maharashtra government felt that the interim MERC r=
uling has effectively placed DPC and MSEB on a level playing field. A senio=
r government official said: "The escrow freeze imposed on DPC by MERC means=
 that the former will not be able to divert around Rs 400 crore from the MS=
EB account in Canara bank." Canara bank is the sole receptor of the Rs 5,50=
0-odd crore collected annually by six other receiving banks of MSEB.=20

The Union government has come out with a set of proposals for solving the p=

w deal with DPC. Godbole, however, refused to spell out what these proposal=
s were. He was speaking to newspersons after the second round of discussion=
s with representatives of Enron and DPC. Asked whether the company had agre=
ed to a reduction in tariffs, Godbole said, "It is too early to talk of spe=
cifics at this stage." He added that the two sides had decided to meet agai=
n but the date had not been fixed as yet. The second round of discussions a=
ssume importance as this was the first time that the Centre had deputed its=
 representative A VGokak for the meeting. Gokak said that the Centre was ke=
en on resolving the issue and it would play an "active role" in solving the=
 problem.=20

The solution should take into account the interest of all four sides, MSEB,=
 the state government, the Union government and DPC. Well-placed sources sa=
id that Gokak had made it clear that the Centre will not buy power from the=
 project but will function as a facilitator. Enron India managing director =
K Wade Cline said, "We had a very good meeting and a variety of issues were=
 discussed. We have not submitted any proposal. This is an ongoing process.=
" State energy secretary V M Lal told reporters that discussions were held =
on all issues that hindered the progress of the project. He refused to elab=

 MSEB stops power purchase from Dabhol Power

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has stopped power  purchase =
from Dabhol Power Company (DPC) from 12 noon on Tuesday. This decision come=
s in  the wake of its May 23 decision to rescind the power purchase agreeme=
nt (PPA) with DPC. MSEB has been purchasing only 180 mw of power from Dabho=
l phase-I.  MSEB has made it clear that discontinuation of power purchase w=
ill not affect the supply situation in  the state. With Tuesday's decision,=
 the proposed commissioning of block B (722 mw) of Dabhol  phase-II from Ju=
ne 7 hangs in the balance as there is no buyer for the power generated.  MS=
EB, in a communication to DPC, said it was convinced that  the company's co=
nduct was not bonafide and as such it has rescinded the PPA, it would not l=
ike to continue to purchase power.

MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal told reporters that as the PPA had been rescinde=
d through its "avoidance" notice, the question of payment of fixed charges =
to DPC does not arise in the changed circumstances. MSEB, in its communicat=
ion, strongly criticised the DPC for initially turning down a cheque of Rs =
136 crore towards April bill "under protest" and later demanding it.MSEB ma=
de it clear that it will make the monthly payments under protest or not pay=
 it at all as it was not inclined to accept any conditions from the DPC.  A=
t the hearing before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MER=
C) on Tuesday, the advocate general Ghulam Wahanvati, while making a strong=
 plea for the admission of MSEB's petition on rescinding of PPA also referr=
ed to the MSEB's decision in this regard.

MSEB, in its "avoidance" notice, said it had agreed to continue the present=
 arrangement of power  purchase and payment till disputes were resolved by =
the appropriate forum, so as to minimise loss  and inconvenience. For such =
supply, MSEB had agreed to make payments to DPC as provided  under the PPA,=
 "but such payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determi=
nation of reasonable compensation and quantum merit by a competent forum". =
However, MSEB stopped power purchase as DPC denied the charges of material =
misrepresentation and questioned the present arrangement to continue when t=
he PPA had been rescinded.=20

DPC's foreign lenders may invoke FI guarantees to pare counterparty limits =
,   Raghu Mohan

FOREIGN lenders to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are veering around to the=
 view that they will have little choice, but to invoke the guarantees issue=
d by domestic term  financing institutions to pare counterparty limits to t=
hese entities if the covenants under "events of  default" are triggered.Whi=
le it has been gathered that DPC has not defaulted in loan servicing to its=
 clutch of lenders, this is just one of the covenants. There are other poin=
ts on which a reneging can be construed as an "event of default". Charges a=
nd counter-charges emanating from DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity=
 Board (MSEB), and talk of "adjustable claims" have been cause enough for t=
hese lenders, in general, to slam brakes on fresh disbursements to DPC over=
 the last month.

A loose consensus among the foreign bankers/lenders is now gaining ground t=
hat it is better to invoke the guarantees. Well placed sources in foreign b=
anks said that their exposure to DPC backed by financial institutions (FIs)=
 amounted to them jamming their counterparty lines to these bodies, and act=
ed as a hindrance in taking on fresh credit exposure - be it fund-based or =
non-fund based."What is the point in having non-remunerative counterparty l=
imits? We could as well have taken on a direct exposure on DPC," a senior f=
oreign banker said while pointing out that the irony in corporate banking i=
s that guarantees are issued with a "tacit understanding" that they will ne=
ver be called up.

FIs have been prevailing upon international lenders not to invoke the guara=
ntees, citing "relationship reasons" as part of their overt efforts to curt=
ail the looming threat of non-performing assets (NPAs) well in excess of Rs=
 5,000 crore. Pressure though is mounting on foreign banks to take a stand =
one way or the other over the issue of FI guarantees. Many with an exposure=
 to DPC, and having local presence seem to be of the view that "they cannot=
 hold on indefinitely" hoping that there will be a way out of the current i=
mbroglio.

While such a move will increase the fund-based exposure of FIs to DPC, and =
lead to an even bigger NPA situation, foreign banking sources said that "co=
mmercial interests will force us to invoke  these guarantees", while adding=
 that pressure is now on to look at new business avenues. These  woes, sour=
ces explained, will also influence their decision to finance DPC's cost-ove=
rruns with disbursements now on hold.

The flip side to any decision by foreign banks to invoke FI guarantees is t=
hat such covers may not be made available when they lead-arrange cross-bord=
er loans to domestic corporates. Top-of-the-line corporates may well secure=
 a stand-alone cover from a foreign bank, but the remaining will have to lo=
ok elsewhere.A recent move on the part of by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI=
) that forex loans are not be calculated as part of foreign banks Tier-1 ca=
pital while drawing up exposure limits to corporates from fiscal 2002 may a=
lso catalyse a decision to invoke FI guarantees. Many a foreign bank will b=
e forced to revisit their country-limits or sell assets to comply with the =
RBI diktat.

MERC restrains DPC from operating escrow=20

THE Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) on Tuesday, in  an=
 ad interim relief for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) "in t=
he larger public interests", restrained the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to o=
perate an escrow account of Rs 5,000 crore annually and take any steps or m=
easures to implement its arbitration process under clause 20.3 of the power=
 purchase agreement (PPA).However, the DPC is likely to challenge the MERC =
order in the Mumbai High Court. MERC chairman P Subrahmaniam and members, V=
enkat Chary and Jayant Deo, in their ruling said  that they are convinced t=
hat MSEB has disputes against the DPC and prima facie they are of the view =
that the MERC has a jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such disputes and diffe=
rences between utilities.

The board, in its petition filed on May 24, had said that the DPC be restra=
ined from taking any steps or measures in furtherance of any of the escrow =
agreements/notices including amended and restated escrow agreement and the =
collection of agreements from reactivating the escrow account or from in an=
y manner drawing, utilising, enjoying, or accessing funds in the escrow acc=
ount. MSEB had pleaded that in the event that escrow account has been activ=
ated the status quo ante be restored by appropriate mandatory direction.Fur=
ther, MSEB, in view of commencement of arbitration proceedings shortly at L=
ondon after the appointment of third arbitration by the DPC, had pleaded th=
at the DPC be restrained by a temporary injunction from taking any steps in=
 that regard. State advocate general Ghulam Wahanvati, appearing on behalf =
of the MSEB, strongly pleaded that the MERC should not only give an ad inte=
rim relief but also admit its petition as it has the jurisdiction under sec=
tion 22 (2) (n) of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998 to adjud=
icate upon disputes and differences between utilities and if required refer=
 it for arbitration.

"Parliament through the 1998 Act has created central electricity regulatory=
 commission and state  electricity regulatory commission as dispute resolut=
ion bodies. They have exclusive jurisdiction and thus the question of arbit=
ration does not arise," Mr Wahanvati said. He added that the DPC has misdec=
lared and defaulted on the availability of power on January 28, February 13=
 and March 29 and thus was entitled to pay rebate of Rs 401 crore only for =
January 28 default. However, DPC made a turnaround on an agreed formula by =
a curve on the availability of power.

Mr Chary wanted to know whether the DPC had provided a substandard plant. M=
r Wahanvati, in his submission, said that the power plant is not of the sta=
ndard which the board had proposed and thus, it was not mere "misdeclaratio=
n but a fraud". At the outset, DPC counsel Ashok Setalwad questioned the au=
thority and jurisdiction of MERC to entertain MSEB petition and sought two =
weeks time to thoroughly go through the MSEB petition to consider its posit=
ion.  The company also claimed that the MERC has no jurisdiction to enterta=
in any dispute between the DPC and the escrow agent/bank, arising out of th=
e escrow agreement. At one point of time, the DPC counsel remarked that the=
y were constrained to leave today's hearing as they are of the view that ME=
RC has no jurisdiction. However, after a snub from the MERC chairman and me=
mbers, the DPC counsel withdrew his remarks.

THE BJP-led government at the Centre, which has come under severe attack fo=

 for the resolution of the issue. He said it would not be proper to go into=

d any proposal of how it would cut tariff by 10 per cent, he declined to co=

Dr Godbole said that the date of the next meeting has yet to be decided. Mr=

DPC offers to hold talks with MSEB on tariff reduction ,  Sanjay Jog

THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which had issued a preliminary  termination=
 notice, on Tuesday has gone one step backward and offered to hold talks wi=
th officials of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for carrying=
 out 10 per cent tariff reduction. The meeting will take place on Wednesday=
. DPC is likely to be represented by its chief financial officer Mohan Guru=
nath and another official Rajesh Shivaraman while MSEB's accounts' member A=
 Krishna Rao would lead its team at the talks.

MSEB sources told The Financial Express that DPC submitted this proposal on=
 Tuesday at the meeting of Madhave Godbole renegotiations committee for the=
 Dabhol project. "DPC stuck to its proposal of 10 per cent reduction, which=
 was made at the committee's meeting held on May 11. The company said that =
it was prepared to hold talks with MSEB officials on the methodology to be =
adopted for tariff cut," sources added.The DPC, which expressed its desire =
to continue its participation during renegotiations, said that it would als=
o submit the necessary data while carrying out an exercise of tariff reduct=
ion. The company is believed to have told the committee that it would seek =
a nod from lenders and shareholders before giving a concrete proposal on th=
is front.  "We are quite keen to know what is the basis for the tariff cut =
and thus have agreed to meet DPC officials on Wednesday. During the course =
of time, DPC will finally submit a concrete proposal to  the committee," so=
urces said.  Once DPC would comes out with a concrete proposal, the committ=
ee has agreed to hold its next  meeting.

According to sources, the Centre's nominee and former bureaucrat AV Gokak w=

Dabhol Power's Indian lenders to meet today=20

INDIAN lenders to the Dabhol project, led by Industrial Development Bank of=
 India (IDBI), have decided to meet on Wednesday here with the main objecti=
ve of persuading offshore lenders against precipitating matters and to requ=
est them to show restraint. The lenders are expected to chalk out a common =
strategy in the wake of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) de=
cision to scrap the power purchase agreement (PPA) with Dabhol  Power Compa=
ny (DPC).Domestic lenders have an exposure to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore to=
 the Dabhol project. IDBI, with an exposure of Rs 2,158 crore in the projec=
t and a guarantee for Rs 1,528 crore to the offshore lenders, has taken the=
 initiative to convene the May 30 meet. Unlike the foreign lenders to the p=
roject, Indian financial institutions (FIs) do not have any guarantee cover=
 for their exposure.

The domestic lenders meeting on Wednesday precedes a meeting by foreign len=
ders, who have convened a meeting in Singapore on June 5 and 6 to decide on=
 the future course of action on the DPC-MSEB imbroglio. The meet is expecte=
d to be attended by the representatives of IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India=
, Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) and Canara Bank.The FIs fe=
el that if Enron ultimately decides to pull out at this stage, terminating =
the PPA, it will have  serious consequences with regard to the investments =
made by the FIs in the project. It is widely held  that domestic non-fund-b=
ased exposure of local FIs will go up if international lenders were to invo=
ke the guarantees extended by them. This is expected to enhance the corpus =
of non-performing loans and thereby, require more provisioning in their res=
pective balance sheets.

MSEB versus Enron, advantage MSEB

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) got an upper hand today in i=
ts tug-of-war with Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) after the first reneg=
otiation meeting. The MSEB stopped drawing power on the grounds that it con=
sidered the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) void. It's action was further bo=
lstered when the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) gave =
it an interim relief restraining the DPC from activating the escrow account=
 or going ahead with the international arbitration proceedings.=20

Almost as if giving the state a helping hand, the Centre finally moved prop=
osals to resolve the dispute. This marks a departure from the earlier hands=
-off approach of the Centre and may work out favourably for the state. ''We=
 have stopped taking power from noon today,''a top MSEB official said after=
 the meeting of the renegotiation committee. The Board's action follows May=
 25 letter of DPC managing director K Wade Cline in which the latter had as=
ked the MSEB 'to make up its mind that either it rescinds the PPA or if it =
continues to buy power, the PPA would be considered still valid'. ''We have=
 decided to stop purchase of power from today noon as is in line with our s=
tand over the PPA,''the official pointed out. Continuing purchase of power =
 would have meant that the MSEB considered the PPA valid,he added. In anoth=
er significant development, the MERC today issued an ad-interim relief to t=
he board  restraining the DPC from activating the escrow account and stoppi=
ng further steps in the arbitration proceedings.

Appearing for the MSEB, Advocate General Goolam Vahanvati had sought the ad=
-interim relief. Since, the DPC had sought two week's time to decide on its=
 reply to the petition by the board before the commission. DPC's legal coun=
sel, Atul Setalvad had raised doubts over the jurisdiction of the MERC to t=
ake decision on                    the disputes arising between the board a=
nd DPC over the PPA. Earlier, Vahanvati had stressed that the MERC had excl=
usive jurisdiction to hear the petition over the dispute between two power =
utilities. Although the PPA between DPC and board was an international agre=
ement, the law of the land was supreme and the MERC, formed under an act en=
acted by the parliament had jurisdiction to deal with the petition, he asse=
rted. Further hearing of the petition will be held on June 14. The renegoti=
ation talks also made some headway today with the Centre finally showing it=
s willingness to take an active interest in the process.

In the meeting of the Godbole panel, Centre's representative A V Gokak pres=
ented some proposals to resolve the dispute. ''In today's meeting the Centr=
e clarified its stand over the issue and mooted some proposals to resolve t=
he dispute,''Godbole told reporters after the meeting. Gokak struck an opti=
mistic note over the fate of the renegotiation and said that the Centre wil=
l play an active role in  the process. He hoped that the panel will be able=
 to come out with a workable solutions. Cline, who also attended the meetin=
g with DPC officials, said the company will participate in the next meeting=
 of the Godbole renegotiation panel.

Endgame Enron, at least for now=20

Despite negotiations, it's still rough weather for Enron. The Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) has asked the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to s=
hut down its plant from 12 noon on Tuesday as it has decided to stop buying=
 power from it.In a letter dispatched to DPC officials Tuesday morning, the=
 MSEB board has stated that the decision to stop buying power from DPC is t=

Following this development, the Phase II project, which was expected to com=

uction measures. The tariff renegotiation committee will now meet on Wednes=
day to discuss the issue of tariffs. Apart from MSEB and DPC, representativ=

so attend the meeting.

``In the second round, our discussions were good and the dialogue will cont=
inue. However, the next date of the meeting will be fixed later,'' state en=
ergy secretary V M Lal said. DPC managing director Wade Cline also echoed t=
he sentiment and said, ``We discussed a variety of issues.'' Asked if DPC h=

Centre rejects proposal to buy power from Dabhol=20

The Centre said on Tuesday that it would not buy costly power from the cont=
roversial Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company, currently engaged in a legal=
 battle with Maharashtra authorities over power  purchase agreement, despit=
e a proposal from the state  government. "How can central utilities buy pow=
er from DPC and sell it elsewhere when it is not possible for Maharashtra g=
overnment to buy it," power minister Suresh Prabhu said  in an interview. "=
A solution has to be found out which will have to be both in the national i=
nterest as well as acceptable to the investors... By asking the National Th=
ermal Power Corporation to buy power we can't have a solution," he said.=20

Stating that he had made his stand clear to the Maharashtra chief minister =
Vilasrao Deshmukh when hecame with the proposal to meet him and finance min=
ister Yashwant Sinha, Prabhu said, "What appears a solution  can prove to b=
e a precursor to a problem later." In the wake of the ongoing fight between=
 DPC and Maharashtra State Electricity Board over the payment issue and leg=
alities of power purchase agreement, Deshmukh had asked the Centre to bail =
out the state by instructing NTPC and Power Trading Corporation  (PTC) to b=
uy power from the second phase of DPC, to be commissioned later this year.=
=20

Prabhu said states were the users of the electricity and not the Centre, wh=
ich was only playing the role of a  facilitator by generating and supplying=
 power. Asked if Enron controversy would affect foreign investment in the p=
ower sector, Prabhu said "though there are apprehensions amongst foreign in=
vestors and lenders,                                        but there are a=
lso countries which have shown keen interest in India's power sector."=20

On inter-state rading of power through PTC, the minister said the corporati=
on had not yet started functioning and modalities for the same were being w=
orked out by the two ministries of power and finance. Secretary, power, A k=
 Basu would hold discussions with his counterpart in the finance ministry s=
oon to decide the structure of PTC, Prabhu said. Though Enron's local unit =
chief K Wide Cline had sought Centre's intervention in the ongoing feud wit=
h MSEB, when he met Basu last week, he has not yet formally made a case wit=
h the minister.=20

Prabhu said Centre's role in the entire issue was very limited as Dabhol Po=
wer Project was a state promoted project and it was for Maharashtra governm=
ent and DPC to resolve the issue. He however, declined to predict eventuali=
ties arising out of the DPC's preliminary termination notice and MSEB's cou=
nter termination notice. Stating that the final proposal has to be acceptab=

 date has been fixed for the next meeting. Enron and MSEB have been sparrin=

to sell its entire output to MSEB at a fixed price. The row is seen as a te=
st case of India's ability to attract foreign investment in the power secto=

MSEB began buying the 740 mw of power produced by the the project's first p=

The state Cabinet has decided not to proceed with Enron arbitration matters=

 give judgements on matters of dispute related to power generation, distrib=

from activating the Escrow account with MSEB or furthering arbitration proc=

ase Agreement (PPA) with DPC has became void as the latter could not fulfil=
 its condition of supplying MSEB power within three hours of placement of d=
emand.  Sparks flew as DPC senior counsel Atul Setalvad and state Advocate =
General Gollam Mahanvati defended their respective clients tooth and nail a=
t  the MERC yesterday.  Setalvad contested the jurisdiction of the MERC whi=
le Vahanvati insisted that the MERC is within its jurisdiction as the dispu=
te is between affected public policies and not private interests of two com=
panies.=20

 He also cited two Supreme Court judgements on exclusive jurisdiction. Seta=
lvad said his clients did not have enough time to study the notice served o=

MERC chairman asked him if his client would give an assurance, as requested=
 by MSEB, that during this period DPC  would not activate its Escrow arrang=
ement with MSEB or further its rbitration, DPC representatives present ther=
e refused. Vahanvati prayed for an ad interim relief on both counts, which =
was granted by the commission.  During the hearing, it was revealed that MS=
EB had stopped buying power from DPC from 12 pm onwards yesterday. MSEB cha=
irman Vinay Bansal later told mediapersons that MSEB, in its notice to DPC,=
 had conveyed that though the PPA was void, MSEB would continue to draw pow=
er and make payments subject to adjustments in tariff by concerned authorit=
