I am currently planning to be in Europe for most of that time, although I might be back in Houston. I should know in the next few days. Are the Omani's going to be here in Houston for the whole of that period?
 
Thanks,
Jonathan

How do your calendars look June 7-15 for meeting with the guys from OLNG? They are interested in a visit to CMS. Possibly they could be there for the Hoegh Galleon unloading.

Please let me know your date preferences and the names of anyone else that should attend the meetings.
