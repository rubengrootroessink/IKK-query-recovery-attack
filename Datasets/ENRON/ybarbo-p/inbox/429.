Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 10/1/2001.  Please be advised that currently there are no releases in effect after October 31, 2001.  Additionally, there were no new releases that exceeded the max tariff rate.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.


TW Schedulers - Could you please forward this email and the Sept 2001 TW Capacity Release report to Chris Miller (I wasn't sure which one to select from in the Outlook address list)?

Thanks,
Elizabeth
