Latest news reports advise that a cell of 4 terrorists has been
operating in Arkansas. Police advised earlier today that 3
of  the 4 have been detained.

The Regional Police Commissioner stated that the terrorists
Bin  Sleepin, Bin Drinkin and Bin Fightin have been arrested on immigration
issues.

The Police advise further that they can find no one fitting the
description of the fourth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area.
Police are confident that anyone who looks like Workin will be very
easy to spot in the community.
