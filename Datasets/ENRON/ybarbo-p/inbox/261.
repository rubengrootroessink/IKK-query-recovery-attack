DPC lenders take a hard line, oppose MSEB move , Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Mum=
bai

Lenders to the $3-billion Dabhol Power Project are planning to take a hard =
line against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) decision to s=
crap the power purchase agreement.The New York-based law firm, White & Case=
, which is advising the lenders, is of the opinion that the PPA-entered int=
o by MSEB with Dabhol on May 23, 1993-is not exactly an  exclusive bilatera=
l contract. The firm feels that the PPA cannot be scrapped without the cons=
ent of the lenders, who are also stakeholders in the project by virtue of t=
heir debt exposure.=20

Armed with the opinion of DPC's law firm including the Indian Law Institute=
 and the advice of White & Case, the lenders are meeting in Singapore in th=
e first week of June to chalk out  the next course of action. At the meetin=
g, lenders across the board areexpected to oppose the MSEB move as they fee=
l that the failure of the 657 mw phase I project in generating power in tim=
e (cold start in 3 hours) is a breach of warranty which can be settled thro=
ugh arbitration.It cannot be a valid ground for the termination of the PPA.=
 The MSEB had issued the notice toscrap the PPA on May 23, a week after DPC=
 served the preliminary termination notice to the board. DPC served the PTN=
 after the foreign lenders gave their consent despite a stiff opposition pu=
t up by the Indian lenders. However, the lenders did not give DPC the conse=
nt for transfer of assets. The company, has, however appointed Arthur Ander=
sen and Jones Lang La Salle to undertake a valuation exercise of the projec=
t.=20

The MSEB move on scrapping the PPA has unified the entire lending community=
 which was  vertically divided on DPC's action on serving the  PTN. While t=
he Indian lenders-who are not covered by the Centre's counter guarantee-opp=
ose the PTN tooth and nail, the foreign lenders gave the go-ahead to the co=
mpany as they were apprehensive that the MSEB might pull the plug ahead of =
DPC. Now both the Indian as well as the foreign lenders are planning to opp=
ose the scrapping of  PPA collectively. The Singapore meeting will take sto=
ck of the cash position of Phase II of the project which is set to go on tr=
ial run on June 7 and formalise the lenders stance whether to support or mo=
thball the
project.=20

priority. The DF constituents were briefed about the legal steps initiated =
by the state government vis-a-vis DPC, Deshmukh said. The renegotiations co=
mmittee appointed by the state government is slated to meet on May 29, the =
day on which the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission was also to =

 'Centre not to purchase power from DPC',  Sanjay Jog

THE union minister of state for power Jayavantiben Mehta has categorically =
stated that the Centre would not purchase the Dabhol power, but would allow=
 the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to sell its power directly to various other=
 states across the country. "However, the DPC will have to drastically cut =
the tariff. The Centre is prepared to facilitate the direct sale of power b=
y DPC to states which are power deficit," Ms Mehta said in an exclusive int=
erview. Ms Mehta's statement comes in the wake of the DPC's appeal on Frida=
y to the Centre to help resolve the ongoing crisis.

The minister said that although the Centre would not purchase Dabhol power,=
 it would provide necessary assistance to resolve the present impasse. "The=
 Centre will try to protect the interests of the Maharashtra state and ulti=
mately of the National Democratic Alliance government in a bid to find a wa=
y out to overcome the Dabhol crisis," she opined. Ms Mehta said that she wa=
s of the view that efforts should be made to save the Dabhol project especi=
ally when there were several states which had been striving to meet increas=
ing demand for power. She said it is important to meet the demand for power=
 as the country is entering into newer and newer pastures in various segmen=
ts like information technology, software development and oil  and petroleum=
 through joint ventures.  "Similarly, the Indian financial institutions (IF=
Is) have appealed to the Centre that it should take a positive view as thei=
r substantial funds are blocked in the Dabhol project," she added.

The minister also said that there has been tremendous pressure from the IFI=
s to get the project  going. The IFIs have already made representations to =
the Centre on various occasions in this regard. According to Ms mehta, the =
DPC has said that it has three options comprising termination of contract, =
participate in the negotiations and the take over of Dabhol project by any =
agency. "I am quite optimistic that ultimately an acceptable solution will =
emerge," she observed.Ms Mehta said that the people should consider the Dab=
hol crisis against the backdrop of country's  requirement of additional one=
 lakh mega watt to be created by 2012. "The NDA government is committed for=
 this capacity addition despite a huge required investment of Rs 8 lakh cro=
re," she remarked.

Ms Mehta said that the NDA government in general and her ministry in partic=
ular have taken a lot of  initiatives to make this a reality with the activ=
e participation of the private sector. The ministry has  launched a 100 per=
 cent metering programme, improvement and strengthening of transmission and=
  distribution, encouragement for the privatisation of power distribution s=
ystems and implementation of  power development programme across the countr=
y, she added.Meanwhile, the Dabhol Power Company is believed to have projec=
ted that the per unit tariff would  be reduced at Rs 4.20. The per unit tar=
iff will further be reduced at Rs 3.50, when the naphtha would be replaced =
by liquified natural gas (LNG). DPC has already announced that the block b =
of  722 of phase-II would start commercial operations from June 7.

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, May 28, 2001
The great Indian investment movie Ecopinion/ S L RAO=20

THE Dabhol-Enron saga has all the ingredients for an unusual Hindi movie. T=
here is a principal female interest in the (to some) ravishing and (to all)=
 extraordinarily shrewd, determined and tough negotiator, Rebecca Mark. If =
politicians in India are our sleazy side, we have them from many political =
parties at all stages in the unfolding drama. For the comic element we have=
 the bumbling, stuttering, uncertain, and incompetent Maharashtra State Ele=
ctricity Board, always trying hard to please its masters, without any regar=
d to its self-interest. For the patsy, the fall guy, we have the electricit=
y customers of Maharashtra, paying increasing amounts forpoor quality. Then=
 there are the other bit and not-so-bit players - the academics, the NGOs, =
the negotiating and re-negotiating groups, with varying interests, motivati=
ons and influences.=20

But the hero(ine) of the story is undoubtedly Rebecca Mark, who rammed thro=
ugh an agreement that was  opposed by very many and `educated' some of the =
shrewdest political leaders in India.  Her Texan bulldozing ability, never-=
give-up attitude, total focus on her objective, packaged in an attractive f=
emale form, were too much for all her interlocutors, who were elderly men w=
ith no experience of such opponents, and even less so with strong women.=20

Looming above all these characters is the brooding and baleful presence of =
the government of India. What little has emerged from Abhay Mehta and the G=
odbole Report shows its intervention at critical times to ease the way for =
the clearance and signing of the agreement. Apparently there was little con=
cern for what the record would show, as indeed it has since done, that the =
approval of its technical wing (the central electricity authority), was rde=
red, and the clear recommendation of the World Bank, usually a strong suppo=
rter of foreign private investment, ignored. Among the government agencies =
involved, except perhaps the CEA, there was an urgent and overwhelming desi=
re to clear the project.=20

At the same time, the central government had done little of its policy home=
work. It had not defined a clear fuel policy for the country. It could ther=
efore easily sanction naphtha and imported gas based power generation proje=
cts, with consequent cost escalation when the then (temporary) glut became =
a shortage. It refused to accept that the external value of the rupee would=
 keep declining, even though it had just depreciated the rupee by a whoppin=
g 20 per cent. It had little understanding of the movements of internationa=
l prices of oil and gas and assumed that present prices would be the  norm.=
 These factors led to substantial escalations in costs and of tariffs. With=
out any firm plan to use the surplus gas transport and processing capacitie=
s, it agreed to MSEB paying the full fixed charges for gas capacities far i=
n excess of the needs of the power plant.=20

In this movie, therefore, the central government would be cast as the wicke=
d uncle lurking behind the scenes and orchestrating the looting of the fall=
 guy. This movie can have no happy ending. Indeed, one wonders if it can ha=
ve an ending at all. The hero(ine) has  left the scene, as have her courtie=
rs. Her kingdom, Enron, no longer has an interest in the movie and would li=
ke to give it up. The bumbling MSEB and its owner, the Maharashtra governme=
nt, have no clue as to what to do. The politicians are in a corner, wringin=
g their hands, helpless to extricate the country from the mess, but intent =
on saving themselves and their positions. The central government would like=
 to forget the whole sorry episode, but cannot. The country stands to lose =
vast sums of money as fines and compensation payments, and a considerable l=
oss of image, for not adhering to agreements.=20

It also stands exposed for incompetence, a sorry advertisement for a countr=
y with the brains to become an IT `superpower'. Between the two, the exposu=
re of incompetence allied to possible venality, is more  damaging. Our gove=
rnments must stop playing to the grandstand. They must understand that they=
 are playing in an international, not an Indian theatre. Their opponents, E=
nron, have all the cards stacked in their favour. Time is not on our side. =
We must end the movie. That requires that we use our best talents to buy En=
ron out. -

In Guhagarh, the majority couldn't care less, S Ravindran in Guhagarh

Nature is at its best along the 50-kilometre stretch connecting Chiplun, th=
e cultural capital of Konkan, to Guhagarh which houses the controversial Da=
bhol Power Project.Mountains dotted with Alphonso mango trees and the lashi=
ng Arabian sea make the place an  ideal picnic spot. However, along the wel=
l-laid out road leading to Guhagarh, odd huts and barren land reveal the   =
sad economic plight of the region Hopes of the $3-billion power project put=
ting an end to the poverty-ridden life of the people living here seem to be=
 short lived now.=20

Locals today say if Enron was to exit from the controversial power project,=
 there would be only  a marginal effect on the region's economy. A few will=
 suffer if the power major chooses to pack its bags. The majority could not=
 care less. Appasaheb Salagre, called Appa by all and a long-time resident =
of Chiplun running tutorial classes, says, "Initially, there was a spurt in=
 the economy. A number of people found employment in the project. However, =
the bulk of  the 12,000 -odd contract workers were from Bihar, UP, Bijapur =
(Karnataka) and other  regions." The locals are not an educated lot here, s=
ays Appa. They could get only low-paid jobs. These  jobs too were temporary=
 in nature. "Contract labourers would have lost their jobs once constructio=
n of the project was over. This isirrespective of whether Enron decides to =
stay on  or exit," he adds.=20

Concurs Pramod Pednekar, a local journalist with Pudhari, a large-selling M=
arathi daily, "A large number of Enron-officials in Chiplun gave a fillip t=
o the travel business benefiting several  lodges and hotels. Now that the c=
ompany has its own township, these opportunities too have vanished. However=
, a number of people used to come to do their marketing in Chiplun which wi=
ll now be affected. With very few people from Guhagarh employed at the plan=
t, Enron's exit will hit the region's economy by not more than five per cen=
t." Appa adds that a number of locals in Chiplun and Guhagarh had purchased=
 Sumos to carry Enron executives to and fro. These people are yet to repay =
their loans and hence would be affected. "There are 150 such Sumos. Even if=
 one considers that the Sumo owners have large families, only about 1,000 p=
eople will be affected," he adds.=20

The project has its set of supporters too. V S Nathu, the local BJP MLA fro=
m Guhagarh says,  "Guhagarh, like much of Konkan, is dependent on the `mone=
y order' economy. Most people  work in Mumbai and they send money back home=
. For the first time, this was set to change  (after the Dabhol plant came =
into being). Power, good roads and plenty of water is now available  in the=
 region." He also says several other industries could have mushroomed in du=
e course. Besides, if DPC   went ahead with its plans of setting up the LNG=
 terminal, the food processing industry could have also got an impetus. Foo=
d processing precisely requires temperatures of minus 59 degrees centigrade=
, similar to the temperature in which LNG is stored, he adds. Nathu's estim=
ate of families being affected  extends beyond Guhagarh. "A total of 12,000=
 families in Chiplun,  Guhagarh,and the adjoining regions of Dapoli and Khe=
d would be affected if Enron exits," he says,  adding that DPC has also bui=
lt a world-class hospital in the region.=20

Yashwant Bait, a leader of the Enron Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti however disag=
rees. "One, the  power purchase agreement is not for selling  power in the =
region. It is for selling power to MSEB. How would industry come into this =
region as a result? Two, DPC has not done a  favour by building a hospital.=
 It was based on the orders of Bombay High Court. The benefits accruing to =
the local population is minimal as the  hospital does not charge concession=
al rates for  locals."

Scrap Dabhol project, say NRIs , Freny Patel=20

Non-resident Indians (NRIs) in the USA have called for the scrapping of the=
 controversial  Dabhol Power project, dubbing it as the largest  scam India=
 has ever seen. The group of NRIs, under the umbrella 'Enron Action', in th=
eir outcry put up on the website  (www.altindia.net/enron) have stated that=
 under international law, the MSEB can bypass the 'insane' obligations to t=
he DPC only if an Indian court rules that the power purchase agreement (PPA=
) and the agreements surrounding it were in violation of Indian law.=20

A court case was filed by Prayas, an NGO, but has been rejected by the Bomb=
ay High Court.  An appeal against this dismissal is pending before the Supr=
eme Court, the group says. The NRIs group stated that under the laws when t=
he PPA was signed, the agreement required mandatory economic and technical =
clearance from a statutory body (the Central Electricity Authority), which =
has been constituted for this purpose. The CEA issued a technical clearance=
 to the DPC power plant, it refused the economic clearance. Rather it was t=
he ministry of finance that looked into and approved the economic  issues. =
The petitioners are falling back on the argument that the "mandatory CEA cl=
earance was the legal  safeguard against signing PPAs at exorbitant rates.=
=20

As this clearance was never received, they conclude the Dabhol PPA has no f=
orce in law".  The World Bank also categorically stated in its feasibility =
report in 1993, when it was asked to part fund the project, that it was "no=
t economically viable, and thus could not be  financed by the Bank". It wen=
t on to say that it "would place a heavy financial burden on the MSEB" beca=
use it was  "too large for base load operation in the MSEB system". The Wor=
ld Bank letter, written by its India country director Heinz Vergin, identif=
ied the need to reshape "the project to serve higher value intermediate loa=
d in the western Region". The website calls "for transparency, accountabili=
ty, that lost promise called a democracy". Highlighting the chronology of e=
vents and legal suits filed in the past, the website also suggests "a  way =
out" for the Indian state and central governments.

4,000 workers at DPC site without jobs, S Ravindran in Guhagarh

At least 4,000 workers at the site of the Dabhol Power Company are now with=
out jobs. These  are mainly semi-skilled labour and only a fraction of them=
 are from Guhagarh Taluka in Ratnagiri  district, the site of the controver=
sial power project. "About 4,000 to 5,000 workers are jobless. The  contrac=
ts of most of them were coming to an end anyway as the construction is more=
 or lesscomplete. However, the present uncertainty surrounding the project =
has led to an earlier exit,"  said V S Nathu, the BJP MLA who represents Gu=
hagarh Taluka.=20

When contacted, a senior DPC executive said  "this is mainly because during=
 the monsoon a  number of workers are told to leave as construction is not =
possible anyway. Besides, a major part of the construction is now over". A =
total of about 12,000 contract workers were employed at the project site at=
 the height of the project construction. They were not direct employees of =
DPC but of the engineering, procurement and construction  contractor Bechte=
l and various other sub-contractors like Besix, UB Engineering and Paharpur=
 Cooling Towers. Nathu also said that construction had come to a  grinding =
halt at the site in the last few weeks. The DPC executive, however, denied =
that construction had come to a halt though he agreed there had been a slow=
down as lenders had stopped disbursing funds in the last three months.=20

MSEB estimates up to Rs 5 crore legal expenses to fight DPC battle ,  Sanja=
y Jog

FOR the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the ensuing legal battl=
e with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) will really be a "costly" affair. MSEB is=
 prepared to engage lawyers at a fee of paltry Rs 15,000 per hour to a whop=
ping Rs 1.50 lakh. In terms of pounds, it has prepared to shell out a minim=
um of 90 pounds per hour to 500 pounds per hour.MSEB sources told The Finan=
cial Express that according to preliminary estimates, it expects the legal =
expenses in the range of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore. "We will spend it as we =
have a strong case against the DPC for misdeclaration and default on the av=
ailability of power on January 28 and non payment of rebate of Rs 401 crore=
 towards that," sources added.

The lawyer's fees would be dependent on their experience. The more the expe=
rience and the name, the higher would be the fees. "For example, if a lawye=
r, other than Indian origin, has completed one year in the profession, his/=
her fees would start from 90 pounds per hour. However, the lawyer represent=
ing a leading firm with a vast experience, he/she would charge not less tha=
n 450 to 500 pounds per hour," MSEB sources said.In a recent communication =
to the MSEB, the London-based Baker & McKenzie has said the "rate of charge=
s of around 360 pounds per hour are highly competitive compared to other fi=
rms of similar status and experience." The solicitor firm has further said =
that these rates may appear high compared to Indian lawyer's fees, however,=
 their competitors are now charging 420 pounds per hour or more.

These rates would apply to firms such as Linklaters (representing Enron) an=
d the other top firms that  would have the necessary experience to respond =
in kind to Linlaters, the Baker & McKenzie  communication said. MSEB source=
s said that it was aware that it would have to take on a battery of lawyers=
 and solicitors both from India and abroad engaged by the DPC. Further, it =
was also aware of the fact that the US-based multinational Enron, with deep=
 pockets, would not mind fighting its case in  various Indian courts and la=
ter at arbitration in London.

MSEB said that it would engage the state advocate general Ghulam Wahanvati =
during the hearing at  Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc)=
. In addition, it has already engaged Mumbai-based solicitors Shyam Diwan &=
 Company to provide legal assistance. MSEB would also try to rope in the be=
st available solicitors across the country to plead its case in the Indian =
courts. Simultaneously, it would have to pay the fees of its arbitrator and=
 former Bombay High Court Justice ML Pendse during the arbitration proceedi=
ngs in London.MSEB sources said that it was aware that billing rates are on=
ly one part of the equation that leads to  the ultimate bill that a law fir=
m sends to its clients. "The much more significant is the number of hours w=
orked by the number of lawyers. The lesser the number of lawyers, the lower=
 will be the bill," sources added.

Enron woos regulators in era of deregulation ,  Bob Davis & Rebecca Smith

EVERY energy executive in America would have liked a half-hour with Vice Pr=
esident Dick Cheney as he  fashioned the Bush administration's national ene=
rgy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.  Mr Lay used the time=
 to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other things, to head off=
 price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron and other energy tr=
aders with unfettered access to the US's electricity- transmission system a=
nd remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power =
lines. The energy plan President George W Bush unveiled last week re-electe=
d many of those same priorities. In a recent interview, the vice president =
said he also met with other energy executives, but Mr Lay was the only one =
he named. Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lay's advice because "Enron has a dif=
ferent take than most energy companies."=20

Indeed, Enron is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the past =
15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the largest trader of gas=
 and electricity in the US and a formidable player in newer markets such as=
 telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it is =
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.=20

In a certain respect, this is true even in Enron's dealings in India, where=
 the company is in the news this week because of a dispute with a state ele=
ctricity board over that entity's failure to pay $48 million in overdue bil=
ls. Enron was one of the first foreign power companies to enter India when =
the country started free-market reforms in the early 1990s, and Dabhol Powe=
r Corp., its power-generating project outside Bombay, remains India's singl=
e largest foreign investment. Enron's trouble has its roots in the sometime=
s wildly shifting political winds in India; it is facing political barbs fr=
om opponents who attack it as a foreign multinational unjustly milking a po=
or country by charging too much for electricity, a charge Dabhol denies.=20

Politics, however, is a minefield that Enron has very successfully negotiat=
ed in the US. As much as any  American company, it has cultivated close tie=
s with government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based  company, which =
was President Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up its lo=
bbying staff,  boosted its political contributions and sought out friends i=
n the world of politics. Now, with Mr Bush in the White House, it is in a u=
nique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.=20

Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulati=
on. Just as government created  immense telephone, electric and gas monopol=
ies early in the 20th century, Enron and other players feel they need the g=
overnment's help in opening those monopolies and gaining access to once-clo=
sed markets. In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favourable to the compa=
ny. Rather than having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the ut=
ilities,  it wants-those lines to provide open access for new entrants such=
 as Enron eager to buy and sell power.=20

Mr Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush cabin=
et and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas =
governor's mansion with Mr Bush. Before joining the administration, both Wh=
ite House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoe=
llick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annual stipend =
of $50,000.  Under Mr Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr Bush d=
uring his political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and=
 its employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive=
, the  Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center =
for Responsive Politics. Enron also  accounted for $461,000 in contribution=
s during Mr Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Publi=
c Integrity.

Mr Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from governme=
nt is a fair shake. Enron  supports candidates "you believe in," he says. "=
You believe in their value system, you believe in their  philosophy and you=
 believe they'll do the right things as leaders."  But it is clear that Mr =
Lay wants more than that from government. For now, he is focusing on FERC, =
where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was known as the Federal=
 Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power=
 of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesal=
e transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as =
the chief navigator of the nation's transition to a fully deregulated energ=
y marketplace.=20

Even before Mr Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market power=
 of utilities. In December, it told the nation's utilities that it wanted t=
hem to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines-those that can dispat=
ch electricity across state lines-to independent grid operators, such as th=
ose already in place in  California and the Northeast United States, which =
would provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to s=
ubmit plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish co=
ntrol of their lines to such independent organisations.=20

Mr Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct contr=
ol of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls en=
ergy "Balkanisation" and create "seamless" interstate electricity markets. =
"Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the co=
mpetitive side of the business," says Andre Meade, an analyst for Commerzba=
nk. "To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows down."  Ri=
ght now, it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly control=
led markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout and risk=
-management acumen to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it freq=
uently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.=20

In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants, s=
ometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using =
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the=
 power, finds a buyer, and then arranges delivery via transmission lines ow=
ned by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale =
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for electr=
icity in the first quarter alone.=20

Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979 mil=
lion and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over the=
 same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than four=
fold. At the start of the Bush administration FERC's future was very much u=
p for grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron=
 quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush name=
d a friend of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulato=
r Pat Wood. Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort =
to open Texas' retail electricity market. Mr Wood also had shown the kind o=
f backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation whe=
n he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opene=
d their networks to competitors.=20

For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utilit=
y regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block a =
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and =
by Republican Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked =
it out of the Philadelphia market.A White House spokeswoman says a number o=
f individuals and industry groups weighed in to favour Ms Brownell, but she=
 declined to name any. Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts t=
o strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the comm=
ission. Earlier this year, the company hired two of former Vice President A=
l Gore's closest friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and M=
r Gore's campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms =
Breathitt through Democratic politics.Ms Breathitt says she wasn't very fam=
iliar with Enron's interests, but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited h=
er to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro, E=
nron's managing director for government affairs. "Everyone likes to get to =
now the FERC commissioners," Ms Breathitt says, adding that she always pays=
 for her own meals.

Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr Lay has been friendly=
 with both Democratic and  Republican administrations over the past 25 year=
s, sharing time on the golf course with Presidents Bill  Clinton and Gerald=
 Ford. He's been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the lat=
e l980s, he ran  fund-raising drives in Texas for the current US president'=
s father, then-Vice President George Bush. After the younger Bush became go=
vernor, he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governor's Business Coun=
cil. Mr Lay also made Enron's fleet of corporate jets available to the new =
governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects.=
=20

Mr Lay says he hasn't sought Mr Bush's aid directly since Mr Bush won the p=
residency. "It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting=
 around and having drinks," he says.  Not all Mr Lay's initiatives have bee=
n successful. When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight g=
lobal warming by requiring reductions in carbon-dioxide levels produced by =
burning hydrocarbons, Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain. "The=
 scientific evidence, although certainly not conclusive, is  pretty compell=
ing that there could be a climate-change problem," he says he told the vice=
 president. "The  administration should still look very seriously at it."

But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheney's energy task force. I=
n April, Mr Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and =
later, with Mr Cheney. In both meetings, say Enron and White House official=
s, Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical s=
ystem and wed the gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both=
 cases, he argues, pipelines and transmission lines should be like the fede=
ral highway system that offers easy access to all. The Cheney report uses s=
imilar language, describing the electrical grid as the highway for intersta=
te  commerce in electricity." As Enron sought, the report directs the energ=
y secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to e=
stablish a national grid, and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission s=
ystem as well as how to remove them.

MSEB plans an acid test for DPC Phase II Vinu Lal

AS June 7 deadline nears for Enron-promoted DPC to declare the commencement=
 of Phase II, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has finalised its =
plans to conduct a performance test on the plant. This assumes significance=
 because in case the plant fails to deliver full capacity according to the =
power purchase agreement, the board will have the right to declare the plan=
t unviable. Enron has already defaulted thrice and the board has slapped Rs=
 768 crore as penalty, which is a matter in dispute.Confirming this plan, a=
 top official in MSEB said, ``Once they declare commercial production, we w=
ill undertake a capacity test by asking them to shut down the plant complet=
ely for atleast 2 days and then perform a cold start. If they do not achiev=
e full rated capacity (657 MW) within three hours then we will declare the =
plant as inefficient.''

MSEB has already formed a core team comprising six technical officers to wo=
rk on block 1 of Phase II expansion project. As per the agreement the compa=
ny is scheduled to start commercial production on June 7 and should furnish=
 a seven-day notice to the board to gear up to the capacity addition. Sourc=
es added that while commissioning a block, there are provisions in the powe=
r purchase agreements to do a performance test for both the parties, viz MS=
EB and DPC. Unlike periodic reviews of the plant, this test would be crucia=
l since an official added that once the plant does not qualify in the initi=
al capacity check, then the board could declare the plant as unviable.

Energy experts informed that under section 5.3 of the PPA, immediately afte=
r commercial production, there will be a technical capacity check where all=
 parameters of the plant will be put to test. Here since the company has be=
en charged of misdeclaration and that the plant failed to deliver power wit=
hin 180 minutes from a cold start, this test will be quite crucial. Sources=
 added that the cold start timing will be amended only after the project is=
 shifted to liquefied natural gas, when instead of 180 minutes, the plant w=
ould get 240  minutes to achieve full rated capacity. But this will not be =
applicable to Block 1 of Phase II since the project will be run by naphtha.

``It's just impossible to achieve full rated capacity in 3 hours after a co=
ld start especially after a long period of idle time. The plant took five a=
nd a half hours to achieve its full capacity on January 28, where the plant=
 was instructed to stop operations for 6 days,'' said an MSEB official. Sou=
rces added that the ramp up curves                                        i=
ncorporated in the PPA is a technical goof-up since  ramp up time depends o=
n how long the plant was kept idle.MSEB officials informed that there was n=
o notice given by the company yet on the June 7 deadline. They added that t=
he company has to furnish a seven-day notice to the board before declaring =
commercial production.                                      =20

 Interestingly, the turbines used for Phase II project are not sourced from=
 General Electric but from Japanese companies. However, experts argue that =
3 hours ramp up time for any cold start would still prove an uphill task fo=
r the company.

DPC may challenge MERC's jurisdiction

Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is likely to challenge the jurisd=
iction of state electricity regulatory Commission (MERC) to settle a pletho=
ra of disputes, including "rescinding" of the PPA with Maharashtra State El=
ectricity Board (MSEB) during the first hearing of the case, scheduled for =
May 29."One cannot deny the possibility of DPC's legal intention as the mul=
tinational strongly believes that the PPA of its $3 billion project, does n=
ot come under MERC's perview at all," legal officials involved in the DPC-M=
SEB row told PTI here today. However, MSEB's legal counsels feel DPC would =
be unable to prove their point if it took the "jurisdiction" angle.

MERC is a specialised body set up by Parliament in 1998 as part of the powe=
r sector reforms to regulate PPAs and procurement processes of transmission=
 and distribution utilities. "This includes the regulation of the price or =
tariff at which power shall be procured," they contend. As per section 22 (=
2)(N) of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act of 1998, the state regul=
ator has been conferred powers to "adjudicate upon disputes and differences=
 between licensees and ultities and refer the matter for arbitration." On M=
ay 25, MSEB had moved merc challenging the agreement's legal validity and s=
eeking cancellation of the PPA and claiming nearly Rs 700 crore as damages =
from DPC.

Terming the move as a "logical step", a state official said MSEB had sought=
 Justice from MERC as it had exclusive legislative jurisdiction to adjudica=
te disputes between two power utilities. With such an emphatic regulation, =
on what grounds would DPC insist that its PPA with MSEB did not come under =
MERC, the counsels said. "After all, DPC and Maharastra State Electricity B=
oard are both power utilities and the only dispute redressal forum availabl=
e is the regulator," they said.

Interestingly, counsels are of the view that if DPC does not attend the hea=
ring or refuses to comply by the regulator's notice, then MSEB would have t=
o prove its "service of summons" upon which the Commission is entitled to g=
ive an ex-parte hearing on the matter. The 60 page petition, with nearly th=
ousand pages of annexures, prays that MERC should adjudicate MSEB's dispute=
s with DPC, including the Rs 401 crore rebate payable by the us multination=
al and mainly misrepresentation of facts involving the ramp-up procedure fr=
om a cold start to full capacity.

The loss-making board has also referred numerous notices, the "political fo=
rce majeure", the preliminary termination notice, DPC's demand for the escr=
ow cover and its subsequent defaults in ramping up generation as per demand=
. Maharastra State Electricity Board has also sought the regulator's direct=
ion over whether it should take up international arbitration, process for w=
hich is on, with DPC in London."With a suitable order, MERC will now tell u=
s how to deal with the arbitration, escrow cover, damages etc," an Maharast=
ra State Electricity Board official said.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Monday, May 28, 2001
Defusing Dabhol=20

In the present brouhaha over the Dabhol power project, it's all too easy to=
 lose sight of one fact: there is life  beyond Enron. And the eventual deno=
uement will have implications far beyond this particular project. At stake =
is India's image as a credible investment destination. Little is gained by =
winning a war if you then end up losing the peace. It's important to rememb=
er that, because positions on both sides seem to be hardening. The Madhav G=
odbole Committee has criticised the power purchase agreement in no uncertai=
n terms. The demand and realisation projections on which the deal was based=
 have been described as a ``fairy-tale''. Two committee members have called=
 for a judicial enquiry into the entire issue, to determine whether Enron r=
eceived any "undue favours". But three members disagree, at least partly be=
cause judicial inquiries in India take forever and rarely achieve anything.=
 Enron, in turn, has flatly told the Centre  that it is unwilling to negoti=
ate on the basis of the Godbole  Committee's report. Meanwhile, the Maharas=
htra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has slapped a termination notice of its=
 own on Enron's subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), and is demandin=
g compensation of over Rs 800 crore. The MSEB contends that DPC failed to s=
upply power at short notice and wrongfully withheld rebate payments. DPC cl=
aims that the MSEB is wilfully misinterpreting the power purchase agreement=
. Clearly, both sides are now engaged in trying to stare the other guy down=
. In earlier instances, it was a safe bet that Enron would blink first. But=
 if the signals emanating from the company's headquarters in Houston are an=
y indication, that can't be taken for granted this time.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario - that the talks do fail. What message=
 would that send out to the international community? India could, of course=
, argue that the deal was flawed, but that would be tantamount to acknowled=
ging that the negotiators who clinched the power purchase agreement were ei=
ther criminally incompetent, or venal, or both. The fact that the deal was =
signed by a different administration after the previous agreement was scrap=
ped would only weaken India's position, as would the dismal fate that has b=
efallen virtually every high-profile foreign investment in the power sector=
. There would be a real danger of India ending up with egg on its face, apa=
rt from having to pay hefty fines. Of course, it may not come to that - in =
fact, let's hope it doesn't. Talks are still on, and the ideal situation wo=
uld be for all parties concerned to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement=
. Failing that, India should seek an out-of-court settlement which would at=
 least leave it with the fig-leaf of being a country which respects  contra=
ctual obligations. It should then finally start acting on all the brave tal=
k of sweeping power sector reforms, which would hopefully prove that we sti=
ll mean business. Does that mean that the people responsible for this frigh=
tful mess should be allowed to just walk away? Of course not. There are man=
y lessons to be learnt from the Enron fiasco, including the importance of a=
ccountability and transparency at every step of liberalisation. But the fir=
st priority has to be to put out the fire and contain the damage. Investiga=
ting the arsonists can wait till later.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Monday, May 28, 2001
Dabhol project: Politics of power , S. Padmanabhan=20

IT ALWAYS looked as if the Maharashtra Government had a definite plan while=
 renegotiating with Dabhol Power Company (read Enron). The plan perhaps was=
 to get some cosmetic changes in tariff and give DPC large benefits such as=
 sales tax exemption for naphtha; reduction in interest rates of loans; and=
 third party sales in the hope of getting the Centre to make NTPC and a few=
 other Central utilities buy the costly power. This would look as if the co=
ntract has been renegotiated to ease the burden on Maharashtra when in fact=
 the burden would have been distributed among several States and the Centre=
. The ultimate beneficiary would be Enron which would continue to keep a co=
ntract executed so blatantly against public interest. The  real objective o=
f the Maharashtra Government and perhaps the Centre is to give  the controv=
ersy a decent burial. The party was spoilt by a statement by the Nationalis=
t Congress Party President, Mr Sharad Pawar, criticising the re-negotiating=
 Committee Chairman, Mr Madhav Godbole. The latter resigned, but was convin=
ced to retract it. But it cannot be forgotten that it was Mr Pawar as Chief=
 Minister of Maharashtra, who had bypassed a lot of objections to give the =
project to Enron.=20

Now it has become convenient for the Maharashtra Government to say that the=
 State is suffering because of the decisions of the BJP-Shiv Sena Governmen=
t. While the role of the BJP-Shiv Sena Government in reopening and permitti=
ng Phase  II and integration of the LNG terminal, by which means Enron can =
recover the  capital costs many times over, is utterly deplorable, it can n=
ot be lost sight of that it was Mr Pawar's government that brought in Enron=
. As Mr Praful Patel rightly said in STAR News' Newshour, the project had t=
he blessings also of the then Prime Minister, Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, and h=
is Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. All of them, pushing for reforms, w=
anted a project in double-quick time and they ignored the several layers of=
 approval process. The real story is described in a civil suit filed in 199=
5 by the then BJP-Shiv Sena Government in the Bombay High Court. It is anot=
her matter that this civil suit was mysteriously withdrawn after the Enron =
head, Ms Rebecca Mark, met the powers that be in Maharashtra, including the=
 Shiv Sena chief.=20

The suit -- drafted by such eminent lawyers as, Prashant Bhushan, Nitin Pra=
dhan, C. J. Sawant, the then Advocate General, and F. S. Nariman -- tells t=
he interesting story of how the Pawar government went out of its way to fav=
our Enron by giving approvals even after the elections were announced andco=
nducted in the State -- a gross violation of the election code. To this day=
, neither the Congress nor the BJP-Shiv Sena nor the NCP governments has ha=
d the courage to speak the truth -- perhaps because all of them were benefi=
ciaries. Here are a few passages from the suit to judge the actions of the =
Pawar government:=20

A After the calling of elections for the Maharashtra State Assembly, after =
expiry of its full term, the following documents came to be executed namely=
 (i) Amendment to PPA dated 2/2/1995, (ii) Consent Agreement dated 23/24.2.=
1995, and (iii) Fuel Management Agreement dated 25.2.1995. As mentioned abo=
ve, all the aforesaid documents were in aid of and supportive of the PPA da=
ted 8.12.1993 (later amended as mentioned above).=20

Elections were called for by a press note dated 8.12.94 and a notification =
date 10.1.95 and were held from 9-12 February, 1995, but announcement of re=
sults was deferred in order to complete election process in other States wh=
ich were to take place. It was this deferment of results which was taken ad=
vantage of and  the letters/agreements were executed and/or exchanged durin=
g this period.=20

* By reason of Clause 2 of PPA, the status of the PPA was that of an agreem=
ent not enforceable by law until all conditions precedents had been fully s=
atisfied and/or bona fide waived as provided in the PPA itself. However, by=
 a letter dated 25.2.1995 these conditions precedents were waived. The so-c=
alled waiver was not bona fide but was deceptive and fraudulent.=20

* The unholy haste with which the purported financial closure was sought to=
 be achieved was clearly in order to reap the benefit of the huge sum of $2=
0 million admittedly already spent by the principal shareholder of the Firs=
t Defendant (Enron) described by them euphemistically as `educational expen=
ses'; (the testimony of Ms Linda Powers specifically states that:=20

``Moreover, our company spent an enormous amount of its own money approxima=
tely $20 million on this education and project development process alone no=
t including any project costs... Why do we, and other developers include su=
ch things in our project? To win local support and support of the authoriti=
es, and contribute to the general improvement of conditions, and contribute=
 to the general improvement of conditions in the area''. In the purported r=
efutation also enclosed in the letter dated 18.8.1995 of the First Defendan=
t, it is stated that $20 million included ``engineering, financing, legal, =
travel and administrative costs actually totalling a sum in excess of $20 m=
illion as of 29.3.1995.'')=20

* 20.6.1992 -- (within five days of arrival in India and within three days =
of arrival in Bombay) The Enron team arrived in India on June 15 and spent =
two days visiting various sites in addition to meeting people in Delhi and =
Bombay. A  memorandum of understanding was signed between the Second Defend=
ant  (represented by Mr Ajit M. Nimbalkar), then Chairman of the Second Def=
endant, Ms Rebecca Mark of Enron, and Mr Douglas Mcfadden of General Electr=
ic Corporation.=20

The term sheet annexed to the MoU opens with the following:=20

``Electrical Power Purchase Contract'' -- Contract for 20 years term betwee=
n Power Venture and MSEB to be structured to achieve an all in price of US$=
 0.073/kWh, comprised a fixed monthly capacity payment calculating at the I=
ndian rate of inflation each year and a per-kWh energy payment equal to the=
 per-kWh operating cost (as defined below).=20

 (ii) Thus, the purported decision to set up a huge power generation projec=
t in the private sector with a foreclosed obligation on a statutory corpora=
tion to buy power from the private sector at a predetermined unprecedentedl=
y high rate was taken in a great hurry without there being any public debat=
e on the said issue  apart from there being any detailed consideration of t=
he matter.=20

* Before the PPA was executed in December 1993, the following events occurr=
ed:

 (a) The World Bank expressed its opposition to the project and advised tha=
t it was not viable, not in the interest of Maharashtra in particular and t=
he country, the public and the consumers, in general. This objection was br=
ushed aside by Enron which said, in a letter, that ``the World Bank opinion=
 can be changed'', that ``we (Enron) will engage a PR firm and hopefully ma=
nage the media from here on'' (June 1993).=20

* The Central Electricity Authority had drawn attention to several aspects =
of the MoU including:=20

(i) The all-in price is a departure from the existing norms and parameters =
notified by the Government under Section 43 A(2) of the Electricity (Supply=
) Act, 1948.=20

 (ii) Denominating the price in US dollars is also a departure from the exi=
sting norms.=20

(iii) We take it that the price of 0.073 kWh will be applicable from 1996 w=
hen power would be available.=20

* The PPA violates the tariff guidelines in force issued on December 8, 199=
3. The tariff guidelines permitted only a return of 16 per cent on equity b=
ut the PPA allows a return much in excess of 25 per cent. Second, the tarif=
f notification puts a cap on Operation and Maintenance (O&M) charges at 2.5=
 per cent of the capital cost. In the case of the PPA the O&M changes were =
over Rs 90 crore annually which is over three per cent of the capital cost.=
 The PPA was not even structured in accordance with the said notification.=
=20

The tariff notification allows payments only for the actual fuel consumed a=
nd not for deemed consumption. In the present case the heat rate guaranteed=
 by the Dabhol Power Company to the MSEB is 7605 BTU per unit while the hea=
t rate guaranteed by GEC to DPC is considerably lower. Under the PPA about =
25 per cent  of this difference and deemed consumption and actual consumpti=
on is allowed to be retained by DPC, contrary to the tariff notification.=
=20

All these are but a few paragraphs of the 600-page civil suit. Perhaps had =
the then Maharashtra Government persisted with the arbitration the compensa=
tion would have been far less than what could be anticipated now. However, =
for reasons best known to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, the suit was withdrawn=
 and its government appointed a review committee which integrated the LNG p=
lant with the power plant and gave the green signal for the second phase. T=
he net result was a higher tariff than what was negotiated by the Pawar Gov=
ernment.=20

The project has come a full circle now. Now the effort is on to distribute =
the burden across the country. This is evident by the Maharashtra Governmen=
t turning to the Centre and its representative A. V. Gokak, and stating tha=
t the Centre is evaluating various options including of the Power Trading C=
orporation to buy the power from DPC and distribute it to all the States. B=
ut at what price? Not lower than negotiated under the PPA of course with co=
smetic concessions by Enron and a lot of sacrifices by the State and the Ce=
ntre. But is this what we want?=20

DPC rejects MSEB's legal notice

Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has rejected Maharashtra State Electrici=
ty Board's (MSEB) legal notice for 'rescinding' the PPA, saying 'it did not=
 have the right to do so', as the two partners cross swords before state El=
ectricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) tomorrow.  In a three-page response =
to MSEB's May 24 legal notice, Enron India managing director K Wade Cline h=
as said " The legal notice is not acceptable to us, as according to the PPA=
, MSEB does not have the right to rescind the agreement", state government =
sources told correspondents today.The letter, dated May 26, also asks MSEB =
to comply to the 'sanctity' of the PPA, " please confirm that the board wou=
ld also pay all DPC dues, including the disputed Rs 213 crore for December =
and January bills plus the interest".

In its notice, MSEB has questioned the legal validity of the entire PPA as =
per the Indian Contracts' Act (ICA) 1872 and later also went a step further=
 by filing a petition in MERC. " Other than non-acceptance of our legal not=
ice, DPC has continued its demand for an escrow account, knowing fully well=
