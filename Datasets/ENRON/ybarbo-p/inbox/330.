Stone & Webster to evaluate DPC suspension

INDIAN and foreign lenders of us energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power C=
ompany are to appoint global energy consultants Stone and Webster to evalua=
te the cost of suspension of the multinational's 2,184-mw project. On the s=
econd day (yesterday) of the lenders' Singapore meet, Enron India managing =
director K Wade Cline in his presentation suggested a temporary suspension =
of the $3-billion project, FI sources said.=20
Cline also provided detailed alternatives vis-a-vis a post-suspension scena=
rio with reference to power blocks and almost ready liquefied natural gas t=
erminal, they added.=20

Sources said Stone and Webster were zeroed upon to calculate their estimate=
 of revenues of the entire project, including the LNG terminal as foreign l=
enders felt that a cost evaluation should be undertaken in the present circ=
umstances. ``The Indian lenders failed to convince their foreign counterpar=
ts who in turn were in favour of the suspension,'' they explained. ``The fa=
te of DPC's 1,444-mw phase-II now hangs in balance as it has been postponed=
 for the time being till the matter regarding the `rescinding' of the power=
 purchase agreement (PPA) is settled,'' they said.=20

As per the original schedule of PPA, DPC's phase II was to have been fired =
on Thursday.=20
Both Indian and foreign lenders were of the view that the legal wrangles be=
tween DPC and Maharashtra State Electricity Board should be kept in abeyanc=
e and a solution reached for offtake of phase-I power, they said. (PTI)=20

Private firms expect early end to Enron crisis

PRIVATE power producers expect an early end to the dispute between Enron Co=
rp and a local utility after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said he wa=
s optimistic about the US firm's $2.9-billion project. "Now the Central gov=
ernment is taking interest. That too at the highest level. That is very nic=
e," Harry Dhaul, director-general of the Independent Power Producers' Assoc=
iation of India, said.=20

On Wednesday, Vajpayee said he was confident that Dabhol Power Co, 65 per c=
ent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant'=
s only buyer, would sort out their problems. MSEB, which complains that Dab=
hol produces costly power, defaulted on payments of $48 million to DPC last=
 year. The squabble provoked Enron to serve a preliminary termination notic=
e to MSEB and the utility declared late in May that it had stopped buying p=
ower from the controversial plant.=20

Dabhol's first phase of 740 mw is already operational and the next phase wa=
s scheduled to add 1,444 mw later this year. MSEB has already said it would=
 not buy power from the project's next phase. Private power producers, who =
have been demanding central government intervention in the dispute said Vaj=
payee's comments augured well for the plant and will help refurbish India's=
 image that took a beating after the dispute involving its largest direct f=
oreign investor. "I think the prime minister has done absolutely the right =
thing. It is going to send the right signal that we are back on track and t=
he international investors concern will be duly met." (Reuters)

Dabhol lenders to study pullout cost , Freny Patel=20
Lenders to the Dabhol Power project have mandated their engineer, Stone and=
 Webster, to do a costing study on the implications of mothballing the seco=
nd phase of the project. The issue is whether to close it now or wait till =
the civil work on the project is over. Enron has made it clear that it want=
s to pull out of the second phase unless issues relating to the power purch=
ase agreement are resolved and the government of India makes a firm commitm=
ent on the offtake of power.
IDBI executive director RS Agarwal, who was present at the two-day lenders'=
 meeting in Singapore, told Business Standard that the institutional lender=
s will discuss the report of the engineers before deciding on a further cou=
rse of action. The second phase is 92 per cent complete. Total completion w=
ould entail the finalisation of the power blocks and the LNG facility.
Incidentally, the trial run of the first block of the second phase-740 mw -=
was to have taken place today, but failed to happen on account of the legal=
 battle between DPC and MSEB.To date, more than $1,570 million has been inv=
ested in the second phase. Stone & Webster's report will identify how much =
additional funds the lenders would have to plough in depending upon whether=
 the project is shelved immediately or after completion of construction act=
ivity. It will also figure out the funds required to restart the project.
"The legal position of the two parties -- DPC and MSEB -- has complicated t=
he issue," said Agarwal. Foreign lenders are reportedly unconvinced about t=
he Indian government's seriousness in resolving the issue. Lenders have exp=
ressed anxiety over the suspension of power offtake by the MSEB, as this ha=
s affected the $50 million cash flow. The priority is for the two sides to =
resolve the issue through negotiations at the earliest. DPC ought to take t=
he initiative as it is at the receiving end, said industry sources.=20

States cannot afford DPC power , Santosh Tiwary & P Vaidyanathan Iyer=20
The Centre's initiative towards facilitating sale of power from the Enron-p=
romoted Dabhol project in Maharashtra to other states is likely to come a c=
ropper. Sources told Business Standard that the states would in no way be a=
ble to purchase power from Dabhol Power Company (DPC) as it would be diffic=
ult to lower the tariff to Rs 3 per unit. "No state will be able to buy pow=
er from DPC at a rate above Rs 3 per unit considering the rate at which the=
y are supplying power to the consumers at present," said a source in the Ce=
ntral Electricity Authority (CEA).=20
Power minister Suresh Prabhu had only last week asked CEA to consult the po=
wer-deficient neighbouring states of Maharashtra seeking their views on the=
 requirement and tariff at which they would be able to buy electricity from=
 DPC. Sources said that states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Goa, to =
which DPC could supply power, were not in a position to buy it at a cost wh=
ich was more than what they spend at present.=20
They pointed out that even after a considerable reduction in tariff, it was=
 highly unlikely that DPC would sell power to these states at the rates aff=
ordable by them. And for the other states, transmission cost would only add=
 up to the already high cost of Dabhol power. Hence, the proposition is alm=
ost ruled out, said sources. They said that the unit cost of power for all =
SEBs was around Rs 3 at present. Interestingly, the average tariff of all t=
he SEBs was estimated to be 208 paise per unit in 1999-2000, with a ratio o=
f tariff to cost at 74 per cent. In 1999-2000, the unit cost of power suppl=
y in Gujarat was 287.30 paise, and in Madhya Pradesh, it was 252.72 paise.=
=20
Maharashtra had 254.36 paise per unit cost of power supply in 1999-2000. So=
urces said that the the existing tariff structure and supply cost is a clea=
r indication why third party sale had not been allowed by the states even t=
hough Section 43 of the Indian Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 allowed such =
sale. They added that the chances of states allowing third-party sale by th=
e independent power producers in the light of the DPC-MSEB controversy was =
remote. The Centre has asked the states to allow third-party sale from the =
IPPs.

Dabhol lenders for 1-yr plant closure, Sanjay Jog
 THE lenders to the Dabhol power project, who concluded a three-day meeting=
 in Singapore on Thursday, have unanimously suggested that the Dabhol proje=
ct be closed down for a year in a bid to "resolve various issues pertaining=
 to tariff reduction". These lenders, comprising the offshore lenders and t=
he Indian financial institutions (IFI) and banks, have asked Enron's consul=
tants based in Houston, Stone and Webster, to prepare a feasibility report =
for closure of Dabhol plant for a year.

IFI sources told The Financial Express that the offshore lenders have agree=
d not to take any stern step at this point of time but explore various oppo=
rtunities for a long-term solution. "However, all the lenders were also una=
nimous that the government of India should make various commitments especia=
lly to see that the project gets going in future," the sources added.

Sources said Enron's consultants will find out the possible gains and losse=
s for the lenders as well as for the Dabhol Power Company and MSEB if the D=
abhol plant was closed down for a year. The consultants will also look into=
 the viability of the closure formula especially when over $2 billion loans=
 have been blocked in the project.

Moreover, the lenders and DPC are believed to have expressed disappointment=
 over the Prime Minister AB Vajpayee's statement that the Maharashtra gover=
nment and Enron will find a solution to Dabhol imbroglio. In fact, the lend=
ers and the DPC were expecting the Centre would play a proactive role for t=
he early resolution of issue. These lenders were disappointed over the timi=
ng of the prime minister's statement. "The prime minister's statement is ob=
viously not a good sign," remarked the lenders. According to sources, the p=
rime minister's statement has been seen as a major setback for the ongoing =
efforts to resolve the Dabhol crisis.=20

DPC willing to cut rate of return to 11 per cent, Sitanshu Swain
 EVEN as the foreign lenders secured more time to take a final view of thei=
r investment in Dabhol power project, hopes of reviving the high-cost proje=
ct has gained momentum as the US energy major has shown willingness to scal=
e down the rate of return (RoR) from 16 per cent to 11 per cent from the Da=
bhol project.
Such a move on the part of Enron Corporation will facilitate a similar down=
ward revision in the per unit of power cost from its present range of Rs 3.=
01 to Rs 4.70, depending upon the PLF and foreign exchange variation.
The power cost in India remains cheaper as the return is calculated in rupe=
e terms whereas in Enron's case, it is high since it is linked to the excha=
nge rate. According to a top official of Industrial Developmment Bank of In=
dia (IDBI), Enron has informed the financial institution that it is keen to=
 cut down the projected return from 16 per cent to 11 per cent. ''It is mat=
ter of time that Enron will decide about the revision of the projected retu=
rn,'' said the official, adding that IDBI is insisting on the immediate imp=
lementation of the revised return instead of waiting for the second phase.
Enron's initiative to cut down the projected return is possible as the assu=
red return of 16 per cent, which is linked to the exchange rate is making t=
he per unit cost expensive. Further, the IDBI official point out that Enron=
's maximum rate of return in the US is between six per cent to eight per ce=
nt. The rupee has almost depreciated by 35 per cent to 40 per cent since th=
e 16 per cent return was agreed upon by the MSEB and the Maharastra governm=
ent. The rupee's slide effectively pushes up the per unit power cost. Also =
IDBI has already brought down the interest rate on loans lent to DPC from 2=
1 per cent to 16 per cent, which will automatically cut down the capital ex=
penses for the project.=20

Dabhol's RoE should not cross 16%: Godbole panel , Sanjay Jog

Mumbai, June 7: THE Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee on Thursday unan=
imously took the view that the Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) return on equit=
y (RoE) should not exceed 16 per cent, even if the drawal of power is at 90=
 per cent plant load factor (PLF). The committee comprising Dr Godbole, Vin=
ay Bansal, VM Lal and SK Shrivastava, which met along with officials of the=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), has asked the Infrastructure D=
evelopment Finance Corporation (IDFC) and Crisil to jointly prepare a detai=
led presentation in this regard within eight days.

The committee has asked IDFC and Crisil to fix certain parameters so that t=
he return on equity will be maintained at 16 per cent, despite cut in the t=
ariff. MSEB sources told The Financial Express that according to the presen=
t government norms, the return on equity has been fixed at 16.5 per cent at=
 68 per cent PLF. As the PLF increases by 1 per cent, the return on equity =
will hike by 0.7 per cent. "According to these existing norms, the DPC's re=
turn on equity will go up to 31 per cent at 90 per cent PLF. However, the c=
ommittee is of the view that DPC's return on equity should not exceed 16 pe=
r cent, despite low PLF and drawal," sources said. These sources added that=
 the IDFC and Crisil has been asked to explore various possibilities to mak=
e this happen.=20

DPC appeals to high court to stay MERC order, Sanjay Jog

 THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has challenged the jurisdiction of t=
he Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), has appealed to th=
e Bombay High Court to stay the MERC order restraining it from reactivating=
 the escrow account and carrying out arbitration proceedings.=20

The DPC, in a 245-page writ petition which will come up for hearing before =
the high court bench comprising AP Shah and SA Bobde on June 11, has also r=
equested that the MERC be restrained from the June 14 and future proceeding=
s on petitions filed by the MSEB.

The DPC has argued that the MERC has no jurisdiction to act, entertain, or =
adjudicate upon any of the disputes and differences which have arisen betwe=
en the DPC and MSEB under the provisions of the power purchase agreement. T=
hus, for a writ of prohibition or a writ in the nature of prohibition, or a=
ny other writ, direction or order provided for under article 226 of the Con=
stitution of India, MERC be prohibited from entertaining, or, from adjudica=
ting upon any matter raised in the petition filed by MSEB.

The DPC said for a writ of certiorari or a writ in the nature of certiorari=

DPC appeals against Merc's order on escrow
 THE Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has challenged the jurisdiction of M=
aharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc), has appealed to the Bo=
mbay high court to stay Merc's order restraining it from reactivating the e=
scrow account and carrying out arbitration proceedings.=20
The DPC in a 245-page writ petition which will come up for hearing before t=
he high court bench comprising AP Shah and SA Bobde on June 11 has also req=
uested that the Merc be restrained from the June 14 and future proceedings =
on petition filed by MSEB. The DPC has argued that the Merc has no jurisdic=
tion to act, entertain or adjudicate upon any of the disputes and differenc=
es which have arisen between the DPC and MSEB under the provisions of power=
 purchase agreement. Thus, for a writ of prohibition or a writ in the natur=
e of prohibition or any other writ, direction or order provided for under a=
rticle 226 of Constitution of India, Merc be prohibited from entertaining o=
r from adjudicating upon any matter raised in the petition filed by MSEB.
The DPC said for a writ of certiorari or a writ in the nature of certiorari=
, directions or orders provided for under article 226 of Constitution of In=
dia, Merc be prohibited from calling for the records of the case and after =
pursuing the same, quash and set aside the order granted by Merc on May 29.

Lenders form panel to negotiate with MSEB, By Pradipta Bagchi=20
Domestic and international lenders to the $ 2.9 billion Dabhol Power projec=
t have put aside their differences and adopted a united front to try and re=
solve the crisis. The lenders under the leadership of the IDBI have set up =
a committee comprising of the major Indian lenders--IDBI, ICICI and SBI--an=
d the foreign lead arrangers--ANZ Grindlays, ABN Amro, Citibank and Credit =
Suisse First Boston. This committee of lenders will meet with the Maharasht=
ra State Electricity Board next week to try and seek a resolution to the cu=
rrent crisis.=20
Institutional sources said that the lenders have not given consent for DPC =
to issue a transfer notice to MSEB yet. Permission for such a notice was so=
ught by DPC officials after their presentation to the lenders on Wednesday.=
 However, both domestic and foreign lenders have decided to take an active =
role to try and arrive at a concrete solution to the crisis by negotiating =
with MSEB.=20
Depending on how negotiations with MSEB progress, the lenders will take a v=
iew on the payments to be made to Bechtel, the EPC contractor for phase II =
of the project. According to the current schedule, a payment of $ 25 millio=
n has to be made by June 18 to Bechtel. Institutional sources indicated tha=
t the lenders have come to the conclusion that a concrete plan is needed wi=
thin a specified time-frame to have any hope of salvaging the project. Howe=
ver, institutions remain confident that a solution will emerge, especially =
as PM Vajpayee has promised to intervene to find a solution.=20
Foreign lenders have also explained their position to their Indian counterp=
arts in terms of further disbursal of loan funds. This is because in the ab=
sence of a plan, it is difficult for foreign lenders to seek more disbursal=
s on the project from their respective credit committees. The total project=
 cost of the DPC project is slated to be $ 3 billion, of which $ 2.1 billio=
n has been financed through debt while the rest has come from equity contri=
butions from Enron Corp, MSEB, GE and Bechtel. Indian institutions have a R=
s 5,000 crore exposure to the project.

Dabhol Power ready to scale down RoR to 11 pc, Sitanshu Swain
EVEN as the foreign lenders secured more time to take a final view of their=
 investment in Dabhol power project, hopes of reviving the high-cost projec=
t has gained momentum as the US energy major has shown willingness to scale=
 down the rate of return from 16 per cent to 11 per cent from the Dabhol pr=
oject. Such a move on the part of Enron Corporation will facilitate a simil=
ar downward revision in the per unit of power cost from its present range o=
f Rs 3.01 to Rs 4.70, depending upon the PLF and foreign exchange variation=
.
The power cost in India remains cheaper as the return is calculated in rupe=
e terms whereas in Enron's case, it is high since it is linked to the excha=
nge rate. According to a top official of Industrial Development Bank of Ind=
ia (IDBI), Enron has informed the financial institution that it is keen to =
cut down the projected return from 16 per cent to 11 per cent. ''It is matt=
er of time that Enron will decide about the revision of the projected retur=
n,'' said the official, adding that IDBI is insisting on the immediate impl=
ementation of the revised return instead of waiting for the second phase.
Enron's initiative to cut down the projected return is possible as the assu=
red return of 16 per cent, which is linked to the exchange rate is making t=
he per unit cost expensive. Further, the IDBI official point out that Enron=
's maximum rate of return in the US is between six per cent to eight per ce=
nt.

Enron seeks promise on phase I drawal=20
ENRON has suggested that it could suspend construction of phase II of the D=
abhol power project for about a year or so if it proves difficult to find b=
uyers for electricity from its plant. That would, however, be possible only=
 on an assurance that the entire phase I power would be lifted. Mr Wade Cli=
ne, Enron India Managing Director, told financiers at a meeting in Singapor=
e that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) was also willing to pare its returns by 1=
0 per cent if MSEB assures power purchase and reinstates the contract.=20
Another suggestion that came up at the meeting was that ``mechanical'' cons=
truction such as the power blocks and LNG facilities could be completed and=
 the rest left for a later date. The lenders have mandated engineering firm=
, Stone and Webster, to make an ``assessment'' of the project and submit a =
status report within a week. The mandate includes ascertaining the current =
requirement of funds and the cost implications of suspending the second pha=
se.=20
According to sources, foreign lenders have mellowed their stand but are not=
 willing to back down too far. They have not yet made any commitments becau=
se of legal issues involved. The issue of reduction of tariffs could be dis=
cussed only after finding a buyer for the power, the meeting was reportedly=
 told. The sources also said offshore lenders were unhappy about MSEB resci=
nding the PPA, which they want to be reinstated. They feel that a confronta=
tionist stand would not be good for any one. Sources said the meeting had s=
pilled over to one more day on Thursday but some representatives of Indian =
lenders had returned yesterday. However, a couple of others stayed back for=
 the final round of talks, the sources added.=20

Dabhol lessons=20
DABHOL POWER COMPANY'S reported willingness to extend the period for concil=
iation must be welcomed as it gives rise to some hope for a negotiated sett=
lement. At the same time, it must not be perceived by the anti-Dabhol lobby=
 as a climbdown by the company. Even if an amicable settlement comes throug=
h, the chances for which appear extremely dim now given the extreme posture=
s adopted by all concerned, there are not going to be any winners or losers=
.=20
The politicians need to realise that they cannot mess around as they like w=
ith such projects, especially one that has an apparently water-tight contra=
ct. More important, they need to realise that the decision-making process i=
n the country is still woefully inadequate to deal with multinationals whic=
h have wide experience in dealing with varied markets. There seems little p=
oint in the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, now saying that Dabhol=
 power is ``too expensive'' for anyone. For companies like Enron, the princ=
ipal promoter of Dabhol Power Company, the crisis is a lesson in that they =
cannot hope to get away with unreasonable profits and blatantly one-sided c=
ontracts. Ultimately, wisdom must dawn that a negotiated settlement will be=
 far more beneficial and far less messy than the one that goes through a lo=
ng-drawn legal process. It is still not too late for the Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board, the Maharashtra Government, DPC and the Centre to sit ar=
ound the table and arrive at a settlement.=20
At the same time, it must be mentioned that wisdom has belatedly dawned on =
the Power Minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, that contracts have to be honoured. F=
or, it was the party he belongs to -- the Shiv Sena -- that re-opened the o=
riginal agreement inked by its predecessor Sharad Pawar Government, thus in=
creasing the burden on the MSEB many times over. Mr Prabhu's admission may =
also be because of the unenviable position he might find himself in should =
the burden of the project shift to his lap. As it is, his Ministry is burde=
ned with the problem of getting the power sector back on the rails, with re=
calcitrant State governments unwilling to go ahead with even minimum reform=
s. Mr Prabhu has to deal with a situation of investors -- forget internatio=
nal agencies, even the domestic institutions -- having absolutely no faith =
in the repaying capacity of the State electricity boards and where Central =
power sector utilities are making no headway in collecting their bills even=
 as they continue to bail out the States.=20
It is probably because of this that Mr Prabhu feels that independent power =
producers should be allowed to sell power directly to third party consumers=
, bypassing the moribund SEBs. By doing so, the argument goes, there will n=
ot be any need for the elaborate payment security mechanisms that the IPPs =
insist on when selling to the SEBs. Such a proposal had even been mooted in=
 the draft Electricity Bill. However, it is unlikely that States will accep=
t this proposal as it will mean that industrial consumers, which contribute=
 to the bulk of the SEBs' revenues, switching to direct purchases from the =
IPPs. Private investment has also been permitted in transmission and distri=
bution and by allowing third party sale, the country is expected to move to=
wards a more competitive power market. But the question remains whether Ind=
ia is as yet ready for such a switch.=20
The poor financial position of the SEBs cannot be just wished away, so also=
 the fact that subsidies to certain consumers are going to continue for som=
e time to come in one form or the other. Dabhol exposed the myth that Mahar=
ashtra was a financially well-administered State. That itself should serve =
as a lesson to other States to not play around with the power sector and in=
stead run it on purely commercial lines. Dabhol is also a lesson for the do=
mestic financial institutions that they need to be more transparent and pro=
fessional in the way they assess projects.=20
Godbole charges DPC with doublespeak=20
MUMBAI, JUNE 7. The ongoing efforts to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agree=
ment (PPA) with the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) suffered a se=
tback today with the State Government- appointed renegotiation panel chief,=
 Dr. Madhav Godbole, charging the company with adopting a dual stand on the=
 issue.=20
``They have a different stand on the negotiating table before the committee=
 and a different stand elsewhere'', Dr. Godbole said after the panel held a=
n internal meeting at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) premis=
es in south Mumbai to discuss PPA- related issues.=20
The meeting also discussed at length the availability of power in the State=
, Dr. Godbole said adding that the next meeting with DPC officials would be=
 held after the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission ( MERC) heari=
ng scheduled for June 14. However, no date has been fixed.=20
The meeting chaired by Dr. Madhav Godbole, was attended among others by the=
 State energy secretary, Mr. V.M. Lal, the MSEB chairman, Mr. Vinay Bansal =
and the Central nominee, Mr. A.V. Gokak.=20
Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court today fixed the hearing on the suit filed =
by the DPC challenging the MERC ad- interim order for June 11.=20
The MSEB had filed a suit before the MERC alleging that the DPC had default=
ed by not supplying power on demand on January 28, February 13 and March 29=
 this year as per the PPA and slapped a penalty of Rs. 401.24 crores on it.=
 After hearing both the parties on May 29, the MERC had posted the next hea=
ring to June 14 to give time to the DPC to submit its reply. It had also pa=
ssed an ad-interim order restraining the company from taking the matter to =
the International Court of Arbitration in London and also from activating t=
he escrow account till its next hearing on June 14.=20
In a petition filed on Wednesday, the DPC sought a direction from the High =
court to call for records from MERC and after perusing it, quash the impugn=
ed May 29 order in favour of the MSEB.=20

Provision for arbitration=20
The company also sought a direction to MSEB to withdraw the proceedings pen=
ding before the Regulator. It said the Electricity Regulatory Commission Ac=
t 1998, came into affect much after it had signed the PPA with the MSEB on =
December 8, 1993. The PPA clearly provided for international arbitration in=
 case of any dispute between the parties. Therefore, the MERC had no jurisd=
iction to act, entertain or adjudicate upon any disputes and differences wh=
ich had arisen between it and the MSEB in connection with the PPA.=20
Seeking to nullify MSEB's argument that the Indian Contract Act, 1872, woul=
d prevail over any other law, it said the MSEB had entered into the PPA aft=
er seeking the State Government's approval. Both parties were fully aware t=
hat the PPA contained a dispute resolution mechanism, which provided for an=
 arbitration of disputes and differences, in accordance with arbitration ag=
reement set out in Clause 20.3. Therefore, the DPC said, it possessed a con=
tractual right under PPA to refer any dispute or difference which may arise=
 to arbitrators. The MSEB had a similar right to invoke the arbitration cla=
use, it added. - PTI=20
Medha for judicial inquiry=20

makers in the interest of the nation.=20
An indefinite agitation would also be launched against the globalisation pr=
ocess from October-November this year under the banner of the National Alli=
ance for People's Movement, she said. Criticising the Maharashtra Governmen=

LENDERS BLOW THE DABHOL II FUSE =20

The controversial second phase of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) plunged into a=
nother round of uncertainty today, with the foreign lenders weighing a move=
 to suspend construction of the project. The latter appointed global energy=
 consultants Stone & Webster to evaluate "the cost of suspension" of the se=
cond phase of the 2,184 MW project promoted by US energy major Enron Corp. =
While the Indian institutions had, on Wednesday, assured their foreign coun=
terparts that the Centre was likely to step in and a solution to the Enron =
mess was in sight, the overseas lenders apparently did not buy this argumen=
t. "This (the central government's intervention) has been repeated often," =
the foreign lenders are believed to have said. "The Indian lenders failed t=
o convince their foreign counterparts, who, in turn, were in favour of the =
suspension," sources said."The fate of DPC's 1,444 MW Phase-II now hangs in=
 the balance, as the project has been postponed till the issue of the resci=
nding of the power purchase agreement (PPA) is settled," they said. As per =
the original schedule of the PPA, DPC's Phase-II was to have been fired tod=
ay.=20
Sources said Stone and Webster will review the second phase of the project.=
 One of their aims will be to ascertain whether it is worthwhile to complet=
e the mechanical part of the second phase. According to a section of the pa=
rticipants at the meeting, the rationale behind completing the mechanics of=
 the project was that in case Enron wanted to exit, the project will get a =
better valuation. Already, 92 cent of the project has been completed, with =
$ 1500 million committed to it.=20
On Wednesday, the Enron India managing director K. Wade Cline in his presen=
tation before the lenders in Singapore, suggested a "temporary suspension" =
of the $ 2.9 billion project, R S Agarwal, executive director of IDBI, told=
 The Telegraph here today.Cline also provided detailed alternatives vis-a-v=
is a post-suspension scenario, with reference to power blocks and almost re=
ady liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, sources said. However, Agarwal, w=
ho headed the delegation representing the Indian financial institutions, sa=
id all the lenders unanimously agreed that Phase-I should restart immediate=
ly. They were of the view that the legal wrangles between DPC and the Mahar=
ashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) should be kept in abeyance and a solu=
tion reached for offtake of Phase-I power.
The local lenders said the legal wrangling had complicated matters further,=
 with no end in sight to the eight-month old imbroglio.The foreign lenders =
felt the Centre should play a greater role in resolving the payments tangle=
, the sources said. They also felt the MSEB move, rescinding the PPA, had h=
armed their interests in the project. When asked whether the foreign banks =
had given any indications of invoking the guarantees of the Indian institut=
ions, sources replied in the negative.
Meanwhile, both the lenders continued to meet with representatives of indiv=
idual foreign banks today. In a related development, the state government h=
as decided to call the third round of the Godbole renegotiations committee =
on June 30. The Godbole committee, which met today, also discussed the stat=
e energy review report.
