Paul,

I was wondering if you are getting some LNG industry reports/analysis e.g. "LNG in World Markets" published by Poten & Partners.  If yes, would it be convenient for you to arrange a copy of the same for DPC?

As I write this mail, the DPC lenders meet is still going on in Singapore.  All of us are anxiously waiting to know the outcome.

Regards,
Shubh
