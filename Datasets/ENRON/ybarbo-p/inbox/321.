Vajpayee says state, Enron should resolve Dabhol crisis themselves=20
 PRIME Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Wednesday passed on the buck to the=
 Maharashtra state government and Enron to find a way out to resolve the Da=
bhol impasse. Hoping that both the parties will solve the imbroglio mainly =
concerning the disposal of costly power, he said the steps initiated by the=
 state government and the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are in the right direc=
tion of resolving the issue.
Addressing a press conference immediately after his arrival at the Mumbai a=
irport, Mr Vajpayee shared the state government's sentiments on the purchas=
e of the "costly" Dabhol power. The prime minister admitted that there are =
difficulties in finding a solution to the Enron issue, but he was confident=
 that it would ultimately be found. By putting the ball in the court of the=
 state government and DPC, the prime minister has made it amply clear that =
the Centre would not like to associate itself directly to either purchase D=
abhol power or its despatch to various states until tariff is reduced after=
 renegotiation. Mr Vajpayee's remarks have come as a major setback to the s=
tate government as it has been appealing to him for the takeover of the Dab=
hol phase-II in view of its inability to bear the mounting burden.
Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, in his recent communication to Vajpayee o=
n February 6, April 17 and May 10, repeatedly demanded that Dabhol's surplu=
s power be disposed by national organisations such as the NTPC and the Powe=
r Trading Corporation in power deficit states. "The negotiations with DPC w=
ith a view to reducing the tariff hinge around the question whether the ent=
ire power from this project at 90 per cent PLF would be purchased. DPC may =
be willing to reduce tariff from the existing high levels, provided they ge=
t such an assurance from the government of India," Mr Deshmukh had said.=20

...but Deshmukh insists Centre should help resolve the dispute=20
 THE Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Wednesday said that hi=
s government's stand that the state cannot afford to buy "costly" Dabhol po=
wer has ultimately been vindicated by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. =
"We stick to our position that the Centre should step in to bail out the st=
ate as we cannot bear the additional burden. The purchase of additional 722=
 MW from block b of Dabhol phase-II is simply out of question as the state =
has not drawn more than 300 MW from the Dabhol phase-I of 740 MW," Mr Deshm=
ukh said. Mr Deshmukh was reacting to the prime minister's statement that i=
f Maharashtra cannot purchase such costly power who else would buy it.Mr De=
shmukh told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting that something would=
 emerge from the ongoing renegotiations between the Maharashtra State Elect=
ricity Board (MSEB) and the Dabhol Power Company. "However, DPC will have t=
o sacrifice something and the MSEB will also have to do some balancing act =
for the resolution of the Dabhol issue," he added.
Mr Deshmukh admitted that the he has been consistent on his demand that the=
 Centre should take over Dabhol phase-II which is the only way in which the=
 complex problem of this project can be resolved. The chief minister said t=
hat his government will seek legal opinion on how to tackle the arbitration=
 proceedings initiated against it by the DPC. He added that at present the =
MSEB has got stay from the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission on=
 implementation of arbitration process by the DPC. "Let the DPC take action=
 on this front against the state government, we will take the necessary ste=
ps after seeking legal advise," he added.
On making the Dabhol papers open for public, Mr Deshmukh said that his gove=
rnment will also seek legal advise in this regard and take necessary action=
 thereafter. At present, DPC has declined to release certain documents on t=
he grounds of "confidentiality." Mr Deshmukh ruled out any possibility of a=
dverse impact on receiving foreign direct investment in the state in view o=
f the ongoing Dabhol imbroglio. "The question does not arise, as according =
to the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB, the latter was entitl=
ed to purchase all power. In case of FDI, the state is not entitled to buy =
the products of the FDI investor," he added.=20

DPC lenders to continue talks on Thursday=20

THE talks between Indian and foreign lenders of the Enron-promoted Dabhol P=
ower Company will continue Thursday in Singapore. The DPC is reported to ha=
ve made a presentation at the meeting Wednesday and explained its disputes =
with Maharashtra State Electricity Bord and the pending case in the state r=
egulatory commission, financial institution sources said here.=20

Thursday's meeting is scheduled with foreign banks.=20

Earlier, in a desperate bid to convince foreign banks to not invoke guarant=
ees issued by them, Indian lenders to the Dabhol Power Company assured inte=
rvention by the central government in salvaging the project. Institutional =
lenders run the risk of guarantees worth Rs 2,463 crore being invoked by fo=
reign lenders, who are under pressure to prevent their loans from going bad=
. During the DPC lenders' meet in Singapore on Tuesday, Indian lenders aske=
d foreign ones to not take "individual decisions" in respect of loans to th=
e project. Instead, they should wait for the outcome of negotiations. The l=
enders meeting was also attended by senior DPC officials. Among foreign ban=
ks, senior officials from Citibank, ABN Amro, ANZ Grindleys, Bank of Americ=
a and Opec were present.=20

The 2,184-MW power project, with an estimated cost of $2.9bn, stopped gener=
ation last week following MSEB's decision not to buy power from the DPC. Th=
is has aggravated the matter, making it difficult for the lenders to adopt =
a softer stand. Indian lenders have guaranteed loans by foreign banks and i=
nstitutions to the extent of $524 million (Rs 2,463 crore). The guarantees =
given by lead institution IDBI alone is around Rs 1,528 crore while its tot=
al exposure to the project stands at Rs 2,158 crore. The other major Indian=
 lenders include ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Indian lenders=
 are worried that foreign banks would invoke the guarantee if the current s=
talemate continues. "However, lenders have to depend on the central governm=
ent, MSEB and the DPC to resolve the issue. Indian lenders can only mediate=
 between the government and DPC and also plead with foreign lenders not to =
pull the plug," said an analyst. Officials who attended the meeting said,=
=20

"We hope to arrive at some decision by tomorrow." DPC is expected to make a=
 presentation to the lenders on Wednesday while small foreign banks will be=
 meeting on Thursday. Asking foreign banks not to take an individual decisi=
on is because of the fear that foreign lenders are considering invoking the=
 guarantee. "Although Indian banks maintain that foreign banks are not cons=
idering invoking the guarantees, it definitely appears that they are consid=
ering such a move given the stringent accounting norms followed in the inte=
rnational market," an analyst pointed out. -=20

DPc foreign lenders to hold their horses , Sanjay Jog & Sitanshu Swain

 IN a significant turn of events, the foreign lenders to the Dabhol Power C=
ompany (DPC) have decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, rather than p=
recipitate matters on the basis of the termination notices served by both p=
arties - the power company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSE=
B) - on each other. This development comes even as the lenders' meeting rol=
led on to an unscheduled third day to iron out further issues among themsel=
ves.
This decision was taken after two days of hectic deliberations among the le=
nders where the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)-led domestic le=
nders briefed their foreign counterparts about the positive signs relating =
to the continuance of the power project, top sources associated with the me=
eting told The Financial Express on Wednesday evening. The sources said thi=
s effectively means that the foreign lenders would not immediately insist o=
n encashing the guarantees on their funds provided by the domestic lenders =
to the project. The Dabhol lenders' meeting will now continue for an "unsch=
eduled" third day on Thursday.=20
The lawyers of offshore lenders White & Case have confirmed that the meetin=
g will continue on Thursday.
However, the representative of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) =
Mr RS Agarwal left Wednesday's meeting mid-way to catch the flight back to =
India. Sources said Enron India managing director K Wade Cline made a detai=
led presentation for over two-and-half hours before the lenders. Mr Cline i=
s believed to have outlined the series of events that have brought Enron to=
 the brink of quitting India.Mr Cline said after the presentation: "We have=
 made a presentation. The presentation went well." Dabhol Power Company, on=
 its part, has already made it known that it is willing to revise some of i=
ts earlier projections to suit the requirements of the state government.

FIs buy more time in DPC lenders meet

The two-day meeting between Indian and foreign lenders of the Enron-promote=
d, Dabhol Power Corp (DPC) remained inconclusive on Wednesday with foreign =
lenders deciding to give some more time to the Indian government to decide =
the fate of the project.While officials of Indian FIs (IFIs) decided to fly=
 back on Wednesday, foreign lenders are expected to discuss among themselve=
s on what action should be taken on the project on Thursday. IFIs have alre=
ady sunk over Rs 5,000 crore on the project and if international lenders pu=
ll the plug on the project, it would be IFIs which will have to take anothe=
r Rs 2,463 crore hit on their balance sheet as they have guaranteed all the=
 international loans taken by DPC.

IFIs, led by IDBI have already told the foreign lenders that they should no=
t take any hasty decision as even the PM has intervened in the dispute. The=
 foreign lenders include a consortium led by ABN-Amro, Citibank NA, Japan E=
xim bank and OPIC. With this, foreign lenders have now decided to adopt a w=
ait-and-watch posture instead of fighting with Indian lenders.The IFIs had =
pressed for completion of the $3 billion project, as DPC has stopped commer=
cial production and doubts are being expressed for commissioning of its 1,4=
44 MW phase-II due on Thursday. The Indian team, led by IDBI executive dire=
ctor R S Agarwal, flew back to India alongwith representatives of SBI and I=
CICI. On Wednesday, DPC also made presentations to the lenders about the fa=
te of the project. Analysts say that foreign lenders cannot give much time =
to the project as they have to follow stringent accounting norms followed i=

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, June 07, 2001=20
A step forward
DABHOL Power Company is reportedly ready to extend the period for conciliat=
ion till August. This is a good idea. Nobody, least of all Enron, which own=
s the majority stake in DPC, gains from terminating a costly project sudden=
ly. India is desperately short of electricity, whether or not Maharashtra c=
laims that it can do without Dabhol power. The least that will be achieved =
by extending the conciliation period will be a more organised withdrawal of=
 Enron from the $2 billion project.=20
However, if MSEB, the governments of Maharashtra and India act sensibly, th=
en the project can be salvaged by some renegotiation. Enron, which reported=
ly plans to specialise in energy trading and pull out of power generation w=
orldwide, might still pull out, but a renegotiated Dabhol will be a cheaper=
 source of large volumes of electricity which India desperately needs. The =
Godbole committee reckons that by renegotiating DPC's PPA and its gas contr=
acts, and by some financial re-engineering, the cost of DPC electricity can=
 be nearly halved. That will mean very attractive prices for electricity fr=
om a new gas driven plant. It also means that domestic financial institutio=
ns and banks, who have a huge exposure to Dabhol, will not have to contend =
with the worrisome prospect of having to provide for loans that become non-=
performing.=20
Meanwhile the government in New Delhi has to stop waffling about the need f=
or reforms and get some work done. The first thing to do is to issue an ord=
inance permitting all independent power producers to sell power to whoever =
is willing to pay for it. Private investment is already allowed in transmis=
sion and distribution. With generators free to sell to entities other than =
SEBs, India will move towards a more competitive market for power. Privatis=
ing power distribution has proved to be a mixed success - it has succeeded =
to some degree in states like Orissa and flopped in UP, mainly because nobo=
dy has faith in the government's ability to administer. Reforms of state ow=
ned distribution networks and SEBs are uncertain and will take a long time =
to succeed. In the meantime, it is a good idea to set up parallel, privatel=
y owned and operated systems for generation, transmission and distribution =
that will provide reliable, quality power to consumers who are willing to p=
ay.

Dabhol to challenge MERC order in high court, Arijit De & S Ravindran=20
The legal battle between the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and the Maharashtra=
 State Electricity Board (MSEB) has taken a fresh turn with the former deci=
ding to challenge, in the Mumbai High Court, the order of the Maharashtra E=
lectricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) restraining it from seeking recours=
e to international arbitration till June 14. The case is slated to come up =
for hearing on June 11, three days before the next MERC hearing. DPC's cont=
ention, it is learnt, is that it is beyond MERC's jurisdiction to debar the=
 company from proceeding with international arbitration. DPC has informed M=
ERC about its decision in a communication dispatched this evening, MERC off=
icials said.When contacted, the DPC spokesperson declined to comment on the=
 issue. MSEB has slapped a claim of Rs 401 crore on DPC for non-supply of p=
ower at adequate levels on January 28.
In a submission before the commission, it also said that DPC has to pass on=
 Rs 1,200 crore which had been paid as capacity charges. On May 29, MERC ha=
d passed an interim injunction restraining DPC from going in for arbitratio=
n on its payments dispute with MSEB till June 14. The commission had also t=
aken the line that DPC could not activate the escrow account for the second=
 phase of the project. The terms of the power purchase agreement inked betw=
een MSEB and DPC provide for international arbitration between the two side=
s if payments disputes arise. DPC lawyers had questioned MERC's authority t=
o settle disputes with MSEB. They had argued that MERC, created in May 1999=
, did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes between DPC and M=
SEB. The DPC argument was that since the amended PPA with MSEB had been ink=
ed in 1998, there was no question of MERC having any role to play. MERC sou=
rces concede that they cannot reopen the PPA. But they point to another ame=
ndment to the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act on October 27, 2000, w=
hich empowered MERC to settle all disputes between power utilities. The com=
mission's stand is that since both DPC and MSEB are power utilities, it has=
 the right to adjudicate on all disputes between the two.

DPC to continue billing MSEB for Phase II power, S Ravindran=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) will continue billing the Maharashtra State Elec=
tricity Board (MSEB) for the power generated from its phase II, which was d=
ue to commence operations on Thursday. Sources close to DPC said: "If MSEB =
had fully cooperated with DPC, commercial production could have begun from =
tomorrow. Under the power purchase agreement (PPA) they would have been for=
ced to buy this power.""While MSEB's contention is that they have rescinded=
 the PPA, DPC's contention is that the PPA continues to be in force. Under =
these circumstances, DPC will definitely charge MSEB for the second phase p=
ower at some future date," the sources added.=20
MSEB has already stopped buying power from DPC. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal =
could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, lenders to the Enron-promoted =
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are yet to arrive at a decision on the crucial i=
ssue of a transfer notice being served to the MSEB.DPC executives made a pr=
esentation to a consortium of domestic and foreign lenders in Singapore on =
Wednesday. "The lenders are yet to get back to DPC with their views on the =
subject," sources said. This was one among various suggestions put forth by=
 DPC executives to the lenders.
The other issue that was discussed was the mothballing of the 1,444 mw seco=
nd phase of the project.Further, DPC executives also spelt out the differen=
ces between the company and the Godbole committee to a consortium of Indian=
 and foreign lenders."DPC representatives pointed out that there was a huge=
 gulf between the members of the Godbole panel and the company. The bone of=
 contention is the plant load factor (PLF) at which DPC will sell power to =
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). Dabhol Power is keen on a PLF o=
f 90 per cent which will bring down the tariff. The Godbole panel on the ot=
her hand wants a much lower offtake of power by MSEB," sources close to DPC=
 told Business Standard from Singapore.=20
The meeting was attended by Enron India, managing director, Wade Cline; DPC=
 president and CEO Neil McGregor and representatives of Indian financial in=
stitutions and banks like Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI, Stat=
e Bank of India. The foreign lenders were represented by the arrangers to t=
he loan for DPC including to Credit Suisse First Boston. DPC also sketched =
out a number of possible scenarios to the lenders in the wake of the prelim=
inary termination notice issued to MSEB. Sources however refused to elabora=
te further. DPC executives are scheduled to hold another round of discussio=
ns with the lenders to the project on Thursday.=20

'Captive, decentralised power projects are the answer to power shortage pro=
blem', Rajeev Jayaswal

THE failure of big power projects such as Dabhol proves that captive and de=
centralised power generation projects are the solution to the massive power=
 shortage in India, according to global power major Wartsila Corporation's =
president and CEO Ole Johansson. "The future of small power projects or dis=
tributed generation in India is quite promising, compared to large power pl=
ants," he said citing the company's growth in India."Wartsila, India, is ad=
ding about 200 MW power generation plants every year in India for the last =
five year and the growth is likely to continue even in the future," he said=
. Wartsila, India, has commissioned a number of distributed generating stat=
ions in India in the last 15 years, which altogether crossed the installed =
capacity by 2,000 MW. The power generation plants have been installed for i=
ndustries, utilities and independent power producers (IPPs).  "Out of the t=
otal 2,000 MW power projects installed, 50 per cent of the capacity was add=
ed in the last five years, showing the trend for small distributed generati=
ng stations located close to the load centres," he said.

Stating, there is a large demand and supply gap in India, Mr Johansson said=
: "India is currently short in peak demand by about 11 per cent. According =
to an estimate, about 1,00,000 MW will have to be added over the next 12 ye=
ars to the existing generating capacity of about 1,00,000 MW, to support a =
GDP growth rate of 6 per cent per annum."Speaking about the Enron controver=
sy, he said, "The company, the foreign lenders involved in the projects, an=
d both the state and the Central governments can find an amicable solution.=
"

He, however, added that the big plants are always difficult to finance, whe=
reas there are little financial and completion risks involved in small powe=
r projects. The company claims to install a captive power plant of 150 MW i=
n about 14 months which can run on both furnace oil, as well as natural gas=
.Stating that gas is the fuel of the future, Mr Johansson said that power g=
enerated by using gas fuel is cheaper than oil by about Rs 1, depending on =
the availability of gas and its market price. "The cost of power generation=
 is under Rs 3 per unit in case of gas, whereas in case of oil it is about =
Rs 4 per unit," he said. The Finnish company, Wartsila
