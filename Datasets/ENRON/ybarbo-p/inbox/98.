Paul,
 
WOW!!!  You do have some news.  Congratulations!  That's amazing how after all these years you marry a Port Neches girl...  Well, I certainly approve of your choice.  Renee was always such a nice and pretty girl and I'm sure that hasn't changed.  Please tell her how happy I am for the two of you.  Doesn't she have one son?  The last time we spoke you two were beginning to date and I believe you mentioned her son.  How long ago was that?  Too long...
 
Well, guess I'll update you on our family.  Chad is 13 yrs. old (boy, does that make me feel old!!!) and is very into sports.  He's a great kid most of the time but very strong willed.  The combination of strong will and the puberty stage could drive you crazy if you let it...Tom is still practicing international tax law and stays very busy.  He'd like to teach law school one day but that will probably have to wait until Chad finishes college. I am staying at home this year but went back to teaching part-time (high school level)  over the last couple of years.  Decided to take some real estate classes this year and work on my tennis game.  I also volunteer two days a week at his school.  We are living in Highland Park which is in Dallas but are moving to a suburb of Dallas called Southlake soon since our house has sold.  We'd like a bigger lot and Southlake is beautiful, located between Dallas & Fort Worth which is nice. I'll get you my new phone # in a few weeks.  
My family is all fine and the only detail I'll bore you with is that my brother, Cory, just married for the third time.  Third time's the charm, right???  We all hope so. Well, let me know more about your life when you have a change to write back.  How are your parents and siblings?  What type of work are you doing?  Where do you live in Houston?  Tell Renee hello and let me here from you...
 
Dana

Subject:  hi!
Hi Paul.  I received your message earlier this year and accidentally erased
it.  When I called information to get your number, a really young woman
(twenty-something) answered the phone number I was given....  She told me I
had the wrong number but I'm still wondering...  Anyway, hopefully you'll
receive this and reply with your current home number.  Are you still in
Puerto Rico?  You'll have to tell me about your experience there.  Let me
know if you receive this and I'll write back...  Talk to you soon...
Dana
