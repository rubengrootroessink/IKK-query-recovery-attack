Debbie,

No, I have no copy of this invoice in the Dynegy's file.  All the payments to Dynegy were directly from Chase.  Can I get copy of this invoice???
Paul,  which is the concept on these charges???

Jose,

Dynegy is calling and is looking for a payment of an old invoice.  Do you
have any records of making a payment from your LOCAL account to Dynegy for
their invoice # 11-AR-9281-9PC for $61,621.83???

I received a call from Paul Y'Barbo yesterday, and apparently this invoice
is over a year old.

There is a folder in one of the boxes, with all the Dynegy invoices, maybe
there is a copy of it in there???
