Great to hear back.  Jenny and I have just returned from a short trip to
Beijing, where we were antique shopping and eating great Chinese food.

Life in Hong Kong is fast paced and revolves around work.  I travel
throughout the region making private equity investments.  Weekends are a
time to catch up on sleep.  Pretty boring stuff.

I was very happy to hear that you have settled down.   Glad to see that you
have found someone who can put up with your ideosyncracies (I am kidding,
of course).

What are you doing at Enron?

Best,
Edan

Edan,

Thanks!!!! I didn't realize that you were still in Hong Kong. How's life???
Are you married? I can't remember.

Married life is good. Different but good.
