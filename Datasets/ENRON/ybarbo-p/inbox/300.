Are you Ready2Go ?
Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Enron Wholesale Services and EBS employee's...

	It's just for you and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:
A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>
You can go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, you will need to bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC1631D or EB2249B).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a brief training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.
