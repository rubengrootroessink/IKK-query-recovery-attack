Enron India lenders meet in Singapore today=20
Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeti=
ng in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued sup=
port to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India. Representative=
s of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank, ABN AMRO, and Bank of=
 America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Develo=
pment Bank of India, State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate. M=
arket analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint sta=
nd on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slat=
ed to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. But it comes aga=
inst a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utili=
ty, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer=
 of Dabhol's electricity.=20
Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to c=
ontinue supporting the project. But they are being opposed by offshore lend=
ers who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the o=
ffshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions. =
The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pu=
ll the plug, plan to oppose any such move. But they have been forced on the=
 backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and=
 terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift=
 the entire output.=20
The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has =
blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. Last month, Dabho=
l issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It h=
as also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol =
before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulator=
y Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration=
 proceedings. The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign =
investors.=20
Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in =
the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as a=
n example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors=
. "The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live=
 up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further de=
ter foreign direct investment from coming into the country," Moody's said. =
Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interv=
iew with Reuters on Sunday. "India is always in favour of making sure that =
international contracts are respected," he said. "There is no need for conc=
ern." (Reuters)

FIs working hard to end DPC crisis=20
The representatives of Indian financial institutions on Sunday left for Sin=
gapore to attend the two-day lenders' meeting beginning June 5 in a last di=
tch effort to defuse the escalated financial crisis between the Maharashtra=
 State Electricity Board (MSEB) and Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DP=
C). The FIs team is led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) exec=
utive director R S Agarwal, who is also DPC board member. The group also co=
mprises representatives of State Bank of India and ICICI.=20
The domestic lenders would update their foreign counterparts about the curr=
ent imbroglio and legal tangles including MSEB's petition filed in Maharash=
tra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) and the board's simultaneous d=
ecision to stop drawing DPC power from May 29 noon. ``One thing worrying th=
e Indian FIs is the foreign lenders' probable decision to encash their secu=
rities, which runs into more than Rs 2,500 crore'' a senior state official =
said here. ``I think, the divide between the domestic and foreign lenders w=
ill widen on this issue. The former are desperately trying to save their gu=
arantees from being encashed'', he added.=20
Last week, IDBI acting chairman and managing director S K Chakrabarti had s=
aid the total exposure of Indian lenders was Rs 6,600 crore. IDBI's exposur=
e was Rs 2,158 crore including guarantees worth Rs 1,528 crore and rupee lo=
ans of Rs 630 crore, he had said. FIs had last evening, held a meeting with=
 MSEB, trying to comprehend the state electricity board's views and stand o=
n resolving the crisis before embarking on the visit to Singapore. ``MSEB h=
as firmly told us that it will be able to draw power from DPC's first phase=
 only at a renegotiated lesser price and it wanted the Centre to take over =
phase II'', FI sources said. The foreign lenders have already taken a tough=
 stance on the issue and had also approved the preliminary termination noti=
ce in the April 23 meeting held in London, the sources added.=20
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is understood to have asked Union power=
 minister Suresh Prabhu in a meeting between them on June 1 in Delhi to pur=
sue the sale of power to deficit states as part of efforts to help DPC. Gov=
ernment sources had said sale of power to other states had emerged as the o=
nly option for Centre to help the troubled project as purchase of power by =
central utilities was not possible. The success of central initiative would=
 also hinge on the stance taken by Maharashtra government and MSEB on the i=
ssue, the sources had added. (PTI)

Centre's Dabhol package to include sops to help cut tariff, Soma Banerjee=
=20
=20
THE Centre's new pack for the Enron power project is expected to include fi=
scal sops and financial concessions so as to reduce the tariff. On its part=
 the state electricity board will have to commit itself to a time bound ref=
orm programme. The new package which is being worked out by the power minis=
try in consultation with the finance ministry is expected to take about two=
 to three months time sources said. According to power minister Suresh Prab=
hu, he has been in discussion with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on t=
he developments and their consequences. "PM too is with us on the view take=
n till now. We all are committed to seeing that the project works and we wi=
ll play our role as a facilitator whenever it is required." The Centre's re=
cent move to direct CEA to work out a contingency plan for the sale of powe=
r from Dabhol to other consumers has come as a big comfort to the lenders. =
"Lenders who are the majority stake holders with a debt equity ratio of 70:=
30 are the worst hit in such a scenario. They would want the project saved =
and are not really interested in termination and arbitration proceedings. T=
he Centre's move has helped them gain confidence that a solution will be fo=
und." Among the the financial breaks that are being considered are a cut in=
 the bank interest rates. This would be the second cut in bank rate .DPC to=
o would be required to lower its internal rate of return to reduce the tari=
ffs sufficiently.=20

The other thing which the Centre is trying to see is to work on a reduced c=
ustoms duty on LNG. With the budget already doing away with the 16 per cent=
 CVD on LNG, the fuel which would have otherwise have been costlier will no=
w be relatively cheaper. The third fiscal break involves the state governme=
nt. The negotiating committee is trying to explore the possibilities of cut=
ting down the incidence of sales tax. Power Grid Corporation of India has a=
lready begun the exercise of working on the transmission links and accordin=
g to sources, the export of power can start in the near future provided the=
 states are willing to work out their financial mechanisms. Justifying the =
move against buying out the plant by NTPC, the power minister said: "If NTP=
C were to defend every plant that is in trouble it would mean the end of re=
forms in the states. Moreover you would soon turn NTPC into a sick company.=

India to respect global contracts: Prabhu=20
=20
INDIA is in favour of ensuring international contracts are respected, Union=
 power minister Suresh Prabhu said as investors' fears grow over a squabble=
 between US energy giant Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.=
 The row was sparked late last year when MSEB defaulted on payments of $48 =
million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 per cent owned by Houston-based Enron. =
Prabhu said it was obvious investors saw some question-marks over Enron's $=
2.9-billion power plant, which is India's largest private foreign investmen=
t. Enron is building the plant, but the dispute with the MSEB, has threaten=
ed to derail the 2,184-mw power project. "We have to address those concerns=
 adequately because the Government of India is always in favour of making s=
ure that international contracts are respected in the process of assuring a=
ll the foreign investors that there is no need for concern," Prabhu said.=
=20

Signs emerged last week that investors were souring on India.=20

Global rating agency Fitch last Thursday revised India's sovereign rating o=
utlook to negative from stable, citing concerns over fiscal policy, privati=
sation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Compe=
ting agency Moody's said on Friday it saw slippage in the Indian government=
's reform effort, but declined to say whether a ratings change could be exp=
ected, while Standard & Poor's said it was worried about the size of the bu=
dget deficit. Asked if he felt the Enron row had deterred investors, Prabhu=
 said: "This is one single issue. We must deal with it in the manner in whi=
ch it is possible in a given situation." "There is a negotiation going on. =
The central government has a representative on the negotiating committee an=
d I am sure that the only way in which commercial disputes can be settled i=
s through negotiations." Prabhu was referring to a panel set up last month =
by the Maharashtra government to renegotiate the tariffs charged by the 2,1=
84-mw Dabhol power project.=20

The MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to buy the plant's entire output, says the p=
ower is too costly and has defaulted on $48 million in power payments. Dabh=
ol issued a notice last month to cancel its power purchase deal, a move man=
y investors fear could be the first step towards getting out of the project=
 entirely. "The phase in which we are right now ... is the phase in which s=
ome independent power producers have already contracted certain obligations=
 which we will definitely like to uphold, which should be honoured," Prabhu=
 added. "Because in India contracts are very important. Sanctity of contrac=
ts should be kept." (Reuters)

Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase=20

India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, wi=
th plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilit=
ies and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. With in=
vestors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp an=
d a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is=
 standing behind international contracts. "Sanctity of contracts has to be =
kept," Prabhu said.=20
The row began late last year when the utility in Maharashtra defaulted on p=
ayments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. =
The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 b=
illion. Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. "Absolu=
tely," he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered =
a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribu=
tion, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs. "In =
India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in fa=
vour of generation," he said. "We never really realised that distribution i=
s the more important part of the process." Prabhu added, "We have now decid=
ed we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the en=
d of distribution enough investment is made."=20
A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's we=
stern coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the c=
ountry's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. An =
errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian=
 politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the=
 shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered =
government, and whom local media call "technocrats". Prabhu said India has =
decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifti=
ng curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort.=20
He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's =
states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a s=
tumbling-block for foreign investment. "They cannot force a generator to se=
ll power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make,=
" Prabhu said, referring to the states. SEBs or state electricity boards ar=
e owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India. India =
estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over =
the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in fund=
s that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment. =
But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wa=
ry. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held=
 up reform moves.=20
Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlo=
ok to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privat=
isation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Comp=
eting agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & =
Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. Prabhu said he wa=
nts to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting po=
licies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tac=
kling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the secto=
r. The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined =
losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle =
in efforts to draw private investment.=20
Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances -- l=
ooking at technical, commercial and tariff issues -- is expected to report =
within a few weeks. "For the first time we will be preparing commercial dat=
a which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data wh=
ich is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an infor=
mation base which will be created by experts and then made available to the=
 states," he said. The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run =
to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure =
of about eight percent internationally, he said.=20
Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. "I=
n the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 pe=
rcent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but Othe=
r steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern re=
gion with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through mo=
dernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficie=
ntly. Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves thro=
ugh a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, o=
r even free, as many did in the past. (Reuters)=20

Scrap the PPA with Dabhol?, Dr R K Pachauri=20

IT is unfortunate that the Dabhol project is in such a terrible mess. This =
is clearly the result of serious lapses and mistakes on the part of all the=
 stakeholders. But I would not agree with those who are clamouring for the =
termination of the PPA by the Maharashtra government. It could very well ha=
ppen that we are left with no choice in the end but to cancel the contract,=
 but this if at all should be a legal decision and not a business decision.=
 The fact of the matter is that we have a large facility established on Ind=
ian soil, which we must find ways to use for the benefit of the country.=20

I have not seen the plant at all, but from all accounts that I have heard e=
ven from those who regard the whole project as a big mistake, this is a ver=
y well engineered plant. To harp on the termination of the contract would b=
e like cutting your nose to spite your face. At no time must the action of =
the MSEB, the Maharashtra government or the government of India be-or even =
appear to be- arbitrary or spiteful.=20

The Dabhol officials have signaled their willingness to renegotiate the con=
tract, and we must therefore go through the process with an open mind but w=
ith our position clearly specified, namely that of getting a fair deal for =
the consumer of Dabhol power. I believe the contract can be renegotiated an=
d a reasonable tariff hammered out between the parties to the contract, and=
 I also believe that the re-negotiations should be conducted directly betwe=
en the parties themselves, unencumbered by any group or committee that may =
have analysed the project. The road map for renegotiating the deal has been=
 provided by the Committee set up to review the project in the report it ha=
s submitted to the Maharashtra government. The rest is a matter of give and=
 take based on how much each stakeholder is willing to concede.=20

The various measures outlined in the report clearly indicate the impact tha=
t these would have on the tariff. If all these are followed and the sales t=
o other customers facilitated such that the plant runs at full capacity, th=
e tariff would come down substantially. Maharashtra cannot at this stage ab=
sorb the power produced from the two phases of the project, and therefore o=
ther parts of the country would need to be supplied the bulk of the output =
from this plant. The central and the state governments must facilitate this=
 as part of renegotiated deal, which of course would involve a major shift =
in the position of the promoters of the project in several ways detailed in=
 the report.=20

For all practical purposes, sales of power by IPPs are unrestricted, and ca=
n involve more than one state. In the case of Dabhol, however, it was belie=
ved at the stage of project design that all the power would be absorbed by =
one state. There are today the so called mega power projects where power fr=
om a particular project will be sold to more than one state. But I believe =
there is a case for greater flexibility in the policy in this regard and ge=
tting the Power Trading Corporation divested of its monopoly power as the o=
nly trader for interstate supplies of power from IPPs.=20

One important feature of the Dabhol project is the large LNG facility and r=
elated infrastructure that has been established. The answer to the question=
 whether this should be treated as part of the power project depends on the=
 fact whether these facilities are fully dedicated to the production of pow=
er or have a large surplus capacity. In the case of Dabhol the latter happe=
ns to be the case. Hence it makes both business sense and sound legal logic=
 to separate the two.=20

There is no reason why the entire LNG infrastructure, which has capacity fa=
r beyond the needs of the power project, should not be separated as a disti=
nctly different profit centre. This would bring down the cost of power gene=
rated significantly, and make the whole deal neat and transparent. This wou=
ld be in the nation's and the consumer's interest.=20

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20
Bring this sorry saga to end, Abhay Mehta=20

MUCH ado about nothing - that's what I think of the Dabhol controversy. I a=
m frankly perplexed at the hype and the ado being made on the Dabhol issue.=
 If after eight years, basic issues have not come through even trivially, t=
hen this country is doomed anyway. To reiterate the fundamental issues are:=
=20

a) What is signed is a contract simpliciter between two parties: A contract=
ing party (Enron) has agreed to sell another (MSEB) a commodity (electricit=
y) for a price (US$ 0.0872 a unit) in a fixed quantity (1728 crore units) f=
or a period of time (20 years) ie. MSEB is liable for $1.4 billion plus (Rs=
 6,500 crore plus) a year, year on year for the next twenty years. These pa=
yments are indexed to just about all possible economic indices. The rise in=
 payments in rupee terms is minimally 12 per cent a year.=20

b) It is not, repeat not, a foreign investment: one would have hoped that b=
y now, if this nation has even a vestige of economic sense, the basic calcu=
lation of the net foreign investment would be public.=20

The substantial over capitalisation (over 60-70 per cent), the direct lendi=
ng by Indian FI's (about 55 per cent of the over-capitalised capital costs)=
, the indirect lending (guarantees to by Indian FI's to foreign FI's- about=
 18 per cent of project costs) and MSEB's own equity investments implies th=
at all the money is Indian. The net effective investment on Enron's part is=
 close to zero or even negative.=20

c) There is no set of economic circumstances (growth rates, industry off-ta=
ke) or even political (MSEB "reforms") that will allow the purchase of this=
 power. The basic premise that there are buyers for outrageously expensive =
base-load power is itself fundamentally flawed.=20

Even in the most power deficient state, there is no shortage of power in th=
e night. However the Enron meter keeps on ticking: in fact at the rate of U=
S $ 0.184 million an hour, hour upon hour for 21.6 hours a day. There is no=
 scope for payments of this magnitude even in ideal circumstances.=20

d) There is little scope for 're-negotiations' in an economically acceptabl=
e manner. All the current talk (reduction of FI's interest rates, 'sharing =
of burden' etc.) is largely of no consequence.=20

The fundamental issue remains the same - over-capitalisation, forex linkage=
s (on the fuel LNG, etc.) and the profit margins (well in excess of those a=
llowed by law - of the order of 60 per cent even on notional equity). Enron=
 has stated in unequivocal terms that these are issues that are not open to=
 negotiations of any kind.=20

e) It does not matter if Enron leaves. Given, the above, big deal. That thi=
s country is unable to do what Croatia, Pakistan and Indonesia have done, r=
eflects on India not on Enron.=20

f) The only signal that would go out would be positive one - to quote the q=
uintessential epitome of right wing, free market thought - The Economist, w=
hich wrote, at the time of the first cancellation, about "the India that ca=
n say no".=20

g) It is more than possible to terminate the contract without any liabiliti=
es in either political ('sanctity of contract') or economic ('termination l=
iabilities').=20

Even currently, Enron is in severe breach of its contractual obligations. I=
n any case, the condition precedent to the sanctity of the contract - the n=
ecessary clearances (the CEA's techno-economic clearance) are not in place =
and even an admittedly illegal "technical" clearance addressed to Enron sta=
tes that construction on phase 2 shall not begin until GOM/MSEB ensure comp=
lete absorption of power. This condition has not even been met for phase 1,=
 never mind going ahead with phase 2. Enron went ahead on it's own risk des=
pite being aware of the lacunae.=20

Other more substantive issues (a fraudulent tariff clearance) as well actio=
n under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Section 13 (i) d) against public =
servants unknown wherein the act of actually giving or taking money is not =
to be proved - simply that a private party benefited at the expense of the =
public exchequer (gratuitous largesse to private parties). Jayalalitha (in =
the Tansi case) as well as the recent cases in the Doordarshan case come un=
der this section.=20

These are avenues that ought to be pursed to bring this sorry saga to the e=
nd it deserves.=20

he-art power station for Phase-I with a nominal baseload capacity of 670 mw=
. It was represented that the power plant will have certain dynamic paramet=
ers. One of the key parameters was the plant capacity to ramp up upto 100 p=
er cent load within three hours.=20

Relying upon these representations the MSEB consented to the PPA. Since the=
 commissioning of the Phase I plant in May '99, the DPC has been billing MS=
EB for capacity payments based on the rated base-load capacity for each ava=
ilability period. Until January 2001, the ramp up capacity had not come int=
o question, nor was MSEB told that it was materially different from that st=
ated in the contract. On January 28, '01 however, MSEB asked for 657 mw in =
three hours to meet an urgent requirement. The DPC, however, could deliver =
only 156 mw. There were similar defaults in February and March '01 which en=
titled MSEB to rebate as per the PPA. The DPC, however, refused to pay the =
rebate. Instead, in its letters, while admitting that the actual performanc=
e does not conform to the contract, it has disputed MSEB's rebate claim.=20

The Board gave sufficient opportunities to resolve the issue but DPC starte=
d pressurising the Board for making payments for December 2000 and January =
2001which had been adjusted against rebate that it had failed to pay. Then =
it invoked guarantees of the state and central governments. Notices of arbi=
tration were served. Another notice declaring Political Force Majeure was f=
ollowed by instructions to our banks to activate escrow accounts. Finally, =
the DPC issued two Preliminary Termination Notices on May 19, 01.=20

In the opinion of MSEB, its rebate claims are valid and its consent to the =
PPA was caused by material misrepresentation. We were advised by our lawyer=
s that the agreement is void and/or voidable at our option. Accordingly, th=
e Board issued a notice to DPC on May 23 rescinding the contract. To avoid =
inconvenience to all concerned, the Board made a very reasonable offer to t=
he DPC, which was without prejudice, to continue purchase of power at old t=
erms till the disputes are resolved, provided such payments were later adju=
sted on the basis of determination by a competent forum.=20

But the DPC responded that the Board could not have its cake and eat too; h=
aving rescinded the contract, if it continued to buy power, it would be tak=
en as affirmation to hold the contract valid. Therefore, we stopped drawing=
 power from the noon of May 29. MSEB has been up-to-date in payments of its=
 monthly dues including the two bills adjusted against the rebate. For thei=
r latest bill also, the Board sent the cheque 'under protest' on the due da=
te, the May 25, but the DPC refused to take delivery.=20

Notwithstanding these differences, without prejudice to our respective stan=
ds, both DPC and MSEB are seeking an amicable solution to the issue in the =
forum provided by the Godbole committee. The average price of supply of DPC=
 power to MSEB in the last two years has been about Rs 5.60 per unit. We dr=
ew less last year because of MERC restrictions on drawal of this expensive =
power and the rate for the last twelve months has climbed up to Rs 8.08 per=
 unit. Since the prevailing consumer tariffs are much lower, without prejud=
ice to our notice rescinding the contract, negotiations are continuing in t=
he Godbole committee to reduce the DPC tariff to acceptable levels. Even to=
day, the DPC is free to sell power to anyone outside the state but it is un=
willing to become a merchant generator.=20

MSEB is willing to wheel DPC power. If, however, IPPs are allowed to sell p=
ower within the Board's area, they will naturally choose the most profitabl=
e customers, namely the HT industrial consumers. Figures show that our tari=
ff structure is so distorted that the Board subsidises 9 out of 10 consumer=
s. (1.18 crore customers are subsidised out of 1.30 crore). If the 10th con=
sumer is taken away from the Board, its losses will mount further.=20

Dabhol Block B not yet commissioned , Sanjay Jog
UNCERTAINTY looms large over the commissioning of Block B (722 mw) of Dabho=
l phase-II by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in view of Maharashtra State E=
lectricity Board's (MSEB) decision to rescind power purchase agreement (PPA=
) and suspend power purchase since May 29 noon.The DPC, which had planned t=
o commission the block b on June 7, was tight lipped and declined to commen=
t at this point of time. "We have nothing to offer," replied DPC spokesman =
on Monday, on the eve of Dabhol lenders meeting in Singapore.
Further, the fate of performance test to be carried out by DPC in the prese=
nce of MSEB officials also hangs in the balance as the company has already =
suspended the test runs.According to section 5.1 of power purchase agreemen=
t, "DPC shall, at least seven days before hand, give MSEB notice of and sha=
ll invite MSEB's representatives to attend any performance tests, but the f=
ailure of such representatives to amend will not result in the postponement=
 or failure of any such tests and any tests conducted in relation to the en=
try into commercial services of the liquified natural gas facility. MSEB sh=
all pay DPC the commissioning charges specified in schedule 10, part VIII i=
n respect of such active energy."
However, MSEB soures told The Financial Express that it has not received an=
y notice from DPC on carrying out performance test. These sources said that=
 even if DPC conducts performance test, MSEB would not join it on the groun=
ds that it has not only rescinded the PPA but also taken up the matter with=
 the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc). "The matter is s=
ubjudice and thus we will not like to be present during performance test. T=
he possibility of DPC going in for an expert test cannot be ruled out," sou=
rces added.
The performance test is unavoidable to avoid misdeclaration and deliver pow=
er within 180 minutes from a cold start.MSEB recalled that DPC had conducte=
d performance tests in May 1999 prior to "entry into commercial service" of=
 Dabhol phase-I since May 13. The company had tested the nominal baseload c=
apacity of the phase-I plant and found that it was 658.56 instead of 670 mw=
, a position later accepted by DPC and MSEB.
Thereafter, the rated baseload capacity was fixed at 658.56 mw for each hou=
r called an "availability period."=20

Patkar said that some politicians with vested interests were trying to scut=

Enron 'frustrated' by India talks
By Julie Earle in New York and Khozem Merchant in Bombay

Enron, the US energy group, says it is becoming "increasingly frustrated" w=
ith its negotiations with the Maharashtra state government agencies in Indi=
a. The group denied reports that it was renegotiating the contract and the =
tariff between its Indian arm, the Dabhol Power Company, and its sole custo=
mer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). "That is not true," said a=
n Enron spokesman at the weekend. "Why would we renegotiate with counter pa=
rties? They are trying to imply a contract that was in place for eight year=
s and operating for two years does not exist." The denial came as Indian an=
d foreign banks prepared to try to bridge their differences over sustaining=
 support for Dabhol's $2.9bn power project near Bombay, which has been supp=
lying the Maharashtra utility.=20
A two-day meeting in Singapore starting on Tuesday will aim to stake out co=
mmon ground, which lenders hope will remove the uncertainty dogging the con=
troversial 2,184MW power project. The Indian utility owes Dabhol $45m but i=
s demanding in turn a greater sum in rebates for what it describes as the U=
S company's failure to meet technical thresholds. Foreign lenders have stop=
ped disbursing loans to the 1,444MW second phase of the project, which is d=
ue for completio n soon. The 740MW first phase was commissioned in May 1999=
. ABN Amro and Bank of America are some of the foreign banks that will thra=
sh out the issues with State Bank of India, Industrial Development Bank of =
India and ICICI.=20
People close to the talks say the situation has "worsened" since the last l=
enders' meeting in April, when Dabhol received authorisation to quit the pr=
oject. Dabhol has since issued a pre-termination notice, signalling its int=
ent to withdraw in six months if a solution is not found. MSEB has responde=
d to the threat by abandoning its power purchase contract with the company =
and has refused to draw any more power. Dabhol has not generated any power =
in the last six days. MSEB's decision to stop lifting power alarmed Indian =
banks, whose exposure of funded loans and guarantees to the project totals =
about $66bn, about 70 per cent of the total debt raised to finance the proj=
ect. Foreign banks raised the balance of about $600m. "There are difference=
s [between the banks], even among the foreign ones. Each has a different ap=
petite for risk. But I would not characterise it as a rift," said one parti=
cipant in Tuesday's meeting.=20
Despite the tense atmosphere, power industry executives say there is an inc=
reasing realisation that the banks and Dabhol must resolve their difficulti=
es "because this project is too big to fail". Suresh Prabhu, India's power =
minister, intervened last week, calling on the country's top power authorit=
y to look at how Dabhol's 2184MW of power might be exported to power-defici=
ent states elsewhere in India. The dispute has alarmed foreign investors an=
d rating agencies. Last week, Fitch, the international rating agency, adjus=
ted the outlook on India's sovereign rating of BB+ from stable to negative.=
 It says central and state government guarantees - issued to support infras=
tructure projects such as Enron's - amount to 9 per cent of GDP and "are co=
ntingent liabilities of the government". Enron said at the weekend that it =
was still operating and open to discussions but there needed to be some sig=
n from state agencies that they were beginning "to reverse practices of den=
ying obligations under contracts".

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, June 05, 2001=20
Power experts get it wrong, Sanjeev S Ahluwalia=20

STATE utilities owe Rs 40,640 crore to central power generators alone. This=
 is one half of their annual revenues. Overdue payments equal to eight mont=
hs of revenue are sure signs of insolvency and financial unsustainability, =
especially when the interest rate for incremental debt of 24 per cent is th=
ree to four times the growth rate of revenue. The government of India set u=
p a group of experts, chaired by Dr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, to recommend a =
solution. Part one of the report was submitted in April 2001. Here is why t=
he experts have gone wrong. The bulk of the overdue payments to central pow=
er suppliers are the consequence of an arbitrary and ill-advised tariff inc=
rease, in 1992 and again in 1998, of these central generators.=20

The allowed rate for depreciation was raised from 3.4 per cent to 7.4 per c=
ent. In 1998 the allowed rate of return was increased from 12 per cent to 1=
6 per cent, even for existing plants. These measures add around Rs 2300 cro=
re to the annual revenues of NTPC alone. State utilities are, however, cons=
trained from passing through such increases by public pressure to keep reta=
il prices low. The result has been cascading volumes of overdue payments fo=
r power purchase. The Enron story and the more recent unilateral shut down =
of the generation facility run by AES in Orissa, are sequels of the same ma=
lady.=20

Enron is being renegotiated presumably because the costs were arbitrary. Th=
e experts, however, failed to recognise a similar arbitrariness in the tari=
ff increase, effected by GoI, prior to the formation of the central power r=
egulator.=20

The fact is the bulk of these over-dues should be waived, as they should ne=
ver have been levied in the first place.=20

State utilities face two kinds of financial challenges, which impact state =
government finances. The first is tackling the overdue payments or borrowin=
gs contracted to meet these liabilities. The experts have recommended that =
state governments take responsibility for these overdues, by issuing bonds =
in favour of the creditors. This is a welcome step towards fiscal responsib=
ility, since these overdues are the contingent liability of state governmen=
ts.=20

Failure to service the bonds, or failure to pay future power dues invites h=
eavy censure including suspension of central transfers. These are efficient=
 penalties in themselves. Where the experts have gone wrong is in ignoring =
the imbalance in revenue flows while restructuring the stock of overdues. R=
eforms were supposed to bridge the revenue imbalances. Firstly, Regulatory =
Commissions were to raise tariffs to meet costs. Commissions, which work in=
 a quasi-judicial manner and must needs safeguard the interest of the consu=
mer, have justifiably baulked at passing through ``inefficient costs''.=20

The Andhra Pradesh Commission has not raised tariffs at all in 2001-2002. S=
econdly, privatisation was supposed to cut costs and improve revenues. This=
 has not happened. Even where the private sector has taken over distributio=
n, as in Orissa, its capacity for efficiency improvements is now seen to be=
 overrated. Nor is the private sector willing to finance the transition to =
financial stabilisation. It is, therefore, the existing state utilities, wh=
ich are now expected to provide efficiency improvements in operations. This=
 a tall order.=20

In fact, the very process of `reform' provides perverse incentives to let e=
fficiencies fall and the system to decay pending eventual privatisation. Th=
is was the Orissa story from 1995 to 1999. The result is that most reformin=
g state utilities need a bridge facility to balance the revenue budget. The=
 experts have ignored this fact. By converting the overdues into equity, he=
ld by central generators and Indian financial institutions and thereby faci=
litating their participation in Board level management, the state utilities=
 could be assured the commercial autonomy which is key to improving their p=
erformance.=20

However, true `risk sharing' of this nature, which is a prospective concept=
, has been ignored by the experts in favour of `loss sharing', which is a b=
ackward looking concept and hence self limiting. By tackling only the stock=
 and ignoring the flow of future overdues, the experts have devised a solut=
ion, which is bound to fail. Let's take the case of Uttar Pradesh. This ref=
orming state government has already waived Rs 20,000 crore owed by the stat=
e utility to it and assumed Rs 10,000 crore of the utilities liabilities, i=
ncluding unfunded pension liabilities. In addition, it provides Rs 1000 cro=
re every year as subsidy and an equal amount as capital infusion. The reven=
ue gap is still around Rs 1000 crore per year. Future efficiency improvemen=
ts will only dilute the incremental revenue mismatch from a 7 per cent annu=
al increase in supply.=20

Hence, in five years, the cumulative revenue gap, after subsidy, will be Rs=
 5000 crore or double the existing level of payments overdue to central gen=
erators. Against this requirement, the formula allows UP to float additiona=
l bonds for only Rs 600 crore leaving an unfinanced gap of Rs 4400 crore pl=
us interest on this amount. Even if UP could borrow this amount, it would i=
nflate its fiscal deficit by 44 per cent. The resultant interest payments w=
ould inflate its revenue deficit by 15 per cent or UP will need to cut back=
 other revenue expenditure by around Rs 350 crore or 1 per cent of total re=
venue expenditure.=20

UP is not the exception to this fact. States may still opt for the formula,=
 despite its limitations. However, this is not an endorsement of the robust=
ness of the formula but rather the helplessness of insolvent states. It is =
no one's case that fiscal imbalance should become an excuse for easy money =
but a package for fiscal stabilisation cannot ignore the differing base lev=
els of such imbalances, both stock and flow, within the states. Incentives =
and penalties are efficient only when they can induce the required fiscal r=
esponse. By adopting a ``cookie cutter'' uniform approach to financial rest=
ructuring, the experts have ensured that only states at the margin, or thos=
e least requiring immediate assistance, will corner the lion's share of the=
 assistance.=20

THE TELEGRAPH
Singh Protest Puts Sonia In Bind On Enron , RASHEED KIDWAI, Sunday, June 3,=
 2001

Sonia Gandhi is in a bind over the demand for a judicial probe into the Enr=
on deal due to opposition from Manmohan Singh and N.K.P. Salve. Maharashtra=
 chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is waiting for Sonia's signal to implemen=
t the Madhav Godbole committee report that has recommended a judicial inqui=
ry into the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).If Sonia vetoes Manmohan and Sal=
ve, there will be a question mark over the continuation of the Democratic F=
ront government in Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party h=
as made it clear that it will part ways in case its alliance partner, the C=
ongress, favours a probe. There is a sharp division in the Congress over th=
e Enron deal. Madhavrao Scindia, Pranab Mukherjee, Motilal Vora, Murli Deor=
a and Arjun Singh are in favour of the probe but Manmohan is reluctant as t=
he deal was struck during his tenure as the Union finance minister. Salve, =
then, held the power portfolio.=20
Party leaders said the "image-conscious" Manmohan would take offence though=
 there is nothing that could go against him in the probe. He had reportedly=
 not even attended the Cabinet meetings in which Dabhol power project was d=
iscussed. Sonia, who chaired the meeting on Enron, has decided to ascertain=
 the views of the Maharashtra Congress unit. "She will go by its opinion," =
a source close to Sonia said. A section of the Maharastra party unit wants =
Sonia to take an aggressive stance and queer the pitch for Pawar, who was i=
nstrumental in getting the deal through. "In case of a judicial probe, thre=
e leaders, Pawar, Bal Thackeray and Atal Bihari Vajpayee are going to be th=
e worst affected. Since the trio is a known enemy of the Congress, why shou=
ld we shield them?" a senior leader from the state, who called on Sonia to =
press for the probe, asked.
But another section of the party is opposed to it on the ground that the Co=
ngress-NCP alliance would fall through. "The Deshmukh government is doing a=
 fine job. Why should we rock the boat? Secondly, what kind of signal would=
 we be sending to the MNCs and investors?" a party MP asked.But Pawar's det=
ractors in the state Congress are getting restless. According to them, the =
leadership should either work for a merger with the breakaway group or take=
 on Pawar to end the confusion over "two Congresses". Going by the present =
mood, the merger is unlikely as Pawar, P.A. Sangma and Tariq Anwar continue=
 to make Sonia's foreign origin an issue.
