Greg,
 
Attached is the language that Dan Masters, Gene Massey, and I have come up with that could be included in the SPA that you are currently negotiating. All of the details would be hammered out in the proposed fuel supply contracts mentioned in the attached document. Those LNG and LPG supply contracts will be lengthy documents. I would expect them to be 30 to 60 pages in length. 
 
Please note that I am sending this from my personal e-mail account. I do not check this very often, therefore please send any replies to my Enron e-mail address.
 
Call me at 713 825-8046 if you need anything.
 
Paul
