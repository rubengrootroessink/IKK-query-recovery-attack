Hi Paul,

I'd like to get some more information before following up on your request.

Could you please provide the following so I can research this.
1. Effective Begin Date
2. Effective End Date
3. Ref Begin Date
4. Ref End Date
5. Publication
6. Curve Code. 

Sorry to ask for these again, but these specifics are needed to analyze the data that was returned to you. 

Thanks,
Kim
