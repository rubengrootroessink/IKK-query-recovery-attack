Godbole quits, protests Pawar's remarks, Aditya Chatterjee=20

DR MADHAV Godbole, chairman of the Godbole Committee, appointed by the Maha=
rashtra government to  renegotiate the power purchase agreement with Enron-=
promoted Dabhol Power Company, has resigned after Nationalist Congress Part=
y supremo Sharad Pawar implied that he was not the right person to head the=
 talks. In an apparent criticism of Godbole, Pawar had said on Tuesday he w=
as apprehensive about the outcome of the renegotiations "as those leading t=
he talks from the government side are working with a negative approach". Go=
dbole's resignation was in protest of this allegation. "I have resigned due=
 to derogatory remarks made against me by Nationalist Congress Party chief =
Sharad Pawar on Tuesday night," Godbole said here. Maharashtra has a coalit=
ion government, comprising the Congress and the NCP. And as the chief of NC=
P, Pawar has considerable clout in Maharashtra politics.=20

Pawar was the state's chief minister when Maharashtra first signed an agree=
ment with US-based power major Enron. DPC is a joint venture, with Enron as=
 the majority shareholder. Enron has publicly said it was not willing to ac=
cept the terms of the Godbole panel report, which had suggested a re-negoti=
ation of PPA, among others. In the light of Godbole's resignation, it seems=
 that Enron may have scored a vital point in its negotiation with governmen=
t authorities. It is not surprising that Enron is inimical to Godbole. The =
Madhav Godbole-led Energy Review Committee's report on the DPC project in M=
aharashtra had blamed DPC as well its major shareholders, Enron, General El=
ectric and Bechtel, for a lack of due diligence to ensure the absorption of=
 the entire DPC power after phase II was complete. The report had also slam=
med the role of financial institutions when it found they had exhibited poo=
r  judgement and lack of due diligence in accepting these  projections with=
out demur, and disbursing funds for the  phase II of the DPC project. "The =
decision of the financial institutions to fund this project seems to have b=
een based primarily on the escrow account given by MSEB, the state governme=
nt guarantee  and the counter guarantee by the Central government for phase=
 I, rather than an independent and meticulous appraisal of the project," th=
e Godbole report noted.=20

The same financial institutions are now vigorously lobbying  with the Centr=
e to ensure Enron does not pull out of India. The Godbole Committee had als=
o expressed deep concern at the apparent failure of overnance that allowed =
such decisions to be taken. "A government that takes decisions involving th=
e incurring   of liabilities to the extent of over Rs 6,000 crore a year (a=
nd rising) for over 20 years, in so cavalier a fashion, cannot at   the sam=
e time, assert that the courts must presume it  acts in the public interest=
," the report noted. The crux of India's problems with Enron lies on the is=
sue of whether Enron is over-charging India. The Maharashtra government say=
s that when the first PPA was signed in 1994, it was assumed that the DPC w=
ould  provide power at the rate of Rs 2.20 per unit, corresponding  with th=
e rate of dollar at Rs 30 and cost of LNG at Rs  4,300 prevailing at that t=
ime. But that criterion, unfortunately, has not been considered, and now th=
e state has to pay Rs 8.54 for every unit of power.=20

State chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has gone on record to say: ``Even if=
 we buy the entire power as per the agreement, the cost will be Rs 5.20 per=
 unit." Enron, of course, claims that the higher power tariff was on accoun=
t of the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the increase in w=
orld fuel prices. The negotiating committee, which comprises members of the=
 Godbole Committee, representatives of Enron, Maharashtra State Electricity=
 Board and the Centre, was supposed to meet on Wednesday, but the meeting w=
as cancelled after Godbole put in his papers. It is not clear at this junct=
ure whether the Maharashtra government will straight-away appoint a success=
or to Godbole or request him to reconsider his decision to  resign.

CM refuses to accept Godbole's resignation

In a significant development, CM Vilasrao Deshmukh has refused to accept th=
e resignation  of Madhav Godbole, who heads the Enron renegotiation panel, =
saying that he (Godbole)  need not react to comments made by persons "outsi=
de the government".Deshmukh confirmed receiving Godbole's resignation but s=
aid that he has not accepted it. " I told him that he need not react to the=
 comments made by persons outside the government. The panel was appointed b=
y the state Government and we as the government are in total support of God=
bole. I have requested him to continue and I hope that he will reconsider h=
is decision". When asked if the crisis would pose any threat to the ruling =
coalition Deshmukh said there was no immediate cause for worry.

 Meanwhile, a crucial meeting on re-negotiation of the Power Purchase Agree=
ment (PPA) between Maharashtra State Eelectricity Board (MSEB) and Enron-pr=
omoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for 2184 mw power plant at Guhaghar in Ra=
tnagiri district has been cancelled following the resignation of Godbole. C=
onfirming the cancellation of the meeting, the MSEB chairman and member of =
re-negotiation commitee, Vinay Bansal said that in wake of the resignation =
of committee chairman Dr Madhavrao Godbole the meeting has been cancelled. =
 Godbole chief of the committee appointed by the state Government to renego=
tiate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC) ha=
d resigned this morning following criticism by the NCP president Sharad Paw=
ar.Pawar had said that it was difficult to find any solution through a comm=
ittee which was headed by a person having negative mind set. Though he did =
not mention Godbole, his criticism was clearly directed towards him.

'Govt should take a stand & stand by it', Aditya Chatterjee=20

NATIONALIST Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said on Tuesday he was appreh=
ensive about the outcome of Maharashtra government's renegotiations with Da=
bhol Power Company "as those leading the talks from the government side are=
 working with a negative approach". Madhav Godbole, chairman of the negotia=
ting committee, put in his papers in protest. Godbole spoke to Aditya Chatt=
erjee of Times Internet Network about what led to his resignation. Excerpts=
:=20

You were appointed the negotiating committee chairman by the Maharashtra go=
vernment to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the Enron-promote=
d Dabhol Power Company. A key member of the  government has now criticised =
you. Do you feel being let down?=20
The government should learn to first take a stand and then stand by it. As =
you rightly pointed out, the Maharashtra government had appointed me as the=
 committee head. And now, an important constituent of the government has al=
leged that the negotiating committee has a negative attitude. This type of =
a statement weakens the committee's stand on the crucial issue of negotiati=
ng the power purchase agreement with DPC. The government should try to give=
 all the support to the committee and help strengthen it. Tuesday's comment=
s by the senior NCP leader is counter-productive in this light. I have resi=
gned because if the state government is not able  to place its full trust o=
n my capabilities, there's no reason  for me to stay on. Therefore, I sent =
my resignation to the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.=20

Sharad Pawar was the chief minister of Maharashtra when the state first sig=
ned an agreement with US-based power major Enron in 1993-94. You were also =
regarded as the thorn in Enron's flesh. In fact, Enron has publicly said it=
 was not willing to accept the terms of your committee report. Doesn't your=
  resignation, in effect, help out Enron and its supporters?=20
I would not like to comment on this. It's for you to decide. But, the outco=
me of the negotiation will be decided by the kind of panel that the governm=
ent constitutes. Hopefully, the committee will have a positive attitude thi=
s time.=20

Is your decision to resign final or will you consider withdrawing the lette=
r if the state government requests you to continue?=20
I haven't considered this issue at this point of time. Sharad Pawar did not=
 specifically name you in his statement. He actually blamed the entire comm=
ittee for having a negative approach. Do you think other conscientious memb=
ers of the Godbole committee will now follow your lead and put in their pap=
ers? That is a possibility. But, it's for the other members to decide.=20

What is your future plan of action?=20
Well, I will continue working on the report which involves the phase-II of =
the DPC project and the restructuring the  operations of the Maharashtra St=
ate Electricity Board. The report will be completed over the next 10 days.

Should India pull the plug on Enron?, Aditya Chatterjee & Pooja Kothari=20

THE Indian think-tank needs to quickly put their minds together in finding =
an amicable solution to the current Enron-Dabhol Power Company-Maharashtra =
government imbroglio and resolve the crisis which has risen over non-paymen=
t of electricity bills. If the two sides reach an understanding, it will be=
 the best   case scenario. If not, India has to think whether to continue w=
ith a cancerous limb, or to simply cut it off to prevent further damage.=20

The Maharashtra government has entrusted the Madhav Godbole panel with the =
responsibility of negotiating a new power purchase agreement with Enron. Th=
e panel would do well, if it takes into account the following. If Enron doe=
s pull the plugs on DPC, the central government will have to cough up a sum=
 of Rs 2,910 crore - which constitutes a penalty amount of Rs 1,500 crore f=
or one year of electricity bill, and $300 million as termination  fees (whi=
ch, at $1=3DRs 47, is equal to Rs 1,410 crore). This is a one-time payment,=
 and the final figure of Rs 2,910  crore is certified by Union power secret=
ary A K Basu.=20

Now, instead of terminating the DPC project, if India were to continue with=
 the present arrangement and keep paying Rs 1,500 crore per year for the ne=
xt ten years to DPC, the net present value of this investment works out to =
a whopping Rs 9,217 crore, which is nearly three times the price that India=
 pays - if DPC is terminated. The NPV was calculated on the basis of Rs 2,9=
10 crore  being put in a fixed deposit for 10 years, and the deposit earnin=
g an interest rate of 10 per cent every year. However, another issue that a=
lso needs to be taken into account is the exposure of the Indian financial =
institutions and banks. FIs, led by the Industrial Development Bank of Indi=
a, have, in two phases, provided loans of $ 95 million and $ 333 million, m=
aking their total exposure equal to $428 million (which, at $1=3DRs 47, is =
equal to Rs 2,012 crore). This apart, SBI also underwrote the maximum porti=
on of a $557 million cross-border loan, and have an exposure of about $175 =
million (or Rs 823 crore).=20

Thus, the cumulative exposure of the Indian banks and financial institution=
s in DPC works out to Rs 2,835 crore. However, since only 80 per cent of th=
is amount has been disbursed so far and FIs have tightened their purse stri=
ngs of late, the net exposure of Indian lenders in DPC works out to Rs 2,26=
8 crore. Since the Indian lenders are not covered by any counter-guarantee,=
 their bottomline would take a hit if Enron backed out of this project. The=
 government being a  majority stakeholder in most of these institutions, wo=
uld also take a hit on account of these losses. If all these loans are take=
n into account, and added to the one-time payment of Rs 2,910 crore, the to=
tal cost to government would be Rs 5,178 crore - which is still lower than =
Rs 9,217 crore (the price India will pay to DPC, if the nation is to contin=
ue with the present arrangement of paying Rs 1,500 crore per year over the =
next ten years). Thus, going by the current scenario where a compromise see=
ms like a very far-fetched option, the termination option will be a less co=
stly one for the nation.=20

However, the question which arises then is what happens to the assets and t=
he plant in case of a termination. Well,  the government can sell it to pri=
vate power players and  re-negotiate the cost factor with them - this time =
hopefully  after doing a cost-benefit analysis! A sale of assets would also=
 lessen the load on the government. Who knows - the government may actually=
 strike a deal with another private sector player to sell the ownership of =
DPC at a premium? Now, for our fears that cancelling the project might cost=
 us future foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in=
 India so far. Compare this - while Brazil raised $31 billion and China $49=
 billion last year alone in foreign direct investment, how  much FDI can In=
dia, with its annual inflow of about $4  billion, really lose? In short, it=
's a case of losing what you don't have in the first place. The Godbole pan=
el would also do well to note that many developing nations, who were pushed=
 into signing expensive power projects by power MNCs, have  successfully re=
-negotiated their contracts with no serious  financial consequences.=20

Many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the  inflated bills, =
some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards, whi=
le some others like Costa Rica declared that the 15 contracts signed with I=
ndependent Power Producers (like Enron) have no legal  status or are bad in=
 law. There are others too.=20

* In July 1999, the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with mu=
ltinational RWE was unconstitutional and void.=20

* In August 2000, the Croatian government insisted on  tearing up a PPA sig=
ned by Enron with a previous  government. The contract was considered to be=
 unaffordable, and was allegedly signed in politically  dubious circumstanc=
es. Enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement.=20

* In September 2000, the Philippines government took a decision of not rene=
wing contracts with IPPs. This was done to avert the excessive financial bu=
rden caused by these deals.=20

The Enron project was always mired in controversy. One has seen how the Shi=
v Sena-BJP combine had thundered during 1994 election campaigns that they w=
ould "throw the Enron project in the Arabian Sea". Now, of course, the same=
 BJP-led government at the Centre is bending backwards to prevent Enron fro=
m packing its bags. One can understand the predicament of the Indian politi=
cians. The MNC was the biggest contributor to the campaign fund of US presi=
dent George Bush and has the high profile former US ambassador to India, Fr=
ank Wisner among its  board of directors.=20

In a sense, the fondness of the government for Enron is not surprising at a=
ll since the Sena-BJP government of Maharashtra had taken pride for `succes=
sfully' negotiating with Enron to increase the total output of the project =
where an additional 1,444 mw was added to the 740 mw DPC project. It's a di=
fferent matter that as of date, neither Maharashtra can consume all of DPC'=
s 740 mw produce, nor it has the money to pay the bills. The crux of India'=
s problems with Enron lies on the issue of whether Enron is over-charging I=
ndia.=20

The Maharashtra government says that when the first power purchase agreemen=
t was signed in 1994, it was assumed that the Enron-sponsored DPC would pro=
vide  power at the rate of Rs 2.20 per unit, corresponding with  the rate o=
f dollar at Rs 30 and cost of LNG at Rs 4,300  prevailing at that time. But=
 that criteria, unfortunately, has not been considered, and now the state h=
as to pay Rs 8.54 for every unit of power. In fact, the state chief ministe=
r Vilasrao Deshmukh  has gone on record to say: ``Even if we buy the entire=
=20
power as per the agreement, the cost will be Rs 5.20 per  unit."=20

Enron, of course, claims that the higher power tariff was on account of the=
 depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and the increase in world fue=
l prices. Even during the first days of the Enron project, there were  enou=
gh warnings from sensible quarters. For instance, in  August 1994, the then=
 Union finance secretary had written  to the power secretary that that the =
size of "the potential liability for a 1,000 MW plant, was around Rs 3,000 =
crore per year". The department of economic affairs had also expressed a fe=
ar that the "...risk of the counter guarantees being invoked was not unreal=
, given that SEBs had been defaulting in payments...". Caution was thrown t=
o the winds then. The least India can do now is to ask for a re-negotiation=
. The question is does the Indian government have the guts to threaten a ca=
ncellation and force Enron to re-negotiate?

Enron renegotiation meet called off

US-based Enron Power said on Wednesday a meeting with the expert panel set =

 were told the meeting was called off. We were not assigned any reason for =

enegotiate the power purchaseagreement. The Enron-backed Dabhol Power Compa=
ny has almost finished building a $3-billion two-part power plant in the we=
stern state -- which is the single largest US investment  project in India.=
 Part one of the plant began generating power in May 1999, but the project =
has run into problems, with the Maharashtra government arguing it could not=
 afford the high electricity  bills. Dabhol Power last Saturday issued a wa=
rning notice threatening to terminate the electricity supply contract with =
Maharashtra, due to the payments dispute. The "preliminary termination noti=
ce" effectively gives six months to the state to sort out disputes over the=
 power purchase pact with Enron.  Payments for electricity have been guaran=
teed by the state and central governments.=20

Early in April, Dabhol Power served the state electricity board a notice of=
 political "force majeure," which is a legal manoeuvre that enables a party=
 to break a contract in the case of events beyond its control. The Dabhol p=
roject has had a turbulent ride since initial contracts were signed in 1992=
. Allegations of corruption and high costs led to the scrapping of the cont=
ract in 1995, but it was re-negotiated  the same year. In February a state =
government panel recommended fresh re-negotiations to bring down the tariff=
s and charged Enron with inflating costs. (Agencies)

DPC fracas: NPA problem stares at FIs, stocks fall, George Mathew

The Dabhol fracas has started reflecting on Indian financial institutions. =
Angry investors have been pressing sales in the counters of financial insti=
tutions which have a huge exposure in $2.775 billion Dabhol power project. =
Investors and fund managers are worried over the possibility of Dabhol loan=
sbecoming non-performing assets (NPAs) in the books of Indian FIs.IDBI stoc=
k has already fallen 8.47 per cent to Rs 24.85 and ICICI by 6.09 per cent t=
o Rs 83.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange in the last two days. "If the PPA i=
s terminated, supply of power will also stop. This means further payments w=
ill also stop. This can create problems for Indian institutions which are a=
lready saddled with huge NPAs," institutional sources said.

FIs and banks have already disbursed over Rs 1,700 crore out of its total c=
ommitments of around Rs 2,000 crore. What has accentuated the problems for =
Indian institutions is that they do not enjoy the comfort of their exposure=
 to Dabhol Power Company being covered under the counter-guarantee agreemen=
t. On the other hand, foreign lenders have nothing to worry as their loans =
are covered under the counter-guarantee agreement.Indian FIs have taken fur=
ther exposure by guaranteeing some of the foreign loans. Besides the rupee =
loans, IDBI has extended a guarantee for a $200-million credit extended to =
DPC by the US Exim Bank. "The two different sets of loans are likely to com=
plicate things for FIs. They should have taken counter-guarantee for their =
loans... Why shouldn't Indian FIs also get cover for the loans? It's to be =
seen whether it will help them if they run to the government now," sources =
said.Foreign lenders who have committed around $ 1.6 billion have disbursed=
 around level of provisioning in case of an eventual termination of the pro=
ject after DPC issued a preliminary termination notice under the power purc=
hase agreement. "There's no wonder Indian FIs have been trying to prevent t=
he pre-termination  notice at any cost," sources said.

Banking circles said the Finance Ministry has so far ignored the request of=
 domestic FIs to help protect their loan exposure. "Going by the turn of de=
velopments, DPC loans may become a problem for Indian FIs and eventually tu=
rn into NPAs. This may prove costly for lenders especially at a time when t=
hey are trying to clean up their balance sheets and recover existing NPAs,"=
 said a  banker, adding, "otherwise the government will have to come forwar=
d and bail them out. This seems to be a remote possibility."Another alterna=
tive for FIs would be to reschedule the loans on the lines of steel bailout=
s. While NPAs of commercial banks have crossed the Rs 60,000 crore, Fis in =
the country have not lagged behind. NPAs of ten leading institutions have r=
eported a rise of 11.89 per cent, or Rs 1,929 crore, to Rs 18,146 crore dur=
ing the year ended March 2000 from Rs 16,217 crore.=20

IDBI has topped the NPA list by notching up bad loans worth Rs 7675 crore b=
y March 2000. In fact, its NPAs have gone up by Rs 1,185 crore from Rs 6,49=
0 crore. IFCI followed with NPAs of Rs 4,103 crore, but it reported fall of=
 Rs 134 crore from the previous year's level of Rs 4,237 crore. ICICI's NPA=
s went up to Rs 3,959 crore from Rs 3,623 crore in the previous year, as pe=
r the RBI figures. FIs had resorted to large scale loan reschedulements, in=
terest waiver and bail-out packages in the last two years. "This is benefic=
ial to both the FIs and borrowers. While FIs can report a smaller amount as=
 NPAs, borrowers (mostly big corporate houses) can avoid their names in the=
 NPA list," said a former IDBI official, adding, "had FIs included bail-out=
s and reschedulements, the NPA figure would have gone up further."

Indian power firms not keen on buying DPC, Dev Chatterjee

Leading Indian power companies have ruled out buying Enron Corp's stake in =
Dabhol Power Company if the project comes up for sale. The reason, say powe=
r company officials, is the high power tariff. ''None of the state governme=
nt or consumer will buy power at the prevailing power tariff,'' say officia=
ls of leading power companies. ''If the project is up for sale, there is no=
 question of us buying Enron's stake in Dabhol Power Corporation. We think =
the power tariff of over Rs 7 is too high and it would be difficult for us =
to find any buyers,'' said a top Tata Power official. ''The PPA has to be r=
e-negotiated and tariff brought down,'' he added.

Tata Power had taken over the Mangalore power project after US energy giant=
, Cogentrix had withdrawn from the project. According to sources, the compa=
ny will now invest its time and funds into 1000 mw coal-based Mangalore pow=
er project instead of taking over new power projects like DPC. ''There are =
reports that Karnataka government wants to have re-look at the Mangalore po=
wer project PPA, we are busy with that,'' said Tata Power official. Tata Po=
wer is one of India's largest power generation and distribution companies a=
nd is considered a likely suitor for the DPC.

Reliance Industries, which was setting up a 450 mw power project in Patalga=
nga near Mumbai, has also expressed its reservations about taking over the =
project. In its post-annual results news conference, Anil Ambani managing d=
irector of RIL had said that the company is not keen on buying Enron's stak=
e in DPC. RIL also owns 29.68 per cent equity in BSES which has its own dis=
tribution and power  generation capacity for Mumbai suburbs.Power sector an=
alysts say only the cash-rich Union government utilities have the cash to t=
akeover Enron power project but it would be difficult for them to sell powe=
r to other States unless some solution is hammered out between Enron, and M=
aharashtra government over the tariff. Already Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh=
, though facing major power cuts, have ruled out buying power from MSEB at =
the stiff rate.

Similarly, Maharashtra is a power deficit project but it is unable to lift =
power from Enron project as the state electricity board is unable to pay En=
ron bills due to its bankrupt balance sheet.MSEB has said the power produce=
d by $ 2.7 billion Dabhol power project is expensive and has refused to buy=
 the output from the second phase. The contract between the two signed in t=
he mid-1990s had called for MSEB to buy the entire capacity of 2,184 MW. Th=
e first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999 but MSEB is unable to =
pay even the bills for first phase.

Scrips of DPC lenders dip after termination notice , Aarti Shetty

Mumbai, May 22: SCRIP prices of the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI and th=
e Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) have dipped after the Dabhol =
Power Corporation (DPC) gave its preliminary termination notice last Saturd=
ay. On Tuesday, SBI's share price on the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE) quote=
d at Rs 228.10, down from Friday's level of Rs 236.20. The scrips of ICICI =
and IDBI were seen at Rs 83.95 and Rs 24.80 down from Friday's quotes at Rs=
 89.40 and Rs 27.15 respectively. SBI and local financial institutions have=
 both fund-based and non-fund based exposures to DPC. This is in main to th=
e phase-2 of the project, which does not have a counter-guarantee from the =
Centre. In the project is scrapped, only a new buyer can salvage the situat=
ion on a reworked power purchase agreement (PPA). Domestic lenders have an =
exposure in excess of Rs 4,000 crore to DPC.
=20
The termination of the project is expected to reflect badly on loan-portfol=
ios. This in turn has made markets wary of the stocks of these financial in=
termediaries. It might be recalled that international lenders have already =
started a review on the impact of the termination of the DPC project on the=
ir loan-books, and the provisioning required. Local banksand financial inst=

extent to which they can limit their losses in the event of the project's t=
ermination. It is widely believed that both SBI and IDBI will also post low=

State advocate general dubs MSEBs claim justified, Sanjay Jog

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has received a major boost, =
as state advocate general Ghulam Vahanvati has remarked that the MSEB's cla=
im towards rebate of Rs 401 crore charged on the Dabhol Power Company (DPC)=
 for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on January 28 =
is justified.
"One would have to fall back on the basic principles of the law of contract=
s, under which, if the MSEB has a legitimate claim against DPC, it would be=
 entitled to withhold payments to DPC. It cannot be that the MSEB should be=
 required to continue to make payments to DPC, merely because the latter ch=
ooses to raise a dispute with regard to the rebate," Mr Vahanvati said in a=
 22-page communication to the MSEB.

Mr Vahanvati said that the DPC has solemnly undertaken to operate the Dabho=
l plant in accordance with the dynamic parameters and it was binding on the=
 company to specify a variation in the Availability Declaration in the prep=
aration time required to commence start-up procedure. "No such thing was do=
ne in the Availability Declaration," he added.On January 28, 2001, although=
 DPC had declared the baseload capacity of 657 mw, the actual generation of=
 mere 156 mw against the MSEB's instructed capacity of 657 mw during 6 pm t=
o 7 pm. During 7 pm to 8 pm, the actual generation was 325 mw, against the =
declared baseload capacity and instructed capacities of 657 mw, during 9 to=
 10 pm, the actual generation was 325 mw against the declared and instructe=
d capacities of 657 mw and during 11 pm to 12 am, the actual generation was=
 450 mw against the declared and instructed capacities of 657 mw."The momen=
t there was a shortfall, apart from anything else, Clasue 10.2 of the power=
 purchase agreement (PPA), which deals with availability, rebates and bonus=
es, came into operation," Mr Vahanvati opined.

According to him, DPC in its communication on February 1 to MSEB, has conce=
ded that it has breached its obligations, but "that it has not done so know=
ingly." "One wonders how such a statement could be made, having regard to t=
he confession that 180 minutes is insufficient to bring the plant to 657 mw=
. If this was an obligation and if DPC gave its Availability Declaration co=
ntrary to this, there could be no doubt that it did so knowingly," he added=
.Mr Vahanvati said that the DPC could have made changes to the Availability=
 Declaration under article 3.4, but it did not do so. Clauses 6.1 and 6.2 o=
f Schedule 6 also reiterate the importance of the dynamic parameters, since=
 they provide that the DPC could not be required to operate the plant other=
wise than within the Availability Declaration or the Dynamic parameters. Th=
e company in another letter on February 14, admitted that the actual perfor=
mance capability of the Dabhol plant is not in accordance with what is stat=
ed in the PPA.

Mr Vahanvati said that the rebate has to be adjusted and the contract provi=
des for billing in terms of payment in Clause 11. The billing statement has=
 to contain the computation of rebate in accordance with Clasue 10.2.

In a move which may be a prelude to Enron's complete exit from India, the c=

 valuation exercise of all its business in the country, including the contr=
oversial Dabhol Power Company. While Jones Lang La Salle will assess all th=

tacted, a company spokesperson declined to comment. "Nobody in Enron will t=
alk about it," he said. However, sour- ces said the appointment of consulta=
nts was in line with Enron's strategic decision of pulling out of the 2,144=
 mw power venture which has been mired in controversy from day one.=20

According to sources, Enron's real estate investments have taken a big hit.=
 "Enron invested in prime real estate during 1992-1995 when the prices were=
 at a peak. However, they have touched more realistic levels now," said a r=
eal estate consultant.Jones Lang La Salle is, however, tight-lipped about s=
uch a mandate from Enron. Meanwhile, sources said that Cushman & Wakefield =

lso in the race.=20

CB Richard Ellis has also proposed certain clients to Enron for buying/leas=

had in February said in an interview to Business Week that Enron "should no=
t be in there (India) building $2 billion power plants. Our cost of capital=
 is too high for that." DPC had disregarded the contents of the Godbole Com=

y 19. The PTN gives DPC, MSEB, the state government and the Centre six mont=
hs to resolve the issue amicably. If the talks fail, DPC would issue the fi=

DPC imbroglio: Rs 5,255 crore at stake for Indian lenders, Tamal Bandyopadh=
yay in Mumbai

The three Indian lenders to the Dabhol Power Company -Industrial Developmen=
t Bank of India, State Bank of India and ICICI-may take a hit of Rs 3,000 c=
rore on account of the deferred payment guarantee (DPG), given to foreign l=
enders in case they decide to trigger the accelerable guarantee clause in t=
he wake of the preliminary termination notice (PTN). Also at stake is the I=
ndian lenders' Rs 2,255 crore in term loans outstanding for both phases of =
the controversial $3 billion project.

Bankers are lobbying hard with the finance ministry to defuse the crisis. I=
f the ministry continues with its "indifference," banks may collectively st=
ay away from core sector lending in future. Indian banks have also decided =
not to attend the lenders' meet in Singapore, called in the first week of J=
une to take stock of the situation.In phase I of the project, the outstandi=
ng US Exim loan is $221 million, backed by the guarantees of IDBI, ICICI an=
d SBI. In rupee terms (exchange rate of Rs 47 per dollar), it works out to =
Rs 1,039 crore.=20

For phase II, IDBI, ICICI and SBI have given guarantees to OND's (a Belgian=
 bank) $64 million, Miti's $143 million and J-Exim's $210 million (Rs 1,960=
 crore).If the accelerable guarantee is invoked, Indian financial intermedi=
aries will face a massive cash flow problem. Their capital adequacy ratio (=
CAR) will go down as the risk weightage to loans is 100 per cent, against 5=
0 per cent risk weightage of guarantees. The outstanding rupee loans on Ind=
ian lenders' books for phase-I is around $53 million (Rs 249 crore) with ID=
BI taking the lead with $26 million, ICICI, SBI and Industrial Finance Corp=
oration of India $7 million each and Canara Bank $3 million.=20

BankAm's Indian office also has a $3 million exposure to phase I. SBI has d=
isbursed $141 million worth of foreign exchange loans for phase-II and Cana=
ra Bank $40 million. The rupee loan for this phase is pegged at $246 millio=
n (Rs 1,156 crore). Here, ICICI has the highest exposure ($93 million), fol=
lowed by IDBI ($83 million), SBI ($37 million), Canara Bank ($17 million) a=
nd IFCI ($16 million)."It is too early to speculate on the fate of our expo=
sure. This is backed by assets," said an institutional source. Bankers said=
 the company can pay the dues up to September but if DPC's activities come =

'An inexcusable failure of governance'

An extract from the first part of the Godbole Committee report on Dabhol Po=
wer Company suggests that the project was based on questionable assumptions=
The Dabhol project has generated a lot of controversy in the past and till =
the date of the constitution of the committee, there have been a number of =
public interest litigations filed against DPC [Dabhol Power Company] on var=
ious counts. Even during the tenure of the Committee, fresh petition have b=
een admitted and are under consideration of the Bombay High Court.=20

However, none of the earlier petitions have found favour with the courts. E=
ven the one case that is still pending before the Supreme Court, has been r=
etained because of the conduct of the GoM [Government of Maharashtra] in fi=
rst filing an affidavit and then disclaiming it. Whenever the history of pu=
blic interest litigation is written, this will be recognised as one of the =
failures of the process. One would presume that with such judicial scrutiny=
, all the issues in the project would have been examined thoroughly. Unfort=
unately,...this is far from true. The fault does not lie with the court but=
 with inexcusable failure of governance... The case against DPC was argued =
extensively at least in two major writ petitions before the Bombay High Cou=
rt. In these two critical cases, viz, the Ramdas Nayak case and the CITU ca=
se, various Government agencies argued forcefully...that DPC was in the pub=
lic interest; that the contract could not have been awarded through competi=
tive bidding but it was negotiated hard and long in order to obtain a benef=
icial outcome, that the design and size of the project was appropriate, and=
 that the tariff was competitive and below the norms set by the Government =
of India and that all these issues had been examined by the appropriate aut=
horities as required under law.=20

The various agencies submitting affidavits and arguments to this effect inc=
luded GoM, MSEB [Maharashtra State Electricity Board], Ministry of Power, G=
oI [Government of India] and the CEA [Central Electricity Authority]. In bo=
th these cases as also several other cases filed against DPC, the Court did=
 not consider it appropriate to intervene. In the Ramdas Nayak case, the co=
urt observed that, "It is well accepted legal position today that judicial =
review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which=
 a decision was made. ...The function of the Court is to see that lawful au=
thority is not abused; while doing so, it should arrogate itself the task e=
ntrusted to that authority...The Court should not enter into the merits of =
Government actions, more so in economic matters unless the same is unreason=
able and is not in public interest... But at the same time the Court can ce=
rtainly examine whether a decision making process was reasonable, rational,=
 not arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution."=20

The Committee believes that this report brings out these very concerns and =
shows in no uncertain terms that the decision-making process violated all t=
hese salutary principles, i.e, it was neither reasonable [nor] rational....=
 The Committee is surprised at the breadth of governance failure , which ha=
s occurred across time, across governments and across agencies, right from =
1992 till as late as 1999...This chapter will show that every one of the as=
sertions, relating to the benefits from the project, viz., the effectivenes=
s of negotiations, its design and size, the need for power and competitiven=
ess of tariff, for both Phase I and Phase II, have proven to be false and i=
ndeed, were based, at the time of the assertions on extremely questionable =
assumptions.=20

The Committee, in the short time allocated to it, is unable to determine re=
asons for this consistent lapse in governance but is extremely concerned at=
 it. Two members of the Committee, namely Dr Godbole and Dr Sarma, felt tha=
t, prima facie, the manner in which each and every opportunity was exploite=
d by those favouring the entry of DPC at different points of time, against =
the interests of MSEB, the interests of the Maharashtra consumer and the pe=
ople of Maharashtra raises doubts about a concerted effort to exercise undu=
e influence at every stage in this project. ... One of the persistent issue=
s has been the lack of competitive bidding. ... The GoM had chosen consciou=
sly to enter into negotiations, instead of going by the competitive bidding=
 route and it justified this course of action and insisted that it had cond=
ucted intense negotiations before signing the contract. Both the justificat=
ion and quality of these negotiations are suspect. ...[O]n the issue of com=
petitive bidding, it was affirmed (by GoM through MSEB) that this was not r=
elevant, counter-productive and inappropriate. Perhaps the only accurate st=
atement was it was not unlawful. For reasons detailed below, the Committee =
finds each of these reason to be deficient and suspect. "Not relevant": GoM=
 said that the "competitive bidding procedure [was] relevant when the Gover=
nment or public authority [was] either disposing of or purchasing property =
or services. It [had] no relevance to cases where a private party chooses t=
o set up a project on its own with its own resources" [affidavit by MSEB in=
 Ramdas Nayak dated 25 July 1994].=20

This depiction of DPC as an investment with no obligation on either the "Go=
vernment or public authority" to purchase services was patently in error. T=
he GoM resolution extending a guarantee to DPC dated 10th February 1994 cle=
arly mentions that "As MSEB will purchase power from DPC, it has to execute=
 an agreement, namely Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)". "Counterproductive":=
 This is a very interesting statement, which suggests that "major companies=
 should not be asked to compete for projects. The Committee believes that t=
he vacuity of such an argument is self-evident and does not merit further c=
onsideration. Inappropriate": This is a surprising statement, for it admits=
 that GoM's "expert knowledge and experience" for evaluating bids is "not s=
ufficiently up to the mark" and that its "knowledge of risk identification =
and allocation...is also not sufficiently developed." At the same time, how=
ever, GoM argues that it has the expertise, experience and knowledge to neg=
otiate a contract.=20

It is apparent to the Committee that if a body is not qualified to evaluate=
 bids, which are submitted on standard terms, it is evidently less qualifie=
d to negotiate minute details of a similar project. This dissonance between=
 the two bodies of knowledge as perceived by GoM is inexplicable. If the ar=
gument is that the MSEB had engaged international financial and legal advis=
er to assist it in its negotiation with DPC, the same could have been done =
with respect to preparation and evaluation of bid documents.=20

'Enron revisited, Enron saw and Enron conquered'=20

The Bombay High Court, in writ petition No 2416 of 1996 in CITU and Abhay M=
ehta vs DPC and others, observes the following regarding the renegotiations=
 of the project in 1995: " But once it [GOM] decided to revive the project,=
 it acted in the very same manner in which its predecessor in office had do=

sparency it claims is the constitution of the negotiating group. The speed =
with which the negotiating group studied the project, made a proposals for =
renegotiations which was accepted by Dabhol, and submitted its reports is u=
nprecedented.The negotiating group was constituted by the Government of Mah=
arashtra on 8th November 1995. It was asked to submit its report to the sta=
te governmentby 7th December 1995. The committee, we are told, examined the=
 project, collected data on various similar other projects as well as inter=
nal bids including data on a similar project executed by Enron in the UK, h=
eld considerable negotiations, settled the terms of revival of the project,=
 got the consent of Enron and Dabhol to the same on 15th November 1995, jus=
t within a week of its constitution and submitted its exhaustive report ...=
 on 19th November, 1995, just 11days after its formation, much before the 7=

DPC tangle: Centre adopts wait & watch policy, Subhomoy Bhattacharjee & San=
tosh Tiwary in New Delhi

The Centre will await the outcome of the conciliation proceedings before de=
ciding on its next step about the Dabhol Power Company. Talking to Business=
 Standard senior finance ministry officials said the central government rep=
resentative AV Gokak has already been suitably briefed about the affair, an=
d the centre is looking forward to the outcome of the proceedings. The sour=
ces said since the preliminary termination notice (PTN) has been sent by DP=
C to the Maharashtra government the Centre cannot take a stand on the issue=
 without the state asking it to intervene.=20

They also said since there is a mandatory time period of six months between=
 the serving of a PTN and the implementation of the same, the conciliation =
can proceed. Officials of the finance and power ministries have meetings wi=
th Gokak last week to sieve through the entire legal position between the c=
ompany, the state and the central governments. However, they agreed that th=
e conciliation proceedings cover a very small portion of the dispute involv=
ing only the pending bills of DPC for December amounting to Rs 103 crore an=
d will not solve the entire issue of electricity purchase between the compa=
ny and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.

Since the bills for the successive months have also run into problems it ha=
s created the possibility that the project may be terminated. Though the so=
urces said that since the company has already invested a substantial sum fo=
r the second phase, it will not be very keen to withdraw from India abruptl=
y.Incidentally the Godbole committee for renegotiating the power purchase a=
greement with DPC is slated to meet tomorrow in Mumbai.The officials also s=
aid that though the lenders to the project, which includes IDBI have approa=
ched the finance ministry to enquire about the stand of the centre, they ha=
ve been told that the Centre can do very little about it.This is because th=
e contract as drawn up is between the Maharashtra government and the DPC wi=
th the Centre only standing as a counter guarantor.

The wait and watch policy of the Centre is also dictated by the political c=
ompulsions, with the centre deciding to let the state government do all the=
 talking. The total amount of guarantee that will come into play if the pro=
ject is terminated is about $300 million. Since the second phase of the pro=
ject does not involve any further counter guarantee the liability for the g=
overnment will not rise. The sources also said no letter has been sent to e=
ither Enron or DPC till now.=20

IN AN unexpected move, US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company =

Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's  waters

EXECUTIVES of Enron say they are withdrawing from a large natural gas proje=
ct off Qatar, partly because the venture doesn't fit with the energy compan=
y's focus. Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to =
work with Elf, a subsidiary of France's Total Fina, and the United Arab Emi=
rates Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qat=
ar North Field.=20

But the company pulled out, believing there are better places to invest its=
 money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London. He said the proje=
ct doesn't fit with Enron's current focus of emphasizing businesses such as=
 marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those for natural gas a=
nd electricity and broadband. Those involved with the project said last yea=
r it could end  up requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or s=
even years.=20

Enron said on Monday it was transferring its 24.5 per cent stake in the pro=
ject to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news releas=
e it had started negotiating with other international players to become sta=
keholders. With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will   own=
 75.5 per cent of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. Enron said i=
t would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates Offsets Grou=
p that were "in line with our core business activities." M Carol Coale, an =
energy analyst with Prudential  Securities in Houston, said Enron's move is=
 consistent  with its exit strategy from international assets that generate=
 low returns. (AP)
