Someone was asking me the other day if I had
any friends at Enron....you came to mind!

Are you weathering the storm? Unbelievable
is the word that comes to my mind.

We use Andersen also and I know they are
quite "tight lipped" about the situation!

I sincerely hope everything works out for you
and the other Enron employees that have done
nothing more than "bust your rears" for the good
of the "Big E".

Stay in touch,

Alton D. Heckaman, Jr.
Swift Energy Company
Senior Vice President
Chief Financial Officer
