Victor,

This issue came up back in October of last year, when we recommended the following scope:

Evaluate Diesel Export Capability to Peerless.  
Prepare P&ID Markups showing modifications to existing EcoElectrica facilities, required for diesel export to Peerless.  
Prepare budgetary estimate(+/- 30 %) for implementing modifications.  
A field trip to Puerto Rico is required to determine tie-in points to Peerless loading lines.

The cost for this scope is $9500.

Bob Iversen or Gene O'Gorman, EEOS Specialist Engineers, were orginally nominated to perform the work.  Unfortunately, neither of them are not available till mid June.  Is this time frame acceptable?

Regards
James

Victor,

As discussed, we need to engineer a tie-in to Peerless so that we have a way to periodically turnover (by selling) our fuel oil inventory to before it goes bad.

James McMillan will forward to you a scope of work and cost for an engineer to go to site to develop the tie-in design.  This cost should be between $5 and 10K.

Once finalized, please issue an Eco PO to perform this work.

Rick
