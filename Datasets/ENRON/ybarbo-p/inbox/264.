Meeting with DPC was good, says Godbole, Priya Ganapati in Bombay=20

Officials of US energy giant Enron Corp-promoted Dabhol Power Company who m=
et with the Godbole committee on Tuesday to discuss the fate of the controv=
ersial $2.9-billion power project were non-committal on the outcome of the =
talks, but said that the "meeting was good". Both the sides, however, were =
unanimous that it would take more discussions to arrive at a peaceful solut=
ion to the vexed issue. Tuesday's meeting was cordial and broke fresh groun=
d, said sources, indicating that the problem may yet be resolved. Both the =
parties have decided to meet again and take the discussions forward. Energy=
 secretary V M Lal, speaking to the reporters, informed that both the parti=
es have decided to meet again and continue the deliberations, but fresh dat=
e for the meeting has not been fixed yet. The meeting concluded with both t=
he sides agreeing to extend the tenure of the Godbole committee which was s=
lated to expire on Wednesday. The period for which the panel's tenure has b=
een extended has not yet been decided.=20

Speaking after the meeting Madhav Godbole, chairman of the committee set up=
 to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with DPC, said: "The meeting w=
as quite productive. Basically, we discussed each other's position in the i=
ssue. The Government of India has put forth a set of proposals before the D=
PC and we shall see how things proceed from here." He, however, declined to=
 spell out what the 'new set of proposals' comprised. When asked what did t=
he committee think of DPC's proposal to cut power tariff by 10 per cent, Go=
dbole said: "It is too early to talk about specifics at this point. We disc=
ussed generalities and it was a satisfactory meeting." Central government n=
ominee A V Gokak, who attended the meeting for the first time, said: "The g=
overnment is keen to resolve the vexed issue and will actively participate =
in the process and talks."=20

"The negotiations would take into account the interests of all the sides," =
Gokak said. "Nobody's intentions can be doubted as the deliberations are on=
 to come to an amicable solution which is agreeable to all," he said when a=
sked to comment on DPC's earlier posture of taking the meeting only as a co=
urtesy call. DPC chief K Wade Kline said that only general issues were disc=
ussed at the meeting and that the deliberations were "good". The renegotiat=
ion committee meeting was headed by Madhav Godbole, energy secretary V M La=
l, MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, finance secretary S K Srivastav and central =
nominee A V Gokak, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh. The Dabhol Power Company te=
am was represented by DPC chief K Wade Cline, president Neil McGregor, Bech=
tel representative Phiroz J Nagarwala, DPC chief financial officer S Mohan =
Gurunath, DPC vice-president Sanjeev Khandkar and IDBI official Mukesh Tyag=
i, Rajesh Sivaraman, and Paul Kraft, general counsel.=20

Earlier analysts had said the meeting is unlikely to yield any result as Da=
bhol Power Company had announced that the meeting would only be a courtesy =
call. The panel was formed last month by the Maharashtra state government t=
o renegotiate the tariffs charged by the 2,184 MW power project. Maharashtr=
a State Electricity Board, which agreed in 1995 to buy the plant's entire o=
utput, says the power is too costly and has defaulted on $48 million of pow=
er payments. Dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase=
 deal. The Maharashtra government has asked the panel to renegotiate the pr=
oject with Dabhol and bring down the tariff. The first meeting scheduled fo=
r May 5, was cancelled as Enron sought more time to attend the meeting, whi=
le the second meeting which was held on May 11 concluded without any transa=
ction in which, of the nine members, five including central nominee A V Gok=
ak were absent. Later, it was fixed for May 23, which also had to be cancel=
led in wake of the resignation by the committee chairman Madhav Godbole fol=
lowing remarks by NCP chief Sharad Pawar about the negative attitude of the=
 renegotiation committee.=20

However, the Maharashtra Cabinet unanimously decided not to accept his resi=
gnation. Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh wrote a letter to him=
 after the Cabinet meeting stating that "the state government has full fait=
h and confidence in his working, and urge you to withdraw your resignation =
as the chairman of the committee." An MSEB official had on Monday said that=
 the success of the re-negotiations would largely depend on the co-operatio=
n of DPC officials as well as the Union government, particularly over the i=
ssue of the second phase's 1444 mw power offtake. The second phase would be=
 commissioned from October this year. After the commencement of second phas=
e, the MSEB will have to pay Rs 5 billion per month from the beginning of n=
ext year, which is unaffordable for the MSEB. Phase-I, comprising 740-mw po=
wer, was commissioned three years ago, but the cost of the power from the p=
lant based on imported naphtha has made a dent in the profitability and mar=
gin of the state-owned electricity board.=20

Centre offers set of proposals to end Enron crisis=20

The Godbole Committee today held a meeting to discuss the Enron imbroglio. =
The Committee was set up by the Maharashtra government to renegotiate the p=
ower contract between Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and Enron =
promoted Dabhol Power Company.After the meeting the Chairman of the renegot=
iation committee, Dr Madhav Godbole said, "We discussed each others positio=
n. We have listed out a few issues which are going to be discussed and then=
 we will meet again after some time. If there is anything concrete we will =
definitely proceed further. We are prepared to play an active role but what=
ever solution emerges has to take care of the interests of all sides."The r=
epresentative from the Centre, A V Gokak said they have given a set of prop=
osals to the Committee. Controversy has surrounded the Committee specially =
since Enron has made it clear that it will not accept the recommendations o=
f the Committee as the basis for renegotiations.

However, even as the central representative reiterated the Centre's willing=
ness to play an active role in solving the Enron controversy, Power Ministe=
r Suresh Prabhu has ruled out that the Centre will bail Maharashtra out by =
buying expensive power produced by the Dabhol project. "How can the central=
 utilities buy power from Dabhol and sell it elsewhere when it is not possi=
ble for Maharashtra government to buy it," informed Mr Prabhu.

In another crucial meeting scheduled to be held later today, the Maharashtr=
a Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) will hear MSEB's petition about =
the validity of the power contract or the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).

PTI adds:

The Union government today offered a set of proposals for solving the ongoi=
ng dispute between Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board (MSEB).The offer was made at the second meeting of the r=
enegotiating Committee, headed by Madhav Godbole, held in Mumbai today to r=
esolve the crisis over the DPC-MSEB dispute.Godbole later told reporters th=
at the meeting was "positive" and the committee discussed and tried to know=
 the position of the two sides. However, he declined to reveal the set of p=
roposals put forth by the Centre for resolving the issue. "Centre's represe=
ntative A V Gokak told Enron India managing director K Wade Cline that Nati=
onal Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will not be able to buy power from DP=
C", an official who attended the meeting told PTI.Asked whether DPC had mad=
e any reference to a 10 per cent cut in its tariff, Godbole said "it was to=
o early for any comment on specifics of the discussions".

Gokak, Former telecom secretary, said the Union Government was quite keen o=
n resolving the matter and "will definitely play an active role" in the ent=
ire process.
"In the second round of our meeting, our discussions were good and the dial=
ogue will continue. However, the next date of the meeting will be fixed lat=
er", state energy secretary V M Lal said. Wade Cline too echoed the sentime=
nt and said "we discussed a variety of issues".Asked if DPC had agreed for =
a possible 10 per cent tariff cut, Cline said "no proposal has been submitt=
ed before the committee and discussions were on".Lal said the committee dis=
cussed all issues which "were hindering the progress of the project".Howeve=
r, he refused to divulge further details of the discussions, saying "it has=
 been made clear time and again that renegotiations cannot be done through =
the media".The DPC delegation included president Neil McGregor, vice presid=
ents Sanjeev Khandekar and Mukesh Tyagi and chief financial officer Mohan G=

Enron, India panel make no progress on power row , By Sriram Ramakrishnan

 Talks between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's Indian unit and a government =
panel ended on Tuesday without resolving a contentious dispute over a giant=
 $2.9 billion power project, officials said.But they said the talks will co=
ntinue.Participants at the meeting, which lasted an hour, discussed the iss=
ue of a reduction in tariff rates charged by Enron's unit for the power it =
sells to Indian state utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB=
), government and company officials said.

Also discussed was the option of a third entity, apart from the sole buyer =
MSEB, purchasing the power from the second phase of the project. "We had a =
good meeting. We discussed a lot of issues. But no proposals were submitted=
," K. Wade Kline, chief operating officer, Enron India Pvt Ltd, told report=
ers.V.M. Lal, principal secretary to the Maharashtra government, said the d=
iscussions will continue with Dabhol Power Company, which is 65 percent own=
ed by Houston-based Enron <ENE.N>."We are negotiating on the various issues=
 that are coming in the way of the project," he told reporters, adding that=
 no date has been fixed for the next meeting.Enron and MSEB have been sparr=
ing for over six months on the 2,184 MW project, which was originally slate=
d to sell its entire output to MSEB at a fixed price.The row is seen as a t=
est case of India's ability to attract foreign investment in the power sect=
or, which needs 100,000 MW over the next 10 years to meet growing demand.MS=
EB began buying the 740 MW of power produced by the the project's first pha=

Lenders' meet=20

Meanwhile, Indian lenders to Dabhol are scheduled meet in Bombay on Wednesd=

r said on Monday. The meeting's top priority will be the adoption of a comm=
on strategy to convince foreign lenders not to invoke guarantees issued by =
local financial institutions and banks. The project is being built at a tot=
al cost of $2.9 billion, of which $2 billion has been funded through loans.=
 Of this amount, the local lenders have contributed $1.4 billion and foreig=
n lenders have provided the rest. Foreign lenders are protected by guarante=
es issued by domestic banks and financial institutions. They have called a =
meeting on June 5 and 6 in Singapore to discuss invoking guarantees on thei=
r loans in the project. At stake is not just the investment in the project,=
 but also India's efforts to reform the power sector. Indian lenders would =
also take a hit on their books if their foreign counterparts insist on paym=
ents.=20

THE ECONOMIC TIMES,Tuesday, May 29, 2001
DPC willing to further cut tariff by 10%

 DABHOL Power Company has informed lenders that it is willing to bring down=
 its tariff by 10 per cent. This decrease will be over and above the fall i=
n tariff due to the shift from naphtha to LNG. This has been indicated by E=
nron to the lead financial institution, IDBI, recently. Once DPC switches o=
ver fuel  from naphtha to LNG by the end of this calendar year, the  tariff=
 will automatically be reduced by 10 per cent. Apart from this, it is learn=
t that Dabhol has agreed to reduce the tariff by a further 10 per cent. Whi=
le this alone may not be adequate to resolve the on-going differences, the =
proposal has reportedly been well received by domestic lenders. At the same=
 time, to protect their interest, domestic lenders have formed a committee =
to look into the problems relating the DPC. The total debt to DPC amounts t=
o Rs 6,600 crore of which 90 per cent has already been disbursed.=20

The committee is slated to meet on May 30 here, while all lenders will be m=
eeting on June 5 and June 6 in Singapore to discuss various issues relating=
 to DPC. IDBI has total exposure of Rs 2,158 crore in phase I and phase II.=
 Of this, Rs 1528 crore constitute guarantees and Rs 630 crore is loan. IDB=
I officials indicated that the domestic lenders will make an effort to pers=
uade foreign lenders against invoking the counter guarantee or precipitate =
matters any further. Officials from the term lending institution also maint=
ained that finding a purchaser for the power generated is a bigger problem =
than tariff reduction. "The tariff can be re-negotiated and reduced, but th=
e larger issue is finding a buyer for the power," said IDBI officials.=20

Meanwhile , Union energy minister Suresh Prabhu today again turned down the=
 state's request to buy power generated by the Dabhol Power while CM Vilasr=
ao Deshmukh accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of "not being =
very keen to resolve the ongoing imbroglio" between MSEB and DPC. Prabhu ex=
pressed the Centre's `helplessness' saying that his government has hardly a=
ny role to play as far as buying DPC power is concerned. He was speaking to=
 media persons after attending a symposium over power reforms. Tomorrow, th=
e controversy is likely to take a new turn with MERC all set to hear the ca=
ses of both the parties. DPC, after rejecting MSEB legal notice for "rescin=
ding" the PPA, will be pleading its case before the MERC on Tuesday. In a t=
hree-page response to MSEB's notice, Enron India MD K Wade Cline has said "=
the legal notice is not acceptable to us, as according to the PPA, MSEB doe=
s not have the right to rescind the agreement".

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Tuesday, May 29, 2001
DPC rejects MSEB's legal notice
=20
ENRON'S Dabhol Power Company has rejected the Maharashtra State Electricity=
 Board's legal notice for"rescinding" the power, saying: "It (MSEB) did not=
 have the right to do so." The two partners are getting ready to plead thei=
r case before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission on Wednesda=
y. In a three-page response to MSEB's May 24 legal notice, Enron India mana=
ging director K Wade Cline has said: "The legal notice is not acceptable to=
 us, as according to the PPA, MSEB does not have the right to rescind the a=
greement." The letter, dated May 26, also asks MSEB to comply with the "san=
ctity" of the PPA: "Please confirm that the board would also pay all DPC du=
es, including the disputed Rs 213-crore for December and January bills plus=
 the interest."=20

In its notice, MSEB has questioned the legal validity of the entire PPA as =
per the Indian Contracts' Act 1872 and later also went a step further by fi=
ling a petition with the MERC.  "Other than non-acceptance of our legal not=
ice, DPC has continued its demand for an escrow account, knowing fully well=
 that MSEB has filed a caveat in the Mumbai High Court for not activating t=
he same," sources said. DPC has also demanded an increase in LC (letter of =
credit) amount in line with the PPA, as MSEB was supposed to do 21 days bef=
ore the firing of its second phase on June 6, they said.  "We are tired now=
 with the same explanation that unless the political force majeure stands a=
ctivated, we will not be in a position to increase the limit, but are yet t=
o hear something positive from their side," state government sources said.=
=20

Interestingly, the sources said, there was no mention of DPC paying Rs 401 =
crore penalty and a subsequent rebate for December and January bills. DPC a=
lso reiterated that the 2,194-mw power station was a  "base" load one and c=
ould not be treated as "peak" load, and hence, it took a minimum six hours =
to ramp up to full capacity. The multinational has also expressed disappoin=
tment at the loss-making board's "repeated attempts to create a situation a=
llowing it to claim rebates for alleged misdeclarations" about the capacity=
 of the $3-billion power station. (PTI)

Dabhol Indian lenders to meet on May 30

INDIAN lenders of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company led by Industrial Dev=

surising their foreign counterparts not to escalate the crisis by withdrawi=

se of action to convince the latter not to precipitate the crisis any furth=
er in the June 4-6 Singapore meet," IDBI acting chairman and managing direc=

 project is to the tune of Rs 2,158 crore including guarantees worth Rs 1,5=
28 crore and rupee loans of Rs 630 crore," the CMD said. For the first time=
 the Indian lenders on Monday disclosed their exact exposure to DPC, which =
stood at Rs 6,600 crore, Chakrabarti said. Other than IDBI, the domestic le=

MERC clubs Prayas, Hogade suits , Renni Abraham=20

The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has clubbed togeth=
er the  petitions filed by Prayas (an NGO) and senior Janta Dal leader Prat=
ap Hogade, which sought   the copies of the power purchase agreements and o=
ther associated documents of the Dabhol Power Co, Patalganga and Bhadrawati=
 power  projects. The two petitions have additionally provided the opportun=
ity to test the effectiveness or otherwise  of the Maharashtra Right to Inf=
ormation Act, 2000. The MERC members on their part are keen to  ensure that=
 the much sought after transparency, since the act was passed by the state =
legislature,actually translates into a reality.=20

Chairman of MERC P Subramaniam, during the last hearing on the issue of DPC=
 documents being made available to Prayas berated MSEB (Maharashtra State E=
lectricity Board) for issuing  conflicting statements in connection with th=
e financing agreement for phase II of the project as also being unable to b=
ackup with legal reasoning how it could withhold the documents sought by Pr=
ayas.He subsequently directed MSEB to issue all the documents related to DP=
C to the commission  within a month, and granted two weeks time for the rel=
ease of documents sought by Prayas.  A senior MERC official told Business S=
tandard, "While initially MSEB said that it was   not in possession of the =
documents, it later told  the commission that the documents were in fact av=
ailable with it but not the detailed document."=20

The commission also found it peculiar that MSEB had chosen to merely reiter=
ate the legal  submission made by DPC with regards to the confidentiality a=
ttached to certain key documents  instead of employing the services of the =
large  in-house legal department.  According to a senior government officia=
l, while the Reliance-promoted Patalganga project and  Ispat-promoted Bhadr=
awati projects are yet to achieve financial closure, the petitions before M=
ERC would serve as the touchstone ruling for deciding upon the issue of pub=
lic access to  information.=20

Both MSEB and DPC as well as the Reliance and Ispat groups would have to ex=
plain how they could withhold the documents sought by the common public und=
er the provisions of the act. The Maharashtra Right to Information Act, 200=
0, clearly stipulates, "Every bonafide person requiring information may hav=
e access to such information in accordance with the procedure specified und=
er this act." The criteria for denying information is also specified under =
the act where it would prejudice the security, integrity or sovereignity of=
 the nation or the state, information relating to defence matters.However, =
according to well placed sources in the MSEB, its legal department has take=
n the provisions of the act through a fine comb to find  grounds for justif=
ying the withholding of the   documents sought by Prayas.=20

A senior MSEB official said, "For instance, one of the criterion for denyin=
g information as stated   in the act says that it is permitted if the discl=
osure would prejudice negotiations or the effective  conduct of personnel m=
anagement or commercial or contractual activities. It also notes if the inf=
ormation disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party or=
 if the  information has been supplied in confidence under a statutory guar=
antee that its confidentiality  would be protected, the act would not apply=

Govt shoots down plan to sell DPC power to central utilities , Anupama Airy

THE Centre has turned down the Maharashtra government's proposal that Natio=
nal Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Power Trading Corporatiopn (PTC=
) be asked to buy and distribute Dabhol power.   Top government officials t=
old The Financial Express that the consequences of commercial   decisions t=
aken by the state government or the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (M=
SEB) will   not be passed on to the consumers across the  country. Besides,=
 NTPC is a central power sector organisation whose main task is generation =
and it has no expertise in power trading, the  sources said.

 Moreover, as per officials, any attempt to force NTPC to buy high-cost pow=
er will adversely affect the corporation's financial health, as it is alrea=
dy struggling to recover huge dues from the state electricity boards (SEBs)=
.  "The basic objective of reforms in India's power sector is to provide po=
wer at reasonable cost. The Maharashtra government's proposals to distribut=
e high-cost Dabhol power through NTPC or  through PTC will be clearly again=
st the objective of reforms and consumer interests," said a senior  governm=
ent official.Sources said even PTC cannot be asked to buy and distribute po=
wer of the Dabhol plant. This is because the Centre has already refused to =
declare Dabhol project as a mega power project while PTC only deals with th=
e power from mega projects, which are inter-state projects. Officials said =
the Centre is of the view that if any decision is taken to impose high cost=
 power from Dabhol on other states, it will be an open invitation to other =
states to pass on their existing liabilities vis-a-vis private producers to=
 the central government. "This will not be acceptable to the government of =
India," the sources said.

Coming down heavily on the Maharashtra government, the officials said the s=
tate government's   unwillingness to rationalise tariffs has crippled MSEB'=
s ability to make available reasonably priced power in the state. "The Maha=
rashtra government has been directly interfering in MSEB's efforts to colle=
ct arrears which have mounted to a whopping Rs 5,000 crores," the officials=
 said. On the condition of anonymity, a highly placed central government of=
ficial said, "Although the Centre is committed to support any worthwhile id=
ea acceptable to both MSEB and DPC for settling the problem, it would be mo=
re advisable for the state government to rise above politics and carry out =
re-negotiations in a constructive manner so that sustainable solution is fo=
und."

Officials disclosed that between April 1997 and March 2000, MSEB doled out =
Rs 2,800 crore of   subsidies and, in the year 2000, MSEB was incurring cas=
h loss of about Rs 5 crore per day, which  is 40 per cent of the cost of ge=
neration.  "There has been no increase in tariff since September 1998 and, =
the total receivables of MSEB are in the range of Rs 5,000 crore," the offi=
cials said. Central government sources informed that the Maharashtra govern=
ment has been announcing subsidies to specified categories of consumers suc=
h as powerlooms and agriculturists without ensuring that subsidies are paid=
 to MSEB. The financial condition of MSEB, therefore, has deteriorated to s=
uch an extent that it cannot pay for   the power being purchased from Dabho=

MSEB refuses to issue cheque towards April bill to DPC ,   Sanjay Jog

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) on Monday refused to issue a=
 cheque of Rs 136 crore towards the April bill to the Dabhol Power Company =
(DPC). MSEB sources told The Financial Express that the decision was taken =
after the DPC's bank, Bank of America, returned the MSEB's cheque, deposite=
d within two hours on May 23. Sources said that MSEB, which has decided to =
pay the monthly bills "under protest," until the issue of non-payment of re=
bate of Rs 401 crore by DPC for the misdeclaration and default on the avail=
ability of power is resolved, would not accept any other conditions from DP=
C on payment of bills.

Sources said that Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC chief =
financial officer Mohan Gurunath, in separate letters had asked the MSEB no=
t to pay the April cheque. They said that MSEB should make the payment with=
out any 'ifs and buts' as there is no provision of payment under protest in=
corporated in the power purchase agreement (PPA). MSEB was highly disappoin=
ted over the return of its cheque by the Bank of America on grounds that it=
 cannot accept the cheque, following clear cut directives from the DPC.=20

  "Suddenly, Mr Gurunath calls up this morning and tells that a company off=
icial will come to collect the cheque, even if it is to be issued under pro=
test. This is not acceptable to us and thus we refused to hand over the che=
que today to DPC officials," sources said. According to MSEB sources, had i=
t paid the April cheque without any protest, the DPC's stand on non-payment=
 of rebate would have been confirmed. Meanwhile, Mr Wade Cline, whose lette=
r, written on May 23 to the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, was received by the=
 latter on Monday.

DPC signals climb down, sees scope to cut power tariffs , Pradipta Bagchi

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has told its major lenders that there is roo=
m for a downward  revision in tariffs. According to S.K. Chakrabarti, actin=
g chairman and managing director of the Industrial Development Bank of Indi=
a (IDBI), DPC has informed lenders in writing that there may be scope to re=
duce the power tariffs by ten per cent from the existing levels.This is the=
 first time since the Dabhol controversy exploded that Enron, the main prom=
oter of DPC, has shown any sign of wanting to renegotiate tariffs. Accordin=
g to bankers, DPC will charge a tariff of Rs  3.50 per unit after Phase II =
of the project is commissioned as per the power purchase agreement. However=
, in its latest communication to lenders through its lawyers, White and Cas=
e, DPC has told lenders that there is room for the tariffs to be renegotiat=
ed downwards by ten per cent to Rs 3.15 per unit from the existing rate of =
Rs 3.50 per unit.

Speaking to the press, Chakrabarti said that he was hopeful of an amicable =
resolution of all outstanding issues between DPC and MSEB. ``We have also i=
mpressed upon DPC that there is scope to reduce the tariffs further,'' he a=
dded.According to the lending banks, DPC has said that tariffs can be revis=
ed downwards if contracts for buying   liquefied natural gas (LNG) are rene=
gotiated with the sellers. This is because LNG prices have come down signif=
icantly since the contracts were signed a couple of years ago.DPC has also =
indicated that LNG shipping and carriage rates can also be renegotiated to =
help reduce tariffs. These rates have also fallen since the contracts were =
signed in the nineties. The major lenders are supposed to meet in Singapore=
 on June 5 and 6 to discuss matters further. Moreover, IDBI has set up a co=
mmittee for the domestic lenders to help  them take a united stand in the m=
atter.  ``We will try and convince the foreign lenders that they should not=
 take any action to precipitate matters further,'' Chakrabarti said. The In=
dian banks and financial institutions together have  an exposure in excess =
of Rs 6,000 crore in the project.

DPC rejects MSEB's legal notice=20

Enron's Dabhol Power Company has rejected MSEB's legal notice for "rescindi=
ng" the PPA, saying "it did not have the right to do so", as the two  partn=
ers get ready to plead their case before the state  electricity regulatory =
commission (MERC) on Tuesday. In a three-page response to MSEB's May 24 leg=
al notice, MD of Enron India K Wade Cline has said, "The legal notice is no=
t acceptable to us, as according to the PPA, MSEB does not have the right t=
o rescind the agreement," state government sources said here on Monday. The=
 letter, dated May 26, also asks MSEB to comply with the "sanctity" of the =
PPA: "Please confirm that the board would also pay all DPC dues, including =
the disputed Rs 213 crore for December and January bills  plus the interest=
." In its notice, MSEB has questioned the legal validity of the entire PPA =
as per the Indian Contracts' Act (ICA) 1872, and later also went a step fur=
ther by filing a petition in MERC.=20

"Other than non-acceptance of our legal notice, DPC has continued its deman=
d for an escrow account, knowing fully well that MSEB has filed a caveat in=
 the Mumbai High Court for not activating the same," sources said. DPC has =
also demanded an increase in LC (letter of credit) amount in line with the =
PPA, as MSEB was supposed to do 21 days before the firing of its second pha=
se on June 6, they said."We are tired now with the same explanation that un=
less the political force majeure stands activated, we will not be in a posi=
tion to increase the LC limit, but are yet to hear something positive from =
their side," state government sources said. Interestingly, they added that =
there is no mention of DPC paying Rs 401 crore penalty and a subsequent reb=
ate for December and January bills. DPC also reiterated that the 2,194-MW p=
ower station  was a "base" load one and could not be treated as "peak"  loa=
d, hence it takes a minimum six hours to ramp up to  full capacity.=20

In its notice, MSEB has alleged that DPC has not been able to conform to ce=
rtain dynamic characteristics and operations of the PPA and time and again =
had failed to comply with the same, they added.   "As per ICA, such a confe=
ssion amounts to material misrepresentation of facts, which, in this case, =
has been knowingly committed by DPC," the sources informed. DPC has denied =
this very charge and said, "There has been no material misrepresentation of=
 facts as alleged by MSEB in the avoidance notice." The MNC has also expres=
sed disappointment at the loss-making MSEB's "repeated attempts to create a=
  situation allowing it to claim rebates for alleged  misdeclarations" abou=

Enron rocks India's flagship investors: Fears are growing over rift between=
 domestic and foreign lenders to power project, Khozem Merchant and David G=
ardner:=20

A"basic rift" has emerged between domestic and foreign lenders to the Enron=
 power project near Bombay, which threatens to undermine attempts to rescue=
 India's flagship foreign direct investment.Indian banks account for about =
70 per cent of the Dollars 2bn in debt raised to finance the Dollars 2.9bn =
Dabhol project. Foreign banks provide the balance of the loans but some of =
them are protected by guarantees from Indian financial institutions. Indian=
 bankers fear the foreign banks may call in the guarantees. S.K. Chakrabati=
, chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India, which accounts for =
about a third of Indian banks' total exposure of Rs66bn (Dollars 1.4bn), ye=
sterday said he was "substantially hopeful" of solving the rift. Lenders to=
 Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, will meet in Singapore on June =
5-6. The Indian lenders, which include the State Bank of India, the country=
's biggest, and ICICI, will meet tomorrow to devise a strategy that would r=
ely more on "persuasion because we lack the power of veto", one Indian offi=
cial said.=20

Foreign lenders, which include US Exim, Bank of America and Industrial Bank=
 of Japan, have become increasingly dissatisfied with the payments record o=
f Dabhol's sole client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MSEB owes DPC =
Dollars 45m in unpaid bills. Last month foreign banks gave Dabhol the autho=
rity to withdraw from the project. Last week, Dabhol issued a "pre-terminat=
ion notice" to withdraw in  six months. The past few days of tit-for-tat mo=
ves by Dabhol and MSEB have also raised complex legal issues. MSEB's decisi=
on to cancel the power purchase agreement, which defines contractual relati=
ons with Enron, seems destined to go to court. The question is: which court=
? The agreement is governed by and based on English law. But the MSEB has r=
eferred the cancellation of the agreement, whose high tariffs are at the ro=
ot of the dispute, to the untested electricity regulator.  This is a risky =
strategy. "The regulator is not the authority that can decide on a purely c=
ontractual issue between parties," says a Bombay commercial lawyer. "In fac=
t, even an Indian court of law would have to refer the matter to an arbitra=
tion tribunal as identified in the agreement."=20

Enron launched arbitration proceedings on April 12 after increasingly bitte=
r wrangling. Many foreign bankers regard this official undermining of a con=
tract as a dangerous game of "power poker", which is already having a chill=
ing effect on multinationals' plans to invest in India's power and  telecom=
munications sectors. Three companies have told the Financial Times privatel=
y that they were reviewing their involvement with and strategy in India. On=
e senior executive pointed out that the risk premium for investors in India=
 has already gone up in the past six weeks. He said the "hurdle rate of ret=
urn" - the minimum rate of return on equity in dollars - that his and other=
 companies eyeing opportunities in India were seeking had risen by one to t=
wo percentage points. "If this Enron thing works out badly," the senior exe=
cutive said, "the hurdle rate is going to be   infinity." Foreign companies=
 are also becoming nervous by increasing domestic hostility. At the weekend=
, protestors attacked the Orissa-based subsidiary of the US energy company,=
 AES. Last week, about 2,000 protesters burnt down AES offices in northern =
Orissa. The state of Orissa pioneered the privatisation of power distributi=
on in India.=20

The Enron dispute has also forced Karnataka, to the south of Maharashtra, t=
o re-open 11 power purchase agreements signed with independent producers in=
 a move to cut electricity tariffs. Enron's position on its agreement remai=
ns unchanged. It refuses to renegotiate the contract, as the Indians sugges=
t, based on the findings of a recently published official report by the res=
pected politician, Madhav Godbole. Enron regards the report as hostile even=
 though the author was equally critical of the "quality of governance" in t=
he early to mid-1990s when the agreement was signed. Commentators say this =
is a reference to the administration of Sharad Pawar, who as the then leade=
r of Maharashtra was, and remains, a keen advocate of Enron's interests.=20

Meanwhile, K. Wade Cline, managing director of Dabhol, has told MSEB in a l=
etter dated May 25 that the utility's cancellation of the agreement is not =
valid. MSEB axed the contract because, it says, of Enron's poor plant perfo=
rmance, notably a failure to raise capacity from a cold start in three hour=
s, which Enron disputes. Yesterday, an Enron official picked up for the sec=
ond time a cheque for Rs1.37bn that MSEB paid last week "under protest", bu=
t which was returned by the US company, apparently to clear any misundersta=
nding about its position. As Mr Cline said in his leaked letter: "MSEB cann=
ot have it both ways. We will rely upon any payment as constituting an uneq=
uivocal affirmation of the validity of the PPA (power purchase agreement by=
) MSEB." Enron's  choreographed show of corporate pique yesterday at least =
shows it has learned something about the ways of Indian political play-acti=

Worried FIs in fresh bid to defuse Dabhol crisis

Worried over the prospects of their Rs 6,600 exposure to the Dabhol project=
 becoming non-performing assets (NPAs), Indian lenders led by the Industria=
l Development Bank of India (IDBI) have decided to meet on May 30, here wit=
h the main objective of persuading the offshore lenders against  precipitat=
ing matters further and request them to show restraint.IDBI, which has an e=
xposure of Rs 2,158 crore in the Dabhol project and has provided a guarante=
e forRs 1,528 crore to the offshore lenders, has taken the initiative to co=
nvene the May 30 meet in a bid to  avert a major lending crisis. IDBI is be=
lieved to have expressed concern over the lack of guarantee cover for the I=
FIs as against the similar protection enjoyed by the offshore lenders.

For the first time the Indian lenders today disclosed their exact exposure =
to DPC, which stood at Rs 6,600 crore. Other than IDBI, the domestic lender=
s include ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara   Bank. FIs feel that if En=
ron ultimately decides to pull out at this stage, terminating the power pur=
chase  agreement, it will have serious consequences with regard to the inve=
stments made by the FIs in the project. The Wednesday's meeting is expected=
 to be attended by the representatives of IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India,=
 Industrial Finance Corporation of India and Canara Bank to chalk out futur=
e course of action.

"However, we will have to persuade the foreign lenders that crisis should n=
ot be further precipitated and they should not exert pressure on the termin=
ation of project," sources said, adding, "Considering all aspects, the FIs =
are of the view that the Dabhol phase-II, which is already completed to the=
 extent of 90 per cent,should be allowed to be fully completed and an alter=
native for distribution of power should be explored, having regard to the i=
nability of the MSEB to absorb the Dabhol phase-II power."Foreign lenders, =
already upset with the payment delays and the controversy over the PPA canc=
ellation, are apparently not happy with the turn of events. "Indian lenders=
 will be the losers. Foreign lenders exposure is backed by guarantees. That=
's not the case with Indian lenders," FI sources said, adding,  "looking at=
 their stand so far, foreign lenders may cash their guarantees." There is  =
also speculation that belligerent foreign lenders are all set to encash the=
 deferred  payment guarantees.
