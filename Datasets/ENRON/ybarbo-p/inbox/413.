Dear Paul,

With reference to the message below and further to my fax to Mr Sanabria
dated 25th September (copied to you), could you please follow up the latest
status with him, as I have not received any direct communication from him
as to why this invoice is still outstanding.

I would appreciate your urgent attention to this matter.

Regards,

Debbie
