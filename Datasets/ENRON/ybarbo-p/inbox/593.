Hello Paul - we will be meeting for the Procaribe meeting at 11:15 on the 10th floor (1084) in 3AC.  A car will pick us up and take us to the meeting.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 11:45 and last for 2 hours.

Do you by chance have an electronic version of a picture of ProCaribe?

Thanks, Brian
