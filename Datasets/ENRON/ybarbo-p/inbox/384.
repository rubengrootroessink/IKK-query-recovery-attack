Probably yes. Paulo Issler in our Research group maintains the exotica files, contact him for details on those files. exotica1 is probably a backup file.

Krishna,

Do you mean the /Research/Exotica/xll directory? Is the exotica1.xll addin the same as the exotica.xll addin?

Here is what we had done for Kim before. In the PGE_Permian.xls file, the option values are in cells starting M30. In Excel, you need to load the exotica.xll addin which is in /Research/Exotica directory on your common drive. Load the addin and say NO to "copy to your local drive?" Also, see the "Results" sheet for volatility and correlation calculations.

Krishna,

Please see attached data on the pages named "MO IND DATA" and "Basis Forwards". I am interested in understanding the math associated with valuing calls and puts on the spread between the index points. Also, do you have an option pricing model that I could have? My office number is 5-4173.

Thanks,

Paul

P.S. Do you recall the work that you did for Kim Watson in the past?
