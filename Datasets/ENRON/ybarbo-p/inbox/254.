Dan,

Good morning,

Please be informed that the velding in the boiler tube was not successfully at
first attempt, so that had to be rewelded.  This has now been rectified and
pressuretested again and found in order.  The vessel put fire on the boiler 0630
this morning, 25th, and is expected to have the port boiler in service at 1200.

The vessel will arrive Algeciras 27th morning and making the stop as short as
possible.  The average speed to Lake Charles from Algeciras should be abt 17,5
knts to have  ETA June 8th 0600.

Best regards

Kjell
Hoegh LNG
