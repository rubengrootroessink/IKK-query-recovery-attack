Govt rejects DPC terms for selection of third conciliator,   Anupama Airy

THE finance ministry has rejected Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) proposal   t=
hat appointment of third independent conciliator for resolving the payment =
dispute be done either   by the London Court of International Arbitration o=
r by the International Chamber of Commerce   (ICC). Top government official=
s told The Financial Express that at meeting between the union finance mini=
ster Yashwant Sinha and the power minister Suresh Prabhu on Friday, it was =
decided that the   two conciliators, already appointed by the Centre and DP=
C respectively, will now appoint the third   conciliator.

Official sources disclosed the finance ministry has also done away with the=
 stipulation that the third   conciliator should not be a national of the U=
S or of India. "The department of economic affairs   (DEA) felt that the st=
ipulation over the nationality of the third conciliator was not necessary a=
nd should be done away with," the officials said.Earlier, the DEA had sugge=
sted that the appointment of the third conciliator be either left to the tw=
o   conciliators (already appointed on behalf of the Centre and DPC) or be =
selected by an institution   based in India.

DEA had proposed the names of two institutions - The Indian Council of Arbi=
tration and The International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution - who=
 could be asked to appoint the third independent conciliator.  However, sou=
rces said of the two suggestions made by DEA, it was finally decided in the=
 meeting of the two ministries that the thrid conciliator be appointed with=
 the consent of the two arbitrators, already appointed.Sources said the sug=
gestion of DPC that the Centre give a list of six neutral individuals of ap=
propriate standing and eminence for the appointment of the third conciliato=
r has also been turned down by the finance ministry.

Lenders seek power, finance ministry aid to resolve Dabhol mess ,   Anupama=
 Airy

FOREIGN lenders to Dabhol Power Company (DPC) have sought the   interventio=
n of the ministries of finance and power to quickly resolve the ongoing imp=
asse over  non-payment of dues by Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB=
), as DPC has sought their  consent to issue a preliminary termination noti=
ce to the MSEB.Justifying DPC's plans on issuing a termination notice to MS=
EB, the foreign lenders, in letters to the   secretaries of finance and pow=
er dated May 1, have said, "DPC is in its rights to do so, since various ev=
ents and issues have had a materially adverse effect on DPC's ability to pe=
rform its  obligations under the power purchase agreement (PPA)."

Sources informed that this issue was also discussed at the meeting between =
Union power minister Suresh Prabhu and finance minister Yashwant Singh on M=
ay 4. In their letters to the two ministries, foreign lenders have asked th=
e government to quickly find an amicable solution by ensuring timely paymen=
ts to DPC of all the outstanding dues, besides asking the government to inc=
rease the face  amount of the letter of intent (LoI).The lenders have also =
informed the government that all future disbursements for Phase-II of the D=
abhol project have been stopped till this matter is resolved between DPC an=
d MSEB.

MSEB to pay Rs 139cr April bill 'under protest' , Sanjay Jog

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) proposes to pay the April bi=
ll   of Rs 139 crore "under protest" to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) befo=
re the expiry of due   date of May 25.This would be the third consecutive t=
ime the MSEB would pay the bill to protest against the DPC's   refusal to a=
ccept mis-declaration and default on the availability of power on January 2=
8 and rebate   of Rs 401 crore slapped by the MSEB. The MSEB has paid, also=
, "under protest," the February bill (Rs 114 crore) and the March bill (Rs =
134 crore).=20

MSEB sources told The Financial Express that it has received the April bill=
 early this week for the   purchase of 128 million units at Rs 10 per unit.=
 The fixed charges were Rs 7, while the varible  charges were Rs 2.95.   Th=
ese sources said that the per unit tariff had reached Rs 21.06 in January f=
or the purchase of 53   million units. The MSEB has not paid the January bi=
ll of Rs 111 crore on the grounds that the DPC should adjust it against the=
 rebate amount of Rs 401 crore.   As far as the February bill is concerned,=
 the MSEB purchased 75 million units at Rs 14.74 peer unit  from the DPC.=
=20

In March, in view of increased power purchase at 156 million units from DPC=
, the per unit tariff was reduced at Rs 9.34 (total bill of Rs 146 crore). =
  In case of the December bill of Rs 152 crore, MSEB purchased 179 million =
units at the per unit  tariff of Rs 5.21. It must be mentioned here that th=
e MSEB has paid only Rs 50 crore and not paid  the balance Rs 102 crore in =
view of the non-payment of rebate of Rs 401 crore by the DPC. It must be me=
ntioned here that the DPC's per unit tariff had skyrocketted at Rs 25 for t=
he purchase of 39 million units in June last year which later soared at Rs =
7.90 in September and Rs 8.90 in November last year.=20

Dabhol project -- Enron: A rational renegotiation plan, S. Padmanabhan=20

THE MAHARASHTRA Government recently announced its plans to renegotiate the =
Enron-promoted Dabhol power project. In this connection, Mr R. K. Pachouri,=
 a committee member appointed for the renegotiation, outlined the prioritie=
s of the project in a television interview:=20

> To reduce the interest rate for the project debt of DPC to be in line wit=
h the current market trends;=20

>To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra=
; and=20

> To separate the LNG project from the power project.=20

A business daily on May 2 reported that Indian Oil plans to supply 1.2 mill=
ion tonnes of naphtha to DPC at around the international price of $290 a to=
nne, including sales tax of 16-18 per cent per tonne. The report indicates =
that DPC   has requested the Maharashtra Government to waive the sales tax =
so that the reduction in the sales tax can be passed on to the consumers.=
=20

Similar news reports on the project have started appearing in both the prin=
t and visual media. These indicate that the State Government and the DPC ma=
nagement seem to have come to an understanding on the broad principles of  =
renegotiation and both are in the process of educating the public about the=
  benefits these various measures would bring to the project.=20

No doubt, these steps would bring down the tariff. But, then, the reduction=
 will be due to concessions and subsidies offered by the State and the fina=
ncialinstitutions by way of waiver of sales tax and reduction in interest r=
ate. It appears that DPC will not offer any reduction or concession offered=
 in the tariff or the rate of returns.=20

Reduction in project debt: When the DPC loans were sanctioned, the prime le=
nding rate was around 14 per cent and the power projects were offered loans=
 at 3-3.5 per cent over the PLR. Now the PLR is around 12.5 per cent and th=
e interest rates for the power sector will be 15-15.5 per cent. Effectively=
, there  would be a reduction of around 1.5-2 per cent in the interest rate=
. However, it must be noted that the same refinancing opportunity is good f=
or every other Indian project. If the Centre permits refinancing for DPC, i=
t should permit  projects in other States as well to be refinanced. If it d=
oes, that will be at a  considerable loss to the FIs such as the IDBI, the =
IFCI and the ICICI.=20

To achieve higher output and identify power purchasers outside Maharashtra:
This is not a tariff-reduction exercise. In fact, this would help DPC impro=
ve its profits and cash flows under the present PPA. DPC has a single-point=
 tariff whichconsists of a fixed and a variable charge. Higher the output t=
he DPC recovers, higher the fixed charges and higher the profits. Thus, wit=
hout any significant changes in the existing PPA, this step would help DPC,=
 and put more States in  trouble. Perhaps, the renegotiating committee want=
s other States to sink as well  with Maharashtra.=20

To separate the LNG project from the power project: This is a welcome step.=
 While it would reduce the tariff for the power project, it would not remov=
e the financial hurdles for the State and the Centre, which would continue =
to be paying more for the LNG project and guaranteeing the loans of the LNG=
 project. DPC is now recovering all the cost of the LNG project from the Da=
bhol project, which will consume only around 2.5 million tonnes of LNG, whe=
reas the capacity of the LNG project is being upgraded to five million tonn=
es. Therefore, the mere segregation of the LNG project without readjusting =
the PPA or delinking the sovereign guarantee obligations does not serve the=
 purpose. It would help DPC and not the people of Maharashtra.=20

To exempt sales tax on naphtha: This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. As =
IOC suggested, if $290 is the price of naphtha per tonne, it works out to R=
s 13,630 (one $ =3D Rs 47). Given that DPC gets paid fuel cost per kWh at 2=
,000 kcal (heat rate) and the naphtha has a heat value of 11,000 kcal, one =
tonne of the fuel will  give DPC fuel price for 5,500 kWh, that is at the r=
ate of Rs 2.48 per kWh for  naphtha. If sales tax of 16 per cent is exempte=
d from this price, the naphtha price drops to Rs 11,750 and the per kWh fue=
l price for DPC drops to Rs 2.14 from Rs 2.48. IOC expects to supply 1.2 mi=
llion tonnes of naphtha for producing 6,600 million kWh and the sales tax e=
xemption effect will be Rs 225 crore (0.34  per kWh).=20

What is DPC`s contribution in this reduction? On the same account, every po=
wer project would seek to reduce the sales tax on the fuel they use. Rememb=
er that if the State sacrifices revenue in one area, it will recover the lo=
ss through some other taxes. When the current trend is to remove subsidies =
in all the sectors, the State and the renegotiating committee are opening u=
p new subsidies to support DPC. An alternative The renegotiating committee =
should reduce the real tariffs from DPC`s fixed  costs, rather than making =
cosmetic changes in the taxation structure. The following steps are needed:=
=20

To remove the corporate veil protecting the DPC project documents: The publ=
ic at large are paying for the revenues of DPC and no government can have t=
he right to keep a veil of secrecy on the documents. This will help the pub=
lic at large and the experts in the industry understand the implications an=
d suggest  viable alternatives.=20

To change DPC tariff formula from a single-part to two-part tariff: The Cen=
tre has a two-part tariff policy which stipulates recovery of fixed cost un=
der certain circumstances. The most critical issue of this policy is the re=
covery of all fixed costs at a capacity utilisation (PLF) at 75 per cent. D=
PC has adopted a single part tariff system where the fixed costs are paid f=
or all capacities and, thus the return of DPC increases as the capacity uti=
lisation rises. While this method may promote efficiency, DPC has tied the =
State in tight knots with this higher capacity utilisation and, will make v=
ery high levels of profits. Therefore, it is essential that the single-part=
 tariff is renegotiated at lower levels or better still scrapped and two-pa=
rt tariff adopted.=20

Renegotiating the station heat rate: DPC has a station heat rate of 2000 kc=
al per kWh. Thus, for every unit of electricity it produces the fuel -- nap=
htha " it is reimbursed to DPC at the rate of 2,000 kcal per kWh. At $290 p=
er tonne (Rs 13,630 at one $ =3D Rs 47) of IOC price this works out to Rs 2=
.48 per kWh. DPC  uses GE 9FA machines-gas turbines which burn naphtha at a=
round 1,700 kcal per  kWh. In other words, DPC uses 1,700 kcal of naphtha a=
nd gets paid for 2,000 kcal. Thus, it spends Rs 2.11 per kWh on fuel but ge=
ts paid Rs 2.48 per kWh, making a profit of Rs 0.37 for every kWh. On 2,100=
 MW at 80 per cent capacity, this is a whopping Rs 550 crore. While there m=
ay be technical grounds to pay at a level higher than 1,700 kcal due to con=
siderations of part load, there is no justification for paying at 2,000 kca=
l. In fact, the Centre and the CEA as well as other States have been succes=
sfully forcing all power producers to reduce from the 2,000 kcal levels whi=
le Maharashtra has not been able to do this. This is a  key issue in negoti=
ations.=20

To source naphtha only from domestic sources:=20

India has a surplus of naphtha as of now and there is no need to import it.=
 DPC should be forced to buy fuel only from domestic sources so that the pr=
ofits remain with domestic companies, and not allow DPC to make higher prof=
its of fuel handling.=20

What if renegotiation fails?=20

DPC will not agree to changes in the PPA as it would feel that it is a sign=
ed and sealed document. Maharashtra may look at cosmetic changes, and may m=
ake sacrifices to reduce the tariff. But in the long run, the contract will=
 run aground because of the inability of the State Government to use and pa=
y for the power produced by DPC. Given the background of Enron worldwide, i=
t would press ahead with its perceived advantages -- legal and contractual.=
 It is better for the State to ready a back-up action plan. The following l=
ine of action is suggested:

* To terminate the PPA and other project contracts and give notice to Enron=
 to wind up operations;=20

* To inform the lenders, the beneficiaries of the sovereign guarantee, that=
 the Centre will pay up its commitments. Perhaps, this may involve setting =
up an escrow account and placing sufficient debt reserve funds that the len=
ders may request, pending final payments;=20

* To quickly move towards an arbitration process primarily to determine the=
 amounts payable to Enron towards contract termination;=20

* To initiate an international competitive tendering process, with the perm=
ission of the lenders, to sell the power project and the LNG terminal as in=
dependent projects -- the process should also permit bids from Indian compa=
nies;=20

* To make a serious effort to complete the bid finalisation and selection o=
f the successful bidder in two-three months;=20

* The bidding process should have two parameters for the bidders to quote:=
=20

a) tariff payable to the bidder for the next 20 years (in the case of LNG t=
erminal  -- price of gas on long term basis);=20

b) price for the assets;=20

c) The bid would attract several international power players including Amer=
ican companies for the power and the LNG projects and the bids offered will=
 be attractive. Also Indian companies or consortia would line up for the bi=
d;=20

d) Simultaneous with this exercise, as soon as determination of amounts pay=
able to Enron becomes clear, to place the funds so determined and accepted =
with an escrow agent acceptable to Enron;=20

e) To set up an investigating team to go into the approval process to deter=
mine whether there has been any corrupt practice in the process of granting=
 approvals. There is a Supreme Court case (filed by CITU) pending decision =
on charges of corruption. The investigating team to focus, with the coopera=
tion of the US Government, on the issues relating to Foreign Corrupt Practi=
ces Act (FCPA) of the US. Violation of the FCPA by any American corporate i=
s a serious issue attracting criminal prosecution. There can be a time boun=
d investigation;=20

f) To proceed with the prosecution of all people concerned if found guilty =
" if Enron is found guilty the compensations may not be payable and the US =
law agencies will step in to prosecute Enron;=20

j) If Enron is not found guilty, to pay the monies due to it by releasing t=
he amounts in escrow. By this time the asset takeover and the debt repaymen=
t issues would have been resolved;=20

k) Conservatively, it is believed that there would be an ultimate gap of $1=
,000 million (Rs 4,700 crore at one $ =3D Rs 47) after the assets are sold =
and debts transferred to the new owners. It is suggested that the State flo=
at a public debt issue for paying this to Enron and levy an `Enron Cess' to=
 recover the loss and  repay the debt issue over the next 15-20 years. At a=
 return of 10 per cent per annum on Rs 4,700 crore over the next 15 years a=
nd assuming that 100 per cent of the loss is recovered from the 2,100 MW pr=
oject and assuming an 80 per cent PLF, the `Enron Cess' per kWh of energy p=
roduced will be Rs 0.42.=20

But will the Central and State governments have the political will to force=
 this issue?=20

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Thursday, May 10, 2001
Centre to back Maharashtra on tariff talks with Enron

THE Centre has conveyed that it would support the Maharashtra Government on=
 the contentious issue of tariff renegotiations with Enron for power purcha=
se from Dabhol Power Company (DPC). Talking to newspersons here on Wednesda=
y, the Union Minister for Power, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said the Centre had alre=
ady appointed the Solicitor-General of India as its nominee in the panel se=
t up by the Maharashtra State Government headed by Mr Madhav Godbole to ren=
egotiate the terms of the power purchase agreement. Enron's executives were=
 due to meet the panel on May 11 in this  connection, he added.=20

Replying to questions on Enron's proposals to exit from DPC, he said that n=
either the Maharashtra Government nor Enron had conveyed their desire to ex=
it from DPC. ``We will support the State Government,'' he emphasised. He sa=
id that the Centre was not in a position to intervene in the matter since i=
t was for Enron to take a decision on the issue. However, the Centre's coun=
ter guarantee liabilities in DPC would be confined to the extent of the Sta=
te Government's payment defaults. Earlier speaking at the inauguration of C=
II institute of quality, he said that the Centre's new focus was on conserv=
ation of power rather than adding fresh capacity.=20

The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr S.M. Krishna, who was also present, said t=
hat WTO's impact on the agriculture sector needed to be addressed and said =
that the Prime Minister should call a meeting of the Chief Ministers to dis=
cuss the outcome of the WTO and future steps that needed to be taken. He ad=
ded that the Congress had initiated reforms -- liberalisation and globalisa=
tion -- and there was no intention of retreating on them. However, it was n=
ecessary to have a mid-term appraisal on them.=20

Dr K. Kasturirangan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation said,``Be=
hind every successful company is a quality culture, and that in the  unforg=
iving environment of space strict quality awareness was very essential and =
any violation would mean that we have to pay heavily in space.'' He added t=
hat space had given to the world configuration, control and management and =
in the Rs 1,000 crore GSLV programme, over 10,000 computer simulations had =
been done in th last six-seven years, before it was considered flight worth=
y. Almost 1000 major reviews were done and input collected not only from se=
nior engineers, but from youngsters too, ``as their minds are fresh. We wor=
ked towards transparency and fairly and frankly exchanged ideas. Around hal=
f a million a A-4 size papers documentation was done on the programme,'' he=
 added.
