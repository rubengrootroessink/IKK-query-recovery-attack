Enron Drama In mumbai, Delhi makes gesture
Godbole shakes govt to action Submits, takes back resignation=20

IN a day of dramatic developments, the Dabhol project renegotiation committ=
ee chairman Dr Madhav Godbole, who had resigned in the wake of the criticis=
m by former chief minister Sharad Pawar on the functioning of the committee=
, ultimately withdrew it on Wednesday evening after the state Cabinet affir=
med "full faith, support and confidence in the ability of the committee to =
handle the complex and onerous task". Dr Godbole, whose resignation early o=
n Wednesday morning led to cancellation of a renegotiation committee meetin=
g with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) team,  told The Financial Express tha=
t the next meeting would take place early next week.  He said the state Cab=
inet had unanimously rejected his resignation sent to the chief  minister V=
ilasrao Deshmukh and affirmed its full confidence in the committee.The DPC,=
 which had decided to attend Wednesday's Godbole renegotiation committee me=
eting, declined to comment.

Dr Godbole's resignation has literally shaken the Democratic Front (DF) gov=
ernment in Maharashtra, which has been criticised day in and day out by som=
e of its constituents on the Dabhol issue. Dr Godbole had   put in his pape=
rs on Wednesday morning, following Mr Shard Pawar's statement that the  com=
mittee's negative approach would not help resolve the Dabhol impasse.   Dr =
Godbole, in his two-page resignation letter, is believed to have said that =
it would be impossible to continue to function especially when the leader o=
f one of the major constituents of the state government, the Nationalist Co=
ngress Party (NCP), had criticised the functioning of the committee.  Dr Go=
dbole had expressed his anguish over Mr Shard Pawar's remarks and seems to =
have stated that it would not be proper on his part to discharge his duties=
 when serious aspersions have been  cast on his abilities.

However, Mr Deshmukh and his deputy, Mr Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also the Na=
tionalist Congress Party legislative party leader, were closetted in a meet=
ing and thereafter decided upon a strategy to pacify Dr Godbole.   Thereaft=
er, the state Cabinet wholeheartedly rejected Dr Godbole's resignation afte=
r Mr Bhujbal clarified Mr Shard Pawar's statements appearing in a section o=
f the press. Mr Deshmukh said he had appealed to Dr Godbole to withdraw his=
 resignation and added that "Dr  Godbole's indepth knowledge and experience=
 makes him indispensible for handling a vexed issue  such as renegotiation =
with the US energy giant."  Mr Deshmukh told reporters after the Cabinet me=
eting that it was the state government which had appointed Dr Godbole for r=
enegotiating the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Dabhol Power Company (=
DPC) and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and not any particu=
lar individual. "In fact, Dr Godbole's appointment was a Cabinet decision a=
pproved by the members of Nationalist Congress Party," Mr Bhujbal said. "Mr=
 Sharad Pawar's statement has not been taken in the right spirit. Mr Pawar =
had himself put his stamp on Dr Godbole's appointment," he added.  Moreover=
, Mr Bhujbal said Mr Pawar had said that Maharashtra would not be able to c=
onsume the  extra 1,900 mw generated by Dabhol Power Company and that the C=
entre should play an active  role in reducing the high tariff.

Earlier, the DF constituents, specially the Janata Dal (S) and Peasants and=
 Workers Party (PWP), made several visits and calls to the chief minister u=
rging him to prevail upon Dr Godbole to withdraw his resignation "in the la=
rger interest of the state and its consumers."   A veteran JD (S) leader Mr=
inal Gore, accompanied by socialist leader PB Samant and Enron Virodhi Ando=
lan convenor Pradyumna Kaul met Dr Godbole and made an appeal to withdraw h=
is resignation.  The Janata Dal (S) came down heavily on Mr Pawar and alleg=
ed that he wanted to appoint a pro-Enron man on the renegotiation committee=
. However, Mr Pawar claimed that Dr Godbole's decision was a personal one. =
 He said that he (Pawar) was not talking on behalf of the Maharashtra gover=
nment when he commented on the "negative approach" of those leading the tal=
ks. He reiterated that there was a need for renegotiations with Enron to re=
duce the power tariff and the Godbole panel should complete its unfinished =
work.

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, May 24, 2001,
Godbole does a Mamata; quits, then back

 IT'S not a comparison that springs naturally to mind. But Madhav Godbole, =
the former home secretary in charge of renegotiations with Enron, on Wednes=
day managed a passable imitation of Mamata Banerjee by resigning in the mor=
ning and withdrawing his resignation later in the day. In a day marked by c=
onsiderable drama that briefly threatened the renegotiation process with En=
ron, Godbole decided not to press for his resignation after chief minister =
Vilasrao Deshmukh personally expressed "full faith and confidence" in his a=
bility to "handle the complex and onerous task of renegotiation".=20

Earlier in the day, Godbole, who took offence to former chief minister Shar=
ad Pawar's "derogatory" remarks, decided to walk out of the panel. Pawar ha=
d last on Tuesday night said he was doubtful about the outcome of the ongoi=
ng renegotiations between the state and DPC as those heading the state gove=
rnment's panel did have a positive approach to resolve the issue. Godbole's=
 swift decision to quit the panel sent shock waves at the Mantralaya -- hea=
dquarters of the state government -- as it seemed to threaten the existence=
 of the government. The Janata Dal, Peasants and Workers Party and other sp=
linter groups went to the extent of saying they would pull  out of the nine=
-party coalition if Godbole's resignation was accepted.=20

Following these development, the state government had to cancel the crucial=
 second round of renegotiations with DPC slated for Wednesday. Enron and th=
e Centre's                                           representative were to=
 attend the meet. "I have resigned due to the derogatory remarks made  agai=
nst me by Sharad Pawar last night," Godbole said on  Wednesday morning. God=
bole said instead of strengthening the negotiator's hands, such statements =
"loosen the concerned authority's grip over the fragile situation". However=
, chief minister Vilasrao Deshumukh appealed to him to reconsider his decis=
ion. "Godbole's in-depth knowledge and experience makes him indispensable f=
or handling vexed issues such as renegotiation with the US  energy giant," =
Deshmukh said.=20

Deshmukh, after the Cabinet meet, sent a letter to Godbole expressing full =
confidence in him. "Godbole should not respond to statements from those out=
side the government," said Deshmukh.  Meanwhile, Pawar, too, tried to contr=
ol the damage. "It was my personal opinion that was not aimed at any partic=
ular  person. Godbole should not have resigned. He should complete his task=
." Interestingly, Chagan Bhujbal, the state's deputy chief minister, was pu=
t on a re-fighting mission and asked to express faith in Godbole on behalf =
of the NCP, led by Pawar. Later in the evening Godbole decided not to press=
 for the resignation. "I have received a letter from the chief minister exp=
ressing full confidence in my abilities. It also states the views expressed=
 by Sharad Pawar were his personal views. He has said the state government =
had appointed me and they had no complaints against me. I, therefore, see n=
o reason to press for my resignation," Godbole said. Meanwhile, the next me=
eting of the renegotiating panel has been convened on May 29.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Thursday, 24 May 2001
Enron Endgame=20

As home secretary, Madhav Godbole was known as a no-nonsense administrator.=
 His report on the Dabhol  Power Corporation deal - which he dubs ``an inex=
cusable failure of governance'' - shows that he  still believes in calling =
a spade a spade. Godbole, who was responsible for renegotiating the power-p=
urchase agreement with Enron, is the man in the news. He had tendered his r=
esignation as the chairman of the negotiating committee after Sharad Pawar =
said ``those leading the talks from the government side                    =
                     are working with a negative approach'', only to take  =
it back on Wednesday evening after Pawar clarified  that he had not made th=
is comment on the state's   behalf. On a day of such tumultuous development=
s, he spoke to Aditya Chatterjeehours before withdrawing his resignation:=
=20

You were appointed by the Maharashtra government to renegotiate the power p=
urchase agreement with the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company. A key membe=
r of the government, Sharad Pawar, has criticised you. Do you feel you have=
 been let down?

The government should learn to first take a stand and then stand by it. As =
you rightly pointed out, the Maharashtra government had appointed me as the=
 committee head. And now, an important constituent of the government has al=
leged that the negotiating committee  has a negative attitude. This type of=
 a statement weakens the committee's stand on the crucial issue of renegoti=
ating the power purchase agreement with the Dabhol Power Company. The gover=
nment should try to give all the support to the committee and help strength=
en it. Recent comments made by the senior Nationalist Congress Party leader=
 are counter-productive in this light. I had put in my resignation letter b=
ecause of the government's attitude. If the state government was not prepar=
ed to place its full trust on my capabilities, there was no reason for me t=
o stay on. Therefore, I had sent my resignation to the chief minister, Vila=
srao Deshmukh.=20

Sharad Pawar was the chief minister of Maharashtra when the state had first=
 signed an agreement with the US-based power major Enron in 1993-94. You we=
re also regarded as the thorn in Enron's flesh. In fact, Enron has publicly=
 said that it was not willing to  accept your committee's report. If you ha=
d not recalled your resignation, would Enron and its  supporters havebenefi=
tted?

I would not like to comment on this. It's for you to decide.=20

If the ongoing negotiations with Enron fail to break the deadlock, what wil=
l be India's best strategy to initiate damage control?

Let me answer you this way. Two members of the Godbole committee had called=
 for a judicial enquiry into the entire issue. Only a judicial enquiry can =
get into details as to whether Enron had received any undue favour from the=
 state, or whether facts were misrepresented knowingly by the authorities c=
oncerned. It is also important to find out whether the contract signed with=
 Enron is legally valid. The committee had also suggested that the judicial=
 enquiry, headed by a serving or a retired Supreme Court judge, should be i=
nitiated as soon as possible. One must understand that a committee like our=
s has limited powers. We cannot, unlike a court, record evidence under oath=
 and issue summons to the state government, the centre, financial instituti=
ons and other autonomous bodies.=20

A judicial enquiry will have a two-fold advantage. One, Enron would know th=
at the Indian government is serious about finding out the truth about the a=
lleged wrong-doings. This will force Enron back to the negotiating table. S=
econd, if the judicial enquiry is able to prove that there were indeed undu=
e favours accorded to Enron, the power purchase contract will be no longer =
binding for India.=20

Some senior economists argue that the price per unit  of power supplied by =
Dabhol will come down  dramatically if the Maharashtra State Electricity Bo=
ard purchases its entire output. What is your opinion?

That's a hypothetical argument. Even if we discount the fact that the MSEB =
does not have the requisite funds to  purchase Enron's entire output, there=
 is no way Maharashtra can utilise the entire 740 megawatt of power which i=
s being produced by just the first phase of the Dabhol project. The state's=
 power utilisation has been steadily dropping over the last two years becau=
se of falling demand. In fact, a judicial enquiry could examine as to wheth=
er the MSEB had presented an inflated demand scenario when the DPC project =
was being conceived. The World Bank had actually raised doubts about the de=
mand scenario then. The average power utilisation of the Dabhol project is =
only about 30-40 per cent of Phase I. And, I am not  even counting the Phas=
e II portion; that is completely unviable at this point of time.=20

So, does Maharashtra really need the Dabhol project?

I would say that Maharashtra only needs a marginal portion of the first pha=
se of the Dabhol project.

At what terms, in your opinion, will the Dabhol project be viable for Mahar=
ashtra?

The Energy Review Committee has discussed this aspect in its report. We fou=
nd that the state would be able to find buyers for the power at Rs 2.50 per=
 unit. As opposed to this, Dabhol Power Company sells its power at a variab=
le rate between Rs 3.50 and Rs 8 - depending on the power utilisation by MS=
EB.

Is your decision to resign final or will you consider withdrawing the lette=
r if the state government requests you to continue?

I haven't considered this issue at this point of time.=20

Sharad Pawar did not specifically name you in his statement. He had actuall=
y blamed the entire committee for having a negative approach. Do you think =
that other conscientious members of the Godbole committee will now follow y=
our lead and put  in their papers?=20

That is a possibility. But, it's for the other members to decide.

What is your future plan of action?

Well, I will continue working on the report which involves the second phase=
 of the Dabhol project and restructuring the operations of the MSEB. The re=
port will be completed over the next 10 days.

Centre to avoid dispute with Maha on DPC

IN ITS first reaction after Dabhol Power Company issued the pre-termination=
 notice last week, the Centre on Wednesday made it clear that it would cont=
inue to play its role as a facilitator, but would not step in till such tim=
e the state government walked out of the project Power ministry officials t=
old The Economic Times that this was primarily to avoid any Centre-state di=
spute in the crisis. The Centre would not require to intervene in case the =
disputes were resolved bilaterally. "We will step in with our suggestions o=
nly when the state government has taken a final decision on whether to go a=
head or scrap the project. The first move has to be taken by the state gove=
rnment as the matter involves the Maharashtra government and DPC." Union po=
wer minister Suresh Prabhu who had been on a  foreign tour met finance mini=
ster Yashwant Sinha on Wednesday to discuss the Dabhol power project, and t=
he   financial implications of the pre-termination notice.=20

Although the finance ministry may not have to pay out anything immediately,=
 it has to be prepared for its obligations under the counter-guarantee and =
particularly when decisions have to be taken within a deadline. Senior offi=
cials of the power and finance ministries are meeting on Friday to discuss =
the DPC problem. However, concerned over the affects the Enron controversy =
is having on other private investments, the power ministry issued a stateme=
nt highlighting its efforts to solve the ongoing dispute. The Centre has as=
sured lenders of the Dabhol power project that all steps would be taken to =
resolve the ongoing crisis and steps have already been initiated for an ear=
ly  settlement of the dispute between MSEB and DPC.=20

Prabhu has reiterated and confirmed that the Centre would be willing to con=
sider any worthwhile idea emerging out of the consultations held by the neg=
otiation committee for the settlement of the dispute. However, the solution=
 has to be acceptable to both DPC and MSEB as they are the concerned partie=
s. The Centre has, however, clarified that State-run National Thermal Power=
 Corporation cannot be expected to bail out the Enron project as it would t=
hen be unfair to keep all other  IPPs pending. "There are several IPPS whos=
e financial closure has been pending, and NTPC cannot be expected to bail t=
hem out," sources said. The Centre has further said in its statement that i=
t also played a proactive role by appointing A V Gokak, retired telecom sec=
retary, as the Government of India nominee on the negotiating committee con=
stituted by the Maharashtra government.

THE CENTRE will accept recommendations of therenegotiating committee headed=

Is Pawar playing power politics with Enron?, Girish Kuber=20

MAHARASHTRA'S former chief minister Sharad Pawar's statement criticising Ma=
dhav Godbole, the head of the renegotiation team, and the timing chosen by =
him to air his views, has focused attention on his role in the Enron contro=
versy. Pawar, who had first inked the Enron deal as the chief minister of M=
aharashtra in 1992, was at the center of controversy when the Opposition ac=
cused him of favouring" the US energy giant. The issue of Rs 64 crore being=
 spent by Enron on "educating" Indians had become a political issue in the =
1995 state Assembly elections which Pawar lost. In more recent times, Pawar=
 has repeatedly intervened at crucial junctures. On the eve of Wednesday's =
session of the Godbole panel, Pawar criticised Godbole of having " a negati=
ve attitude" about Enron. Though Pawar did not  name Godbole, the message w=
as loud and clear. His statement comes at a time when the Maharashtra State=
 Electricity is planning to issue a pre termination notice to Enron after t=
he Godbole panel's scheduled meet on Wednesday.=20

The board officials had discussed the issue with the state's advocate-gener=
al and were believed to have received a go-ahead from chief minister Vilasr=
ao Deshmukh. Last October, when the state government had decided not to pay=
 Enron's bills, Pawar convinced the state government to release Enron payme=
nts. It was after his intervention that the state government decided to app=
oint a committee  to review the project. Surprisingly, last month, when Des=
hmukh had a meeting with Yashwant Sinha and Suresh Prabhu at Delhi, Pawar w=
as seen accompanying the chief minister though his name did not figure on t=
he official list of invitees. However, subsequently, the committee could no=
t be formed since the faction loyal to Pawar in the state government was cl=
early against Godbole's appointment.=20

State energy minister and Pawar's trusted aide, Padmasinh Patil, had public=
ly expressed his ire against  Godbole. It was only after the Janata Dal, Pe=
asents and Workers Party, CPI (M) and other anti-Enron groups threatened to=
 withdraw support of the government, the Godbole Committee came into being.=
 But not bofore a month was lost in a wrangling. Even after the committee's=
 formation, Patil continued his tirade against Godbole. It was only chief m=
inister Deshmukh's support that the Godbole Committee could survive the opp=
osition from within. Political observers believe that it was the Congress' =
strategy to support the Godbole Committee that at the end could expose the =
wrongdoings of the earlier governments. As expected, the Godbole Committee,=
 in its first report, exposed what it called the "lack of governance at eve=
ry stage" in finalising the Enron deal. Godbole even  suggested a judicial =
probe to pin those guilty for this "faulty deal". It was against this backd=
rop that Pawar's views on Godbole created a flutter on Wednesday. Although =
Godbole withdrew his resignation, it has certainly widened  the rift betwee=
n the NCP and Congress.

 Mr RK Pachauri, Mr Kirit Parikh and Mr EAS Sarma from the Madhav Godbole r=
enegotiation committee on Dabhol  project. Mr Pawar in an exclusive intervi=
ew to the The Financial Express said the government should find out why the=
se members had quit on the grounds of "prior engagements." He said the rene=
gotiation is the best possible option for the reduction of Dabhol tariff.  =
 Mr Pawar, whose party is a major constituent of the Democratic Front gover=
nment in Maharashtra,  said that the state government is quite keen to reso=
lve the Dabhol impasse. "The state government's bonafide cannot be challeng=
ed as it is quite serious to resolve the Dabhol imbroglio," he remarked.

He reiterated that the renegotiation committee as well as state government =
should keep a positive   approach for the resolution of the issue. He said =
that the Centre's intervention is a foregone conclusion as the Maharashtra =
State Electricity Board (MSEB) was not in a position to absorb  nearly 1,90=
0 mw of power generated from the Dabhol plant. "In fact, questions are bein=
g raised about the purchase of even 500 mw from Dabhol Power Company," he a=
dded. Mr Pawar said that the Centre would have to step in and help the MSEB=
 to find a way for the disposal of excess power especially in the power def=
icit states. He pointed out that the DPC's decision to serve preliminary te=
rmination notice was in haste and uncalled for.

Dabhol lenders hope for crisis resolution at Friday meeting=20

THE domestic lenders to the Dabhol power project, who along with foreign le=
nders had suspended further disbursements for DPC phase-II, have pinned the=
ir hopes on the  meeting called by the Centre on Friday in New Delhi to fin=
d an amicable solution for the ongoing  Dabhol impasse. "We are hopeful tha=
t the meet, which will bring all the disputing parties together, will arriv=
e at an   amicable solution for protecting the national interest," said a t=
op officials of State Bank of India. "We are not worried about the present =
development and we are sure about a positive development at the end," he sa=
id. Regarding the repayment of installments, the official said that he does=
 not expect any problem till   September as the 'reserve fund' which takes =
care of the quarter instalment has sufficient funds.

Also the suspension of further disbursements by the lenders is a temporary =
measure which has no long-term implications on the project. "As stipulated =
by the PTN, they have got six months to sort out things and the time period=
 is enough to settle the differences," he said. The domestic lenders have a=
lso given various suggestions to the Centre and MSEB as to how to tackle th=
e crisis.While the foreign banks are, to an extent, comfortable with the id=
ea of the termination of the project as they have Centre's counter guarante=
e for the phase I, the local banks and financial institutions have to worry=
 about getting their exposure back as they are not at all covered by the co=
unter guarantee.=20

However, the local lenders are confident that the profit making project, th=
e insurance cover of which has been renewed recently, will be operational s=
oon.The domestic lenders had also asked the Centre to convince MSEB and for=
ce it to restrain from issuing a PTN to DPC.   They may also skip the forth=
coming two-day global lenders meet during June 4-6 in Singapore to discuss =
the implication of PTN served by the DPC to MSEB.  The Indian lenders, led =
by the Industrial Development Bank of India, SBI and ICICI, have lent aroun=
d $1.4 billion out of a total $3 billion for the 2,184 mw project.

Enron renegotiation to begin next week'    By: Yogesh Naik

The phone rings incessantly at the Godboles 16th floor apartment at Buena V=
ista just 200 metres away from Mantralaya. The retired Home Secretary, Madh=
av Godbole, who had been recently appointed as the chairman of the renegoti=
ations committee, answers each one of them and speaks to the media men who =
ask him whether he has taken back his resignation as chairman of the Enron =
renegotiations panel or not.  A visibly upset Godbole answers each call unt=
iringly. " I have taken back my resignation after the chief minister sent m=
e a letter saying that the entire cabinet had expressed faith in my work."

 Godbole had submitted a resignation to the CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh last morn=
ing following a 'derogatory statement' from Nationalist Congress Party chie=
f, Sharad Pawar saying that he was apprehensive of the outcome of the discu=
ssions as those leading the talks from the government side had a negative a=
pproach. Pawar had made a statement to the media on Tuesday evening. The NC=
P chief did a volte-face by retracting it.  Godbole told Chalomumbai, " Eve=
n I had seen him on television as many of you reporters did. He said someth=
ing else on the television and he is saying something else now. That' s the=
 way, world is." Though the Power Purchase Agreement with Dabhol Power Corp=
oration is very tight. Godbole feels, " PPAs have renegotiated worldwide. W=
hy can it not be done here."

 Though some allegations have been leveled Godbole report on Enron, the Pun=
e based retired home secretary is known for his honesty and integrity. The =
state government just provides him with remuneration of Rs 10000 per month =
and to and fro transportation, while the lawyers who defend the case in the=
 international courts are paid upto 400 pounds an hour.  Yesterday, Deshmuk=
h tried a lot to undo the damage done to Godbole. He also clarified that no=
 one from the government had criticised Godbole. Godbole was supposed to he=
ar the US energy giant yesterday but the hearing could not take place. The =
Godbole resignation episode coupled with the resignations of three other me=
mbers earlier this month has given a setback to the renegotiations. But God=
bole says that the renegotiations will begin early next week.

Power trading corp to be roped in for disposing of Dabhol power , Sanjay Jo=
g=20

THE BJP-led government at the Centre, which had come under severe attack fo=
r being a silent observer, has ultimately decided to step in to resolve the=
 ongoing Dabhol impasse. The Centre has asked the Union ministry of power t=
o prepare a comprehensive proposal for the consideration of the union cabin=
et for roping in the state-run Power Trading Corporation (PTC) for  the dis=
posal of Dabhol power in power deficit states across the country. Top sourc=
es told The Financial Express on Wednesday that the Centre has asked the Un=
ion power ministry to project the requirement of finances for the PTC to ma=
ke the trading of Dabhol power a reality. "The Centre's nominee and former =
bureaucrat nominated on the Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee for the =
Dabhol project, AV Gokak, has been given the mandate in this direction. The=
 Union ministry is expected to submit a necessary proposal in this regard v=
ery shortly," sources said.

The inter-ministerial team, comprising secretaries of ministries of power, =
finance and oil and natural gas have reportedly made a strong recommendatio=
n in this connection, following the refusal by the National Thermal Power C=
orporation (NTPC) to enter into the picture by dispatching Dabhol power. So=
urces said that former Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar is believed =
to have  played a major role in convincing the Centre to intervene directly=
 to enable the Dabhol crisis to blow  over. In fact, Maharashtra chief mini=
ster Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, in his successive communications to the   Prime =
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on February 6, April 17 and May 10, had appea=
led that the  surplus power generated by the DPC would have to be disposed =
by national organisations such as NTPC and PTC, in power deficit states. "T=
he negotiation with DPC with a view to reducing the tariff of power from th=
e Dabhol project, hinges around the question whether the entire power from =
this project at 90 per cent plant load factor, would be purchased by a cred=
it-worthy purchaser or not. The DPC may be willing to reduce the tariff fro=
m the existing high levels, provided they get such an assurance from the go=
vernment of India," Mr Deshmukh added. According to sources, PTC has alread=
y stepped into the field of inter-state trading of power by identifying sur=

State refers DPC dispute to MERC ,  Sanjay Jog

THE Maharashtra government, in a tactical move, has decided to refer the on=
going Dabhol disputes to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission =
(Merc) mainly to "buy time."  The state cabinet on Wednesday has approved t=
his proposal and is believed to have directed the chief secretary and power=
 secretary to complete the necessary formalities in this regard. Mantralaya=
 sources told The Financial Express that the state government has already i=
nformed its  intent to Merc in this connection. Merc has already been deleg=
ated adequate power under section 22 (2)(n) of the Electricity Regulatory C=
ommission Act 1998 to "adjudicate upon the disputes/differences between the=
 licencees and utilities and refer the matter for arbitration" through a go=
vernment notification issued on December 5, 2000.

The state government had delegated these powers to Merc, when it had referr=
ed the disputes between the Tata Power and BSES over the payment of standby=
 charges. At present Merc is holding hearings on a petition filed by BSES i=
n this connection. The disputes related to the issuance of preliminary term=
ination notice arbitration notice, political  force majuere and non payment=
 of rebate of Rs 401 crore by the DPC to Maharashtra State Electricity Boar=
d (MSEB) for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on Jan=
uary 28, would be referred to the Merc for its consideration and ruling. Ac=
cording to sources, this would  defer the proposed proceedings on arbitrati=
on notices served by the DPC, as these proceedings are  likely to commence =
within a month.

"The idea of referring these disputes arisen between the MSEB and DPC is wi=
th an objective to buy time, as well as transfer legal battles on the India=
n soil," a senior minister said. He added that the DPC, would have to under=
go the Merc route and thereby it could go on challenging its orders in the =
Bombay High court and thereafter in the Supreme Court. Sources said that th=
e DPC's move to serve PTN, was unwarranted especially when the MSEB has not=
 defaulted on the payment of monthly bills, neither it had expressed intent=
 in this regard. MSEB and state government, whose stand has been backed by =
the Centre, have justified the rebate claim made by the MSEB, for misdeclar=
ation and default on the availability of power. Both state government and M=
SEB have also refuted the DPC's allegations, regarding the political  inter=
ference and have said that MSEB was not entitled to make the payment of Dec=
ember (Rs 102  crore) and January (Rs 111 crore) bills, as it could be adju=
sted against the rebate payment by DPC.

Cat amongst the pigeons
Maharashtra's debacle over Enron's Dabhol project seems to have set the cat=
 amongst the pigeons. Karnataka has decided to review as many as 11 private=
 power projects. It seems to have suddenly realised that it, too, may be be=
ing taken for a ride and wants to see if it can get independent power produ=
cers (IPPs) to lower their tariffs. Fresh protests have been heard, meanwhi=
le, against the likely cost of power from the Maheshwar hydel project in Ma=
dhya Pradesh. And a fracas has developed in Orissa between Gridco and an IP=
P. If anyone thought that the path to privatising the power basis would be =
either smooth or easy, he had better think again. But 10 years down the roa=
d from the time privatisation of electricity was first thought of, have any=
 lessons been learnt? Given the amazing features of the Dabhol power purcha=
se agreement (PPA), suspicion about the nature of private power deals would=
 be entirely warranted, as only the na?ve would now hold that these PPAs do=
 not require a second look.=20
Recent experience with India's politicians suggests that either out of igno=
rance or just plain knavery, but also because of the reality of commercial =
risk, the IPPs may well have walked away with more than their fair due. The=
re is a problem, of course, in determining what this is. But as the Enron P=
PA shows, it is possible to sneak in all sorts of hidden costs that have th=
e ultimate effect of raising the tariff payable by the purchaser. Take the =
Karnataka example. The cost of thermal power (mostly) from the six stations=
 of the Raichur thermal power station, is around Rs 2.20 per unit, and the =
cost of central purchase is about Rs 1.46 per unit. The purchase from one i=
ndependent power producer (IPP), Jindal Tractabel Power, is at Rs 2.60 a un=
it.=20
It is true that power from new projects will cost more than power from olde=
r ones. The question is, how much more. On average, power from the coal-bas=
ed public sector plants costs around Rs 2 to generate. The cost of power fr=
om the newest amongst them, such as the NTPC one at Simhadri, is around Rs =
1.80 per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, the IPPs are charging over Rs 2.40. Th=
e key issue, therefore, is to agree on how much more the power from an IPP =
should cost. There is good reason why private power producers will budget f=
or higher returns. They see the risks flowing from poor distribution system=
s, high transmission/distribution losses, the poor financial condition of t=
he electricity boards, and the chaotic power tariff structure, and realise =
that entering a minefield such as this must only be for higher than normal =
reward.=20
The official response of offering insurance against system risk, through co=
unter-guarantees and escrow accounts, has now run into a dead end. What rem=
ains now is to do the obvious thing: reform the distribution and tariff str=
uctures and introduce greater commercial sense into the power sector. If th=
ese are done, and if the electricity boards and governments have learnt how=
 to negotiate, then private investment in electricity generation can come a=
t lower cost. If these are not done, prepare for either no electricity or v=
ery costly electricity.=20

The 'base load' question=20
This second extract from the Godbole Committe report highlight serious flaw=
s in the basic design of the Dabhol project
MSEB, in its affidavit in the Ramdas Nayak case, affirmed that: "protracted=
 negotiations and discussions took place between both the parties during th=
e period August 1992 to December 1993". As a consequence of these negotiati=
ons, "at 90% power availability the estimated total tariff in 1997 prices, =
at an exchange rate of Rs. 32/- =3D $1 and distillate price of $4.3/mmbtu w=
ill be Rs. 2.40/kwH". The quality of these "protracted negotiations" can be=
 judged by comparing this rate of 7.5 cents per kwH with 7.3 cents per kwH =
in the original MoU Term Sheet and more significantly, with the price "prop=
osed by Enron" two months later in the Power Purchase Agreement: Heads of T=
erms, Draft 4, dated 29 August 1992 (revised), where the tariff structure w=
as to be designed to achieve an "all-in price to MSEB of 6.91 cents per kwH=
 (at 1996 prices) assuming a natural gas cost...of US $4.91/mmbtu." That is=
, at the start of negotiations, at a higher assumed fuel price, the all-in =
cost was lower by nearly 0.6 cents per unit (an annual outgo of over $100 m=
illion). The protracted negotiations seem to have led to an increase in pri=
ce.=20
MSEB and the state government averred repeatedly before the Courts that thi=
s project was intensively negotiated over a long period of 16 months and be=
st possible terms were obtained from the foreign party, namely, Enron. The =
very first document signed by MSEB with Enron and GE was the MOU, which was=
 signed within 5 days of their coming to India and within 3 days of coming =
to Mumbai. The Enron team first arrived in New Delhi on 15 June 1992 and th=
e MOU was signed on 20 June 1992. Though the MOU makes it clear that it is =
not legally binding on the parties, it sets the tone for future negotiation=
s of the project. Interestingly, all the main features of the project have =
basically remained the same throughout the so-called intensive negotiations=
 that ensued after the signing of the MOU.=20
MSEB agreed, in principle, to a LNG based project of 2000 MW capacity being=
 put up as a base load station without going into the question of the absor=
ption of this large power in the Maharashtra system and the cost implicatio=
ns thereof. It agreed to orders for the plant and equipment being placed on=
 GE without going into the comparative costs thereof and without bothering =
about the international competitive bidding. The contract was to be denomin=
ated in dollars, payable in rupees. The only major difference was that the =
power venture was to include the power plant but not gas facilities, which =
were to be owned in a separate fuel venture, to be negotiated separately. S=
ubsequently, this separation was offered as a concession in the renegotiati=
on of the project in 1995 but later on retained as a part of the project to=
 avoid a fresh clearance from CEA.=20
As mentioned above, DPC has been designed as a base load project, right fro=
m inception. The World Bank in its assessment of the project, in 1993, poin=
ted out that "Dispatch[ing] the plant as a base load unit at 80-85% minimum=
 plant factor...would prevent the operational flexibility of a combined cyc=
le plant". ... Maharashtra and MSEB need load-following capacity, not for m=
eeting base load but for peak and intermediate load. The situation was the =
same in 1993. It appears that the Planning Commission, at the CEA meeting h=
eld to consider the project, also observed that from a "system operation po=
int of view it would perhaps be advantageous to consider setting up of pump=
ed storage schemes in the Western region" and that "The backing down of the=
 existing thermal generation capacity in Maharashtra due to this new capaci=
ty addition would imply heavy additional economic costs imposed on the powe=
r system of MSEB".=20
Furthermore, it appears that at the same meeting one of the representatives=
 of CEA observed that as "per the studies conducted by CEA, Dabhol CCGT pla=
nt was not the least cost option...MSEB had other less costly options such =
as Kaparkheda Unit 3 & 4 (2X210MW), Kaparkheda-Unit 5 & 6 (2x250MW), Unred =
TPS-1000 MW, but these schemes were in the preliminary stages." The Committ=
ee would like to point out at this stage that if MSEB had made efforts to s=
eriously pursue these projects, they might not have remained in their "prel=
iminary stages". Regardless of these apprehensions, the CEA found the techn=
ical aspects of the scheme "to be generally in order". GoM went ahead with =
the project as designed. Even though the execution of Phase-II was deferred=
, the Phase I project continued to be considered as a base load project, an=
d not as an intermediate load project, as evidenced by the calculation of t=
ariff at 90% PLF.=20
If a lower level of dispatch was contemplated, as would be the case for a p=
roject designed to meet intermediate loads, the estimated PLF would have be=
en lower and consequently, the associate tariff would have been higher, sin=
ce the same fixed costs would have been spread over a smaller base. The Com=
mittee is of the opinion that MSEB and GoM erred seriously, based on inform=
ation available at that time, in proceeding with DPC as a base load project=
, even when it's capacity was reduced to 695 MW. It has been argued that th=
ere were pending applications for power at that time. The World Bank in the=
ir evaluation, considered this and rejected the argument because it was not=
 demonstrated that the load was additional to normal growth, that consumers=
 were willing to pay a higher price as would be needed for LNG power (indee=
d, its surveys of willingness to pay showed otherwise), that they were will=
ing to defer their demand until DPC came up and whether the load in questio=
n was from continuous process industries, justifying a 90% PLF.=20
As the World Bank noted, "under (MSEB's) assumption industrial load would d=
ouble, i.e. grow at an average rate of about 20% for 4 years, compared to C=
EA's already respectable 8% average annual growth." As it happened, even CE=
A's growth rate did not materialise ....Industrial consumption has hardly g=
rown in the past few years.... The attitude of the CEA in according clearan=
ce to this scheme is also questionable, especially given the record of disc=
ussions in the meeting. Nowhere in the summary record are the issues relati=
ng to the technical design of the project effectively addressed and yet, it=
 was decided that the technical aspects were "generally in order".=20
A loss-reduction fairy tale=20
What happens if MSEB actually buys all the Phase II power? Can it really af=
ford it if the realisations are rationalised and losses are reduced? To und=
erstand this it is useful to do two simple exercises, each of which has thr=
ee parts.=20
In the first part of the first exercise, all of MSEB's power purchase is fr=
om DPC at the relatively reasonable rate of Rs. 4.10 per unit (as submitted=
 by DPC to the Committee), but realisations for existing consumers (grouped=
 into four broad groups of HT [high tension] and Commercial consumers. Bulk=
 Supply Consumers, Agricultural Consumers and Domestic and Other Consumers)=
 remain at current levels. This leads to a deficit of Rs. 4293 crore. In th=
e second part, agricultural realisations are increased to Rs. 1.00 per unit=
 and domestic realisations are adjusted so that MSEB's expenses are fully m=
et (without any return). This implies a raise in average domestic realisati=
ons of 193% to Rs. 5.27 per unit from the current realisations of Rs. 1.80 =
per unit. Finally, in the third part, we ask what if there is an overnight =
conversion of 10,000 MU of commercial losses into paying consumers (at an a=
verage realisations of Rs. 2.75) i.e. an overnight additional revenue of Rs=
. 2750 crore? Domestic realisations would still have to be increased by 58%=
. So, the problem therefore is not just that of high commercial losses, tho=
ugh it is a major problem. Even if the losses were fixed in the manner abov=
e, there would remain a deficit of Rs. 1543 crore. The problem is that ther=
e is not enough demand to absorb this power.=20
In the second part of this exercise, we project an overnight increase in de=
mand of 13,350 MU, equal to DPC Phase II, which is distributed evenly acros=
s all non-agricultural consumers, implying an overnight increase in consump=
tion of 36%. If realisations stay at existing levels, this decreases the de=
ficit to Rs. 3273 crore. In the second part, agricultural realisations are =
again increased to Rs.. 1.00 per unit and domestic realisations are adjuste=
d so that MSEB's expenses are fully met (without any return as before). Thi=
s implies a lower raise of 117% in average domestic tariffs. In the third p=
art, as before, there is an overnight conversion of 10,000 MU of commercial=
 losses into paying consumers, i.e. an overnight additional revenue of Rs..=
 2750 crore. In this case, finally, domestic realisations do not have to be=
 increased.=20
This implies that if HT and Commercial realisations remain at their current=
 excessively high levels, agricultural realisations rise to Re. 1.00 per un=
it, i.e. double the existing tariff, and 10,000 MU of commercial losses is =
converted into paying consumption at an average realisations of Rs.. 2.75. =
non-agricultural consumption rises by 36% and agricultural consumption does=
 not grow then it is possible for DPC to be absorbed without any increase i=
n domestic realisations. However, even this fairy tale is too good to last.=
 As time goes on, DPC tariff will rise and if it were Rs.. 4.50 instead of =
Rs.. 4.10, then domestic realisations would have to be increased by 26%.
