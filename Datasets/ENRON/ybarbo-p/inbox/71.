Greg/Rick-
Per our discussion, here are the inventory projection numbers given the various scenarios.  I think the overall strategy should be to buy as much Cabot LNG at this year's prices as possible with the price increase we will see next year (current projection for commodity charge is $4.83 vs $3.48 this year) while still looking at optimising through diversion.

 

Give me a call to discuss,
Dan
