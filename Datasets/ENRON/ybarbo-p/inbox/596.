Laura,

	Would you please re-path this contract/invoice so the system will pick up the 1-part flag?  Thanks!

Dennis just changed the flag last week.  It should now be creating a credit for commodity.

TK called and says PNM K# 27606 is a 1-part deal, is flagged as a 1-part in CBS but isn't creating a credit for commodity... any ideas?
