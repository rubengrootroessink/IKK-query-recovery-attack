 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]  Tuesday, April 10, 2001           Dear continental.com =
customer,   We're Changing To Serve You Better This Thursday evening April =
12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our web reservations system, e=
Service Online.  This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the r=
eservations platform is 100% provided by Continental.  We're making this ch=
ange because our current product, while good, will not provide us with the =
flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arran=
ging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.   Here=
's What You Need To Know:  Your Profile Your profile information, including=
 your username (pybarbo) and password, has been transferred to the new vers=
ion of eService Online.  To protect your personal information, credit card =
information has not been transferred.  You will need to update your profile=
.  Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April 1=
2th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you wil=
l need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not aff=
ect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not vi=
ew them in the new eService Online.    Signing In To enhance security, you =
will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase f=
lights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have =
your password e-mailed to you  click here .  You are strongly encouraged to=
 sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold O=
ption To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the "Ho=
ld for 24 hours" option.  The "Hold" option will not be available between A=
pril 10 and April 12.   Here Are Some of the Changes  More eTicketing The n=
ew eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (eT=
ickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by No=
rthwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlin=
es (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages for=
 easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled El=
ite-status available seating.   Pricing  The pricing system is enhanced to =
deliver more current fares based on your selection of either "Search By Low=
est Fares" or "Search By Schedule."  We also added a gold star to denote "c=
ontinental.com promotional fares," so you know for certain when you receive=
 a discounted, online-only airfare.   Customer Service  Our customer servic=
e is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all suppo=
rt for online inquiries and reservations services.   While we've made a num=
ber of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, on=
 the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These changes lay the =
foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  We=
 welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedback=
 from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.  Overall, we're=
 confident that you will appreciate the changes and improvements and look f=
orward to continuing to serve you in the future.  Sincerely, Continental Ai=
rlines Inc.   This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e-=
mail as a registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in s=
ervice.  If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscrib=
e please reply to: eservice@coair.com   This E-mail was sent to: paul.y'bar=
