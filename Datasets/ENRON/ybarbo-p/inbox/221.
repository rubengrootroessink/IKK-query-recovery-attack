n the US energy major. "PTN or no PTN. In June first week, MSEB will slap o=

Dabhol project suffers $400-m cost overruns, Anto T Joseph=20

AS IF the current dispute with the Maharashtra government was not enough, t=
he Dabhol project now has to deal with cost overruns. The Enron-promoted Da=
bhol Power Company has experienced a cost overruns to the tune of $400 mill=
ion, taking the total project cost to $3.3 billion. DPC, which issued a pre=
liminary termination notice to Maharashtra State Electricity Board on Satur=
day (May 19), is in a fix as both domestic and offshore lenders have refuse=
d to increase their exposure in the controversial power project, the larges=
t-ever foreign direct investment, so  far, in India. After Indian lenders s=
topped disbursements as a fallout of a long payment crisis, DPC is believed=
 to have scouted for foreign debt, albeit unsuccessfully, to maintain the d=
ebt-equity status quo at 70:30 ratio. DPC's issuance of PTN has compounded =
the problem. According to the power purchase agreement between the MSEB and=
 Enron, issuing a PTN would mean fixing a deadline of six months for pullin=
g the final plug on the project. "As of now, the FIs have held back $250-mi=
llion debt to the project. Once the PTN is served, DPC can't expect lenders=
 to make any more disbursements, and it has almost sealed the fate of the p=
roject," said a financial institution source.=20

While the 740-mw phase I is operational, the second phase of 1,144 mw was e=
xpected to be fully operational by the year-end. One unit of 740 mw (part o=
f the second phase) is undergoing trial-runs, and was expected to be commer=
cially operational in June. Sources said the huge cost overruns had been a =
major deterrent in project completion. Worried by the mounting payment defa=
ults, the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor of the=
 project -- Bechtel - is  believed to have threatened to pull out of the pr=
oject by  mid-June. The cost overruns stem from devaluation of the rupee vi=
s-a-vis the dollar and an increase in equipment cost. Indian FIs are now wa=
ry of further cost overruns owing to the delay in project execution. "India=
n FIs, who have contributed 40 per cent of $2.9 billion (earlier project co=
st), had refused to take more exposure.

DPC was forced to approach foreign lenders for raising funds to cover the c=
ost overruns. They have also taken a negative stand," said sources. The ABN=
-AMRO led offshore consortium is believed to have refused to contribute any=
 more debt to the project. The only way out for DPC is for the promoters to=
 increase  their equity contributions. Proportionately, Enron, which holds =
around 65 per cent in DPC, will have to shell out a  major chunk if this we=
re to happen. DPC's move to issue PTN has considerably irked Indian institu=
tions. Lenders were planning to cast a confidential vote on PTN this week. =
However, armed with the required mandate from offshore lenders, DPC went ah=
ead and issued the PTN.

DPC faces fresh Rs 400-crore penalty

 more Rs 400-crore penalty  on the DPC for mis-declaration and default on t=

EB sources said here Sunday. The proposed penalty is in the wake of DPC's i=
nability to provide power on February 12 and March 13, as per MSEB's demand=
 in the stipulated time of three hours (according to the   power purchase a=
greement (PPA) guidelines), they said. "In fact, we will pay the Rs 139-cro=

ary 28 fell in the first cycle, while the other two instances fell in the n=
ext cycle of February-May, a bill for which would be prepared and despatche=
d to the DPC in June, MSEB sources said.

Earlier, MSEB had slapped a Rs 401-crore penalty on DPC for "not generating=
" required power to meet the demand on January 28. DPC had yesterday issued=
 a PTN to MSEB,  saying the loss-making board, the state  government and th=
e Centre had failed to meet their contractual obligations and therefore it =
had  no choice "but to issue the notice." Meanwhile, DPC is also attending =
the next meeting of the Godbole panel on Wednesday. =20
=20
Enron India managing director Wade Cline confirmed that the power company h=
as not  closed its doors to negotiate a satisfactory  solution. But state g=
overnment officials said the onus of finding a workable solution is now wit=
h the Centre, which has to spell out its position on the  offtake of power =
from phase-II of the project. The Central government nominee on the Godbole=
  committee, AV Gokak, is to attend deliberations  for the first time this =
Wednesday. State officials attach great importance to his presence as he is=
 likely to spell out Centre's view on the whole affair. A state official to=
ld Business Standard that DPC had indicated its willingness to renegotiate =
the tariff structure at its first presentation beforethe Godbole Committee.=
 The sole thorn now is the offtake of power from phase-II of the project. M=
aharashtra Chief Minister has said on Saturday that the state cannot afford=
 to draw power from phase-II.

So the issue is now to clear the decks for third parties to buy out power f=
rom the second part of the project. "This is an issue that is in the Centre=
's realm, though there have been some statements that no central utility is=
 in a position to buy power from  Dabhol. DPC is willing to talk to lower i=
ts tariffs  but we are not in a position to buy any of it even though we ar=
e contractually bound to buy it. Sothe solution lies in allowing others to =
buy it," the official said. A senior MSEB official also denied the Board  w=
as planning to issue a counter termination notice to the DPC.=20

MSEB plans to dispute PTN validity ,   Sanjay Jog

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), in a bid to put up a brave =
front, proposes to dispute the validity of the Preliminary Termination Noti=
ce (PTN) served by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and take up the issue at =
the dispute resolution panel. Simultaneously, MSEB has denied that it has r=
epudiated the power purchase agreement (PPA) as claimed by the DPC. MSEB ha=
s also rejected DPC's claim over its failure to meet contractual obligation=
s. The MSEB, after consulting the state advocate general, lawyers and the s=
tate government, may serve a notice with respect to the dispute over the PT=
N to the DPC, as per clause 20.2 of the PPA.

According to the provisions of clause 20.2, a dispute would be referred to =
the dispute resolution panel comprising of one or two high-level representa=
tives from the MSEB and the DPC. DPC had earlier served a notice with respe=
ct to disputes over the payment of arrears towards the November and Decembe=
r bills and interest thereon on January 25 this year. Accordingly, a disput=
e  resolution. MSEB plans to dispute PTN validity panel comprising Enron In=
dia managing director K Wade Cline and MSEB accounts member A Krishna Rao w=
as set up. Although the panel had held a series of meetings, it failed to a=
rrive at an acceptable solution. MSEB sources told The Financial Express th=
at it cannot accept the PTN at this point of time, especially when the rene=
gotiation process had been launched. Further, according to MSEB, it had not=
 defaulted, neither had it avoided the payment of bills, but for certain di=
sputes and thus, the PTN is disputed.

MSEB sources said that if the DPC rejects its claim on disputes over PTN, t=
hen it was prepared to fight it out at the arbitration. "However, it needs =
to be legally studied whether, at a time, how many cases could be referred =
to arbitration. In fact, DPC has already initiated arbitration by serving n=
otices to the Centre on April 4 and to the Maharashtra government and the M=
SEB on April 10 over the non-payment of the December 2000 and January bills=
," these sources added. The MSEB reiterated that the outstanding amount of =
the December bill (Rs 102 crore) and the January bill (Rs 111 crore) is not=
 payable. Instead, it claimed that the DPC, inter alia, is entitled to pay =
Rs 401.6 crore to the MSEB towards rebate charged for "misdeclaration and d=
efault on the availability of power on January 28." The disputes and differ=
ences have cropped up with regard to this payment and the same has been ref=
erred to the arbitration and the pending resolution. The MSEB said that pen=
ding the said resolution as to whether the amount is "payable" to MSEB by  =
the DPC, the latter cannot expect the payment of December and January bills=
 by the MSEB.

Govt, MSEB keen to probe role of IDBI in issue of Dabhol PTN,  Sanjay Jog

The Maharashtra government and the  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MS=
EB) are curious to know   the role played by the Indian rupee lenders' cons=
ortium leader Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) in the issuance o=
f  preliminary termination notice (PTN) by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). =
The sources in Mantralaya and MSEB told The Financial Express that if Indus=
trial Development Bank of India, which has provided a guarantee of Rs 3,000=
 crore to dollar loans and also lent Rs 1,780 crore for Dabhol phase-I and =
II, along with offshore lenders has voted in favour of authorising DPC to i=
ssue PTN to MSEB, then it  must have received blessings from the BJP-led go=
vernment at the  Centre. The Centre's nod is a must as IDBI is still a stat=
e-run organisation.

If Industrial Development Bank of India, which had voted against the propos=
al to authorise Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for issuing PTN =
at DPC's board meeting held in London on April 25, has opposed the PTN  dec=
ision, then it should be questioned as according to the agreement between D=
PC and its lenders,  the preliminary termination notice cannot be issued if=
 a single 'secured creditor' voted against it. The sources are of the view =
that if IDBI has remained consistent and opposed the decision on issuance o=
f PTN, then the validity of the issuance of PTN would be questioned on the =
basis of a lending agreement between various lenders and DPC. "We are keen =
to know whether IDBI has opposed this move," the sources said.

Further, the sources said the IDBI should have blocked the move to issue th=
e PTN as the high stakes of Indian financial institutions and banks have be=
en involved in the Dabhol project. However, sources of Indian Financial Ins=
titutions (IFI) have contradicted the state government and MSEB and said th=
at offshore lenders control the decision relating to termination of the pow=
er purchase agreement (PPA) "if they hold at least 4 per cent of the total =
principal debt." "Overseas Private Investment Corporation, USA alone or the=
 rest of Dabhol phase-I foreign banks group have such  requisite voting per=
centage. In this situation, if they issue the consent to DPC for serving pr=
eliminary termination notice, consent from other lenders including IFIs wou=
ld not be necessary," sources added. The sources said that the IFIs, which =
have a massive exposure of Rs 5,154 crore, have no protection of the Govern=
ment of India counter guarantee. However, the Dabhol phase-I offshore lende=
rs are protected under the guarantee of the Maharashtra government and the =
Centre's counter guarantee.

Maharashtra working on ways to avoid Enron penalty=20

Maharashtra is working out a strategy to avoid paying huge damages to US po=
wer major Enron if its subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), axes its=
 power purchase agreement with the state electricity board.Chief Minister V=
ilasrao Deshmukh, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar and =
senior                                         bureaucrats have been huddle=
d in discussions with legal experts since DPC issued a pre-termination noti=
ce on the  board on Saturday. "The governments of Maharashtra and India wou=
ld face  lawsuits to the tune of Rs 170 billion," an official said. With Ne=
w Delhi providing counter guarantees for the project, it threatens to be a =
liability for the entire country.

Maharashtra has already begun to cover its flanks by charging DPC with prov=
iding insufficient services and installing substandard equipment to prevent=
 its facility from generating 95 percent power. A penalty of Rs 4.01 billio=
n was slapped on the company last month for not providing power to MSEB at =
a notice of three hours. A notice for a similar penalty would be sent in Ju=
ne as well, officials here said.MSEB officials have been quoted as saying t=
hat no bills would be paid to the company after the April bill of Rs 1.39 b=
illion. The bills for the remaining months would be adjusted against the pe=
nalty. With Enron hardening its stand, it is possible the company could sto=
p power supply from June, they indicated.Although the DPC has issued the pr=
eliminary termination notice, the actual process of terminating the PPA cou=
ld take as long as six months. "This initiates the process of terminating t=
he power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra State  Electricity Board (=
MSEB)," DPC said in a statement.Simultaneously, it said it was open to "con=
structive" negotiations on the issue.

The DPC is demanding that the Central government participate in the negotia=
tions between Enron and MSEB or provide credit support to purchasers of its=
 power as a pre-condition to talks. "While a lasting and feasible solution =
to this issue may be possible, it can only occur if the parties contractual=
ly bound to purchase DPC power (MSEB with guarantees from state and central=
 government) are willing to either purchase themselves or find "other" cred=
itworthy entities," the company said. Enron also said the report of committ=
ee on renegotiating the power purchase agreement should not be the basis fo=
r discussions.

The stalemate in the $3 billion project follows the Maharashtra government =
disputing payments for power  purchased by the MSEB from the DPC. The gover=
nment cleared its February and March outstanding of Rs 1.13 billion and Rs =
1.34 billion respectively but under protest. The DPC currently produces 740=
 MW of power. This will go up to 2,184 MW when the second phase of the proj=
ect goes on stream later this year. (IANS)

With the Dabhol Power Company issuing a pre-termination notice, it should n=
ow be reasonably certain that Enron, the controversial power project, will =
wind up its operations in Maharashtra. It is indeed doubtful that the influ=
ential political lobby which ushered the US giant in amid great controversy=
 will be able to do much this time. The series of renegotiations have faile=
d, last minute attempts to humour Mr Sharad Pawar have failed and the lobby=
 which had helped Enron to hype its deal has been surprisingly silent. In t=
he short run, the state will have to pay a price for the withdrawal; in fac=
t, Enron was hoping that precisely that will  happen and the government wil=
l develop cold feet.=20

But with the Centre now washing its hands off the deal, any amount of econo=
mic "diplomacy" and bargaining is unlikely to succeed. As the curtain comes=
 down on one of India's most  controversial deals involving a multinational=
 corporation, it is  time that the matter is looked at afresh. This does no=
t mean that the conscious project be reviewed. What it does mean that the e=
xperts who for various reasons opposed the project in the first place shoul=
d be consulted by the state government. At the same time, Mr Deshmukh shoul=
d ensure that those who have been votaries of the project do not become vic=
tims of recrimination. Six months that have been stipulated for a last-ditc=
h attempt to save a project which promised much, can have meaning only if E=
nron is willing to come down from its high horse. But as reports from its p=
arent country amply show, Enron is trying to woo US lawmakers in an era of =
deregulation.

Energy executives of Enron spent close to 30 minutes with Mr Dick Cheney, a=
 privilege which essentially exemplifies the importance of being Enron. But=
 this importance should not be overstretched, and a large section in the In=
dian power establishment thinks so. Enron wields no magic wand, but its lea=
ding status as a power-sector giant is not to be doubted. Be that as it may=
, its Indian experience has been a far from happy one. Political opportunis=
m may have queered the Indian picture, but it's primarily the Enron strateg=
y to first target and then control markets. Its "insurgent" strategy someti=
mes works. At other times, it does not. In the Indian experience, it has no=
t quite worked. The story that the friends of Enron had deliberately circul=
ated- that other MNCs will think twice before investing in India if Enron f=
ails, have been proved unfounded. Enron may have registered phenomenal grow=
th over the years, but that by itself was never any guarantee that its Indi=
an bid would too, especially with conflicting political positions dogging i=
ts high  cost per unit power.

The end of Enron is by no means the end of the world. A few comparable exam=
ples would empirically sustain the fact that it is not impossible to live w=
ithout Enron, whatever its high-profile supporters would suggest. The Mahar=
ashtra government needs Central and overall support in facing the crisis it=
 is in, though the support may merely be a moral one. The late Rangarajan K=
umaramangalam used to bemoan the  absence of a realistic and long-term poli=
cy for the power sector.The unhappy Enron example should make the Central a=
nd state governments to thrash out a cohesive, constructive policy. At the =
peak of summers, the absence of a genuine policy further complicates infras=
tructural and other constraints. That is such an elementary fact anyway.

he state on the verge of bankruptcy. "Apart from being a union minister, he=
 has a moral responsibility to-wards Maharashtra. Moreover, the second phas=
e of Enron was also approved by the then Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party g=
overnment. So he cannot wash his hands off when the state is heading toward=
s serious problems," said Mr. Bhujbal.=20

Mr. Bhujbal, who also holds the state home portfolio, said that central gov=
ernment intervention had become all the more necessary as it stood as a gua=
rantor in the agreement. Meanwhile, in a counter to the arm-twisting tactic=
s of the DPC, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has planned to take t=
he  company to court in lieu of them seeking compensation for loss  incurre=
d due to inadequate power supply.=20
