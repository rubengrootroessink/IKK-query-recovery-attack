The NYMEX forward curve on our website seems to be having trouble getting curves past 3 years, but the curve does exist beyond that and is available.  We are currently working on improving our web based curve fetch.  If you need the curves past three years ill be more than happy to pull them for you.

To answer your second question, the basis curve "NGI - PGE/TOPOCK" is not a basis point that we currently have any positions in.  From what I gathered if we do make a position it would be more likely to be at PGE-City gate (NGI - PGE/CG).  As in other basis curves in the system, it all depends on if we have positions on those points or not.  I believe someone in Structuring would be more likely to answer those questions for you.  If i can be of any further assistance please let me know.

Re Page:
Comments: Is the NYMEX forward curve available past 3 years? I see where to get it for 3 years but not beyond that.

Is the Basis curve "NGI-PGE/TOPOCK" in this system the same as the forward curve that the traders of that basis use to mark their books to market? What about the other basis cuves in this system?
