Enron to relocate DPC managers abroad, Anto T Joseph=20

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, May 11, 2001
DPC-MSEB slugfest -- Needed a conciliatory approach , Uttam Gupta=20

THE ROW between Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC) and the MSEB/Maharashtra Gov=
ernment/Union Government has reached a flashpoint. At a DPC board meeting i=
n London, the Managing Director and President/CEO were authorised to take a=
 decision to wind up the project at an ``appropriate time''. Though the DPC=
 team agreed to meet the Godbole Committee on re-negotiating the terms of t=
he Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), things are far from clear.=20

The project's termination will place huge payment liabilities on the MSEB/M=
aharashtra Government/Centre by way of compensation claims (running into se=
veral thousand crore rupees), the aggravation of the power deficit in the S=
tate, increased NPAs in financial institutions, adverse impact on companies=
/units with business links with DPC, loss of employment and attendant socia=
l problems. It may be recalled that DPC was the only project, among the eig=
ht fast track IPPs that has seen the light of day. If this is also wound up=
, it will have a debilitating effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) whi=
ch has already suffered on account of policies and delays in various approv=
als/clearances. Enron is currently implementing an ambitious project to set=
 up a terminal for handling imported LNG. Apart from replacing naphtha in D=
PC-I, this will be used as fuel in phase II which is likely to be commissio=
ned next year. The project involves import of 5 million tonnes of LNG, 2 mi=
llion tonnes of which will be used by DPC I and II and the remainder will b=
e made available to other projects, including the fertiliser sector.=20

Due to a severe shortage of domestic gas and the exorbitant cost of other f=
uels such as naphtha, imported LNG is a favourite considering its low cost.=
 In the fertiliser sector, the ERC has recommended that all naphtha and fue=
l-oil-based plants switch to imported LNG to improve cost-competitiveness i=
n the emerging liberalised environment. LNG will also help gas-based units =
feeling the pinch of short supply domestically. Against this backdrop, if t=
he DPC power project is terminated, a major source of guaranteed offtake of=
 LNG on a long-term basis will disappear from the scene. For, it is not lik=
ely that the LNG project will be taken up. This will affect the overall ava=
ilability of LNG, hurting the fortunes of industries such as fertilisers an=
d power. The genesis of the present crisis lies in the high cost of power s=
upplied by DPC and the MSEB's inability to pay its bills. It is the inevita=
ble outcome of a cost plus system of power tariff -- both with respect to t=
he fixed and the variable component -- incorporated in the PPA. The MSEB/Ma=
harashtra Government signed the deal with eyes open and the Centre also pro=
vided a  counter-guarantee!=20

Having consciously become a party to the deal, things need to be taken in s=
tride. It would be imprudent, at this stage, to lay the blame for the conse=
quential problems on DPC/Enron. Unfortunately, our side has adopted a confr=
ontationist attitude, amply reflected in the MSEB's decision to lodge a cla=
im for Rs 401 crore with DPC because the latter could not supply electricit=
y for a  couple of hours in January. Considering that the termination of th=
e Dabhol project will be detrimental to Indian interests, a conciliatory at=
mosphere should replace the present mood of mutual bitterness. The setting =
up of a committee on re-negotiating terms with DPC is a good thing. But the=
re is also the need to avoid frequent outbursts, charges/accusations and so=
 on.=20

In the circumstances, the vexatious problem of high cost power should be ap=
proached in two parts. First, we need to carefully assess the role of the M=
SEB/Maharashtra. Second, the need for necessary adjustment/changes in vario=
us charges to reduce the tariff should be impressed upon DPC. Needless to s=
ay, both parties should take that action concurrently in a spirit of mutual=
  accommodation. We need to clearly understand that under the PPA, the fixe=
d charges have to be necessarily paid irrespective of the quantum of power =
drawn by the MSEB. For DPC Phase-I, these are Rs 1,050 crore per annum or R=
s 87.5 crore a month. After the commissioning of Phase-II, the charges will=
 be Rs 3,500 crore per annum or Rs 292 crore a month.=20

Depending on the quantum of the power drawn, the incidence per unit basis w=
ill vary. Thus, at 80 per cent generation capacity of DPC-I, or 5,186 milli=
on units per annum, the fixed charges will be Rs 2.02 per kWh. For both DPC=
-I and II, at 80 per cent load, or 15,067 million units per annum, these wi=
ll work out to Rs 2.32 per kWh. If, on the other hand, the offtake of power=
 is only a third of the generation capacity, or 2,139 million units on an a=
nnualised basis, then for DPC-I the fixed  charges would be Rs 4.91 per kWh=
. Under a similar scenario, with the operation of Phase-II, the per unit in=
cidence would be Rs 5.63 per kWh.=20

DPC-I now uses naphtha as fuel. On the basis of its prevailing price, the v=
ariable cost component works out to about Rs 2.2 per kWh. Together with fix=
ed charges corresponding to drawal at 80 per cent load, the total cost to t=
he MSEB is Rs  4.2 per kWh. However, if the offtake is restricted to a thir=
d, the cost would zoom to Rs 7.1 per kWh. From next year on, the entire pro=
ject would operate on imported LNG. This being cheaper ($3.75 per million B=
TU against about $6 per million BTU for naphtha), the variable cost will go=
 down to Rs 1.3 per kWh. Together with fixed charges at 80 per cent, the to=
tal cost of power will be Rs 3.62 per kWh. In the event only a third of the=
 capacity is drawn, the cost will zoom to Rs 6.93 per kWh. Clearly, it is p=
ossible to contain the cost of power supplied by Dabhol at Rs 3.5-4 per kWh=
 if, the MSEB draws the optimum load. There seems to be no other way of bri=
nging about a meaningful reduction in cost, other than a significant increa=
se in the offtake of electricity by the MSEB from the present low level.=20

The demand-supply scenario for power in Maharashtra justifies the accommoda=
tion of entire supplies from DPC at optimum load. For 2001-02, the total re=
quirement is estimated at 70,127 million units. Supply from MSEB's own gene=
rating stations and sources other than DPC being about 57,000 million units=
, there will still be an uncovered gap of 13,127 million units, which is hi=
gher than  the supply from DPC-I at 80 per cent load. Notwithstanding the a=
bove, if the MSEB is not able to lift power at the optimum load, it is beca=
use its precarious financial health limits its ability to make payments. Th=
is, in turn, is because of supply of electricity to agriculture and househo=
lds at subsidised rates and high transmission and distribution losses  (pow=
er theft). Without tackling these two problems on a war footing, we cannot =
easily come out of the Dabhol imbroglio.=20

Besides yielding benefits by significantly lowering per unit cost, the abov=
e steps  will also help build confidence with DPC, especially considering i=
ts consequential ability to optimally utilise generating capacity. The nego=
tiating committee can then leverage this to seek from DPC a meaningful redu=
ction, particularly in the fixed charges. Under the PPA, all liabilities to=
wards foreign capital -- servicing of loans and return on equity -- are den=
ominated in dollars/forex. In the event of the rupee's depreciation, this a=
utomatically results in the increased burden on the MSEB. This is contrary =
to established business practices the worldover and needs to be rectified b=
y freezing all foreign currency liabilities with reference to the exchange =
rate prevailing at the time of commissioning of the project. Likewise, with=
 fuel cost, efforts should be made to protect the variable component of tar=
iff from the rupee's depreciation. The DPC should be in a position to absor=
b its effect especially considering that the actual fuel consumption is low=
er than the norm used for arriving at variable cost.=20

DPC mounts pressure on lenders to terminate PPA , S Ravindran in Mumbai

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has stepped up pressure on le=
nders to permit it, without further delay, to terminate the power purchase =
agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The co=
mpany has reportedly told the lenders that there should not be any delay in=
 serving the termination notice as the engineering procurement  and constru=
ction (EPC) contractor Bechtel has threatened to pull out of the project on=
 June 11. Bechtel holds a 10 per cent stake in the project.  The lenders ar=
e, however, not yet ready to back DPC's demand.

They are of the opinion that phase two of the project should be completed f=
irst. The MSEB decision to clear the April bill (Rs 139 crore) has also com=
e as a shot in the arm for lenders.  "Financially, phase two is 93 per cent=
 completed while 97 per cent of the physical construction is over. The lend=
ers want the project to be completed without any cost and time overrun. At =
 this juncture, if the PPA termination notice is served, it will preclude a=
ny further disbursements by the lenders," a source familiar with the develo=
pment said. A DPC spokesperson declined to comment on the development. A fu=
lly completed phase two will be in the lenders' interest as they will inher=
it  the project if it is terminated.The lenders have first charge on the as=
sets of DPC. A fully completed project will enable the lenders to find a bu=
yer and secure a better  valuation.=20

Earlier, on April 23 and April 24, DPC had sought the consent of its consor=
tium of lenders at a meeting in London to terminate the PPA. This meeting w=
as held amidst the backdrop of  MSEB defaulting on its payments to DPC and =
 the Centre failing to honour the counter guarantee for the December bill o=
f Rs 102 crore. The meeting witnessed a sharp division in the ranks of the =
domestic and offshore lenders. The offshore lenders were all for backing th=
e DPC  move as their exposure is covered by the Centre's counter guarantee,=
 if the PPA and  project are terminated.

MSEB, state want rebate issue resolved before arbitration, Sanjay Jog

THE state government and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)   h=
ave asked the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) that the question of payment of Rs=
 401.62-crore   rebate should be resolved at the outset before any of the o=
ther arbitrations are proceeded with. The state government and the MSEB in =
their separate replies to an arbitration notice served by the   DPC said th=
at such resolution of the arbitration between the DPC and MSEB regarding pa=
yment of rebate for the misdeclaration and default on the availability of p=
ower on January 28 would "consequently have a substantial and material bear=
ing on the outcome of the other arbitrations."

The state government and MSEB said that the Dabhol power plant had the capa=
bility to ramp up to   a 100 per cent load from a cold start within a perio=
d of 180 minutes. The DPC, by an availability declaration declared its "dec=
lared baseload capacity" to be 657 MW for each hour on January 28,   2001, =
MSEB by a despatch instruction at 3 PM instructed DPC to deliver its final =
declared   baseload capacity of 657 MW from 6 PM.  "However, the actual gen=
eration of power did not achieve the declared baseload capacity within the =
  stipulated period. This failure on the part of DPC and its incapability t=
o adhere to and perform according to the dynamic parameters and operating c=
haracteristic entitled MSEB to the rebate envisaged under the power purchas=
e agreement (PPA)," state government and MSEB said.

They have further said that under the contractual obligations, the DPC is d=
uty bound to compute the   rebate and to duly adjust the amount at the end =
of four months block ending in January, May and September. "The DPC has fai=
led to compute account for and adjust the rebate for the shortfall in decla=
red base load availability on January 28 in its billing statement of Januar=
y 2001. Thus DPC has committed a breach of their contractual obligations by=
 not giving the rebate to MSEB," the state government and MSEB have said in=
 no uncertain terms.

The state government said that the DPC's decision to invoke state guarantee=
 for the outstanding amount of December bill (Rs 102 crore) and January bil=
l (Rs 111 crore) was "baseless, wrongful and unjustified." Moreover, the am=
ounts claimed by DPC towards December and January bills are not due and pay=
able in the present circumstances when disputes and differences have arisen=
 between the DPC and MSEB in regard to the payment of rebate. The state gov=
ernment denied that it has breached any of the obligations arising under th=
e state guarantee, neither has it renounced and repudiated its obligations.=

Offshore lenders to skip Godbole panel meeting today ,   Sanjay Jog

THE representatives from Enron Corp, General Electric, Bechtel from US, off=
-shore lenders and liquified natural gas suppliers from Oman and Abu Dhabi =
will skip the Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee's meeting scheduled to=
day. Instead, the Dabhol Power Company, which has already agreed to appear =
before the Godbole  committee as a matter of courtesy without any intent to=
 submit proposals with respect to tariff reduction, would be represented by=
 the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline, DPC  president and chief e=
xecutive officer Neil McGregor, senior vice-presidents Mukesh Tyagi and San=
jeev Khandekar and chief financial officer Mohan Gurunath, along with a bat=
tery of company lawyers.

Curiously, none of the other DPC board members comprising Enron, General El=
ectric, Bechtel and   foreign lenders will fly down from Houston to partici=
pate at today's meeting. Instead, the offshore and Indian financial institu=
tions would be represented by former executive director of Industrial Devel=
opment Bank of India AG Karkhanis at the meeting. Mantralaya sources told T=
he Financial Express that Friday's meeting would be a ceremonial one as no =
hard  discussions would take place. However, the state government and the M=
SEB have worked out a combined strategy to press for cuts in the Dabhol tar=
iff and equity returns linked to the dollar, and above all, the Centre's in=
tervention for the disposal of Dabhol phase-II.

The state government and MSEB are believed to have said that they were not =
against continuation of its contractual agreement for Dabhol phase-I, provi=
ded the company agrees to rework tariff and share equity earning with the M=
SEB. However, for Dabhol phase-II, the Centre would have to step in and bea=
r liability. In a related development, state chief secretary V Ranganathan =
on Thursday briefed the state governor Dr PC Alexander on the ongoing Dabho=
l crisis at an hour-long meeting. The state has also written a fresh letter=
 to the government, seeking its active participation during renegotiation a=
nd for solving the Dabhol impasse. Mr Ranganathan is believed to have made =
it clear that the state does not require the Dabhol power, except 300 MW or=
 so at present against the contractual agreement for 90 per cent power gene=
rated from the DPC. The chief secretary has also pointed out that the Dabho=
l project, in its present condition, cannot be   sustained by the state gov=
ernment and hence the Centre's assistance is quite essential.

Mr Ranganathan is believed to have stressed the need for a renegotiation wi=
th the DPC to find out   solutions as the burden on account of fixed charge=
 would increase on MSEB from June this year.The liabilities would increase =
from the present Rs 95 crore to Rs 191 crore in June to Rs 238 crore in Oct=
ober and Rs 475 crore in January 2002. The MSEB would have to shell out Rs =
544 crore at 90 per cent plant load factor in January 2002 to DPC. Mr Ranga=
nathan seems to have told the state governor that these levels of liabiliti=
es would be  unbearable for both MSEB and the state government.=20

surface transport, for providing inputs to the re-negotiation group recentl=
y set up by the Maharashtra government to  recast the state electricity boa=
rd's PPA with the DPC. This decision was taken at a recent meeting between =
finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power   minister Suresh Prabhu. This me=
eting was convened to discuss critical issues pertaining to invocation  of =
the Centre's counter-guarantee by the DPC.

According to sources, this inter-ministerial committee would also brief the=
 Central nominee on the  re-negotiation committee. Appointment of Solicitor=
 General Harish Salve as the Central nominee on   the re-negotiation panel =
was likely to be cleared soon and a finance ministry notification to this e=
ffect  was likely to issued by Friday, sources added. Sources also disclose=
d that the finance ministry had turned down the request of the state  gover=

a permanent member of the re-negotiation panel. However, it was agreed that=
 a senior CEA representative  would be part of both the inter-ministerial p=
anel and would also be the Centre's nominee on the  re-negotiation panel.

The re-negotiation panel was set up to carry out discussions with DPC for r=
educing tariff from the 2,184-MW first phase of the Dabhol project. These r=
e-negotiations would mainly relate to the cost of delivered power as also o=

CENTRE REJECTS ENRON'S PROPOSAL

The appointment of third conciliator may deepen the controversy over the En=

 plea for appointment of the third conciliator by London Court of Internati=

jected the DPC proposal and put the view that the third conciliator should =
be appointed by the two conciliators named by the Government of India and D=
PC.

Favouring appointment of an Indian for the job, Centre also rejected the DP=
C demand that the third conciliator should not be a national of India or of=
 the US, officials said, adding that such a stipulation (about nationality)=
 is not absolutely necessary. Finance ministry conveyed to DPC that the app=
ointment of the third arbitrator be left to the two conciliators or be sele=
cted by an institution based in India like the Indian council of arbitratio=
n or the International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution. Maharashtra=
 chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said the views held by DPC on re negotiat=
ing PPA with MSEB would be conveyed to the state government by Godbole comm=
ittee, which is slated to meet US energy major representatives on Friday. M=
r Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state government had empowered the Godbo=
le committee to renegotiate the controversial power purchase agreement on i=
ts behalf with DPC.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government and state electricity boardhave refut=
ed all charges levelled against them by the DPC in separate replies to the =
four international arbitration notices slapped on them by Enron. The replie=
s, which were dispatched to DPC on may eight by the state and MSEB, categor=
ically deny the allegations mooted by the company, official sources said. "=
Instead, it is DPC which has to adjust the amount from the Rs 401 crores pe=
nalty slapped on it by MSEB for its February 28 default," the sources said.=
 The state government, which replied to three notices, including non-compli=
ance of state support agreement and supplemental state support agreement, h=
as said that "since MSEB had already denied DPC's charges over non-payment,=
 the question of the state paying on its behalf did not arise".

Meanwhile, Swadeshi Jagran Manch convenor Ravindra Mahajan said the group w=
ill be holding a seminar in Delhi at the end of May, in which "we will take=
 up the Enron issue with the Central government".

'TALKS WITH ENRON ON TARIFF A FRAUD', Olga Tellis=20

The discussion on tariff charged to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=
 by the Dabhol  Power Company between the renegotiating committee and Enron=
 will be based on  flawed, fraudulent and inflated costs, Centre of Indian =
Trade Unions claimed on Thursday. Enron's former managing director Rebecca =
Mark who negotiated the Dabhol power  project in the early nineties had off=
ered the 10,000 MW liquified natural gas-based  power project with regassif=
ication at 4.9 cents per unit. Dabhol has been charging seven cents, a clea=
r difference of two and a half cents or an additional Rs 2,000 crores per y=
ear. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions which is in possession of a copy of =
this letter questions the very basis on which the renegotiation committee i=
s going to discuss tariff and said it can only be vitiated and can have ser=
ious implications on any negotiations.

Mr Vivek Monteiro, secretary Citu, Maharashtra told The Asian Age that "fra=
udulent and flawed tariff calculations provide the base matrix for corrupti=
on on a scale unprecedented in our nation's history. A one paise increase i=
n Dabhol Power Company Phase II tariff translates into a Rs 17 crores extra=
 earnings. A rupee one difference in tariff translates into Rs 1,700 crores=
 per year. It must be remembered that the power purchase agreement is a 20 =
year contract. So if this renegotiating committee brings down the project s=
ay by Rs 500 crores per year it would still leave a difference between what=
 Dabhol Power Company is charging and  what Ms Mark offered, a difference o=
f more than Rs 2,000 per year, which leaves a lot  of room for corruption."=
 So the issue as the Centre of Indian Trade Unions posts it is  "how can yo=

cannot be negotiated upon," Mr Monteiro said.

Mr Monteiro said the cost of the project is as yet undetermined. The projec=
t does not  have an approved financial package. As per Energy Review Commit=

 does not have any approved financial package. The implications on the powe=

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday, May 11, 2001
Power, populism and lost potential, Ajay Jindal=20

THE CURRENT Enron embroglio throws up two sad points:
firstly, the power sector has achieved precious little in the ten years of =
privatisation; and secondly, it is hard to figure  out how India will ever =
really seriously get into a higher economic growth orbit. Privatisation in =
the power sector was launched with great hopes in the early 1990s. The gove=
rnment realised two things: reliable and sufficient power supply is a prere=
quisite for industrialised economies; and the government on its own was inc=
apable of meeting expected future requirements.=20

India has always been (then and even now) a power deficit  nation. Studies =
constituted by the government in the early 1990s had shown a demand for add=
itional capacity for about 10,000 MW per annum; annual capacity addition by=
  various central and state government organs and PSUs  had generally been =
in the range of 3,000-5,000 MW per annum. Hence, the government figured it =
urgently wanted private sector to come in generation. Numerous schemes were=
 formulated. Liquid fuel based generation " a practice hardly followed anyw=
here in the world " was also designed; these plants come up quickly and gov=
ernment wanted power fast.=20

Larger, conventional projects "some with central government counter-guarant=
ee like the Enron project " were planned as well. The clearance process was=
 simplified. Pit-head based schemes were encouraged and pit-heads found for=
 such projects. Coal import was liberalised for those wanting to import coa=
l. In short, government showed apparent zeal and innovativeness, something =
it is hardly known for. Nothing much has come of any of this. Fast-track, l=
iquid-fuel, pit-head based, or mega power projects " all of these schemes l=
ie by the wayside. Don't get fooled by the long list of projects awarded re=
gulatory clearances or under the process of getting clearances.=20

What finally comes up is the key issue. Actual capacity addition by the pri=
vate sector is less than 6,000 MW in all these years of privatisation. Ther=
e is no improvement in the power supply situation in most states; it has on=
ly worsened in some. The Enron controversy has probably driven the final na=
il in the power privatisation coffin. It is hard to believe that any new gr=
eenfield private project will ever come up for many years to come, particul=
arly if it involves selling to the state electricity boards.=20

Financial closure will be impossible to achieve now as no lending agency or=
 financial investor can be expected to participate. So we are now back to h=
oping that the government sector and NTPC can measure up to the task ahead.=
 The irony is that the government probably under-utilised the capacity addi=
tion potential of some of its own resources while it focused on getting pri=
vate players in. In the latter part of the '90s, the government did realise=
 the going the generation way was the wrong path, improving financial and o=
perational health of distribution was more important. Given India's vast si=
ze, many states and thus  mane SEBs, and muddled politicians, this is a her=
culean  task. Even assuming political opinions were all streamlined, distri=
bution reforms would take at least a decade to play through " remember, tar=
iff rationalisation has to occur. With the reality that political masters w=
ill continue populist policies, it is difficult to figure out when the SEBs=
 will become financially viable. SEB losses are mounting with every year ev=
en now.=20

So there we are, all ready to drive in a car with four flats. With a core i=
nfrastructure sector sinking deeper in the mire (not to mention no progress=
 in certain other infrastructure sectors as well), just how is Indian econo=
my going into a higher growth curve? Unless reliable and cheap infrastructu=
re is in place, Indian  industry will remain uncompetitive except for a few=
 lucky sectors like the knowledge-economy ones. Going into a higher growth =
orbit also needs higher rates of investment, some of which needs to come fr=
om FDI. The Enron issue could also deter some future FDI, for example in po=
wer distribution. A multiple whammy, indeed.=20

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, May 11, 2001
Dabhol: Back to the negotiation table , Dinesh Narayanan=20

MANY turbulent years later, when Enron sits across the negotiating table to=
morrow, several people would remember the day it stepped into the ``liberal=
ised'' India, promising power, growth and greenbacks. They would also remem=
ber 1995, when Ms Rebecca Mark, the high-profile go-getter of Enron, talked=
 out the ``sinking project clear out of the Arabian sea''. Undoubtedly, thr=
oughout the decade it has been here, Enron has shown tremendous tenacity an=
d stamina in completing the Dabhol power project. And now, just as the stac=
ks of the second phase of the project were about to begin spewing smoke, th=
e players are back at the table -- ``let's talk what's wrong''. This time, =
however, Enron makes its ``courtesy visit'' to the Godbole panel knowing fu=
lly well it can afford to talk holding an axe over the project. In 1995, wh=
en the Shiv Sena Government cancelled the DPC project, Enron pulled arbitra=
tion and simultaneously started renegotiating the power purchase agreement =
with the Negotiating Group of the Maharashtra Government. Several``hard bar=
gains'' later, the project was revived with a ``$330-million reduction in c=
apital cost and a 201-MW increase in the gross output''.=20

However, nothing had changed fundamentally and most of the ``problems'' con=
tinued to plague the project. The negotiation details were not available an=
d only a summary report was given. Even though there were protests, and cas=
es filed against the company, the project went on and things quietened for =
a while. That is, till phase I of the plant went on stream and MSEB started=
 paying through its nose for the power purchased (or not purchased). As one=
 anti-Enron activist put it: ``The enormity of the trap fully manifested th=
en.'' Inevitably, the board defaulted and that triggered off another chain =
reaction. It has come a full circle to arbitration, conciliation and negoti=
ation. However, this time around it appears Enron has the upper hand especi=
ally since the damage wreaked will be most on Indian financial institutions=
 and Governments. The financial institutions are going ape because they had=
 committed funds to  the project, not strictly considering its merits but b=
owing to political pressure, say officials. They say that the Government ba=
cking was ``instrumental'' in their taking the exposure. They want the proj=
ect to continue because that is the best way for them to get their money ba=
ck.=20

MSEB is really cheesed off because it is caught between carrying out the ``=
social obligations'' of those in power and the rigours of doing business in=
 the open market. Adding insult to injury are the barbs of being inept and =
unbusinesslike and talk of reform school.In the melee, the Centre -- the on=
e player capable of making any decisive difference to the issue -- has main=
tained more or less a studied silence. It is understood to be reluctant to =
get too deep into the matter for fear of contracting another ``headache''. =
It wants the other three -- the State Government, MSEB and DPC -- to thrash=
 it out among themselves.=20

But they want the Centre to talk shop. Enron does not appear interested in =
hanging around running a multi-billion-dollar power plant, even though it h=
as consistently denied so. It also has not categorically ruled out the sell=
-out option. The end-game is getting more convoluted with all the players c=
linging on to even the pawns. Enron has already said it does not agree with=
 the interim report of  the Energy Review Committee headed by Dr Madhav God=
bole, which had suggested some workable solutions, never mind if they were =
really tough. Enron is hesitant to compromise on its returns, institutions =
cannot reduce interest rates beyond a limit, MSEB is adamant on ``going by =
the book'', and the  Centre is mum. The going is getting tougher...the toug=
h should get going.

Why disgraced Customs chief took 'secret' flight with Enron, Pranati Mehra

CVC probes BP Verma's role in getting DPC import duty cuts,                =
       =20

THE controversy surrounding the Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Project (DPC) =
is taking a new twist. Details of how some Customs officers, including disg=
raced former Customs chief B.P. Verma, allegedly helped the transnational g=
et import duty concessions are trickling out. The role of Verma, former chi=
ef of the Central Board of Excise and Customs who   is in judicial custody,=
 is being investigated by the Central Vigilance Commissioner  for waivers r=
esulting in cheaper imports for DPC's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility.=
 The role of Pune Customs Commissioner C.K. Kaloni is also under scrutiny. =
Kaloni rejected his subordinate officers' objections in extending duty conc=
essions to the LNG facility that DPC was putting together. The subordinate =
officers had taken the stand that the LNG facility is part of  material han=
dling facility and has nothing unique about it to entitle it to duty  benef=
its. Though the recommending authority is the Union Ministry of Petroleum a=
nd Natural Gas, Kaloni allegedly took the support of a Maharashtra Governme=
nt sanction to justify the lower rate of duty.

The Customs department had earlier denied concessions for the DPC's Naphtha=
 SPM (single-point mooring) project on grounds that it was only a material =
handling project. The dispute was before the Commissioner (Appeals) when Ka=
loni allowed the concessions to the LNG project. This and other concessions=
 by the Customs helped the DPC save around Rs 400  crore. Now where does Ve=
rma enter the picture? Last year, Kaloni allegedly interfered in the depart=
ment's efforts to add service charges to the value of the LNG equipment. Ju=
st when the dispute was hotting up, Verma who was then DG, Central Economic=
 Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), and was angling for the post of CBEC chairman,=
 visited Pune, on an invitation from the Confederation of Indian  Industry.

While in Pune, he made a secret visit to the project site in Enron's choppe=
r. There was nothing official about it. Immediately afterwards, Kaloni inst=
ructed that loading of service charges to the value (of the equipment) be s=
topped. Verma was accompanied to the project site by Kaloni and another ret=
ired customs officer. Verma soon became chairman of CBEC. When contacted, J=
immy Mogul, spokesman for DPC, said he did not want to comment on the issue=
. DPC has been constructing the LNG facility for the last two years, includ=
ing a jetty about two kms into the sea. The imported LNG is to be carried i=
n liquid form to the storage tanks through pipelines from the jetty. After =
regassification, it was to be  used at the plant. DPC had made no secret of=
 the fact that only about 40 per cent of the LNG would  be used for the Dab=
hol plant and that the rest would be sold to other customers. Enron's own s=
ubsidiary, MetGas, was setting up the LNG terminals, and  therefore, in eff=
ect, a separate commercial entity was benefiting from theconcessions in the=
 name of the power project.

MSEB workers' agitation against Enron=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board Workers Federation  (MSEBWF), which=
 is affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), has proposed =
to launch an agitation aimed at forcing the US power giant, Enron, to quit =
Maharashtra. MSEBWF vice-president, Mr. A.D. Golandaz disclosed that a cent=
ral executive meeting of the federation will be held today at Kolhapur to  =
finalise plans for the agitation against Enron. The meeting will be preside=
d by the federation president, Mr. A.B. Bardhan.=20

Mr. Golandaz pointed out that MSEBWF was the first to come out against the =
Enron project at Dabhol in 1993, predicting the consequences. It had taken =
the initiative to form the Enron Virodhi Sangarsha Samiti (Maharashtra) whi=
ch has been fighting against the project for the past four years. "What we =
had said about Enron has now come true. It is time that the Maharashtra gov=
ernment tackles over the first phase of the project and hands it over to th=
e MSEB. The agreement with regard to the second phase should be cancelled,"=
 he said, adding that the agreement was totally in favour of Enron.=20

Drawing attention to the fact that the Madhav Godbole Committee has pointed=
 out numerous irregularities in the agreement, Mr. Golandaz suggested condu=
cting a judicial inquiry into the project. "We insist that no compensation =
is payable to Enron in the event of scrapping the deal," he said. Mr. Golan=
daz further pointed out the high cost of Enron's power, which is presently =
Rs. 8 per unit as against MSEB's rate of Rs. 1.40 per unit. He also express=
ed dissatisfaction over chief minister, Mr.Vilasrao Deshmukh's insistence o=
n continuing the project and stressed  that the federation would continue a=
gitating till Enron leaves the  state.

Enron to relocate DPC managers abroad, Anto T Joseph=20

WITH confrontation with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board deepening b=
y the day, Enron is starting the process of re-locating senior officials to=
 its operations in other countries. Company sources said its multinational =
parent is working  towards absorbing manegerial talent at its Indiansubsidi=
ary in its operations abroad. The company is expected to give a choice to i=
ts remaining staff " whether to continue with the company abroad or opt for=
 a golden handshake. Many senior officials currently working with Enron are=
  planning to stay with the company, no matter which country they are re-lo=
cated to. "Enron is a professionally-run company, and tops the chart of the=
 best-run global companies, annually brought out by Fortune. Unfortunately,=
 the company could not pursue its  projects in India, and has decided to fo=
ld up its operations  in the country," said a senior Enron official, who ex=
pects to  be transferred either to Houston or London.=20

The whole process of re-locating the Indian staff is  expected to be comple=
ted within a month or two.  An Enron spokesperson refused to comment on the=
se developments. Company sources also said a new VRS is on the anvil for th=
e Dabhol Power Company staff. The Houston-based energy giant has pulled out=
 of all its existing projects in India except the Dabhol power project, whi=
ch is currently in the thick of controversy. The other group companies " Me=
tgas (which was setting up a liquefied natural gas pipeline in Maharashtra =
), and Enron Broadband Solutions (which was laying an optic  fibre cable ne=
twork across the country) " have already  virtually folded up operations. T=
he other group company Enron Oil & Gas (India) which is  a joint venture be=
tween Reliance and ONGC, is currently in   the process of selling its stake=
.=20

Enron, which had earlier proposed to set up a few more power projects in In=
dia, has already decided to drop these plans, after it ran into a series of=
 payment problems with MSEB. Enron has already got rid of around 50-60 peop=
le by way of a successful voluntary retirement scheme. Enron India now has =
a little over a dozen employees on its rolls. The focus of Enron Corp, whic=
h occupies the seventh position on the Fortune 500 list in terms of revenue=
s (with over $100 bn) has shifted to trading. A lion's share of its turnove=
r came from its trading activities all over the world, especially in the US=
 market.
