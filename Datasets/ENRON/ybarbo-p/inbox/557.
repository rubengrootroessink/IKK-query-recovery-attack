Hello Paul,

My name is Joelene Whittaker and I am a recruiter with STM Associates. DTE Energy, www.dtecs.com/sitemap.html, has retained us to assist them in placing two Director of Sales for Eastern and Western Regions. The Eastern position will be located in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Western position in Denver, Colorado.  Both Director of Sales will report to the Vice President of Sales.

Qualifications of this position include a minimum of 5 years of sales experience and an additional minimum of 2 years experience with a trading company is preferred.  The successful candidate will have a strong understanding of U.S. Coal, Transportation and Electric Utility industries, including coal tolling, marketing and origination functions used in support of coal trading operations.  Solid experience in finding ways to capitalize on opportunities in the coal and transportation business is a must.  A background which includes Senior-level contract negotiations is required.

We are asking for recommendations from coal trading executives within the energy  industry.  Would you take a moment to consider colleagues whose experience fits DTE's profile and who you would deem as a high caliber candidate for the position.  

I appreciate any help you may provide and look forward to hearing from you.  I can be reached at (801)531-6500 or via e-mail jwhittaker@stmassociates.com.

Regards,
Joelene Whittaker
STM Associates
