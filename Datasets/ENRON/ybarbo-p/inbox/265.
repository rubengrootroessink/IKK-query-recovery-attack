December 2001 Loadings)

Dear Roald:

Wayne Perry asked me to forward to you the COU that will be needed for Oman.
I understand that Dan Rogers also transmitted this to you in late December
for your comments.  It will be necessary for this document to be executed by
all parties prior to the Hoegh Galleon calling on the port in Oman.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Philip Weems
