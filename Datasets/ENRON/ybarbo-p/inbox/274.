In order to provide Humberto the short term supply we have been talking about for a while, and to secure a 5-cent margin for Procaribe as agreed to with Mariella, we will sell him the product with the following terms:

Term:	4 months @ 1MM gal/mo.
Start Date:  On closing of Progasco sale (June)

Pricing: (depending on month of delivery)
	June		MB + 11.25
	July		MB + 11.00
	August		MB + 12.00
	September	MB + 12.00
	October		MB + 12.00

Miguel has a model contract approved by Coralina with the rest of the standard terms.  I suggest we send it to Humberto so he is ready to go by closing.
