Each year PNM is required to present its Winter Supply Plan to the New
Mexico Public Regulation Commission.  Part of that presentation will be the
disclosure of PNM's new firm transportation agreement with Transwestern,
including the discount rate.  PNM has secured a Confidentiality Agreement
with the NMPRC.  Please confirm Transwestern's consent to such disclosure as
soon as possible.
