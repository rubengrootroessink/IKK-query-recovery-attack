Hello,

I see your match and you were able to get it in on time. It has been submitted
and letter will be sent out to the organization to verify the match.

Have a nice Thanksgiving!

Angela

"Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be
honored."

>>I made a gift on 10/24/01 and gave the recipient a Gift Matching form to
submit to Enron. The form was submitted before November 1st but was returned.
The recipient told me that I needed to make my submission on-line. I did that
yesterday, November 20th. Today, I got the news that the program is being
suspended.
