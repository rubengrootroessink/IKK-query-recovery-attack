Over the weekend one of the Enron International data servers (EI G:\common) was scheduled to relocate to another Enron data center.  Since the move of the server, the system has been experiencing a wide range of technical issues.  The infrastructure team has been working around the clock to resolve these issues.  
 
This work is expected to be completed and all files accessible by end of business day Monday evening.  We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience in this matter.
Thank you,
Enron Net Works Infrastructure Team
