Dan:  We have discussed this internally and will remain with the numbers
provided in my e-mail to you on 03/05.  Our feeling is that until the sampling
equipment is up and running at the terminal we have to stick to a know number 
as
a bench mark, that being the first delivery of Matthew.

Joe-
It would have been preferable to work these numbers out in advance rather
than after the fact, especially considering that it seems we already had by
our phone conversations and my email to you dated February 7.  Since we
received no correspondence to the contrary, I assumed the numbers to be
used would be per that email.  Please revert with your response.

Dan

Dan:  We have rechecked our numbers and offer the following.  Based on The
Matthew's original delivery to Eco in July 2000 she delivered 2,744.094
mmbtu's.
This is the base number we are working with.  The Arctic delivered
1,415,921
mmbtu's 5/6 feb 2001, She then delivered 1,389,086 mmbtus on the 12/13th of
feb
2001, for a total of 2,805,007 mmbtus delivered.  We subtract 2,744,094
(matthew
base number) from 2,805,007 and get 60,913 mmbtus remaining, which we will
bill
at the $3.483097 rate.
We will be re-submitting the invoice upon receipt of you comments

Brgds
Joe McKechnie

Joe/Chris-
I have received your invoice for the Feb 13 delivery of the "Methane
Arctic".  I do not agree with the split as it appears on the invoice.  For
the Winter Cargo portion billed at $4.323264, there should be 55,924.321m
(superscript: 3) which corresponds to 1,252,745 MMBtu.  The remainder to be
billed at $3.483097 is 6,086.467m(superscript: 3) which corresponds to
136,341 MMBtu.  Please recheck your figures and revert.

Thank you,
Dan Masters

Joe-
Confirming our conversation, since the "Winter Cargo" is being delivered on
two Methane Arctics, we need to paper split the volumes on the 2nd one
between the winter cargo price and normal price.  Using the volumes for a
standard cargo from the contract, the winter cargo should be 119,000 m
(superscript: 3).  The delivery that just finished was 63,075.679 m
(superscript: 3).  That leaves 55,924.321m(superscript: 3) on the next
delivery to be priced at the winter cargo rate and the remainder to be
priced at the normal rate.

Thanks,
Dan Masters
