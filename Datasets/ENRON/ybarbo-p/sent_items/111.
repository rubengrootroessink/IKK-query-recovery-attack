Elizabeth,

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

25841		40,000/d to Topock

26511		21,000/d to Needles


TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

25841		29,000/d to Topock
		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

Many Thanks,

Paul
