Jaime,

Have you tried Gus Luna or Debbie Keller with Edison Mission? Gus was handling the actual transactions. I kept my own calculations of the settlement amounts but Gus should have copies of the settlement invoices from Enron.

Paul:

I need to get some hard evidence (paperwork) that subtantiates the gain collected by Eco Holdings on the LPG hedging contracts for the year 2000. I do have copies of the contracts, but for audit purposes we need to have probably the worksheet where we signed off with Enron as to the amounts collected. Who can I talk to to get this?
