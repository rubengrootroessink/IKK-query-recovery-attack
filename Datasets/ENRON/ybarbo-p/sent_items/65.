Hi Paul.

I am in fact about to send some documents to EcoElectrica - can you confirm
I should still be sending them to Efraim at the below address?

(These docs are for the Helice : Cargo Op 10 : B/L dtd 01 October 1999).

Many thanks.
Victoria

Hello Paul

Sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you but I have been out of the
office on vacation for a week.  I think you asked me to verify to whom and
where we sent original shipping documents.
