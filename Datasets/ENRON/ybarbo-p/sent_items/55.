Yaqoob,

I hope that all is well with you. I have made some changes to your document. Pardon me for the fact that I cannot seem to draw in the lines as well as you. Therefore, I left them out. I hope that this information will be helpful to you. Note that Rick B. and Eric G. are at an equal level in the organization. They jointly manage the group. Call me if you wish to discuss this or anything.

Best Regards,

Paul
