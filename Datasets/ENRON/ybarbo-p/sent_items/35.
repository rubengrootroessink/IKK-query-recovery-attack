Shubh,

How are you doing through all of the uncertainty associated with DPC these days? Are we still waiting for the lenders to decide whether or not they will continue funding the project? What is the MSEB's current position?

I'll give you a call Wednesday morning (Mumbai time).

Best Regards,

Paul
