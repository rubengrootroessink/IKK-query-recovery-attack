Paul:

For your reference are the attached two files which have the write up from the two previous quarterly reports - Sep 30, 2000 and Dec 31, 2000.  I had given to Todd hard/paper copies of the same.

	 	 

I just found out that I might be leaving for Mumbai on Sunday for meetings beginning Tuesday, 10 April.  Hope to get back to Houston by the end of the week and be in the office on Monday 16 April.

Thanks for your help.
