I tried to send out an email to you from home last week but received an error while sending.  So I'll try again (sorry for the delay in my response).

This contract was negotiated at a one-part daily rate of $0.1100/dth.  However, because the shipper's usage each month was significantly lower than the contracted mdq, they were billed less than the contracted rate (using the applicable max tariff rates for demand and usage).

I reviewed the invoices for the time period May 2001 - September 2001 and these are the results regarding necessary adjustments:

May 2001 - ok
June 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery points #58710 and #500084 ($568.87)
July 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
August 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
September 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($189.00) and delete the Credit for Commodity on reservation invoice ($251.10)

NOTE:  The GRI adjustments do not impact TW's bottom line because the monies collected from PNM for these surcharges are passed through to the Gas Research Institute.  The only impact to our revenue is the deletion of the Credit for Commodity.

Please let me know when you are ready to make the rate adjustments and I can walk you through the process.  Then we can get with the schedulers to re-generate these invoices.


Thanks,
Elizabeth
