Hi Paul,

I'd like to get some more information before following up on your request.

Could you please provide the following so I can research this.
1. Effective Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/1998 
2. Effective End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	10/19/2001 
3. Ref Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/2002 
4. Ref End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	12/31/2006 
5. Publication [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG 
6. Curve Code [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG

[Y'Barbo, Paul]  Also, since my note yesterday, I found price data on 09/30/2000 (a Saturday) in the data that was returned to me. Those prices were the same as those on 09/29/2000. I am most concerned with the prices given for 09/16/2001 (a Sunday). It is easy enough to delete those prices. Are the prices on 09/17/2001 to 10/19/2001 good? 

Sorry to ask for these again, but these specifics are needed to analyze the data that was returned to you. 

Thanks,
Kim
