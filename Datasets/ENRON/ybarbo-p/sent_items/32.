Wayne,

I'd like to discuss this further with you. Primarily, does this make me "officially" Dan's supervisor? I can see some pluses to that arrangement.

Wayne,

Can you please advise if Dan Masters, Dustin Collins and Rajesh Chettiar report to Paul Y'Barbo (they were earlier reporting to Todd Peterson).

Thank you and regards,
Sunita
