Walt,

EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  

I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas. 

Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?

Thanks,

Paul
