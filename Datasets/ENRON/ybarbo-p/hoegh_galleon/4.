Subject: Hoegh Galleon standing orders and voyage orders format

Roald,

In accordance with your request during our meeting earlier today I have 
attached to this message copies of the standing orders and voyage orders for 
Hoegh Galleon that Enron finalized with Capt. Kvammen.  Though these have 
been finalized, it does not mean that they can not be changed in future if 
the need arises.  Should it become apparent that anything has to be added to 
or removed from either of these standard documents they will be amended as 
necessary following consultation between Owners and Charterers.



Additionally, below is an excerpt from a message that I sent to Capt. Kvammen 
some time ago.  It outlines the division of responsibilities within our 
organization as they relate to Charterers responsibilities towards Hoegh 
Galleon.  I did not send you the complete message that was sent to Capt. 
Kvammen as there were a number of questions in that message which have since 
been answered.

Responsibilities for administering the LNG purchase / sale contracts and for 
the daily / voyage instructions, bunkering instructions etc., to the vessel.  
This will rest with Todd Peterson and Dan Masters.  Todd and Dan work under 
Wayne Perry.  Dan Masters will be the primary name on ship / charterers 
communications and will copy our entire group on his communications with the 
ship.
Responsibilities for administering the Hoegh Galleon's Charter Party.  This 
will rest with myself and Jim Fernie.  As you know we work under Wayne.
Obviously Todd, Dan, Jim and I will have to work closely together to ensure 
we all know the current status of voyages etc. so that the operation runs 
smoothly and we can cover for each other during absences.


Regards,

Tony Galt
