Dan,

Ref, yr e-mail dated 1/2-01 re above subject.

Our intention is to use our own strainers with 20 mesh.  That should
catch all bolt, nuts and other debris.

Will revert with more info to Steve Couch, CMSEnergy, re mooring and
interface work sheet as soon as I am back from the gas trial "Hoegh
Galleon".  I am joining the vessel in Singapore on the 15th.

The vessel left the yard to day, 13th, for the sea trial. Up to now
everything has gone smooth.

Best regards

Capt Kjell Kvammen
