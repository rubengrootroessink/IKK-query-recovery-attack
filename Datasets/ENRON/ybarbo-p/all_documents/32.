Larry,

The approach speed indicator you refer to that is currently used is not 
intrinsically safe and should not be approved for use by the FERC or USCG. 
The system we are recommending is similar to the one being used in India and 
other ports and is an integrated system. The additional cost of including the 
approach speed indicator with the tension monitoring and quick release is 
minimal compared to an incident. Larry Snyder and Tony Galt can give you more 
information on the need for this and the cost effectiveness.

Larry - Please add your comments/corrections and forward on to Victor. 

Approach velocity metering is currently hand held and portable and will  
remain so. ?No permanent equipment is planned for installation. ?The purpose  
of the equipment is to measure the ship's approach velocity as it is nearing  
the mooring position. ?The velocity should not exceed 6 inches per second as  
it contacts the breasting dolphins. ?If the ship were to impact the dock at 
a  
greater velocity, then a subsequent inspection should be performed to  
ascertain whether or not damage to pier pilings had occurred. 

The metered mooring hooks have been recommended but not specified nor  
procured. ?The metered hooks would allow close monitoring of ship's forces 
on  
the dock during unloading and the data would allow for the ship to adjust  
forces on the dock, and this controlling the ship's position, by precise  
application/use of ballast and intermediate adjustment of mooring lines. 
This  
feature, by providing precise information on the forces (and motion) of the  
ship relative to the dock would allow for greater precision in positioning 
of  
the ship at the optimum vertical and horizontal position relative to the  
unloading arms and avoidance of undue forces on the unloading arms. 
This feature would reduce likelyhood of perc valves discharging and  
disconnecting of the ship during unloading. ?In summary, it's an information  
system that provides for a higher level of control of the unloading process. 

Regards,
