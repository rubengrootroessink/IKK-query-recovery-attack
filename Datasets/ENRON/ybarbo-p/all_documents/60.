Rudy-
Per our conversation last week, the "Methane Arctic" will be delivered on
to EcoElectrica on April 2, but you had mentioned the possibility of
adjusting the due date for the invoice.  We didn't discuss an exact date,
but the plant would like to see a due due date of April 17 if that works
for you.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Dan Masters
