Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt
of invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day
or two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way
the contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can
net it against our next fuel management payment?

Dan:

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th,
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment
is not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.
