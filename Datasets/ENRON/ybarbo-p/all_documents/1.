Paul, 

I enter the PR CPI as is and any resulting index, I let the decimal float.

Todd,

The attached calculations are using a Year 2000 PR-CPI of 180.525 (this is 
not obvious because of formatting). The Cabot contract does not specify how 
many decimal places to use. Do we have anything worked out with them 
regarding rounding of the PR-CPI?

Paul

Now that I have received the December 2000 PR-CPI, I have completed 
EcoElectrica's LNG pricing for 2001.  The attached model shows that Eco's 
Commodity Charge to be $3.4831/MMBtu and the Demand Charge Rate to be 
$0.8460/MMBtu.
