Subject: Revised Draft Cabot Letter

Further to Dan's meeting with Rick late this afternoon I have amended the 
previous draft sent to Todd et al this morning .

 I have also included language to refute the claim made by Cabot that the 
facility is "infirm"  because it is not capable of receiving at the contract 
rate  during this commissioning period. Although there is no express 
provision regarding commissioning rate in the contract , according to 
industry practice the  rate at this time may be understandably  lower but 
this does not give them the right to direct the vessel elsewhere as long as 
we are paying demurrage. TODD , I AM ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE CASE, SO PLEASE 
DELETE/MODIFY THIS PARAGRAPH IF THERE ARE RATE/ OTHER ISSUES OF WHICH I AM 
NOT AWARE.  

   Attached please find the draft which should, per Rick's instructions, be 
sent to Cabot via fax Saturday morning in accordance with the notice 
provisions of the LNG Sales Contract. I have not forwarded this revised draft 
to EdisonMission. In the mean time any further comments should be directed to 
Todd.
