once my boss Hiro arrives 	from 	Korea. Once again thanks for your
great effort with regards "Enron ORG".

	Pls. find the attached file reg "DPC Implementation Agreements" as

Yaqoob,

Nice to hear from you. I have to admit that I have gotten pulled away by
our other projects during the last month. I should be able to devote
more time to DPC fuel supply this week. My preliminary review leaves me
with the feeling that your document is well thought-out and will be very
useful for DPC implementation procedures. At some point, I would like to
receive an electronic copy, if that would be possible.

I hope that you are well and that we can meet early next month. Did you
have Houston in mind? I will coordinate with Clay Harris.

Regarding, the organization chart: Todd Peterson is no longer with our
company. The rest of the chart looks fine.

We should try to talk Wednesday evening - Muscat time. I will call you
then.

Best Regards,

Paul
