Yaqoob,

I have probably missed my opportunity to speak with you before your weekend. We are very flexible on the dates for a June meeting. We are very happy to have you visit our city of Houston. Could you propose dates that are convenient for Oman LNG? Who will be attending from your company?

I will speak to Clay regarding an agenda for the meeting.

Best Regards,

Paul

P.S. Have you tried reaching me on my mobile phone 713 825-8046? Feel free to call me over my weekend.
