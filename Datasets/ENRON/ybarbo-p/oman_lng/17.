Dan,

This agreement is the same as what Dan Rogers sent over previously, except that it is in final form. Who needs to sign this? Leif Hoegh? the Cpt. of the Hoegh Galleon? Can we get this signed for Clay?

FYI 

Attached is the copy of the CoU given to me by Clay yesterday on Hoegh Galleon that i was asked to get executed by OLNG and Hoegh Galleon.  I have sent the same to OLNG after Clay's signature's.  OLNG will be executing the same and sending it back to us for execution by HG.  I will courier that to you, if you could please get it executed by Hoegh Galleon.

 

Regards
Rajesh
