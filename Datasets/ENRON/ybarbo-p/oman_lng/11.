I believe that this draft is largely negotiated.  Do we need to table this copy to Oman.  Clay has asked for this document to be executed asap.  I am planning on scheduling a meeting with Oman and needed to know your opinion on how we proceed on this CoU. 

Regards
Rajesh

Rajesh,

For you to handle. Will try to schedule a meeting with OLNG in the near future to finalize. Hiro Sakaguchi is handling the COU for OLNG. This is a different COU than that used for the Lakshmi.

Clay,

I looked back and found that these copies of both the "clean" and blacklined versions of the revised Oman COU were sent to Paul Y'Barbo and Dan Masters but I noticed that neither you nor Sertac were copied.  Sorry for the goof.

This document was revised to make Enron a signatory in order to comply with the confirmation notice, but the legal effect of Enron's signature is really no more than an acknowledgment since its liability allocation deal vis-a-vis each of the seller and transporter is set out in the Master SPA and charterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kind regards,
Dan
