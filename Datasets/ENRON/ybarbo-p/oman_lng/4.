Shubh,

How are you managing these days? I'm still hoping for a positive outcome from the current dialogues. However, I've been reading the Indian press and they are rather depressing. I hope that you are not overworked and overstressed.

Oman LNG wants to have a meeting in Houston in early June. They are also still asking about the possibility of a site visit at DPC. I want to talk to Clay Harris and get his view on the desirability of such meetings. How do you feel about meeting with DPC's principal LNG supplier. I would not know what to tell them at this point. A site visit would be awkward at this time. 

Also, Oman LNG has requested a DPC logo in electronic file form. Can you provide it to me?

When would be a good time for me to call on Thursday?

Good Luck,

Paul
