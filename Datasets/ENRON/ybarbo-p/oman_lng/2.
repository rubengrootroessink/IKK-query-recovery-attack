Yaqoob,

Nice to hear from you. I have to admit that I have gotten pulled away by our other projects during the last month. I should be able to devote more time to DPC fuel supply this week. My preliminary review leaves me with the feeling that your document is well thought-out and will be very useful for DPC implementation procedures. At some point, I would like to receive an electronic copy, if that would be possible.

I hope that you are well and that we can meet early next month. Did you have Houston in mind? I will coordinate with Clay Harris. 

Regarding, the organization chart: Todd Peterson is no longer with our company. The rest of the chart looks fine.

We should try to talk Wednesday evening - Muscat time. I will call you then.

Best Regards,

Paul
