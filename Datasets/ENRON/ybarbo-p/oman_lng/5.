Wayne,

Oman LNG is requesting a meeting in Houston in early June and a site visit at DPC in the near future. We discussed these meetings while in Oman in March. I have been trying to contact Clay and get his view on the desirability of such meetings at this point. Also, what would be the agenda?

Comments?

Paul
