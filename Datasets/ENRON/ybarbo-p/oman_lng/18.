FYI 

Attached is the copy of the CoU given to me by Clay yesterday on Hoegh Galleon that i was asked to get executed by OLNG and Hoegh Galleon.  I have sent the same to OLNG after Clay's signature's.  OLNG will be executing the same and sending it back to us for execution by HG.  I will courier that to you, if you could please get it executed by Hoegh Galleon.

Rajesh
