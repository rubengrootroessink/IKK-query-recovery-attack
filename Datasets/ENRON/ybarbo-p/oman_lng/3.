Yaqoob,

I have been unable to reach Clay but I feel sure that I can have a conversation with him later today. He is in Seoul at this time. I will contact you Thursday regardless of the results of my attempt to contact him.

Many thanks for the electronic documents.

I will request that DPC forward to you the DPC logo immediately.

Until tomorrow,

Paul
