Clay,

Per our call, I am giving below a brief account of what happened at site yesterday:

At 02:33 hours on 9th April 2001, a failure occurred while both the 32 inch lines were under pneumatic testing.
The pressure at the time was 23.8 BARg; ultimate test pressure planned was 25.2 BARg.
The event appears to have occurred between bent 4 and bent 1 (at the seaward end of the jetty).
No personnel were at risk; the planning and safety procedures were being observed.
A total of thirty personnel were on duty, involved in the test at the time of occurrence and well away from the point of failure; an exclusion zone of 850 metres was in effect as planned.

Initial Assessment:
Extensive impact bents 4 to 1; all pipework supports and plinths in this area are a loss. 
No visual evidence of impact  to unloading arms, or control building at the jetty head.
No immediate evidence of impact on jetty superstructure.
Internal inspection of pipelines from point of failure to shore is underway.

Actions taken:
Response team assigned.
Insurance assessors notified and due to reach site today.
Design and certain vendor assessments initiated.
Assessment of jetty structure initiated; detailed check of all facilities beyond the jetty to be conducted.

Most of the above is based on what Lingtec (the LNG Construction Contractor) has reported to DPC.  Please appreciate that these reports are preliminary.  Lingtec is expected to make a detailed update during this week.

Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to call me.

Best regards,
Shubh
