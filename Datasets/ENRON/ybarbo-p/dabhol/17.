Folks,

Please find attached a draft version of the presentation to be made to Oman on July 19-20,2001.  Shubh and I have pieced this presentation together from various lender/Board/Greenfield presentations. A few point before you go on to review the presentation:

You will find that we have delved into more detail on specific issues. This has been done to address queries raised by Oman in their letter dated July 4,2001.

This presentation does not answer queries related to any possible outcome of the present imbroglio and its impact on the OLNG/DPC SPA

We do not propose to give them copies of MSEB's rescission letter as requested by them. While they had earlier asked for a copy of the PTN, we had only summarised the same in an Update to them.

Also please find attached a copy of the letter received from Oman dated July 4,2001 

We have not given any cost estimates on mothballing and cost to complete the project . 

Looking forward to comments from all of you.

Regards,
Anshuman
