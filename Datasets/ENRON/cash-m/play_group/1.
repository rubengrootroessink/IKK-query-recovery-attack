Hi Everybody,
 
I just received the playgroup roster and although  we are scheduled to host we can't.  I also cannot host the next week and  can't trade with next,etc.etc.....
 
So if anyone wants to host on Thur. 9/6 please let  me know and I will happily inform the group. If I don't hear from anyone by Tue.  9/4 I'll let everyone know it's cancelled.
 
Thank you,
pam
