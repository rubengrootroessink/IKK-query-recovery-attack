Do either of you have a copy of Dennis Pick's employment agreement which 
contains the provisions of his severance?  The UK Inland Revenue is making 
inquiries and needs a copy.

Dear Jane

I have just joined Enron, and will be assisting Tara Rozen and Madeline Fox 
with their expat work.

We have recently had an enquiry from the UK Inland Revenue regarding Dennis 
Pick's termination payment.  They have asked that we supply them with a copy 
of Dennis's original contract of employment (we have the letter of assignment 
on file, but this is not sufficient for their enquiry). 

Do you know a contact who we could request the contract from?

Thanks for your help.

Victoria
