Jim/Don,

Do you know anything about this for Ecogas?

FYI - see Jerrel's response to my query below.  This is the first I've ever 
seen or heard that this was a "condition to closing."  
Dan/Rob - is this true?  

To me the cost is irrelevant since Jerrel is the only Director affected and 
because of his actions (and/or lack thereof) the company can't afford to 
cover him.

Answering backwards - D&O insurance is exceedingly expensive for small firms
to secure, thus most do without it.  Second, it was a condition when we
closed and McConville/Lambert, et al researched it through Enron Risk
Management, Don Marshall, and stated that it was in place automatically for
any majority owned merchant investment.  A confirmation letter was promised
on 14 July and when pressed in September Lambert finally got around to
issuing the letter to Carl and me that I mentioned earlier.

I'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks
here.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why
doesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is
appreciated.
