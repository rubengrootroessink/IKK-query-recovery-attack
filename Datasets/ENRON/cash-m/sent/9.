Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for 
you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for 
both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping 
dates on which you all are available.  

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

Michelle,

 Yesterday, counsel for Richard Clonch called, requesting January
dates for the Enron depositions.  He provided me with the following dates
possible dates; 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, 1/11, 1/12, 1/22, 1/23, 1/24,
1/25, 1/26.

 I told him that I would forward these dates to Enron.  I will send
counsel for Richard Clonch availability dates for Enron Officials as soon as
I hear from you.

 Thanks
