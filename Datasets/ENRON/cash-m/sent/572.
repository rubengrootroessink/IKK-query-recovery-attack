Privileged & Confidential

David,

As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment 
agreement.  I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and 
have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.

I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment 
(salary, options, etc.).

Let me know if you would like any other information from me.

Michelle

If we were to let him go what would be your advice on deal?

David
