CPage:  Would you please forward this directly to Pat?

Pat, For your information, Chris Tomko has resigned from GSP.  GSP has hired 
a consultant, Hoyt Thomas (who has been working as an Enron HR consultant for 
a few weeks), to handle interim HR responsibilities until GSP hires a new HR 
person.  I suspect that you will be involved in a lot of advice/counselling 
in the next few weeks as this transition occurs.  If you are available on 
Friday, I would like to have a phone introduction of you and Hoyt.   Would 
you please call my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 713-853-6401, to let her know 
your availability so that she can set up a conference call?  Thanks a lot.

Twanda, would you please set this up when Pat calls?

Michelle
