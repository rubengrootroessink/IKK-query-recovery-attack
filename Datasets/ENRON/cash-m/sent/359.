Michelle:

Attached is the DD list provided by RAC - please let me know if you would 
like the team to request additional information from Ahlstrom during our 
visit on Thursday and Friday.  If you could send me this info before I leave 
Wednesday at 10:30, I would appreciate it.

I will send you copies of the plant O&M agreements over the next few days.

Thanks-
Bill
