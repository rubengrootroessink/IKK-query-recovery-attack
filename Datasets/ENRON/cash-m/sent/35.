Molly, add her to the list for Carlos.  Also, could you find out who Bonnie 
Nelson has worked for in the past and provide me with that information so 
that we can call and make reference checks?  Thanks a lot.  Michelle

I am interested in Carlos.  I would also like to run some references on 
Bonnie Nelson.
