Subject: Recent ASAP on AAP issues


I am sending you our most recent ASAP.  Our ASAP's are our summaries of
recent developments in employment matters.  This ASAP addresses the recent
changes in the regulations related to affirmative action plans.  Employers
which have contracts with the federal government, or contracts with federal
contractors, must prepare and maintain affirmative action plans (AAPs) as
long as they employ 50 or more employees, when the contracts are for $50,000
or more. The changes addressed in this ASAP are quite technical and require
careful consideration.
