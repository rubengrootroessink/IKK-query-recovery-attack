Trey,  Unfortunately, I do not know of any position at Enron that would be 
available.  I think that Bracewell may be looking for people, as might 
Littler, Mendelson.  I hope that helps. Michelle

Trey,

I have a friend that is a 5th year lawyer who has 4 years of labor and 
employment experience with a large law firm and a labor boutique firm (both 
here in town)- this person has asked me if Enron might have a need for a 
labor and employment lawyer with these kind of credentials.  Would you pretty 
please ask your wife if she is aware of any potential opportunities.  

Thanks - Tara
