Sheila, 

HR is setting up interviews with Carlos next week, and you will be on the 
interviewer list.  Thanks!

How would you like references run on Bonnie?  Internally or pre-Enron.  Let 
me know, since this is the first time I have received that request (given 
that I am new in this role!).

Thanks.

Michelle

I am interested in Carlos.  I would also like to run some references on 
Bonnie Nelson.
