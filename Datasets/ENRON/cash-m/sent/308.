I agree with your approach.  MHC

PS, I am out next week on vacation.  Call Twanda to arrange for assistance 
while I am out, and she will refer you on.  Agreements will be done during my 
absence; again, work with Twanda.  Thanks. Michelle

Basically, RD wants to hire someone and have that person make a one-year 
commitment to the Company (this is someone that worked for them before and 
left after a few months due to personal reasons).  Rather than doing any kind 
of agreement, I have recommended to RD that we either do a signing payment 
(full amount repaid if leaves within the year) or a retention payment as part 
of the offer letter. 

Are you comfortable with that?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the 
end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire 
consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is 
pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can 
find an alternative.

Michelle -

Do we ever do fixed term offers?  I got a question today from RD Hawkins as 
LasVegas Cogen asking if we could hire someone for a one year period of 
time.  I know we can do it in the UK, just not sure about the US.

Thanks!
Amy
