Hi Michelle

I'm not sure if the Employment Agreement matter with JG Hong has now been 
completed.   We do not seem to have a copy of the same in the file.  Could 
you fax a copy to me at (65) 734-2868?

thanks and regards
Angeline

Thanks for your note, Michelle.  

Yes, I think that we should put in your additional suggested language.

Regards,
Anita
