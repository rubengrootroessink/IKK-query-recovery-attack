Michelle,
This is Scott Williamson's reponses. I talked with him about the number of 
times he travels out of the US for work and he said for Enron he has and will 
not travel for work. For Conchango he does. Right now he is in the UK trying 
to get his visa situation straightened out?? I don't know what that means.

1. I need Steve until I'm able to hire someone to fulfill that role.  We are 
actively recruiting and interviewing candidates for his activities.
2. I simply do not have an answer for your second question. We have not 
discussed or agreed upon a set number of trips.

Scott

Scott,
Once again we need some more information about Stephen Bond. How long will he 
be here? and how many trips in and out of the US will he make? Please let me 
know as soon as possible so we can bring this to a conclusion. Thanks Scott!!
