Subject: Pastoria - Consulting Agreements

Michelle,
Sam told me that Gene Tackett and Kathy Russeth have approved the form of 
consulting agreements you prepared, and everyone is ready to sign.  Please 
send initialled, execution copies to Sam, and we will have Dave Parquet sign 
them.  I need to request urgency on this, as the documents are relevant (from 
a due diligence perspective) to our larger Pastoria transaction.  Thanks.
