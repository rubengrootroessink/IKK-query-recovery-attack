Attached for your review and input are initial cuts at the schedules for the 
draft P & S Agreement that we will be discussing on our call tomorrow 
morning.  You'll see that in many places the drafts are simply placeholders 
for information that some of you will need to provide, but hopefully they 
provide a useful starting point.  I  cannot overstate the importance of the 
schedules.  They have a direct impact upon the representations that ENA will 
be making to a potential purchaser and any errors in the schedules can result 
in serious financial liability for the company.

We need to have our schedules for Pastoria ready for posting on DealBench by 
the end of this week.

Thanks for your continued efforts.  I look forward to talking with you 
tomorrow.
