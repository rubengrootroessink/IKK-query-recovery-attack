Michael,

I met Amy today and look forward to working with her.   Thanks for the heads 
up about her arrival here in the States.

Michelle

I understand that Amy Fitzpatrick will be moving from Enron Europe to 
Portland in the near future as her husband is relocating back to the states.

As you will no doubt be dealing with Amy going forward, I thought I would let 
you know that she has worked extensively with myself and Jon Chapman and is 
also the HR rep for the Legal Department in Europe.  She has done an 
outstanding job and is an absolute pleasure to work with, so we are very 
disappointed to lose her.  However, our loss is your gain and I have asked 
her to look you up when she goes to Houston.

Speak to you soon.
Michael
