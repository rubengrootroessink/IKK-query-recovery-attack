Dear Gretchen:  

Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer 
related? I have never heard of it.

On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice 
and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while 
we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a 
chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need 
for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we 
go!

Stay cool -- Michelle

Hi!? The heat has gotten to us!? We are  thinking Christmas.? We would like 
to give C a Leap Pad if he doesn't have  one and you and T think it would be 
appropriate.? The item is for ages 4  and up but we do not think C is too 
young for it and hopefully it will get him  to read more.? Nothing exciting 
happening here.? Just waiting, waiting  for furniture, materials, etc.? Takes 
forever as you well know.?  What's happening your end?? G?
