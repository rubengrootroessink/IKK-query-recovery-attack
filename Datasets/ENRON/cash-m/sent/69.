Molly, could you please forward the "thanks, but no  thanks" template letter 
to me?  I will send it to her since she interviewed.  For persons who don't 
interview,  I think the "no thanks" letter can come from HR.

Thanks for your assistance on this. 

Michelle

Dear Michelle---Just a note to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
today.  Thank you for taking time to learn more about my background and
experience and to share your Enron story with me.  I am very interested in
the available position because I welcome the opportunity to learn new things
and improve my skills.  Although I have not worked at a law firm, I am
fortunate to say that my in-house experience has been very hands-on with most
of the transactions and all of the labor matters handled without outside
counsel.  I discussed this point at some length with Elizabeth Sager and left
a reference list with Molly McGee in HR.  Looking forward to hearing from you
soon,

Alice Ginsburgh
