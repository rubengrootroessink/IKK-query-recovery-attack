Marty,

Gracie Presas is asking about training for ENA for harassment.  As we 
discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron 
global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency.  So, I told her to call you.

The lawyer contact on this is Kerry Notestine at Littler Mendelson.  His 
number is 713-652-4748.  Thanks.

Michelle
