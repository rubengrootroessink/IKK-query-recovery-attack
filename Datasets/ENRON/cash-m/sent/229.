Hi Pam, 

Attached is an updated copy of the AESOP Program Participation Grid.  Felecia 
forwarded the voicemail to me from Melissa Laing.  She confirmed Nowa Sarznya 
and Trakya Elektrik's participation, but she did not confirm Enron's percent 
of ownership or whether they were consolidated or unconsolidated.  I also 
need information on Torpy Limited (EES) and Enron Energy Services Company 
Limited.  These  two companies were not listed in Secretariat.  I am still 
awaiting information from Belinda McGaughy on the Wind and Zond Companies.  
Do you want me to contact them again or will you handle it?  Please advise.  

Thanks -- LaQuitta
