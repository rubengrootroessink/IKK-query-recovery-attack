Amy, this looks fine, except I would delete the provision about exceptions, 
because there really are none!  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle -

Can you have a look at the attached compliance form and let me know if this 
is OK to send out to all employees with a copy of the policy?

This goes back a while - sorry for the delay.

Thanks!
Amy
