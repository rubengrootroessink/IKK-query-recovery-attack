		 Subject: Employment Agreement Guidelines


Effective May 8, the guidelines outlined in our April 14th training session 
will be officially implemented.  This means that employment agreements for 
VPs and above are not to be generated unless you have received a completed 
and approved request form.  Each business unit should call Mary McKendree 
(713-345-8085)  for the form and we will fax or hand deliver it to them.  The 
form must  be signed by the appropriate HR personnel for the business unit 
(names to be provided to Mary McKendree by each business unit) and then 
returned to Mary McKendree.  The form will be initialed by someone in 
Executive Compensation (Mary McKendree, Mary Joyce, or Pam Butler) and 
delivered to you for generating drafts.  Please do not distribute a draft to 
anyone without a signed and initialed request form.

Also, as discussed, requests for signing bonuses, retention bonuses, up-front 
grants by number of options rather than value, and guaranteed LTI awards are 
exceptions to the rules that the business units will need to justify before 
they will be approved.  Please do not make changes to these items or add any 
provisions to the standard short form without contacting Executive 
Compensation.

These procedures have been implemented at the request of the Office of the 
Chairman.  Consistent application of compensation standards and attention to 
the One Enron goal are key to our success.

Please pass this memo on to others who are impacted by this implementation.  
Sheila, would you please ensure that all Compensation Staff receive this?
