Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the 
end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire 
consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is 
pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can 
find an alternative.

Michelle -

Do we ever do fixed term offers?  I got a question today from RD Hawkins as 
LasVegas Cogen asking if we could hire someone for a one year period of 
time.  I know we can do it in the UK, just not sure about the US.

Thanks!
Amy
