Fran, I think we should get together tomorrow to discuss the issues around 
this deal.  Could you get with Twanda to do that?  THanks.  MIchelle

Craig,

We were supposed to have a conference call with labor/employment personnel 
early next week.  Has that been scheduled yet?  Also, I will not be able to 
attend at 4:00 on Tuesday, but will see if someone from HR/benefits can be 
there.

Michelle

Subject: Toucan Meeting -- Tuesday Afternoon

Please attend a meeting in EB2988 at 4 pm on Tuesday, October 31st. If you 
are unavailable to attend please have someone represent you at the meeting.

The plan for the meeting is to:

Go through individuals' findings regarding completeness of information 
available in data room binders, issues encountered that my impact the value 
of the assets to Enron, and any additional information required for Leaf 
River and Woodland.
Provide an update regarding the status of Woodland and deal stopper issues.

The issue relating to Woodland and the hesitancy to fully proceed on the due 
diligence relates to two potential deal stoppers -- security of fiber supply 
and labor union issues. Our preference was to better understand these issues 
before fully engaging in the due diligence process, and incurring the 
associated costs, but the constrained timing has limited our ability to 
accomplish that. At this stage it appears as though we will proceed to submit 
a mid-November bid, and therefore we should proceed with all necessary due 
diligence for Woodland.

Craig
