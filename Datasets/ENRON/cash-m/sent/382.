Please read the original email below.  Unfortunately I never responded - 
however as I read through the material today, I am unable to answer any of 
these questions.  Do we have a contact (outside counsel) who can provide 
assistance.

What's the word on the tax summary for Mexico?  Has it been completed?  If 
not, we are running up against a deadline so this task needs to be completed 
as soon as possible.  If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-9151.

Thanks.

Fran:

You should be aware that Enron Corp. will grant stock options to domestic and 
some international employees.  Some employees in Mexico will be granted stock 
options this year.  As a result, I must identify the treatment of stock 
options in various countries.  Your name was provided by the Human Resources 
representatives in charge with administering the EnronOptions program.

Attached you will find a series of questions regarding the taxation of stock 
options.  I need you to provide answers to the short list of questions and to 
verify those answers already supplied.  You may wish to contact outside tax 
counsel in Mexico to assist you with these questions.  I ask that you 
complete this task by October 1, 2000.



If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9151,

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Lina Jimenez
