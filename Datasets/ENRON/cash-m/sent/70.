David,

The document you gave me is the form assignment letter that I have prepared 
for many Bridgeline personnel.  Do we need to do anything to tweak it?  How 
do you want me to proceed?

Thanks.

David, I did not receive the package in interoffice mail.  Could you email it 
to me or re-send it by fax at 646-3490?  Thanks!  Michelle

Did you receive my interoffice mail?  It had an example of the contract 
Bridgeline wants to create for Risk.
