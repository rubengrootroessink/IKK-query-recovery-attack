Hi Michelle

Attached are the three review forms that are being proposed for the mid-year 
reviews accross all business units.  The VP form remains unchanged from the 
end of year 99 review.  The other two forms have been created based on the VP 
format.    Can you please review and advise if there are any issues with this.



Secondly, can you advise on the issues, if any, on providing consolidated  
feedback to a VP PRC Committee group (i.e. 26 MD's) on all VP's we have in 
Enron.   There has been a request that we provide this to this group other 
than the direct supervisor.

Thirdly, is there any issues with us or a HR representative  inputting 
feedback into the PEP system in another language ie. spanish/portguese.

Many thanks,

Karen.
