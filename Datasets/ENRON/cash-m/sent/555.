Randy just informed me that we are going to use the PV10 calculation for the
employee contract settlements.

Michelle - I think Kelly has already sent the #'s to Bracewell and the docs
are in progress.

Kelly - if this is not correct, please make sure Michelle and Bracewell
have the right numbers to fill in the blanks on the employee separation
agreements.  If you've already done so just confirm to Michelle.

Thanks!

Randy,

I haven't received the numbers for the releases for the Ecogas personnel
under contract.   Would you mind sending it to me so that I can send it to
outside counsel to prepare the releases?

Also, could you please send me copies of the Agreements for the 5 Ecogas
employees?  The only ones I have are unsigned.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle
