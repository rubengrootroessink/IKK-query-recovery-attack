Ok, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the 
distress.  Maybe we can chat later.

We will not be in Austin in the next few months.  We are going to San Antonio 
the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.  The first 
trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are 
marrying each other.  The other is for the Enron law conference, which is 
Wed.-Friday.  We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party 
time!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.

I am working with Butch Hayes at F&J.  I haven't been too involved in the 
matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I 
like him.  Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.

Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.  But, it probably would 
have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need 
that right now.  If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if 
you need it -- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.  Plus, 
Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.  He started at a new 
school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School -- a Montessori school about a 
block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.  It is amazing 
how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.  Little things 
like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even 
get me started on helicopters).  On the other hand, I feel this enormous 
responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.  
Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.  

Enough waxing philosophical.  I've got to get out of here at some point, so 
I'd better get back to work.

Later.  M

Hi Michelle!
Thanks for your message and update.

Yes, January was a tough month, and I guess I got pretty distracted by it all.
Nothing has been resolved but I've gotten over the initial shock and sadness
for my brothers. We were pretty worried about Joe for a while there because
Myra is (was?) the love of his life and he is so vulnerable. I can't remember
how much I told you over the phone (?)

Good to hear from you! We haven't been to Houston in a long time and are due
for a visit. We almost came the weekend of Feb 5-6 because a group was getting
together to go to Jay's gravesite in honor of his Feb 10th birthday. (But work
kept me here that weekend.) Hopefully sometime soon I can get over there and
see you & Trey & Cameron. Any plans to come this way? I'd love to see you.

For V-Day, we went out to eat at the Hula Hut. I picked up my brother Ed from
the airport (he had been in Santa Fe with Joe for a long weekend - we are
taking turns) and Ed came with us for our nice "romantic" dinner. Later Rog
and I went for coffee and dessert as a special treat. We still have a great
time together just talking about stuff and catching up on the day's
happenings.

Hope all is going well with the investigation - it sounded like you were in
good hands with the Fulbright lawyer. (Who is it? - Brian Grieg? Butch Hayes?)
If I can be of any help in any way, please let me know - I would love to work
with you! But, truly, I would  like to just see you again - to catch up and 
have some
laughs! mms

Maria,

I got your voice mail a couple of weeks ago.  It sounded like you were a bit
on
the stressed out side.  I hope things have improved, and that you had a nice,
romantic Valentine's Day yesterday.  Trey and I went to the opera on Sat.
night
for our V-Day event.  We saw the Elixer of Love, which is a very light, cute,
happy-ending opera (no screeching).

I think we got the referrals taken care of on the Austin investigator issue.
Thanks for your input.

Take care, and I'll catch you later.

Michelle
