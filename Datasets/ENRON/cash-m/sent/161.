Attached are two different programs that have to be installed first to be 
able to open Ghost Files "*.gho".

1. Launch gexp12.exe to install Ghost Explorer v1.2 then
2. Launch Ghost60.exe, then go into the folder Ghost60 and launch 
Ghostexp.exe, ( you will need to unzip to c:\temp )
3. Then goto Start...Run and type:   \\eitxhou1f06\security or 
\\172.20.249.102\security   to access the secure location of users Ghost 
Files.
4. Double click the ghost file you want to access and the lastest version 
should work from then on from just going to the security folder and 
doubleclicking on the ghost file.
