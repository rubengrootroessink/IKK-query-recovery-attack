Michelle,

 Today, I faxed you a copy of the Plaintiff's Second Amended
Complaint.  I am in the process of creating Enron's answer based on my
conversations with McClellan, Reck, McQuade.  I need to ask you a couple of
questions regarding the answer;  Please call me at your earliest possible
convenience.
