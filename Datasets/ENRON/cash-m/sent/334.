Michelle, consider me a "yes." Sounds like fun.  Also, thanks for Alex
Juden's resume; we extended him an offer.

Subject:  "No Excuse" Girls Night  (Document link: Michelle Blaine)

Hello everyone!!

Well, no one is celebrating anything specific, so we haven't had an
opportunity
for the girls to get together in a while.  Therefore, we have decided to
have a
NO Excuses Girls Night.

The proposed date is Friday, Sept. 29 -- Are there any major conflicts with
this
date?

Proposed place is to be determined.  Debbie Rank suggested that a restaurant
would be the easiest.  I offered to have it at my house, but she was
concerned
that I would get stuck doing too much and spending too much.  My thought is
that
if everyone agrees to chip in a bit, we can have it catered, and no one will
have to do too much or pay too much.  What do you think about that?

If you are interested, let me know.

Also, this first email is limited to those persons for whom I had email
addresses.  Many others should be added to this list, including:  Mary
Thamm,
Lisa Anouilh, Deanne Noel, Tamberly Thomas, and others whom I am sure to
have
forgotten.  Please forward this on and have everyone get back to me if they
can
attend or have a different suggestion.

My email is:  michelle.cash@enron.com.  Phone number 713-853-6401.  More
details
to come . . .

Michelle
