Subject: Garden State Paper--Corporate Services Agreement

Marty,

Rainer Cockrell has called to ask that we put the Corporate Services 
Agreement in place before the end of the year.  My most recent draft of the 
agreement, dated 11/3/2000, is attached.  Please give it a final look .  
After I hear back from you I will arrange to get David Howe to sign for GSP 
and Bryan Burnett for ENA.

Thanks,

Pete
