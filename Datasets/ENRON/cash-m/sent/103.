My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses.  

Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and 
explanations.  Perhaps we will work together again in the future.

Michelle,
?
Further to my voicemail, should we advise the actuaries to  cease their due 
diligence work on the Celgar pension plans? They have just  called me to 
advise about some further liabilities under the supplementary plan  for 
non-union employees. Thanks.
