Brian,

Would you or someone in your group please investigate the allegations raised 
by Janeth Rodriguez-Philhower?  Based upon her voice mail message, there is a 
strong possibility of litigation.  Your investigation into her allegations 
thus would be conducted in anticipation of litigation.

Once you have conducted the investigation, please provide me with the results.

Thank you.

Michelle
