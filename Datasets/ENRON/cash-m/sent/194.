Hi, Linda.   I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.  I was out on 
vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope 
that ELM has received the response by now.  Let me know if I need to do 
anything else.  Michelle

Hi Michelle. Unfortunately, this issue with Eddie Lynn Morgan is still alive. 
I talked with Kim a few weeks ago and she mentioned that she sent her 
write-up to you for your review - before sending it to Eddie Lynn. Do you 
have a status update on when it will be ready to go to Eddie Lynn?

Thanks Michelle!

It has now been two weeks since Kim said she would send me a note and yet no 
response.  Perhaps now you can see my continued frustration with the lack of 
response to what I consider to be a very serious matter.   As you had 
suggested when we first talked, I would appreciate it if you would forward 
this to Kim's boss so that I can get a response.

EL - I just spoke with Kim Melodick. As you indicated, she had not had an 
opportunity to provide you with the final outcome of the email investigation. 
She apologizes for this and will have a write up to you within 1 week from 
today.

Let me know if you don't receive it by next Wednesday. 

thanks.
