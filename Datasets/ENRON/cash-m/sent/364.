Bill, I had asked Twanda to get a conference call with you and Dana Davis on 
Williams.  I hope that happened . . .   I would like to have a petition ready 
early next week.  It will be lawsuit only, not injunctive relief.

I believe Ajello will be finalized this week.  I sent our signed version to 
Reliant last week, and I hope to have it signed by Ajello soon.  Once that 
happens, we can dismiss.

Thanks.  Michelle

 Hi Michelle...

 Just a reminder: I've heard nothing further on either the Ajello settlement
or the new matter involving Alonzo Williams.

 I'm looking forward to lunch next Tuesday.

 Best regards,

 Bill
