Subject: Georgia Pacific Due Diligence -- Availability of GP representatives 
post-data room visit  

In response to the question posed by numerous people today, we will have 
access to various GP representatives through calls coordinated through Morgan 
Stanley but it is unlikely that you will have access to GP contact people to 
repeatedly ask questions.

As requested this afternoon, please provide me a detailed list of the 
documents listed on the data room index that you want copies of (and other 
relevant documents) no later than 10AM on Wednesday morning.

Thanks,
Craig
