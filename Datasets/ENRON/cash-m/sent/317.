I certainly agree with the concept.  It sounds like it gives us more 
flexibility.

Mary,

Hope things are going well with you and yours! Nigel and I were discussing 
some contract language today and wanted some input from you on how we might 
word future grants of options or stock. Should we be wording Director Level 
and below agreements with a more generic "equity" component instead of 
specifying options or restricted stock? My question revolves around our 
tendency from time to time to change the structure of how we deliver value as 
a company. Your thoughts? What are others doing?

DCL
