Subject: RW separations

Michelle,

Please let know what you thing regarding the following:

1) Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and 
whether or not they are due money for the coverage.  One could argue ( and 
they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of 
their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.

If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to 
everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.

2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his 
contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the 
year.  Here is the wording verbatim: 

'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the 
Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to 
terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st 
January 2001.'

I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the 
separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this 
particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.

3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months 
to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP 
of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.   

Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

Cathy
