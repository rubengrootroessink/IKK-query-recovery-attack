Michelle - I am scheduled to be in Europe the week of Nov. 27, and in Asia 
the week of Dec. 4.  In addition we are trying to close a synfuel deal with 
AIG / Aquila by year end.  AIG is located in Conn. and Aquila is located in 
Kansas City.  We are also trying to close complex originated deals with 
Kennecott (Gillette, Wyo.), Vulcan and Arch (both in St. Louis) and I am 
trying to leave as much time open as possible in order to be available to 
meet with each of the above companies in order to get our deals closed.

Thanks,

George

The attorneys for Rick Clonch want to depose you in December.  What are the 
commercial reasons that we can use to argue against that?  For example, are 
you working on deals that require you to be out of town?  Are you too busy 
(explain in detail)?  If you provide me with this information, I can forward 
it to our lawyers, who can use it to try to move the depositions until 
January.

Your quick reply would be helpful.

George, I know we talked about your scheduled international travel.  Any 
other reasons?

Thanks.

Michelle
