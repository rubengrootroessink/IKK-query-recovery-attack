Hello!

Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned 
to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.

Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the 
unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.

I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.

Thanks.  Michelle
