Michelle:

Thanks for the call.  I have not heard from Marty Christian (spelling?)
about training but will be glad to talk to her about scheduling.  Regarding
the cost, the price I quoted before was $1500 for half day, and $2500 for a
whole day.  The actors are $100 apiece per presentation ($300 total for each
presentation). Typically, I can do three sessions in a half day and five in
a whole day.  Thus, total cost with the actors for a half day would be $2400
and $4000 for a whole day.  One issue with the actors is that they do shows
in the morning at their theater so afternoons usually are better for them.
I know they have some Fridays in November in which they are open full days.
