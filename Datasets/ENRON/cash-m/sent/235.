Earline,

The questions are as follows:

1.  Has Enron provided Ecogas with such coverage for its non-Enron board 
members so far?
2.  What is the general scope of such coverage?

Ecogas is a stand-alone company.  Enron owns about 85 percent of its stock 
and has three people on its Board.

I hope that helps.

Michelle

OOps there were about 4 emails from Jim Bouillion that were forwarded to me 
on this matter.  Apparently I picked up the wrong name.  It is Jerrel Branson 
that is seeking coverage under Enron's D&O.  The same questions apply only 
change the name to Jerrel Branson.    We just need to know the chain of 
ownership to answer.  The Enron D&O policy is very broad.  

Thanks and sorry for adding to the confusion on this coverage question.

Your email to Jim Bouillion regarding coverage for Ron Maffett  of ECOGASA 
has been forwarded to me for handling.  Teddy Ward, retired June 1.  I am her 
successor as manager of the D&O coverages.  Please provide additional 
information to further my research into the D&O coverages.

Is Enron North America the owner of ECOGAS 
If so what is the % ownership
Is Randal Maffett an Enron employee or is he an outside director/officer.  

We do cover outside directors but it depends on our ownership interest and if 
we manage it

Thanks,  Earline Kendall

Jim/Don,

Do you know anything about this for Ecogas?

FYI - see Jerrel's response to my query below.  This is the first I've ever 
seen or heard that this was a "condition to closing."  
Dan/Rob - is this true?  

To me the cost is irrelevant since Jerrel is the only Director affected and 
because of his actions (and/or lack thereof) the company can't afford to 
cover him.

Answering backwards - D&O insurance is exceedingly expensive for small firms
to secure, thus most do without it.  Second, it was a condition when we
closed and McConville/Lambert, et al researched it through Enron Risk
Management, Don Marshall, and stated that it was in place automatically for
any majority owned merchant investment.  A confirmation letter was promised
on 14 July and when pressed in September Lambert finally got around to
issuing the letter to Carl and me that I mentioned earlier.

I'm not very experienced in these matters so I'm checking with the folks
here.  Can you explain why Enron should cover non-Enron directors?  Why
doesn't Ecogas have its own insurance?  Any help you can provide is
appreciated.
