Mark, If this hasn't already taken place, I'd like to participate.  My 
assistant, Twanda Sweet, should have my calendar.  Also, FYI, Rick JOhnson  
will be in town at the end of the week if you want a face-to-face.  MHC

Subject: Benefit/Tax Meeting - Project Crane

Dee, Jeff, Rick -

I need to set up a meeting between the benefit group and the tax people to 
walk through the structure we want for the purchase of Project Crane.  We 
made a good bit of progress in Toronto over Thursday and Friday on the tax 
structure, but clearly indicated the need to confirm all of this in relation 
to benefit issues.  I would like to have the meeting on Monday sometime, but 
need to coordinate schedules.  As soon as possible, please advise me of your 
respective availabilities so that a meeting can be scheduled, keeping in mind 
the need to have Rick involved.

Thanks.
