Hello Michelle

Twanda gave me your name - would it be possible for you to have a quick look 
through the attached consulting agreement that our new acquisition, MG Plc, 
wish to enter into with Colorado Global Resources, and confirm that it is in 
order?

Many thanks.

I have added a Schedule 1 listing the services, and other than filling in the 
standard gaps I haven't changed anything substantive.

Best wishes

Michael
