Sharon/Kriste,

If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we 
make major ones, including a segregation of FMLA leave from other types of 
leave --i.e., two separate policies.  Let's talk about this on Tuesday ----- 
Majorly important!!

Michelle

Subject: Leave Policy

Here are a few edits to the Approved Time Off and Leaves of Absence policy.

Benefits has not included a "second or third opinion by another health care 
provider paid for by the Company" as it has significant implications to our 
LTD plan and has created at least one problem that I am aware of in the past.
We will need to think through what the certification document might look like 
and would look to you for some guidelines.   The concern I have is around 
privacy and use of information given potential regulation.
Cynthia believes that we should run FMLA concurrent with sick time.  I agree 
and have noted that in the document.   

Sharon, could you please review the wording to ensure I haven't missed 
something here from a legal perspective.  I will follow-up with you by phone 
shortly.  

Susan, here are the "long-since promised" wording changes we propose.     

Thanks,

Elaine
