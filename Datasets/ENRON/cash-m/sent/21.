Michelle,

I have asked Sarah Reyna, Finley Biggerstaff's assistant to send to you 
copies of the collective bargaining agreements, the employment agreements 
with senior management (there is only one, for Fred Inglis, the plant 
manager) and all benefit material.  I am also making copies of relevant 
sections of the AGRA Simons report regarding union and labor matters.  
Michelle, we only got copies of the due diligence materials and the AGRA 
Simons report on Thursday.  Indeed, I am waiting for the benefits documents 
to arrive with this morning's express mail.  

Your contact at Davis & Co, our Canadia counsel in Vancouver, is Dean 
Crawford (604) 643-2951, dccrawford@davis.ca.  Our principal contact at Davis 
& Co. is Brian Hiebert, (604) 643-2917, fax: 687-1612, 
brian_hiebert@davis.ca.  I have not met Dean, but understand from Brian that 
he is a senior employment attorney with experience with the provincial labor 
ministry.  I understand that Dean is currently reviewing the CBAs, the Inglis 
employment agreement, benefits documents, union grievance records, workers 
compensation claims records and human rights complaints files.  Davis & Co. 
have prepared consents to be signed by KPMG as receiver for Stone Venepal 
(Celgar) Inc., owner of the mill, in order to get access to correspondence 
between Stone Venepal and the Workers Compensation Board.  

I trust I will see you at the Celgar metting at 10:00 am today in 27C2.

Peter
