David,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier 
this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues 
surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.  I expect an answer by 
Monday or Tuesday.  Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.  Michelle

Michelle,

This is the first of 2 messages..   We have been trying to get a response on 
this since April, I understand you are very busy, as are we, is there someone 
you can assign to us to work on these issues?  Some type of response would be 
appreciated.

Thanks - David

Michelle,

This is the first of 2 messages we are looking for your input on, can you 
advise when can we anticipate a response to Diane's questions?  At this point 
it is too late to make configuration changes for the 7/1 go-live but we 
wanted to get your feedback so that if we are not in compliance we can get 
the corrections on the schedule for post 7/1. 

Your assistance, as always,  is greatly appreciated.

Thanks - David

Michelle,

Have you had a chance to look at this question?  We are needing to finalize 
the configuration and wanted to make sure that we had everything in line.

Thanks,
Diane

Michelle,

We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime 
for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for 
assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who 
rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario.

For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the 
Night (N) shift.


  M T W Th F S

REG  8 8 8 8 8 
OT       8 
SHIFT  N N D D D D 


Interpretation 1

The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular 
rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5)


Interpretation 2

Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as 
follows:

REG  $400
SHIFT       16
OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5)

Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have 
totally missed the boat on both of them?

Thanks for your help,
Diane
