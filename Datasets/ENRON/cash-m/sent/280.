Enron North America had some summer clerks this summer.   Generally, we do 
not hire lawyers without significant legal experience (i.e., more than 6 
years) unless they have some extraordinary skills and abilities (e.g., 
someone with lots of Enron experience).

I hope that helps. 

Michelle

We have had some legal interns  that were on rotations in the Company
,however, I am not sure what program that they were attributed to within
Enron.  I believe it was the old diversity program.   I do not know the
state of affairs today with respect to legal interns or associates.  You
may want to check with Michelle Cash as she may know if ENA has any legal
interns or associates.

Do you have some sort of policy about hiring lawyers?  We have received a
resume, but didn't know if anyone in Legal would be interested in seeing
it.

Thanks,
Molly

Lexi,
I don't think the legal department takes candidates without prior legal
experience.  Molly, will you check with Kriste or Sharon on their policy so
that we know for the future.
Lexi, there may be some interest in our Program if he is interested and has
had some type of finance experience.  Give me a copy of his resume.

Thanks
