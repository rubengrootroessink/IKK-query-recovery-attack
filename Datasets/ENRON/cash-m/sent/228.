John:

As we discussed, I am sending you a letter summarizing the law related to
double-breasted issues, with particular focus on operating two companies in
the same geographic and project market.  I also have included some
information, as you requested, about the potential liability if the efforts
to maintain double-breasted status fail.

I will send the original of this letter to you by mail.  I have copied this
letter to Michelle Cash but have not sent it to anybody else in your
organization because of your prior comments about David Lund's direct
contact with me.  Let me know if you want me to forward a copy of this to
David, Rick Johnson, or anybody else.

If you have any questions about this letter or this topic in general, please
let me know.
