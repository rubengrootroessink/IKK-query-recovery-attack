Matt, 

Thanks for your email.  I believe that there is an agreement in place between 
ENA and Enron Expat Services.  In general, the contract is between ENA and 
the employee, if the person is an expat.  The assignment letter covers the 
employee's transfer to Expat Services.  We haven't usually amended/assigned 
the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are 
through ENA. 

If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, 
and I am happy to handle it.

If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember 
right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.

I hope this answers your questions.  I have copied Sharon Butcher on this 
email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several 
years.  If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we 
can be aware of questions.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle

Subject to any views Michelle Cash has, I would be happy to assist by 
drafting the agreed amendments to the Rich's Contract. I understand from 
Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main 
body of the Contract. I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to 
finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan. 

I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended 
arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA.  However, your 
suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not 
be sufficient to put the arrangement in place. Rather, there should be an 
agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA. I believe such an agreement 
is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore 
from ENA - John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him. 

Because I do not have the background to the relevant inter-company 
arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services, I would suggest  you 
discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue, and perhaps make the 
necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that 
Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to 
provide services for ENA, instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat 
Services

Regards
Matt

Lillian,

We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since 
the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe, the 
employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a 
clause secunding Mr. Slovinski to Enron Expat Service.  PLEASE have Matthias 
make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible.  I am 
sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will 
be fine.  The important thing is to get Rich to sign the contract!

You did receive the employment agreements we fed-ex'd you on June 6th didn't 
you?  Make the necessary changes and send a copy to us.

This was our first Expat and it has been a real learning experience.

Regards,
Michelle

Michelle,

Per my email to you and Kim (copied John Nowlan and John Chismar) dated 22 
June, there were some amendments to his package which was only approved that 
day.  I do not have the soft copy of the executables to make the changes nor 
am I sure if I m allowed to make amendments to them without legal reviewing 
them.

Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation, and if it is agreeable, we 
can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review 
them.  This should expedite this.  However, we still need to know who would 
be the employers of Rich - ENA or Expat services.

Lilian

Matthias - the executables were Fed-Ex'd to Lillian on June 6th.  We have 
just been waiting for Rich to sign them and return them!  Would you have any 
idea as to why he has not signed yet?? As for it being Eron Expat or Enron 
North America I will let Michelle Cash in our legal dept. respond to that.

Michelle - can you respond on whether or not it matters as to Enron Expat or 
Enron North America and which is correct??

Regards,
Michelle

Subject: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovensky

Michelle / Kimberly

Please allow me to introduce myself - I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore. 

It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that 
the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been 
executed. You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control, 
compliance and legal issues. Apart from confidentiality issues, Rich does not 
presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts.

Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Rich's 
employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or 
whether we have to implement measures to stop Rich's trading activity. 

Additionally, I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich 
refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract 
states that ENA is the employer. Please clarify or rectify as appropriate.

Regards
Matt Lee
