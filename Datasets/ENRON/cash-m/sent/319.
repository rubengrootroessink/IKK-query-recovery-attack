Hoyt,

I have reviewed the attached.  I think it looks good.  It strikes the balance 
of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the 
future.  Kriste, any other thoughts?

I tried to make this as innocuous as I could, it will not make the New York

print these Wed AM so please give me some feedback ASAP!
