Dan, what is the status of this deal?  I hadn't heard anything for a few 
days, and I knew we were on a tight time frame.  Thanks.  Michelle

Kathy,

Here is Wayne's response to the HR due diligence questions that Michelle 
proposed.  What are your thoughts?  Let me know what you need, and I will 
push him for adequate answers.  I will forward you the e-mail of the employee 
manual.  In addition, I believe Maribel Mata in due diligence has a hard copy 
of Power System's employee manual; you may call her and see if you can get it 
(I left her a message letting her know you may be calling her).

Thanks,

John H.

John,

This list relates to an acquisition which is not the case.  I think you're
all set from the benefit information we are giving you.  I'll have Lori
email you the employee manual (you have it in hard copy already).

Wayne
