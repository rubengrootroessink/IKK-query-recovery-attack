Drew, thanks, I got it.  I'll be sending out an email on this in the next 
couple of hours.  I'll send it to you and Robert first.  You can run it by 
Chapman and/or outside counsel in London today. If everyone is in agreement 
as to the approach, we can send it to Louise asap.  More to come . . . .  
Michelle

Subject: Employee Issue

Drew,

Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who 
has had some issues.  I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his 
agreement.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you 
fax it to my house first thing in the morning?  713-218-7355 is the fax 
number.  If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to 
review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I 
will prepare on this topic.  I am going to be attending a seminar out of the 
office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.

I will prepare draft correspondence and circulate it to you, Robert, and 
Louise for comment and dart-throwing.  I can be reached via my cell phone 
during the day at 713-302-5522.

Thanks, Drew.

Michelle
