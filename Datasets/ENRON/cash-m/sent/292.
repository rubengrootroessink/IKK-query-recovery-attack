Amy,

It looks like my presence in Portland is iffy at this point.  There are other 
ways to do the training if you still want it asap.  Otherwise, I can schedule 
it a few weeks from now.  I'll give you the details as I confirm my situation 
with the Portland trip.

Michelle

Michelle -

As of now, does this date still work for you?  I want to get out information 
to let the employees know about the sessions - I was a bit hesitant to do so 
before now just in case you did have to cance.

I hope that you are well.

Kind regards -
Amy

Amy, that day may not work after all.  I'll get back with you if it doesn't. 

 In any event, the training lasts about an hour.  I'll need a video player 
and a projector for a powerpoint presentation.  

Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle -

It looks like the 26th of July works best for everyone here.  I hope that 
this date still works for you.

Can you let me know how long the sessions take and what a good number is so 
that I can get these scheduled?

Thanks and have a great weekend.
Amy
