Peter,

I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves 
the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized 
workforce.  I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a 
deadline of 12/15.

Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me 
involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.  
You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there 
are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal 
department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service 
for Enron.

Please provide me with information about this deal asap.  And, I repeat my 
request to get me involved earlier on future deals.

Thank you.

Michelle
