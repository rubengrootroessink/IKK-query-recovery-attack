Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language.  I have another one for 
you.  The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may 
be facing outsourcing.  There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to 
stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the 
transition.  Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle and Brian,

Please review the attached draft memo for distribution to employees to 
communicate the project completion program.  We would present each employee 
with an individualized memo showing their award amount and the terms.  The 
department head would be responsible for filling in the project term.  Let me 
know what changes need to be made to the memo before we use it.  They would 
like to communicate to their folks as soon as possible.



Also, please look over the revised presentation for the project completion 
incentive for the final time - no significant changes have been made.



Thanks,
Kim
