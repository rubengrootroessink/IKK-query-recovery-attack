I have discussed with Melissa and it does not seem to impact them; in fact, I
think it messes them up in London from a legal standpoint if they offer
redeployment.  I also think that we are going to reduce the redeployment
possibilities for the NYC staff and the time given to them to find an Enron
job (which led to my phone call this afternoon re putting term letters
together for them next week).    But I will let Melissa address the question!
