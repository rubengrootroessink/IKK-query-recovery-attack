Michelle,

I certainly have the training and informational materials and can enlist Roy 
and Derek (technical side of the team) to run the reports.  I know Kathryn 
McLean has been providing overall statistical reports to Cindy Olson, so 
these probably already exist and are being finalized for the VP/MD meeting 
7/31 and 8/1.

Let me know when you want me to provide these materials.

Thanks,
Jennifer
