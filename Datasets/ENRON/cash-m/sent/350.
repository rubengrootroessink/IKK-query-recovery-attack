Chuck,

Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?  Given the 
correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we 
probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from 
the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.  Otherwise, even if we do 
"agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.  I am ready to 
hear what this guy has to say about my client.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Michelle
