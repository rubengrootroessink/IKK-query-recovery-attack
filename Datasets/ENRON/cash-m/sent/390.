Andrea, This looks good.

I have two nits:  First, the street value of our phone book is $1k, not $1.  
Also, "loosing" people should be "losing" people.

One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal 
confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no 
filter on what employees can/can't put.  In other words, if an employee is 
working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know 
about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.

One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron 
facility -- not remotely.  This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop 
to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.

Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that 
talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.

Thanks.

Michelle
