Tara, perhaps the Brown contract should have gone to Melissa instead of you 
-- sorry.  Could you please let me know if I need to re-route or do anything 
else on that agreement?  Oxley is anxious for it to get to him.  thanks.  
Michelle

Spoke with him about his contract on Monday. We agreed following changes and 
he would sign;

1 - Should read Michael L Brown throughout
2 - He would us to have Mark F send him a note (separately) that says why we 
will rank him as a VP he can continue to use the MD title externally and 
maintain any related travel perq's associated with that.
3 - We should change cash sign-on to 12 months pay back.


 Can you get him final asap. Also Kim/Mel lets draft email for Mark F.
