Twanda, please save this in whatever power point directory you have.  Then, 
print for me to revise for a presentation to Energy Operations for Norma.  
Save this one, though, because the one I am going to use for Energy Ops will 
be much shorter, and this one has good stuff in it!  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle:

The PowerPoint presentation that you requested.  Please delete any reference
to Sterling Bank, but otherwise, this is my personal work product and you
may use it.  Let me know if you need anything else on this topic.

In addition, I will let Anne Marie know the timing issue related to the
checks.

Also, let me know what your hear from Jack.  We are disappointed that he did
not come to our firm, but it does not surprise me.
