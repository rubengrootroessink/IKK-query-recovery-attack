		 Subject: Question re: photographs on MV/VP Biographic Profiles

Hi Michelle.  I am so sorry that i was unable to chat with you at last week's 
meeting with David.  I have a question regarding photos on the MD/VP 
biographic profiles (which will be provided at the VP/MD Global meetings on 
31 July and 1 Aug. 

 I am told that insofar as possible we should ensure photos are included on 
all the bio profiles-- but I also understand that there are legal 
considerations (i.e. we need to get employee concurrence to include the 
pictures).

I gather that there is a disclaimer or consent form that the VP's and MD's 
will have to sign and wondered if you would have a copy of this consent form 
for me to use.  
Any info you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in 
advance.

 Gina
