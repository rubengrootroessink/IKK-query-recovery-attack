Pat,

Here is the latest PSA draft for a 

We've agreed to pay $1mm of the severance.  We also have agreed to pay the 
cost of 2000 bonuses.  On options, there is a proposal for Enron to supervest 
the employees' options at closing -- can we agree to that? I didn't think 
so.  

your comments would be appreciated.

Michelle
