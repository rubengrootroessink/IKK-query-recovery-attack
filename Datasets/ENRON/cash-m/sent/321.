I'd suggest finding otu more information.  My inclination would be not to 
accept the contractor.

Michelle - Welcome back from vacation!

Gary Buck suggested that I approach you for guidance regarding a background 
investigation report we have received on a contractor candidate for 
Networks.  The report indicates that 8/14/95, the candidate was found guilty 
of theft, a misdemeanor.  He was sentenced to 3 days jail and fined $200.  
The candidate indicated on his Contractor Information Sheet that he had a 
misdemeanor from 1995.  

Should we have the recruiter contact the candidate and ask for more 
information about the misdemeanor, or should we simply reject him?

Thanks for your assistance.

Candace
