Debbi,

First off, I am wondering how you knew the company name I was calling on.  I
never gave that other girl the name of the company.

Any how, I am wanting information on Contracting Solutions, Inc.  They
listed your company as a reference, and I have been trying to chase this
down for about two months now.  I have been able to contact the other two
references they had given, but the one with your company has been a bear to
run down.

They stated that they have worked with your company on a permanent
placement.  Is this correct?

How was their performance? (did they respond timely with qualified
candidates? With legitimate resumes of real people or were the people no
longer available when you wanted to interview them?, etc.)

Can you tell me if there have been any problems with this company? (if yes,
what are they.)

Are you currently doing business with them?  (If yes, please proceed to the
next question, if no, Please tell me why?)

Do you have any additional information that would assist me in doing
business with this company?

Is there any way you can respond as soon as possible, I would like to either
approve them or close this file.
