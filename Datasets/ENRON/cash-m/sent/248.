Dawn,

I have not seen a request form for his contract.  I believe that Teresa Bien 
was working on it with Mark Haedicke.  I am copying her on this email so that 
if I am mistaken, she can let me know.

Thanks.

Michelle

What's the status, Michelle?  Peter was asking yesterday - I told him we 
might have something to him this week - was I lying??
