Matthias - the executables were Fed-Ex'd to Lillian on June 6th.  We have 
just been waiting for Rich to sign them and return them!  Would you have any 
idea as to why he has not signed yet?? As for it being Eron Expat or Enron 
North America I will let Michelle Cash in our legal dept. respond to that.

Michelle - can you respond on whether or not it matters as to Enron Expat or 
Enron North America and which is correct??

Regards,
Michelle

Subject: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovensky

Michelle / Kimberly

Please allow me to introduce myself - I am Legal Counsel for ECT Singapore. 

It has just been brought to my attention by our HR Specialist Lilian Low that 
the employment contract for our new trader Rich Slovensky has not been 
executed. You would appreciate that that gives us a slew of control, 
compliance and legal issues. Apart from confidentiality issues, Rich does not 
presently have authority to bind ECT Singapore in contracts.

Please let me have your very urgent advice whether we can expect Rich's 
employment contract to be in place immediately to regularise the situation or 
whether we have to implement measures to stop Rich's trading activity. 

Additionally, I noticed that the cover letter offering employment to Rich 
refers to employment with Enron Expat Services but the employment contract 
states that ENA is the employer. Please clarify or rectify as appropriate.

Regards
Matt Lee
