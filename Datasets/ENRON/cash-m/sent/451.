Dorie,

I think this looks good.  I have two tweaks:

On the "Let me be clear" sentence, I'd delete the "let me be clear" 
introduction.  I think the last sentence speaks for itself.  
In the last sentence, why not conclude by saying that if they don't pay, "we 
will have no choice but to take further action on this matter" and delete the 
reference to attorneys.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, it is good to go.

Good luck!

Michelle

Subject: Revised letter to ERI

Attached is the revised ERI letter incorporating your changes from 
yesterday.  Please take a 'fresh' look at the letter and advise me of any 
additional changes and/or comments.  I am out of the office today, so please 
send any changes via my interoffice email.  I am hoping to get the final 
letter sent to Diane Nielsen by email and courier later today.
Again, it was a pleasure meeting you yesterday and I appreciate all of your 
guidance concerning this matter!
