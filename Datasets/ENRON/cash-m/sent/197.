Don't worry about it!  Of all people, I understand about schedules being 
tight.  Good luck with the post-trial work.  Michelle

Sorry that I have not called.  We were gone the first weekend that you called 
and I worked this last weekend.  I am trying to get our JMOL and motion for 
new trial filed by this Friday.  I will call you this weekdend.  I am a 
little keyed up.
