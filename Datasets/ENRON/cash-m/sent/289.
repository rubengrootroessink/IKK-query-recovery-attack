Kristina,  

Attached is the letter we give to all persons who terminate from ENA 
voluntarily (although I don't really know why we limit it to voluntary 
terminations -- I have to look into that).  I also will send you by messenger 
the draft letter to a company (which I don't have on the system) and the 
letter I sent to the individual we discussed.

I hope these help.  Let me know if you would like additional information.

Michelle
