Michelle, John, Attached please find the draft check-list I prepared per your 
requests.  I utilized a variety of legal memorandums and topic reference in 
developing this.  In the many instances listed,  the consensus from both 
NEPCO and ECC should be paramount.  Please let me know if  there are topics 
you would clarify.  I believe we were going to attempt a joint discussion 
after receipt and review of this draft.   I have good availability for a 
conference discussion on:
Thursday 6/1/2000 - through 6 PM PST
Monday 6/5/2000 - 12 through 6 PM PST 
Thursday 6/8/2000  - 12 through 5 PM PST
I will be trying to vacation in the interim periods.  Thanks,  I'll look 
forward to your comments.  Rj.
