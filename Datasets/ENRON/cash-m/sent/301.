Subject: Project Crane (Daishowa)

I have scheduled a meeting for Monday (7/31) at 4:00 at an EB location to be 
determined to finalize the Project Crane Deal Team, and get everyone up to 
speed on the latest developments.

For those of you I have not spoken with, our counterparty has accelerated the 
schedule, and as a result we only have a couple of weeks to assemble a team 
for the data room.  The data room process will begin on Sunday evening, 
August 13 in Quebec City, Quebec, and end Friday, August 18 in Port Angeles, 
Washington, with a travel day in between mills on Wednesday.  My assistant, 
Susie Fallon will handle all the travel arrangements.  We will receive an 
updated itenerary and index of the data room the middle of next week.  I will 
distribute the information memorandum at Monday's meeting.  I apologize for 
the short notice, but look forward to working with you all on this 
transaction.

Thanks,
Patrick
