Michelle,
 
Lee Allbritton and I are friends.   He suggested I contact you regarding the employment position you are  seeking to fill.  He explained that you are not using recruiters to  fill this slot.  
 
I understand you have already seen several  candidates but I would appreciate the opportunity to meet you and  discuss the position.  My resume is attached for your consideration.   My firm is unaware that I am seeking other employment so I would respectfully  request that you keep my interest in Enron confidential.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.   Thank you for your time.
 
Ellen Malow
