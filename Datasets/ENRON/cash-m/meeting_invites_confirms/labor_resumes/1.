Dear Ms. Cash:

	Attached is my cover letter and a copy of my resume.  Sorry to email
you about this, but it is the fastest way to get you my information.  I am
using my husband's email to send you this material.  If you need to get in
touch with me, you can do so by emailing (smoll@littler.com) or by calling
(713-652-4737).  Thank you for your time and your consideration.

Sincerely,


Stefanie Moll
