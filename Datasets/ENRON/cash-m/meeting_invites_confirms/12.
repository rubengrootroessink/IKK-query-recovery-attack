My apologies!!! I sent invitations to the Thursday afternoon meeting but 
failed to change the meeting time to 4:30 p.m..  Please calendar the meeting 
in Conference Room EB3824 for 4:30 p.m., not 9:00 a.m. as shown on the 
meeting invitation.  This is the first time I've set a meeting this way.  
Sorry for the inconvenience.
