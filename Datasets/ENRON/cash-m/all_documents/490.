Nathan,
Ted Bland is the Enron wholesale person responsible for all recruiting for 
one of the business units I support.

I actually spoke with Ted today about you.  He is working on scheduling you 
for a meeting, but he has had some difficulty in finalizing schedules.  So, 
there is no need to follow up, because he will get with you in a few days.

Hope all is well.

Michelle

Subject: Call from Ted


Michelle,

I received a call from Ted about 10 days ago about a possible
interview.  Ted said he would call to schedule an interview at the
beginning of last week, but I have not heard back from Ted.  I would
like to email Ted to remind him I am still interested.  Who is Ted?
Can you forward his email address?

Thanks for your help!
