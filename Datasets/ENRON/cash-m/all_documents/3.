Gracie,

Based upon my brief review of her comments, many are not acceptable.  Without 
a convincing explanation, I am not going to delete entire sections of our 
agreement, particularly when those sections protect Enron.  Please get with 
her (not by copy of this privileged email) and ask for reasons why she wants 
the changes. 

Thanks.  Michelle
