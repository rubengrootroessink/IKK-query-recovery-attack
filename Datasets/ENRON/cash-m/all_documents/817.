No, I have not sent any information.  I doubt that Hoyt has, either.  You 
send them the information before they sign.  I would just do a cover memo and 
references the agreement, where there is a specific provision about receipt 
of information.
Thanks.  MHC

Michelle,

What's the protocol?  Do we wait for them to sign before I send the the ODWP 
info or should I send it now.  The only people this applies to are Mo and 
Leying Sheng.  I thing you or Hoyt have already sent the info to Mo, right?

Do you have a memo that usually goes out with the information?

Thanks
Cathy

Cathy,

Also, for persons over 40 who are signing waivers, we must provide them with 
the census data about persons under 40/over 40 who were offered a package, as 
well as their title and age.  Please make sure that happens, or our waivers 
will not be valid.

Thanks. 

Michelle
