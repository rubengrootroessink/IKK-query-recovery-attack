Amy, this is way late, so sorry.  I suggest running it by the HR leadership 
team.  The email list can be obtained from Gerry Gibson at corp.  If there 
are HR openings, and she would be interested, they would most probably be the 
best people to assess her skills.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle,
Thanks so much for the feedback on Debra's resume.  Ted and I also shared it 
with Brian Schaffer who said he would potentially like to have her in his 
group, but has no openings right now.  You'd mentioned in your e-mail that 
there may be HR possibilites for her and she's expressed an interest in 
exploring that kind of a career move (see below).  Do you know of something 
specific or anyone else I should share her resume with?

I really appreciate your help!
Amy

Thank you so much for circulating my resume and for forwarding the positive
feedback to me.  As a matter of fact, I am very interested in exploring the
possibility of a transition from a Legal Department position to a  Human
Resources position.  Even though there may not be an opening at this time, it
would still be very interesting to speak with someone who has made this
career change.
Thank you again,  Debra
