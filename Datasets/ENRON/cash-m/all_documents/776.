Tara,

We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.  Have we already 
sent you executables?  If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, 
"Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The 
effective date still can be 6/1.

Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?

Thanks.

Michelle

Michelle/Twanda

On the nomination form for Mark Schroeder's agreement, it requests to 
backdate the salary to March 1st, even though the effective date of the 
agreement is not until June 1st. Can this be incorporated into the agreement 
or do we need to do a side letter to Mark?

Thanks
Tara
