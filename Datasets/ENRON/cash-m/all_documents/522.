Dear Gerald,

I received and reviewed your email, and I will check with my clients on your 
proposal.  I expect that I will have an answer later this week.

I understand that my assistant has sent you the documents by email.   Let me 
know if you did not receive them.

Feel free to give me a call to discuss.

Michelle Cash
