Thanks, I received it.  It is the assignment letter that I prepare for 
everyone at Bridgeline, so we can tailor it to your needs.  Let's get

David, I did not receive the package in interoffice mail.  Could you email it

Did you receive my interoffice mail?  It had an example of the contract 
Bridgeline wants to create for Risk.
