Hello Michelle,
?
Attached is a summary of further information we have reviewed.  
?
As you may know, next week our firm will be presenting to  Enron a 
comprehensive due diligence memorandum. The human resources component  will 
contain the information I've sent you to date and additional information I  
obtain. I'll?continue to send you information as I receive it, however, so  
that you can continue your own review.
