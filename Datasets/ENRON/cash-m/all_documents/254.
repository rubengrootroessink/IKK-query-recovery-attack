Hi Michelle

We have now finalised the Secondment Agreement with Kim & Chang, and the soft 
copy is attached for your further action.   Please let us have a fully 
executed copy for our file thereafter.




Thanks and regards
Angeline

Matt,

I am aware that an agreement was contemplated.  I did not prepare one, 
however.  I worked only on the employment agreement.  You might check with 
Sharon Butcher to see whether she has one.

If we need to put one in place, it can be done rather easily.

Michelle

Dear Michelle and Fran

I understand from my file and from speaking with Anita Fam that you were to 
have a Secondment Agreement for Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA put in place between 
Enron Overseas Services Corp ("EOSC" previously known as "OPC Ltd") and Enron 
Capital & Trade Resources Korea Corp. ("ECTRKC", a Delaware corporation). 
This dates back to on or about January 1999, but I don't have a copy of the 
executed Secondment Agreement on file. Please let me have a copy as we may 
potentially have to present a copy to the Korean tax authorities as evidence 
of Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA's employment/secondment structure.

There are some tax related issues that have arisen in Enron Korea that I'm 
assisting Lim Tiong Hock to resolve and your early response would be most 
appreciated.

Thanks and regards

Matt
