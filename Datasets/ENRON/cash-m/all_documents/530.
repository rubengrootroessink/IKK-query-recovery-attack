Yes, we will reword it.  In fact, we are looking at a review of the entire 
application.  Michelle

Michelle - I have not heard back about the Application, and I wanted to be 
able to tell Ryan something before she leaves.  Wednesday is her last day.  
Can you please let me know if you will be able to reword this section?

Thanks.

Candace

Michelle -

In the meeting we had last month regarding background investigation policies, 
we discussed the area on our current application where the candidate is asked 
to disclose convictions, etc.  In some instances, the candidate could 
truthfully disclose nothing, yet have a misdemeanor conviction for theft, 
possession, etc.  or other charges that would be potential disqualifiers for 
a position with Enron.  Since the question is poorly phrased, you had 
recommended that this piece be reworded, and you suggested that Ryan Seleznov 
bring it up in the Recruiting Council.  I brought this up to Ryan, but she 
felt that this would probably be more in the province of your area or Felicia 
Acevedo.  Would you like to take this task on, or would it be more 
appropriate to ask Felicia Acevedo to work on it?

Thanks.

Candace
