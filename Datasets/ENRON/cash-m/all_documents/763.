Michelle:
 I got the answer to the voicemail message I left for you about which lawyer 
would be the contact for the Enron Europe countries for the new Enron 
employee stock option plan.  Jon Chapman will be responsible for Norway, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey (and any other Enron Europe countries that 
are added between now and December).  I assume you are the appropriate lawyer 
for Mexico.  (If not, please forward this message to the right lawyer, and cc 
me so that I know who it is!)  Please read the message below for an 
explanation of the first action item (due June 23rd).  The Mexico spreadsheet 
is contained in the file marked "CALME AESOP" at the  end of Jana's message.  
Thanks for your help!

Jonathon:
 I was in a meeting this morning concerning the new Enron employee stock 
option plan that will be implemented at the end of this year, and Melissa 
Laing (who participated by telephone) informed me that you were the lawyer to 
support Enron Europe HR on this project.  I recently joined the Enron Corp. 
legal staff from Enron International legal.  My role in this project is to 
coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan.  As such, 
I have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with 
local counsel in each of the countries in which Enron has employees who will 
participate in the plan, to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any 
legal restrictions.  Based on current information (which is likely to change 
between now and December, per Melissa Laing), the relevant countries in the 
Enron Europe group are Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.  In the 
attachment labeled "asiapac" at the end of Jana Domke's message, you will 
find spreadsheets for all five of the Enron Europe companies.  Please review 
(with local counsel, if necessary) the information in the "Legal Compliance" 
section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is 
accurate.  Please forward any changes or comments to me and Jana Domke (Jana 
has requested that the review be complete by June 23rd).  The Public 
Relations department is currently preparing the written material that will 
communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees.  When 
that is available, I will send it to you so that you may make any 
modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the 
Enron Europe countries.  The communication documents will be available in 
English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Greek.  Please call me at 
713-853-5698 with any questions.  Thank you for your assistance!

		 Subject: AESOP 2000 - Country Summaries

If you attended the recent AESOP meeting, you are aware that the approval for 
establishing an Enron AESOP 2000 Program was granted by the Executive 
Committee on April 6, 2000.  In most instances, the plan design replicates 
the prior Plan parameters.  However, on an international basis, there have 
been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this 
program.

Attached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the 
various accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues 
into one document.  This consolidated document is based not only on 
information gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also 
reflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the 
information we have here.

Because successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid 
information, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.  
Please coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your 
local financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.  We want 
to ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the "One ENRON" 
philosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost 
effective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in 
your areas of responsibility. 

Please document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, 
provide input on viable options, corrective action, etc.. Also, if you have 
plans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they 
need to be included, please advise ASAP.  Please send your responses via 
e-mail to either Dung Huynh or myself or by fax to (713) 646-7203.  If you 
have questions or if you need to discuss further, please call me @ (713) 
345-6142.  Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the 
latest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.  

Once we have the input, we'll roll this information up into a revised Summary 
Document, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move 
forward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.


Appreciate your assistance!

Regards/Jana Domke & Dung Huynh


PS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly 
sorted by region.  You may need to extrapolate your specific locations from 
one or more of the following attachments.
