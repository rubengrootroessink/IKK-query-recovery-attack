Roberto, 

These are good questions, and, in fact, are ones to which I am not certain of 
the answer (at least for #2).  Let's get together next week to discuss the 
specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues.

Twanda, would you please set up this meeting for me?

Thanks.  Michelle

Enron will be implementing the Mailsweeper software shortly.  This 
application is primarily designed for email scanning/content filtering.  We 
have the following outstanding issue that need to be addressed before this 
application goes into production.

1. Legal disclaimer for out going mail.  (Propose verbiage listed below)

IMPORTANT: THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT A BINDING CONTRACT. ENRON DOES NOT CREATE ANY 
CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS BY TRANSMISSION OF THIS EMAIL.  THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED 
ONLY FOR THE USE OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO WHICH IT IS ADDRESSED, AND 
MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS PRIVILEGED, CONFIDENTIAL, AND EXEMPT FROM 
DISCLOSURE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.  IF THE READER OF THIS MESSAGE IS NOT THE 
INTENDED RECIPIENT OR THE EMPLOYEE OR AGENT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE 
MESSAGE TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT ANY 
DISCLOSURE, DISSEMINATION, DISTRIBUTION, OR COPYING OF THE COMMUNICATION IS 
STRICTLY PROHIBITED.  IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS EMAIL TRANSMISSION IN ERROR, 
PLEASE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE SENDER BY TELEPHONE SO THAT WE CAN ARRANGE FOR 
ITS RETURN.      

2. Under the new setup, all out-going mail (including remote sites i.e 
London) will be routed through Houston, processed through Mailsweeper and 
then sent to its final destination.  How can be sure that we are not in 
violation of a foreign country's privacy laws?

Your comments on these issue is greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Roberto DeLeon
