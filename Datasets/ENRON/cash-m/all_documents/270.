Even though I put "DO NOT RESCHEDULE" on our lunch meeting next week . . . .
Believe it or not, an all-day meeting has been scheduled for 5/31 (it is a
PRC
meeting), and I have to attend.  We never will eat together!  How about June
2
or 6?  As they say, the best laid plans. . .

Let me know, and SORRY.

Michelle

PS, I'll be out of the office all next week on vacation.  : )
