Mr. Del Vecchio,
?
I am working with Brian Hiebert in our due diligence work  regarding Celgar. 
Brian has asked me to forward to you the attached list of  materials I 
requested from Celgar on Friday. The letter and list is attached to  the 
email from my secretary that I am forwarding to you.
?
Doug Cargill's office has just advised me they were able to  put together all 
of the materials today, but the courier package will not arrive  until 
Wednesday morning. They are sending me by fax some of the materials this  
evening.
?
