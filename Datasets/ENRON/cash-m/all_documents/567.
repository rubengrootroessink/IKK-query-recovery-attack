Michelle, this barely intelligible email contains the draft letter from 
Noxtech's President, Ralph Slone.  We averted this crisis by advancing 
Noxtech $50,000 against the expenses incurred on our behalf by Noxtech that 
are reimbursable under the License Agreement.  I spoke with Ralph Slone 
today, by the way.  He thinks PBCC, his lender, will have comments back on 
the Warrant Agreement today.  I will keep you apprised.

Best regards,
Vince

Vince, cannot make its payroll for the end of  the month (October) if it does 
not receive the advance to cover our expenses as  described in attached 
letter. I have not sent the letter to Mike or George. I  would prefer to 
resolve this problem between you and I. If I haven't received a  definitive 
answer from you by Monday afternoon I will take that to mean no. I  will then 
send the letter to the Cc list. Regards.?
