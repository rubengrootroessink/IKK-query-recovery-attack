Steve,  I am meeting with Kathy Neal this afternoon to discuss the action 
items.  I have spoken with Kathy Karaga with Dee Lenfest's office and have 
been assured that the benefit analysis has occured.  I am awaiting further 
details.

Kathy,

I am the ENA attorney assisting Ozzie Pagan (ENA East Origination) and Glenn 
Wright (Enron Industrial Markets) with the acquisition of two Cogentrix's 
coal fired power plants located in North Carolina.  

I understand from Kathy Neal that you are the appropriate person to be 
involved in the employee/labor due diligence efforts that were initiated by 
Dolores "Dee" Lenfest and then transferred to Kathy Neal.  If I am mistaken 
in believing that you are currently conducting such due diligence with 
Cogentrix's HR representative, would you please contact Glenn Wright 
immediately at 3-1568.  I hope there is no misunderstanding of what is needed 
or who is supposed to be assisting, but if there is, we need to get that 
figured out today.  

Thanks for your help.

Steve Van Hooser

All information of this project should be directed to Kim Melodick, Manager 
HR.  This is actually her client group. 

Thanks!

Kathy,

I just got this fax and thought you might want to know of Glenn Wright's
