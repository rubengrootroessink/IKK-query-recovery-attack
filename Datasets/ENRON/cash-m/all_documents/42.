Subject: Wellesley Interviewers

Due to some scheduling conflicts some of the candidates are coming in at 
various times.  As it stands the following is their arrival dates and times:

Candidate  Date  Time
Christina Benkert Dec. 8  after 6:00 PM
Nelly Haghighat Dec. 8  after 6:00 PM
Rupa Bhargava  Dec. 8  9:05 PM
Belinda DeLa Cruz Dec. 8  11:05 AM
Ayesha Kanji  Dec. 8  11:05 AM
Sona Khanova  Dec. 8   1:48 PM
Amanda Lang  Dec. 8  11:05 AM
Dale You  Dec. 8   11:05 AM
Sabrina DeMelo Dec. 7  after 6:00 PM

One of the candidates Sabrina DeMelo is unavailable for the weekend 
interviews and in order to accomodate her she has been given the option of 
getting her four interviews in on the off cycle Super Thursday.  However, 
they are looking for interviewers for that Thursday so I will need two 
volunteers from the Wellesley team for the following date:

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

Please contact Cathy Lira, at ext. 5-4049 to inform her of your availability.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks, Geynille
