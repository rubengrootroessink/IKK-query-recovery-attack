Linda, I haven't looked at the pleading, but it should be fine if it is 
simply a nonsuit with prejudice.  Thanks for your help on this.  MHC

Here are the draft motion for nonsuit and order for nonsuit with prejudice.
(As you will recall, Tom specifically requested that the nonsuit be with
prejudice).  If you approve, I will file these tomorrow and bring this
matter to a conclusion.
Thanks for you attention.
Linda
P.S.  I will be in the office all day tomorrow and can discuss the JAMS/AAA
issue at your convenience.
