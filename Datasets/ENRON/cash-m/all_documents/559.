Julia,

On Garden State matters, how do you want to handle the signing of documents?  
Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and 
initialling them before signature.  Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may 
be a desire to have a more expeditious process.  

I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department 
is going to be involved in GSP work.  Given our discussion last week, I would 
not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the 
standard Enron process, but it is not my call.

I would appreciate your thoughts.

Michelle

Michelle, we talked about this at David's staff meeting last week and he 
seemed to want to develop a quicker process on approval when a lawyer such as 
Ann Murray or Pat McCarthy was involved.

I asked David Howe about this issue.  He said htat he wants to have an
attorney's initials on the document before he signs them.  So, I guess it
needs to go through me for now.  Michelle

     Michelle, we terminated Bill Nycz October 12, he is now ready to sign
     the release that Pat McCarthy wrote up.

     Once bill signs this, we will need to get a company signature pretty
     quickly to pay him expeditiously (i would like to cut the check as
     soon as his 7 days are up).  I assume that David Howe needs to sign it
     . . . does David have to have your approval to sign something like
     this?

     When Pat writes contracts for us, do i still need to get you to sign
     off on it before David Howe signs it?  If a management employee of GSP
     who is not an Enron employee signs a contract, do we have to have
     Enron legal approve it?

     Hoyt
