Bad news girls:

I just got a call from Pam's secretary who let me know that Pam's brother
Russ was killed in a car accident last week.  Pam and I were supposed to
have lunch this week and she called to fill me in.  I don't know many of the
details yet because her secretary did not know much.

Apparently they are having a military service in Seattle and they will
probably bury him in Texas since Pam's parents are moving to Texas soon.  I
don't know when the service in Texas will be.

Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers because I know that this is
going to be terribly hard for her.  She and Russ were very close.

I'll fill you in as soon as I know more,

Thanks,
Karen
