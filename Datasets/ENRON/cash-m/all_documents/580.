We do want to go to the Nutcracker if you can still get tix. Also, could you
have Trey send us the grocery delivery service website?
Thanks

Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or
anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor,
theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the
best.  I could use 5x7" the most.

Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may
want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player
attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John
Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others.

We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the
Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure
that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could
get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know.

See you later.

Michelle

We're getting Dad the dustbuster or keychain (unless you guys already have)
and Gretchen the placemats/guest towels and Span/Eng dictionary

Marianne wants some clarification on what kind of picture frames
(wood/metal
(type) etc and coasters (whimsical, serious artsy, material) for your list.

I'm going to prob get Trey the Lyle CD and a playstation game. Maybe a Polo
shirt

Would you let me know which you choose?  I may need some of them as a
backup!  Michelle

Hi, Brooks.

He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the
Women.  Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they
don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could
find him a game for the new system.  He has said that he wants a new clock
radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with
battery backup -- Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.

Let me know if you need any other suggestions.

We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

Michelle

Michelle,
     Can you give me any ideas regarding birthday and x-mas presents for
the man
who has everything?

Hope all is well there.

Brooks
