Candace, You are right -- there is no need to send a second letter since we 
didn't base our decision on the background check results.  Michelle

Michelle - Just wanted to verify that there is no need to send this candidate 
a second notice.  It seems a bit pointless, but thought I would double check 
with you.  Please advise.

Thanks.

Candace

Michelle - 

I have drafted up a special letter to send to the candidate with the 
derogatory results on his background investigation report.  We had decided 
not to engage him for business reasons unrelated to the background report 
(his job requisition was actually cancelled), and you suggested that we send 
him a copy of his report anyway.

Could you look over this letter and let me know if it is suitable to send 
out?  Will we need to also modify the second letter (that contains contact 
information for the investigation agency) and send it out in a couple of 
weeks, or will this one letter be sufficient?  Or should I incorporate the 
contact information into this letter?

Thanks for your assistance.
