Jim, 

As we discussed, I would like to have nominations for the CLE Planning 
Committee for the 2001 law conference identified before year end so that the 
committee will be able to meet in early January.  Below is draft language for 
inclusion in an email from you to the general counsels of the various 
groups.  


The chair for the CLE Planning Committee for the 2001 Law Conference is 
Michelle Cash.  Each business unit law department should have at least one 
representative on the CLE committee.   The first CLE Planning Committee 
meeting will take place in early January; therefore, please give Michelle the 
name of your group's committee member by December 20.
