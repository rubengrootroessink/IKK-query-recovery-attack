Pat,

I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement 
for Greg Whalley.  I would appreciate your thoughts on the language, 
particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation 
of value for options/restricted stock.  

For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my 
assistant send it under separate email cover.

Thanks a lot.

Michelle
