SUPREME COURT HEARS ARGUMENT ON FORUM FOR INJURED DECKHAND'S
CLAIMS

The U.S. Supreme Court hears oral argument in a case
involving an injured deckhand who wants to pursue a state
court personal injury suit under the Jones Act and a
shipowner who wants instead to proceed with a Limitation of
Liability Act suit in federal court ("Lewis v. Lewis & Clark
Marine Inc., "U.S., No. 99-1331, 11/29/00). James Lewis
claims he injured his back while working aboard a tugboat
owned by Lewis & Clark Marine Inc. on the Mississippi River.
The company sued in federal court in Missouri under the
Limitation Act, which allows shipowners to limit their
liability to the value of the shipowner's interest in the
vessel and its freight if the damage or injury occurred
without the shipowner's knowledge. Lewis then sued in an
Illinois state court, bringing Jones Act and other claims.

Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Limitation
Act suits, which do not allow jury trials, but the "savings
to suitors clause" allows claimants to keep access to "all
other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled" under
other statutes or common law. The Eighth Circuit blocked
Lewis's state court suit, finding the federal court had
exclusive jurisdiction. His attorney argues to the Supreme
Court that the state suit should proceed and only if the
judgment exceeds the value of the vessel and its freight
should the company be able to go to federal court to limit
the judgment. . . . Page AA-1

DOL'S REGULATORY PLAN SUGGESTS FAST RULEMAKING PACE THROUGH
JANUARY

The Labor Department anticipates taking final action on
eight regulations in the next two months that it has
designated as priority items, including updates to its child
labor regulations, simplification of occupational illness
and injury recordkeeping requirements, and efforts to
improve protections for coal miners, according to the
agency's latest regulatory plan. Also on the priority list
is finalization of regulations governing the welfare-to-work
grants program and revisions to the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's steel erection safety requirements.

According to an accompanying semiannual regulatory agenda,
imminent action also is expected on final rules changing the
regulations governing benefit payments under the Black Lung
Benefits Act; establishing new rules for employers dependent
on highly skilled temporary workers under the H-1B program;
streamlining the labor certification process governing the
permanent employment of aliens; banning discrimination
against health care plan participants and beneficiaries
based on health status; and exempting certain government
contracts for commercial services from the Service Contract
Act. OSHA is planning next month to publish two final rules,
one intended to provide for full employee involvement in the
agency's consultation program and the other revising the
existing standard addressing emergency exit routes in
workplaces. . . . Page C-1,  Text E-1,  E-23

'TENDER BACK' AGE BIAS REGULATIONS COMING SOON FROM EEOC

EEOC is on the verge of issuing a final regulation providing
guidance on making payments to employees who waive their
rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
according to the agency's semiannual regulatory agenda
scheduled for publication in the Nov. 30 "Federal Register."

A second regulation, clarifying the application of Section
501 of the Rehabilitation Act as it applies to federal
sector employees, also is scheduled for final publication
soon. However, one of the major regulatory issues facing the
commission, the legality of conversions to "cash balance"
pension plans under the age discrimination act, is not
formally addressed in the agenda. . . . Page C-2,  Text E-84

EIGHTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS BOARD ORDER COUNTING TEMPORARY
WORKER'S BALLOT

The Eighth Circuit upholds the National Labor Relations
Board's decision to count the outcome-determinative ballot
of a temporary employee in a representation election among
on-air personnel of a Kansas City, Mo., television station
owned by New World Communications ("New World Communications
v. NLRB, "8th Cir., No. 99-3228, 11/27/00).

Judge Wollman says the board's decision to count Amanda
Jahn's vote in favor of representation by the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists was supported by
both the "date certain" and the "reasonable expectation"
tests for determining whether a temporary employee is
entitled to vote in a representation election. Jahn's vote
breaks a tie, resulting in a 16-15 outcome in favor of AFTRA
representation. . . . Page A-1

FIRED SOFTWARE FIRM DIRECTOR FAILS TO ESTABLISH BREACHED
CONTRACT

A Texas software company director fired after only a few
months on the job fails to persuade the Fifth Circuit that
the software company breached an employment contract or
fraudulently induced him to leave his old job ("Hamilton v.
Segue Software Inc.,  "5th Cir.,  No. 00-10541,  11/20/00).

The Fifth Circuit affirms summary judgment for Segue
Software Inc. on the claims brought by Randall K. Hamilton,
finding that an employment contract between the parties did
not expressly limit the employer's right under Texas law to
fire Hamilton at will. The court rejects Hamilton's argument
that an offer of an annual salary indicates a one-year
employment contract. In addition, there was no evidence that
Segue or its chief executive officer made any
misrepresentations or fraudulently concealed the company's
financial status in convincing Hamilton to take the job, the
court says. . . . Page A-7

WAGES UP 3.8 PERCENT IN CONTRACTS BARGAINED IN 2000

Data compiled by BNA in the first 48 weeks of 2000 show a
weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
negotiated contracts of 3.8 percent. In the same period last
year, the increase was 3.3 percent. Manufacturing
settlements provided a weighted average increase of 3.2
percent, and the weighted average increase in
nonmanufacturing agreements, excluding construction
contracts, was 4 percent.

Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation are contracts between: ABCO Markets, Fry's, and
Safeway Inc. and the United Food and Commercial Workers;
Dominick's and Jewel Food Stores and the United Food and
Commercial Workers. . . . Page D-12
