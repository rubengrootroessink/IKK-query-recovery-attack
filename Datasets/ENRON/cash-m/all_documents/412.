David,

Hello, I hope all is well with you.  I was out last week on holiday and am 
just now getting back into the swing of things.

Alan and I have spoken about your contract, and I am getting in touch with 
the CU lawyers to work on an appropriate form for Australia.  I will be keep 
you apprised of the status.

Have a good weekend.

Michelle
