Thanks for the draft.

Delaware is the proper state.

I thought the deferral information was sent to you already.   There is no 
"plan" document per se.  Instead, there is a description of the program.  I 
will re-send that to you today if you don't already have it.

Please contact my assistant, Twanda Sweet, for a time to have a conference 
call on the other question.  My morning today is wild; tomorrow probably is 
better.  

Thanks.

Michelle

Dear Michelle,

 Attached are the latest drafts of the Enron Investment Partners
Company Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and the form Award Agreement Under the
Enron Investment Partners Company Incentive Plan.  To aid in your review, I
have also attached redlines of each document highlighting the changes since
the first drafts.  Please note the following points with respect to the
latest drafts:

(1) We need to know what state Enron Investment Partners Company is
incorporated in.

(2) We need a copy of the Enron Deferral Plan.

(3) We need to discuss Gene Humphrey's suggested revisions to Section
7.3(c) of the Plan.

 Once you have had a chance to review the drafts, please call me or
Brian Bloom to discuss your comments and questions.

Very truly yours,
Jeanne Wilson
