Hector -- we do not know the details of how this will work.  It has not been 
finally decided.  I would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing 
until the deal, if it happens, is signed.  Michelle

Hector,
Please clarify this issue that came out of the meeting on Friday:

My group heard the following statement:

If you get a comparable offer from the new company (same title and same 
salary) and you decline the offer then
you are basically resigning from Enron.  You will not be placed into the 
redeployment pool and you are not eligible for 
a severence package.

Pat
