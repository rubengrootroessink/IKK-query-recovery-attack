thoughts?  Michelle

Hello!

An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.  There have been 
three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.  The topic is 
technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.  In this 4th 
edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own 
time.  However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously 
would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the 
book.  She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary 
information, however.

What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?  She is 
willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not 
think that would be worthwhile.  My opinion at this point is that she can do 
it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of 
course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.  I welcome 
your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Michelle
