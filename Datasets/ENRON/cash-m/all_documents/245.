		 Subject: ENA HR Performance Review Meeting

The ENA HR Performance Review Meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 
23rd beginning at 8am at a location to be determined later.  This will be a 
final review of employees below manager level and a prereview meeting for 
managers, directors and sr. directors.  

The meeting will begin at  8am with a review of clerks, jr. professional, and 
sr. professional employees.    Feel free to invite other managers and 
directors on your team to participate in this meeting.

 In preparation for this meeting the following needs to happen asap (note 
that the PEP system opens Monday, May 15):

1.  Employees in your group need to suggest their reviewers using the PEP 
system and provide you a summary of their accomplishments/status of 
objectives.
2.  You need to approve the reviewers and request feedback from the reviewers 
using the PEP system. 
3.  A preliminary evaluation should be completed for each of your employees.

 Call me if you have questions about this process.

Valeria
