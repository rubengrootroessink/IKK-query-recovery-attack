JoAnn,

I left you a voice mail responding to your voice mail containing these 
questions.  I wonder why you didn't get it?  Anyway, the responses are as 
follows:

1.  Thanks for getting it typed into the system.  I look forward to reviewing 
the document.  (I guess that explains why we couldn't find it in our system!!)
2.  New title is fine.  In fact, I am thinking that we should have anyone who 
works in HR sign off on this agreement.  What do you think?  That is the 
plan.  What I'd like to do is take this to the HR Council and have them 
assign a point person in each of their business units to coordinate getting 
this done for the current HR staff, in addition to all future additions to HR.
3.  It should go in PH file, with a copy to me for my files. This will be 
incorporated into the "Procedures".
4.  I have prepared a contractor agreement, which Derek Anderson has.  If you 
need a copy, let me know.  Yes I'd like this copy.  With so many contractors 
working in HR, I believe we need to also include them in this exercise.  
Please forward a copy and I'll include in the process.

Thanks. 

Michelle

Michelle -- per my voice message I left the other day, there are still a few 
outstanding questions I need your feedback on relative to the subject 
document.

I have a hardcopy version which does not indicate a document number.  I am 
having our assistant put this into an electronic version and will forward to 
you for final signoff.
I have retitled the agreement from "Confidentiality Agreement" to "Human 
Resources Information Confidentiality Agreement".
When signed, where do you suggest the signed document be filed -- employees' 
Personnel History (PH) file?
The document is an agreement only between an "employee" and Enron.  What 
about all of the contractors working in HR?  Will they be required to sign a 
similar agreement or should this be covered in the master agreement with the 
vendor and/or individual consultant?

Thanks for your response.
Jo Ann
