Michelle,

I would appreciate an update on your thought on the Volker Eyermann Contract 
that I gave you during our meeting a couple of weeks ago.  We need to get 
something before Volker soon, so that he can have an opportunity to review 
and comment before we start on 15 January 2001 in Kansas City.

Regards
James
