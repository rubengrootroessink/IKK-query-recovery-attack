Cheryl,

Thanks so much for extending your business trip to visit us in Houston.  I 
had a blast with you being here.

I hope that you didn't get sick -- I'd feel awful if you did.  I still have 
the sniffles, but managed to avoid the worst of it (so far).  Cameron perked 
right up after the antibiotics kicked in.   He is his usual self today 
(happily -- he was kind of a pest this weekend --  you really saw him at his 
worst, unfortunately).  We watched How the Grinch Stole Christmas today on 
the Cartoon Network, and he was happy as can be.

I hope you can manage the February trip and weren't frightened off by the 
rough time here last weekend.  When we're not sick, we're really much more 
fun!!  Besides, the pig races await.

gotta go.

Michelle
