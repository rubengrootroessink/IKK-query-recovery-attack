Mandy,  Jane's language looks good.  I would add one thing at the end:  "Of 
course, receipt of an H1B visa transfer and/or permanent resident status will 
depend on whether the INS approves those applications."  Michelle

Michelle,
This is the verbage that Jane gave me for the green card issue Gary Buck 
talked to you about. Please approve and let me know if we need to make any 
changes. Thanks!

I have expanded on it a bit:

As part of the hiring process, the Company will sponsor the transfer of your 
H1-B visa. Please contact Margaret Daffin at 713/345-5083 as soon as possible 
to discuss the documentation necessary to initiate the transfer.  In 
addition, as part of the Performance Management Process at Enron, your job 
performance will be reviewed within the first 6 months of employment 
(year-end 2000).  If your job performance is within the top 33% of your peers 
(employees in the IT function at your level), we will sponsor you for an 
employment-based permanent residency application (green card).  The 
application process will begin shortly after the year-end review is 
finalized.

To get Andre, we have to have some language that provides him an assurance 
that we'll support him for a green card. I discussed this with Beth and she 
is ok with providing some language like this. 

I would propose that we say something to the effect of : "We will support the 
H1B transfer. You will be reviewed for job performance within the first 6 
months. If your job performance is within the top 33% of IT people at your 
level, we will support you for a green card process at the end of the 6 month 
review. 

Even with this language, I think it's iffy that  he'll accept. 


3) I think our critical path on recruiting is as follows : 
Recruiting: Technical team leads for Ken / Regan in the Unify Settlements and 
Accounting area
Recruiting: EDI team lead / developer
Hiring (some assumptions here): Matt Pena as gas operations manager, Paul 
O'Neal as Delphi developer for DCAF.


I really appreciate all the support that ya'll are providing. 

Thanks.
