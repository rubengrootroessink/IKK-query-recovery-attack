I am sending you a link to our newest ASAP on California disability issues.
Our ASAP's are our summaries of important developments in employment law.
If you do not have employees in California, this ASAP probably is not
relevant to your company.  This ASAP addresses a recent bill signed into law
that expands the definition of disability beyond federal law and creates a
new cause of action against employers for failing to engage in the
reasonable accommodation interactive process.
