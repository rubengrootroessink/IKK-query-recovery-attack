Subject: Letters for Personics

Here are the letters that need to get approval for Personics on behalf of the 
Associate and Analsyt program.  I am  still  looking over the last letter.  
Once I have it done I will forward it to you also.  Can you please forward 
these to the necessary persons for approval.  

Thanks!
Althea
