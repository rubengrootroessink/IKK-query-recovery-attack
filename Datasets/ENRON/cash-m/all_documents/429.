Andrea,

Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as 
if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think?

Michelle

Subject: Revised Data Protection Policy

Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy, which is 
required because of directives by the European Union.

Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy.

I would appreciate any comments by Monday, September 11, 2000 so that this 
policy can be rolled out quickly.

Thank you.

Michelle Cash
