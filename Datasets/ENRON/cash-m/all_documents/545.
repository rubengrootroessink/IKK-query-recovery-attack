Michelle -- I doubt that you would have documents of the type described in 
the memo, but given that the Enron Corp. officer signing the filing has 
personal liability for failure to identify the documents requested by the 
form, we need to poll all those involved in the transaction.  To save you 
time, why don't you call me, and I will give you the two minute synopsis of 
the memo, so that you can confirm that you know of no responsive documents.  
x35285.

Lou, based on our earlier conversation, I have not taken time to review 
this.  Let me know if I should review it.  Thanks. Michelle

Subject: HSR Filing

I previously sent to you Ann Ballard's memo re the HSR filing, and to date, 
no one has responded.  Prior to making this filing which is a prerequisite 
for closing, we need to hear back either way----please confirm this directly 
to Ann at 713.853.5285.
