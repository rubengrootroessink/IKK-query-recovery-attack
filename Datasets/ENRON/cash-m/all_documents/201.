Yikes!!!!   I can understand your preoccupation with those issues out there.  
I am sure that you are all "talked out" about it, but if you need an 
empathetic ear, give me a buzz.  Talk to you later.

PS  I saw Julie Parraguirre last night, and she told me to say hello.  She is 
going to be teaching at the same school that Cameron attends!
