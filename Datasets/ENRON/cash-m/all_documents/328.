Trey, it looks like I may have to be in Portland for a mediation on July 27 
-- with travel on the 26th and the 28th.  Are you planning to be gone then, 
too?  If not, I'll schedule this trip (wanna join me with CAC and spend the 
weekend?).

I hope you are having fun and not working too hard.  Don't worry too much 
about me.  Gwyn is coming over to join us for dinner tonight, and Kay is 
dropping by tomorrow -- she offered to watch Cameron if I needed to do 
stuff.  I do miss you, though.

L, M
