Thanks for the description.  Last night, I asked Trey about it, and we went 
onto Amazon.com to look at it.  It looks like a cool toy that Cameron would 
enjoy.  FYI:  the price at Amazon was way less than the price at etoys.  As a 
matter of fact, I told Trey that it would be great to have it for our trip to 
DC in August!  But, we can wait til Christmas, so go ahead with your plans.

Congrats on the furniture.  I am sure that you will be happy with it and will 
love the new look. 

See ya.  Michelle

Leap pad looks like an open book when placed in a child's lap.  There is an
attached pen type instrument which the child can use to point to various
things on the pages and also to indicate whether he/she would like the word
to be pronounced, spelled or sounded.  It comes with a book but other books
can be purchased to be placed in the pad.  That's the best description I can
give since I have never used one.  Check it out when you go to the toy
store.  Good news - several pieces of our living/dining  room furniture are
being delivered tomorrow with all new coordinated materials!  Happy art
looking.  It is fun to look for things to brighten up a room.  G
