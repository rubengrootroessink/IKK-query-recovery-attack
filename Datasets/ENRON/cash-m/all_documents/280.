Alan, I just called our counsel on this matter this morning to find out the 
status.  I believe that Cline has different counsel now, and I will find out 
about this asap.  Michelle

Please look into this and speak with our Charleston counsel, and then apprise

Subject: Clonch lawsuit

I was contacted by Cline's attorney who is handling the Clonch lawsuit.  He 
wants to depose Enron emploees with direct knowledge of the events leading up 
to suit filed by Clonch.  I told him that we will have an Enron lawyer 
contact him.  He is apparently in direct contact with the firm in Charleston 
representing us.  I will wait until we talk before contacting anyone 
regarding the matter.
