Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and 
Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.  MHC

Subject: McConville consulting agreement

McConville's counsel has asked us for language in addition to a mere 
representation that the Enron Milford certificate of incorporation applies to 
ENA to the effect that we will cooperate or at least not unreasonably oppose 
Kevin's making a claim for indemnification should the situation arise.  I 
have drafted language along the lines of what I think he is asking for.  Is 
this something that we would consider agreeing to?
