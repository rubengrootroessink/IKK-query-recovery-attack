Michelle:

FYI, per our conversation.  Wanted to set the agreement to do a project and 
the overall expectations.

Need to go back to each person since they were allowed to choose their 
project -- accepted is an inaccurate word.

Regards,

Bob

Walt:

Per our conversation this afternoon, you have accepted the PRC Historical 
Information and Historical Bonus Information as your project.  These are 
separate activity sets which are closely related.  We have "joined" these 
activity set due to commonality of the PRC and Bonus with Enron, and to 
ensure that you have an adequate workload for your project period.  

As part of this project initialization, you need to:

Determine the Objectives (set with Kathy Schultea, any other individual(s) 
she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and Bob Sparger)
List Activities/Tasks
Set Timelines with Key Dates
Set Deliverables and Targets
Establish Status Reporting

The primary focus is on the  PRC Historical Information set.  It is very 
important that you determine the data sources early on in your project to see 
how you might run all activities in parallel.  If this is not possible, you 
will need to communicate what the issues may be.

The first step is to schedule a meeting with Kathy Schultea, any other 
individual(s) she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and me 
to go through the list above and begin to setup the various components to 
meet the needs of the future staffing teams in the BUs. 

As part of our toolkit, Project Status Report sheets follow.



We need to setup the project status reporting ASAP. 

Upon completion of the project initialization steps, we will meet to discuss 
the performance evaluation process for your project.  Your evaluation will be 
based on several criteria related to the project and your individual 
performance.  Key items that are part of this process include:

Handling of the project initialization stage (includes project planning and 
setup);
Overall quality of the project deliverables (includes work products and 
documentation accuracy and clarity);
The quantity of the overall project work effort (based on volume of the 
effort targeted and completion);
Project management and communication (based on timeliness, accuracy, and 
communication);
Feedback from the project customer base (based on teaming, communication, 
responsiveness, and initiative); and
Other criteria (to be agreed, as appropriate).

The vehicle for evaluation will be the standard PEP form and criteria as used 
in the PRC process.  The items listed above are measurable against the 
specific skills/behaviors that Enron uses in performance evaluation.  
Following are the forms and criteria which will be used in the evaluation 
process.


If you have any questions or concerns, please call me at ext. 31858.

Regards,

Bob
