Debi,

Your response should go as follows.  I suggest doing it in writing, rather 
than an email that could be manipulated.  If you have theri fax number, that 
probably would be best.  Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as 
a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity 
materials.  We prefer to keep our vendor list private.

Dear Ms. Poss,

 Thank you for your written  request for a reference on Contracting 
Solutions.  It is not our practice to provide references for contracting 
agencies.  I would suggest that you contact another company that does 
business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.  I am 
sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives.

 By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me.  
She indicated that you had identified Contracting Solutions as the subject 
matter of your request.  

 Sincerely yours, Debi Vanwey

Debbi,

First off, I am wondering how you knew the company name I was calling on.  I
never gave that other girl the name of the company.

Any how, I am wanting information on Contracting Solutions, Inc.  They
listed your company as a reference, and I have been trying to chase this
down for about two months now.  I have been able to contact the other two
references they had given, but the one with your company has been a bear to
run down.

They stated that they have worked with your company on a permanent
placement.  Is this correct?

How was their performance? (did they respond timely with qualified
candidates? With legitimate resumes of real people or were the people no
longer available when you wanted to interview them?, etc.)

Can you tell me if there have been any problems with this company? (if yes,
what are they.)

Are you currently doing business with them?  (If yes, please proceed to the
next question, if no, Please tell me why?)

Do you have any additional information that would assist me in doing
business with this company?

Is there any way you can respond as soon as possible, I would like to either
approve them or close this file.
