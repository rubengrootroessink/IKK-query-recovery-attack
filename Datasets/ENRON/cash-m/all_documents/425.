Hoyt -- actually, we need only the New York office -- other locations should 
not be included.  Thanks.  Michelle

Subject: Statistics

Under the OWBPA or one of the laws similar to it, we have to present 
statistics to the employees over 40 who were offered the package.  Gloria, 
could you pull together two lists: one would have the names, titles and ages 
of everyone offered the package (Mo and the FX guys) and the other list will 
be the names, titles and ages of everyone else in the US in Enron Metals 
(including ST. Louis and Chicago but excluding Los Angeles), the people who 
were not offered it.  I know that we do not have titles for some of the 
Rudolph wolff folks at this time; please try to get their old titles at RW 
from the RW HR guy and we will use them.  We will need to submit this to 
Michelle Cash soon; we have to give that data to Mo before we can finalize 
his package.

Thanks
Hoyt

I suggest using the entire New York office as the group.  It really doesn't 
matter because the bulk of the people being offered the packages are under 
40, so our statistics look good either way.  Michelle

Michelle, you define the NYC office as the group, and not the FX/Bullion 
traders as the group?  would it look better to show a small group, with 
almost all of them terminated, or a big group with only a few terminated?

Hoyt,

As we discussed, even though Mo and Penner are not part  of this initial 
round, to be on the safe side, we should provide them with data regarding all 
persons in the group (defined as the New York office) who are provided with a 
release and those who are not.  The data should include age and title of 
persons offered packages, and then a separate list of age and titles of 
persons who are not offered packages.

Once this data is pulled together, I will be happy to review it to ensure 
compliance with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, as the DOL has 
interpreted it.

Thanks.

Michelle
