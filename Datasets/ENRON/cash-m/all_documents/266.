I have prepared the attached and forwarded to Drew Lynch.  I am meeting with 
him today.  From my understanding, he agrees with the attached, so we can 
move forward with the payback letter.  Can you assist?

Thanks,

Jane

I agree but there is still no policy in place.  We need to develop a 
mechanism for charging the green cards as well.  Can you assist me with 
drafting something that I can get the individuals to sign?  We currently have 
about 25 in process.

Thanks,

Jane

Jane,

When the Green Card Task Force was alive, we discussed a payback provision if 
the person left within two years after receiving a green card (voluntarily).  
Is this being done?  If not, I think we should talk about it, given all the 
time, energy, resources, funds, etc., being expended on getting a person a 
green card.

Michelle
