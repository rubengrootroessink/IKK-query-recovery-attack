Mark,

As you requested, below is a list of my major accomplishments for the year.  

1. Resolution/management of pre-litigation and litigation matters, 
including:  Dwayne Hart/Utilicorp; Satterwhite; Barrington; Race/Statoil; 
Ross Malme; Rick Blandford; West Boettcher; Anita Suson; Charlie Weymms; 
Steven Cuneo; others.

2.  Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing 
several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost 
200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting 
services agreements).

3. Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the 
OFCCP's "glass ceiling" audit of ENA and all of Enron).

4. Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power, 
Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen, 
and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel. Many 
of these transactions require extensive legal support relating to personnel 
matters after closing.

5. Legal support on labor (union) matters, including successful closing of 
project labor agreements for the construction of generation assets (e.g., 
Pittsburg, 2000 peakers, Pastoria), Unfair Labor Practice matters, training 
on union-related issues in M&A's.

Let me know if you need any more information, and thanks for your support!
