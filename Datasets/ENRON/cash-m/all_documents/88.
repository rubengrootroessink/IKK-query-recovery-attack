The following is a message and attachments from Brian Hiebert:

Re:  Project Canary - Interim Legal Due Diligence and Transaction Analysis 
for the Celgar Pulpmill.

Further to our e-mail of last evening forwarding the above report and the 
enclosed hard copies of this report which you will have received by courier 
this morning, enclosed for replacement of the existing document at Tab 1 is a 
revised version of our overview memorandum.  At the time of sending our 
document last evening I did not yet have our real estate report.  This 
portion of the report has been incorporated.  This document should therefore 
replace the existing document at Tab 1.

Second, enclosed is a more detailed labour/employment due diligence report 
which should replace the existing document at Tab 4 of your binder.

Third, enclosed is a more detailed real estate due diligence report which 
should be placed at Tab 5 of your binder.

Finally, enclosed is a more detailed review of the banking documents and 
security which should be placed at Tab 10.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.
