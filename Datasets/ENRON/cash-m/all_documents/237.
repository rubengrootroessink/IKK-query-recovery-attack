Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail to you, I would like to use 
contractors from the two firms listed below.  Both of these firms have 
contractors available now, so as soon as we get these agreements in place we 
can bring them in and put them to work.  If possible, I'd like any agreement 
we put in place to be flexible enough to allow us to use other contractors in 
the future besides those we currently have identified.  If you need me to do 
anything else or if you are not the right person to talk to, please let me 
know.  Thanks.
