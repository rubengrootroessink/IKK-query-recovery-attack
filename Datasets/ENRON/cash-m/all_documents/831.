David,

The "gardening leave provision would apply beyond the term.

I will make your tweak to 3.4.

I checked the 12-months with Clayton Utz, and they thought it was ok.

I'll forward a new draft in the next day or so.  Hope you had a good trip 
back.

MIchelle

Michelle thanks, Only one point -  it was my understanding that the 
"gardening leave" provision would also apply to a resignation after the end 
of the 2 year period. In other words if I resigned in 4 years (and assuming 
no further service contract had been put in place) the company could prevent 
me taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was 
pay for that period.

Two other points;
The new paragraph in 3.4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary 
for the non-compete period would be paid up-front. Would it be safer to pay 
monthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations?
Have we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non-compete for 
resignations during the term? This is not a concern to me and I am content 
with the existing arrangement for my contract. However, as a far as the 
precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce.

I will call you tomorrow to discuss.
