Jennifer,

Thanks for the email.  Cameron is great.  He loves his new school, even 
though it is not as "working parent friendly" as Cathedral House was. 

Cameron also loves fire engines (and ambulances, and tow trucks, and 
bulldozers and ..... ).  We took Cameron to the Bellaire EMS Open House a few 
weeks ago.  He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the 
driver's seat and "drive."   They also handed out plastic fireman's hats.   
He had a blast!

I look forward to having you back on 36;  I'm moving there as soon as they 
get my phone/computer set up -- I'll spend half days there.

See you later.

Michelle

Michelle,

Thanks for continuing to include me on these mailing lists - We are still 
snowed under on the PEP team (feedback ends on Friday and everyone has waited 
until the last minute...), but I hope to attend these information sessions 
after the Mid Year process is concluded.

How is Cameron?  Jack is turning 4 in two weeks and I can't believe how 
quickly time passes.  He is obsessed with fire engines and we are visiting a 
fire station for his birthday.  I am now the resident expert on fire safety 
and hydrant locations...

I feel rather isolated off in Allen Center, but we will return to 
civilization in August, so perhaps we can meet for lunch.

Thanks,
Jennifer
