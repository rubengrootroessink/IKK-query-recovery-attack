FYI - former Enron employees Jeffrey Bortniker and Lynda Clemmons are the new 
Chief Executive Officer and President/Chief Operating Officer (respectively) 
for Element Re, a new unit of XL Capital Ltd..  The company will provide 
weather risk management insurance, reinsurance and financial products.  
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like us to look into 
this further.
(first announced September 25th)

Thanks,

Kristin
