Kerry, I think I sent a letter and a check for partial payment last week.  
Let me know if you don't get it in the next few days.  Michelle

Michelle:

Remember the issue with the second opinion on antitrust that we had on the
Pittsburg California matter?  We have about a $10,000 bill that we paid to
the other law firm that did the opinion.  You indicated that you had known
about the opinion, but expected something much less expensive.  Of course,
we also sent you the bill several months after the matter concluded.  Any
indication if Enron will pay any part of that bill?  If not, let me know, so
that I can write it off and you will not continue to get reminder notices.
Thanks.
