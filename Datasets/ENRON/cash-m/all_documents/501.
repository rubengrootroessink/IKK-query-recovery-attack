How about this:

Any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to 
appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards; 
the use of the term "guaranteed" on this worksheet does not modify the terms 
and conditions of any such payment/grant.

Too wordy?

Michelle --

Per our conversation, the term sheets list any future grants/bonus payments 
as outlined in employment agreements.  The description that prints along with 
the amount may say "Guaranteed Grant".  Of course we all know that it's 
contingent upon Admin/Comp Committee approval.  However, to keep down any 
question, we thought about adding an asterick and saying:

"Any future referenced payments are contingent upon attaining appropriate 
approvals."

Please word-smith as appropriate.

I appreciate your help.

Mary
