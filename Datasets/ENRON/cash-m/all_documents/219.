Further to our discussion on Tuesday , I am very happy to proceed on the 
basis of Jeff Dodd's draft Agreement ( and draft Data Protection Policy) . 
Can you ask him to prepare a final version and let us have it , please. 

The EU "Data Exporter" entities are as follows:-

UK

Note that Norway is not a member of the EU but , as a member of the European
