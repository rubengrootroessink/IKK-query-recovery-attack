Dear Michelle,

 Attached are the latest drafts of the Enron Investment Partners
Company Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and the form Award Agreement Under the
Enron Investment Partners Company Incentive Plan.  To aid in your review, I
have also attached redlines of each document highlighting the changes since
the first drafts.  Please note the following points with respect to the
latest drafts:

(1) We need to know what state Enron Investment Partners Company is
incorporated in.

(2) We need a copy of the Enron Deferral Plan.

(3) We need to discuss Gene Humphrey's suggested revisions to Section
7.3(c) of the Plan.

 Once you have had a chance to review the drafts, please call me or
Brian Bloom to discuss your comments and questions.

Very truly yours,
Jeanne Wilson
