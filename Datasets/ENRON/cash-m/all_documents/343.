 Attached for your review is an assessment of the General Motors RFP.  I 
focused on specifics related to labor unions, construction, and operations.  
Please call if further reviews or clarifications are desired.  I will be 
prepared to support your efforts and  determinations as this opportunity is 
developed.  I have received the two UAW collective bargaining agreements 
however, it would be premature to tackle those documents until Enron O&M 
objectives are defined.  The opportunity to support pre-construction PLA 
discussions, in concert with GM, should be anticipated Regards,  Rj.
