 You owe nothing, and I'll have to let you know later about whether I
(or we) can join you.

     Michelle:  You have 6 seats for the Orioles-White Sox game on Monday
evening, August 14.  These are the "firm seats" that I mentioned -- along
the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll
send the tickets down to you in the next day or two.  Have fun!
