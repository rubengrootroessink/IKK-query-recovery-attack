Thanks for handling that!  We are looking forward to our trip.  I'll call you 
when we get in and let you know our details.  I look forward to seeing you, 
Mary Lou, and Peter, if available.  See you soon!  Michelle

 Michelle: The tickets went out FedEx today.  If they don't show up
at the appropriate time tomorrow, give me a call and we'll track them down.
