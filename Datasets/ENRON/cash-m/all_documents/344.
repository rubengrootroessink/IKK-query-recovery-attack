Michelle-

Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for 
your consideration.  I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but 
want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy.

Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.  

Thanks,

John

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Phil

With the e-mail transmission (using .pdf files), we'll need you or someone

it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we fill in all the 
details.

Thanks very much,
