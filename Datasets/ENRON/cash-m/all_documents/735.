Please keep your file open.  We still are talking with her, and probably will 
need additional revisions to the document, as well as your advice and

Michelle:
 I sent you a revised settlement agreement on the Lynda Clemmons matter
last week, and I know you were ready to get this one closed out. Is there
anything further I need to be doing on it now? Let me know.
 Best regards,
 Bill
