Privileged and Confidential

In our meeting on Friday, we talked about the summary of complaints that you 
three are going to do.  If possible, I would like to receive those by Tuesday 
night so that they can be reviewed on Wednesday.  We are meeting with 
Beck/Olson on Thursday.

Let me know if that is impossible -- I know you all are swamped with zillions 
of other things!

Thanks.

Michelle
