Yes the two are the new policy and agreement; the "annotated" has not been
revised, but explains the point about Exhibit C to the Agreement.

Jeff, I assume that the two attachments are the revised policies.  If that
is not the case, let me know.  Thanks for your follow up.  Michelle

Wow. You should have received these awhile ago. We had a virus shutdown,
but
I cannot think of any other reason why you do not have these. Let me state
what I attempted to state in my last message:

     1) As to the Data Protection Agreements, we contemplate that an
Exhibit C will be attached that will describe the non-exclusive types of
information that will be personal data. For your information I am resending
the "annotated" version of this agreement to describe the significance of
the removal of brackets. We also added a section 3.g to allow additions to
the purposes for collection. As the regulators in the EU become more
refined
in their analysis and requirements as to the statement of purpose, you
might
need to alter purposes.

     2) As to the Policy itself, we inserted a line that dates the
revision of the policy, and we added a provision in Section 2 corresponding
to the change in Section 3.g mentioned above.

Please call me to let me know that you got this. Should I send something to
John?!

day.

Thanks.

Jeff, here is information from Jon Chapman.  Let's discuss when you have a
chance to review it.  Michelle


-----------------

Michelle,

Further to our discussion on Tuesday , I am very happy to proceed on the
basis
of Jeff Dodd's draft Agreement ( and draft Data Protection Policy) . Can
you
ask
him to prepare a final version and let us have it , please.

The EU "Data Exporter" entities are as follows:-

UK

Enron Europe Limited (also Italy )

I look forward to hearing from you.
