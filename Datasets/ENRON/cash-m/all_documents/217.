Michelle, 

Thank you very much for reviewing and returning the Termination Procedure 
that my group, ENA Competitive Analysis & Business Controls, has been working 
on.  Marissa Womble forwarded the edited procedure to me, and I will make the 
necessary changes to the document.  I truly appreciate your knowledge and 
legal expertise, especially in this matter.  Please note that Marissa Womble 
has rotated into a new group; therefore, please contact either Kristin Walsh 
(ext. 3-9510) or myself (ext. 3-9307) regarding any future policies and 
procedures.

Thank you,

Christa Winfrey
