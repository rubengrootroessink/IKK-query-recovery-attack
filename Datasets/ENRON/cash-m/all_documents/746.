Cindy,

FYI regarding the labor/employment lawyer for EBS -- according to Sharon, she 
was asked to be point person for EBS.  I'll let you know when I talk with 
Mark, which should be early next week upon his return from London.

Have a great weekend!  Is Chelsea giving you a mother's day gift?

Michelle

Dear Kriste:  I agree we need point persons.  I think you might have reversed 
the groups as Rex Rogers and Kristina Mordaunt asked me to be the point 
person for EBS.   I have been the point person for Corp. and Azurix.  It is 
my understanding that you are the point person for EES and Wind Corp.  I 
don't know the status with respect to GPG, EE&CC, APACHI, CALME, South 
America, and India.  During the past year, upon request, I have worked on 
employment agreements for all of these entities.  Thanks.  Sharon

Although we did not discuss it today in our meeting, I believe that Mary's 
group was looking for a point person for each operating company for the 
purpose of division of labor of the preparation of the executive employment 
agreements,  I recommended to Courtney today that  you  be the point person  
for Corp., Azurix, GPG and EE&CC.  I would like to be the point person for 
EES, EBS and Wind.  Of course,  as usual, we will continue to cover for each 
other and  work on what ever agreements come our way in order to get the 
agreements done.  I am sure that there are other operating companies that we 
should divide up but the big ones are noted above.  What do you think?
