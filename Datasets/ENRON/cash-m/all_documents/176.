Jeff, here is information from Jon Chapman.  Let's discuss when you have a 
chance to review it.  Michelle


-----------------

Michelle,

Further to our discussion on Tuesday , I am very happy to proceed on the 
basis of Jeff Dodd's draft Agreement ( and draft Data Protection Policy) . 
Can you ask him to prepare a final version and let us have it , please. 

The EU "Data Exporter" entities are as follows:-

UK

Enron Europe Limited (also Italy )
Enron Power Operations Limited
Enron Teesside Operations Limited
Enron Direct Limited
Enron Engineering Services
Caxios Limited

Norway and Sweden

Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.

Germany

Enron Energie GmbH

Finland

Enron Finland Energy OY

Spain

Enron Espana Energia S.L.

Note that Norway is not a member of the EU but , as a member of the European 
Economic Area , should be treated as an EU member for these purposes.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks.

Jon
