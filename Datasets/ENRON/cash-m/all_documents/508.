At one point in time, many years ago, we required EDS to have a DOT drug and 
alcohol testing program for their DOT-covered employees, who were the IT 
people working at our sites, since they were doing the same job as Enron 
employees and were considered DOT.  We should probably look carefully at 
their current jobs to determine if they are DOT-covered or not.  If they are 
performing DOT-covered jobs, their employer should be required to have a DOT 
Drug and Alcohol Testing program, if not it is not necessary to test them on 
a random basis.  The only random testing this company allows is for 
DOT-covered  and safety sensitive employees in NEPCO and OEC.  Also we have 
no means to test employees from other companies since our random selection is 
accomplished through our payroll system, nor do we want to be in the business 
of testing other's employees.   Hope that helps.  Susan T.

Susan,

The question of random drug testing of non-DOT employees who work 
side-by-side with DOT employees has come up (see below).  My understanding is 
that we do not do random tests except for DOT personnel.  First, am I 
correct?  Second, have we ever done random testing in this type of 
situation?  Your experience would be helpful.

Thanks.

Michelle

Laura,

Sounds like they have a precedence for doing it.  This is a question for 
Michelle Cash.     I would not test non-Dot employees unless there was a 
significant reason.   However, I have worked in a DOT environment and 
understand the desire to test them all.   I don't think it is good practice.

Gary

Gary, what is your opinion of non-DOT employees being subject to random drug 
tests?  This IT department supports the Gas Controllers,  who are subject to 
random drug tests.  My only concern is if we enforce this policy with one IT 
group and not the rest of the group, is that fair?

Gary, I am going to look into this and get back to you once I have researched 
this question.  Thanks.

Subject: DOT random drug testing program

During the EDS to Enron transition I asked about getting the IT staff 
supporting Gas Control into the random drup testing program within Enron. Per 
the transition agreement, EDS had continued the program with an external drug 
testing vendor after we were outsourced to EDS back in 1985. We need to get 
our staff into the Enron internal program. Not everyone in my group is 
effected, but most are. I've listed the names below. The Gas Control support 
staff is framiliar with the program and aware that they are required to 
participate. I haven't heard anything about it from anyone since the 
transition back to Enron so I am assuming this slipped through the cracks.

The staff listed below all support Gas Control, have access to the SCADA 
systems, and could have significant impact to the operation of the 
applications used in Gas Control to monitor and control the pipeline. 

Thanks, Gary
