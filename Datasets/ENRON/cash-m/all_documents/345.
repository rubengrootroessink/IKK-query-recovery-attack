As discussed.

1)Text from B&M document on labour law relating to contract duration states

Quote

The term of an employment contract can be indefinite. However, if an 
employment agreement provides for a definite term, such term may not exceed:

a) one year, or

b) 3 years in regard to agreements with any of the following types of 
employee:

 i) a new employee with special expertise, techniquew or experience 
designated by the MOL which is necessary for research or developement of new 
products, new services, or new technologies;

 ii).a new employee with special expertise, techniquew or experience 
designated by the MOL which is necessary for services that are rendered to 
efffect start-up, change, expansion, scale down or discontinuation of a 
business and that are expected to be completed within a specific period..

Unquote

I seek clarification as to whether we can obtain MOL approval that our senior 
Japanese (say Director level) staff can be categorized under b). Thanks for 
your assistance
