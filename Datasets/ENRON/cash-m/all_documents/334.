Subject:   We've launched SmartPrice.com



OK, so maybe I haven't kept in touch lately - but there's a pretty good
reason for it.  I've been working for a new company called SmartPrice.com,
and we've been pushing hard to get our web site launched.    Now that we've
officially launched, I want to make sure my friends are the first to come by
and use it.  You can find us at http://www.smartprice.com/.

We deliver all of the information you need to make smart long distance
choices.  All you need to do is come to our site, give us a little
information about your calling habits, and we'll find you the best deal.
The best news is: our service is free.

Now that you know what's been keeping me so busy, I hope you'll come to the
site and start saving money.  I think you'll find it's worth it - so far,
our customers have saved an average of 30% on their long distance bills by
using our service.

As I mentioned, our site is fairly new.  We're really interested in learning
as much as possible, and this is where we can use your help.  If you have
suggestions or comments once you've come by the site, please send them to
feedback@smartprice.com.  The more we learn, the better we can make our
site.  (Also, we're breaking in our customer care processes, so if you're
going through the site and have questions, please give us a call at
1-877-550-5317.)

Thanks!

Jeff
