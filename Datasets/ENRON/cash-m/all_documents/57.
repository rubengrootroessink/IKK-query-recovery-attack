CANADIAN PRIVACY LAW RAISES ANTE

Posted at December 04, 2000 07:41 AM Pacific

NEXT MONTH CANADA will enact a law that offers sweeping
privacy protections for its citizens. But the law may
also create legal obligations and data management
problems for potentially thousands of businesses that
exchange data with firms and subsidiaries in Canada,
the United States' largest trading partner.

On Jan. 1, Canada's Personal Information Protection and
Electronic Documents Act becomes law, requiring
businesses to offer Canadian citizens certain
guarantees regarding the collection and use of
personal data. For example, they must get a customer's
consent before sharing data with affiliates or
commercial partners and must provide access to that
data for review.
