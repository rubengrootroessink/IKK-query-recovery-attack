Andrea, 

I don't think we need a certification.  I suggest an email mailout, with the 
policy residing on the hr web site.  It would be a good idea to place a link 
to the policy on all pages that involve HR data, such as PEP, comp data base, 
SAP HR, etc.

Brian, what do you think?

Michelle

Do you need any type of certification that the employee has read and accepts 
like the "Certificate of Compliance"?  Can we put it on the front page of 
ehronline and HROL?  Should this just be an email mailout?  Should this 
reside on the hrwebsite?

Andrea,

Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as 
if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think?

Michelle

Subject: Revised Data Protection Policy

Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy, which is 
required because of directives by the European Union.

Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy.

I would appreciate any comments by Monday, September 11, 2000 so that this 
policy can be rolled out quickly.

Thank you.

Michelle Cash
