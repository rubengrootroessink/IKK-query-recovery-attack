David, on point 2, that type of arrangement has to be approved by the Enron 
Executive Committee.  Let me know if you want a copy of the note describing 
that process, which was sent by Cindy Olson a few weeks ago.    Michelle

Spoke with him about his contract on Monday. We agreed following changes and 
he would sign;

1 - Should read Michael L Brown throughout
2 - He would us to have Mark F send him a note (separately) that says why we 
will rank him as a VP he can continue to use the MD title externally and 
maintain any related travel perq's associated with that.
3 - We should change cash sign-on to 12 months pay back.


 Can you get him final asap. Also Kim/Mel lets draft email for Mark F.


David
