Welcome to the heat!!! 

If you would re-send your resume to me, I'll re-send it to my contacts here 
in town and let them know that you now are available.  I think I may have a 
firm that could use your skills!

Hi Michelle

I hope that you are well. Just to update you, I am now based in Houston 
permanently.

I am still following up the leads you kindly provided me with. However I 
would be grateful if you would consider me for any suitable future positions 
which you become aware of.

Many thanks for your continuing assistance.

Emma Caplan
