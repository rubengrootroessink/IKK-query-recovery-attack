I don't do EBS, but I have asked Kriste Sullivan to send me the info you 
requested.  You also may want to check with Shelly Pierce in EBS compensation 
to see what she knows.  Michelle

Michelle,

Do you do employment agreements for EBS, if not, who is the attorney I should 
contact?  Bill is a Trading Manager for EBS and will be transferring to EGM 
in the near future.  Bill evidently had a draft of an employment agreement 
that was not executed.  Shankman and Nowlan want to offer him a contract and 
want to start with the same terms drafted by EBS.

Thanks,
Shanna
