Hector, we need to check with Kriste Sullivan on this.  I have a vague 
recollection about a group of employees going to Dynegy, and we had to send a 
demand letter to prohibit the improper use of Enron information.  She was 
involved, so could you please send her the email you sent to me?  Then, we 
can discuss a strategy.  Thanks.  Michelle
