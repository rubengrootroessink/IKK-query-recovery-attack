To All -

We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2:30 in EB38C2.  I am hoping to 
have a test version of the site available - especially since it is due for 
release on Friday.  I have not been able to confirm its availability at this 
time.  If it is not available, there is probably not a reason to meet 
tomorrow as I am sure we all have other projects.

I will let you all know what the status is by late today or early a.m. 
tomorrow.
