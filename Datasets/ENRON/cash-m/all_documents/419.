Hello everyone!!

Well, no one is celebrating anything specific, so we haven't had an 
opportunity
for the girls to get together in a while.  Therefore, we have decided to have 
a
NO Excuses Girls Night.

The proposed date is Friday, Sept. 29 -- Are there any major conflicts with 
this
date?

Proposed place is to be determined.  Debbie Rank suggested that a restaurant
would be the easiest.  I offered to have it at my house, but she was concerned
that I would get stuck doing too much and spending too much.  My thought is 
that
if everyone agrees to chip in a bit, we can have it catered, and no one will
