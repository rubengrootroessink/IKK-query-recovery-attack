This E-Mail Contains Legal Advice

In the Barbed Wire Purchase Agreement is the provision that the Purchaser has 
45 days to identify those employees of Company whom it would like the Company 
to terminate from employment prior to closing.  The Seller is providing a 
limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.  The 
indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those 
employees.  This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the 
basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.  The indemnity exclusion also could 
be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.

Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under 
that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.  I 
can assist  you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and 
determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.

Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.
