Subject: Labor Issues response from Pat Mackin

I spoke with Pat Mackin regarding the two representations that I mentioned =
in=20
my Comments to the PSA.  For those that are copied on this email that did n=
ot=20
receive my comments, I have inserted the relevant language below:

 Labor Issues

1) Two different bidders made reference to different parts of Section 414 o=

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  One was Section 414(t)=20
dealing with being treated as a =01&single employer=018 with another party =
and the=20
other was Section 414(n) dealing with =01&leased employees.=018  I have to =
assume=20
that the two are somehow related.  Is there something that we can concede i=

this area to provide our bidders some level of comfort without increasing=

Enron=01,s exposure?? =20


According to Pat, the single employer representation (414(t)) should not be=
=20
added to any of the PSA's because the Peaker and the Pastoria LLCs do not=
=20
have any employees and ENA does not own more than 80% of LV CoGen.=20

The second representation regarding 414(n) and Leased Employees is a=20
representation that can be given by the Peaker and Pastoria LLCs (because t=
he=20
LLCs have no employees and don't lease any employees).  It is unclear,=20
however, whether it is applicable to LV CoGen.  Ron/Andy would either of yo=

please let me know  whether LV CoGen "leases" any employees.  Pat suggested=

that the HR person for LV CoGen should know.
