Wow, this is a shock.  I tried to reach each of you by phone this afternoon.


I suggest we discuss this Monday morning either before or during a
conference call with the Strategy Group.

The EcoElectrica elections held today was won by the United Steelworkers of
America Union with the following results:

UNION--------- 22 VOTES
COMPANY--- 14 vOTES

One employee did not show-up due to sickness.

THIS OUTCOME WAS A TOTAL SURPRISE FOR ME AND THE REST OF THE STAFF.

VICTOR
