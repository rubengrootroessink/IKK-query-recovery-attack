LABOR DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES FINAL 'HELPERS' RULE

The Department of Labor releases a final rule to amend
Davis-Bacon Act regulations to allow contractors on federal
and federally assisted construction projects to use
"helpers" when that practice prevails in an area. The final
rule is scheduled for publication in the Nov. 20 "Federal
Register".

The final rule states that "[a] distinct classification of
'helper' will be issued in wage determinations applicable to
work performed on construction projects covered by the labor
standards provisions of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts."
The agency says, however, that the classification will apply
only where: "(i) the duties of the helper are clearly
defined and distinct from those of any other classification
on the wage determination; (ii) the use of such helpers is
an established prevailing practice in the area; and (iii)
the helper is not employed as a trainee in an informal
training program."

A union attorney expresses doubt the rule will succeed in
setting any helper determination, while a representative of
the Associated Builders and Contractors says the
organization is considering litigation against the rule,
which he says "ignores the realities of the workplace and
refuses to recognize a prevailing class of workers.". . .

NLRB RULES 3-1 AGAINST LABOR SUPPLIER FOR REFUSING TO HIRE
ORGANIZER

Tradesmen International Inc., a supplier of skilled
construction workers, committed an unfair labor practice by
refusing to hire a union organizer who challenged a
construction company's compliance with a city bonding
ordinance, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 3-1
decision ("Tradesmen Int'l Inc., "332 N.L.R.B. No. 107,
10/31/00 [released 11/9/00]). Overturning an administrative
law judge's dismissal of the complaint, Chairman Truesdale
and Members Fox and Liebman find Tradesmen violated Sections
8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act by
refusing to hire Matthew Oakes, a full-time organizer for
Sheet Metal Workers Local 33 in northern Ohio.

"Oakes appeared before [a city board] in furtherance of the
Union's legitimate interest in 'leveling the playing field'
between union and nonunion contractors by ensuring that
[Tradesmen], a nonunion contractor, did not have an unfair
competitive advantage by virtue of its noncompliance with
the surety bond ordinance," the majority writes. Dissenting,
Member Hurtgen asserts that Oakes's activity in testifying
before the city board was not protected because the bond
ordinance "was wholly unrelated to employees' terms and
conditions of employment" and "[t]he bond had no connection
to any labor dispute involving [Tradesmen]." . . . Page A-1,

UFCW, THREE FOOD CHAINS BARGAIN PACTS FOR 16,000 WORKERS IN
ARIZONA

Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union
approve new contracts covering more than 16,000 supermarket
employees at stores operated by Fry's, Safeway Inc., and
ABCO Markets in Arizona.

The three companies bargained separately but simultaneously
with UFCW Local 99, and all three contracts are essentially
the same with minor language differences, according to Local
President William McDonough. The contracts provide wage
increases of $1.20 per hour over term for top-scale
employees. The new food clerk scale goes to $14.17 per hour,
while the top rate for general merchandise clerks is $11.25
per hour. . . . Page A-10

TIME WARNER, DOL SETTLE CHARGES FIRM MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS

Time Warner Inc. and the Labor Department announce that they
have settled for $5.5 million charges that the company
misclassified hundreds of employees as independent
contractors or temporary workers, denying them benefits
coverage in violation of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. DOL filed suit against the company in October
1998 alleging that, since at least 1990, the publishing
giant regularly misclassified workers and failed to examine
whether they met internal and common-law criteria for
benefits eligibility.

The settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York provides that certain
temporary workers and independent contractors who provided
contingent worker services for Time Inc. from 1992 to 1997
and who execute the appropriate documentation provided for
under the terms of the settlement will receive proceeds from
the agreement, the company says, adding that it is not
admitting any liability or wrongdoing. According to the
Labor Department, the settlement may benefit hundreds of
employees of Time Inc. . . . Page A-11

DELAY IN TRANSFER SOUGHT BY EMPLOYEE NOT ADVERSE ACTION

Boeing Co.'s delay in transferring an engineer to a job away
from his supervisor, whom he had accused of harassing him,
does not amount to an adverse employment action, the Tenth
Circuit rules, affirming summary judgment for the company
("Amro v. Boeing Co., "10th Cir., No. 99-3281, 11/14/00).

"He cites no case ... which holds that the mere delay in
obtaining a desired transfer, in the absence of some other
negative or unfavorable effect from the delay, constitutes
an adverse action," Judge Anderson writes for the court. The
only consequence of the transfer delay, the court finds, was
that Amro was forced to face "unpleasant and vulgar
encounters" with his supervisor. The supervisor's conduct,
however, was not "itself sufficiently negative and pervasive
to create an adverse employment action." . . . Page A-6

ARBITRATOR'S AWARD VACATED WHERE UMW DENIED CHANCE TO MAKE
CASE

An arbitrator exceeded his authority under a collective
bargaining agreement when he failed to allow the United Mine
Workers to present evidence that Marrowbone Development Co.
violated the agreement by assigning union work to nonunion
employees, the Fourth Circuit rules, upholding a district
court's decision to vacate the award ("International Union,
United Mine Workers of America v. Marrowbone Dev. Co., "4th
Cir., No. 00-1262, 11/14/00).

"Here, the arbitrator told the Union to meet with
Marrowbone, gather information, negotiate further, and, if
the dispute was still not resolved, present evidence and
argument at a March 26 arbitration hearing," writes Judge
Motz. "Yet the arbitrator issued his award without ever
holding that hearing or affording the Union the opportunity
to present the evidence it had been prepared to offer at the
abbreviated February hearing." "Therefore, despite our usual
deference, we cannot sanction the decision of an arbitrator
who failed to provide a signatory to the arbitration
agreement a full and fair hearing," Motz says. . . . Page
