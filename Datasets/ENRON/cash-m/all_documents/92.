If you're thinking about the scaft, it probably should be grey or a dark 
plaid.   I am giving him a black overcoat, so grey probably would go the 
best.  (He wouldn't like a contrasting color like red).

He also wants a really nice manicure set -- one that has tweezers.

A few more ideas for my Christmas list:

1.  Scarf:  A nice, not too thick, scarf to wear with an overcoat -- i.e. a
little more formal than the old red plaid
2.  Gloves: Leather, again to use with business attire, black

Brooks Brothers would be a good source for both of the above items, but is
not the only place they might be found.  Polo might be another source.
