Hi Michelle, we've finished our due diligence on John Guerriero from Duke.  I 
didn't speak to his references but Paul DeVries did and he and Rob Milnthorp 
are both satisfied that there were no earlier occurrences of the legal 
situation that is unfolding now (or other signs of incompetence or lack of 
judgement).  John is being courted by several companies right now and they 
want to get an offer to him today.  Just wanted to let you know where we were 
on this one....
