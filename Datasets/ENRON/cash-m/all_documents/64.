Y'all:

Can we get them a standard Consulting Services Agreement?  If not, please 
give me a call so we can continue working with them.

Thanks!

Don - We can't sign this agreement, it is strictly for retained search and we 
don't fall under that category. 
Do you have a Consulting Services agreement or a Professional Services 
agreement?? These are the categories we usually fall under.? Please get back 
to me as soon as possible so we can get the legal wrangling out of the way.

Thanks,

Attached you will find the finalized contract with Addendum.? Addendum "A" 
covers qualified candidate criteria, please have Jay Webb review and 
approve.? Addendum "B" covers performance milestones, or activity 
guarantees.? I have only set the milestones for the first four weeks, if 
you decide to move forward with this project I will make additions to the 
milestones as requested.? We are prepared to forward a minimum of 30 
qualified, interested candidates by December 18th, if we can start 
immediately (Monday, 11/20). 

I look forward to your response.
