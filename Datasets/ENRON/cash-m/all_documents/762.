Hi Phil-

The tests appear to be quite comprehensive and are likely to be useful.  Paul 
Davis, from Baker & McKenzie is currently looking into the Japanese legal 
issues and stated that he will be able to respond to us in a couple of days.  
Michelle Cash will be looking at your responses to her queries from the Enron 
perspective.

Best regards,

John

Hi John

The battery of tests includes the following:

a. Global Personality Inventory (GPI) 
description: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data 
collected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists 
from around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in 
general and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct 
scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. 
Japan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual 
contributor norms available. 

b. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens)  
description: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia 
through Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem 
solving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available.

c. Leadership Inventory-plus 
description: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and 
mid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, 
interests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ 
includes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, 
and verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available.

The intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to 
confirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process.  Reference 
checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some 
objective abilities testing against standard norms.  The important thing is 
that we don't use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we 
take on a candidate or not.  

The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important 
part of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such 
in Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal 
impediments I want to proceed with them.

Thanks

Phil-

I have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, 
whose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review.  Please 
reply to Michelle's specific queries in paragraph 3 of her e-mail.

Paul-

Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us with 
the Japanese legal perspective on undertaking these types of activities.  
Also, based on your experience, inform us as to how testing of this nature 
may be perceived in the Japanese market.

Best regards,

John

John,

Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice 
mail and was glad to be in the loop.

In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of 
issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for 
Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).  

Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain 
the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there 
another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references 
from prior employers, etc.)?  

As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that 
address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the 
information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine 
how to proceed.

Michelle

Michelle-

Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for 
your consideration.  I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but 
want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy.

Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.  

Thanks,

John

Hi John

  Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to 
employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes 
to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment 
decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed 
to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our 
use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you 
review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also 
appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with 
abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it 
in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under").

Thanks and regards

Phil

Phil, 
With the e-mail transmission (using .pdf files), we'll need you or someone 
else in Enron to sign a document similar to the attached letter. Please read 
it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we fill in all the 
details.

Thanks very much, 
Douglas
