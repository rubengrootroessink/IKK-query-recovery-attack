Subject: Use of Enron's name in GSP recruiting



Gentlemen, Michelle Cash in Legal has reviewed the engineering advertisement

that we put together for campus and had the comments below.  Michelle is
concerned about how much we tie Enron into the document.

I revised the document as Michelle suggested, see engradv3.  It does not
have
quite the flow that the preceding document had.

Let's discuss this document next week when we are all in New Jersey.  David,
you
might want to talk to Michelle about the bigger issue of keeping Enron's
name
separate from GSP, her phone number is 853.6401

I agree with the issue of de-emphasizing Enron in the communications.  I
would suggest that the communication, as written, could be used to imply
that the candidate would be an Enron employee.  If possible, we should say
that GSP is an LLC that currently is owned 100% by Enron, because, as I
understand it, Enron is going to sell down portions of that facility.
Thus, I want to manage the expectations that the person would be an "Enron"
person.

Could you please forward this message?

Thanks.  Michelle

     David, Michelle, Fran, see the following.  Michelle, once you have
     your discussion with David Howe about the Enron influence, perhaps we
     need to have some writeup that states what we should say and what we
     should not say.

     Jim Burkhead: Dave (Syracuse) and Marty (Miami Ohio) are both going to
     campus on the 14th.  If you could move your date at Maine up to that
     week from the 29th, then we could convene after all three interview
     trips and decide who we want to bring on-site.

     I propose (based on Marty's suggestion) that we try to bring all our
     leading candidates in for a mill visit on the same day (or perhaps one
     day for Dec grads and one day for May grads, if we get that many
     interested candidates), preferably the last week of November.  It will
     be a busy day, but then we can knock it all out then.

     Regarding your campus visits, we are looking for at least two process
     engineers, December grads are fine (actually preferred at the present
     time), and we should also look at environmental engineers if they are
     available at the school you are visiting.  In order to hire two
     process engineers, we probably have to bring eight in for a mill
     visit.

     Margo, is there any way we can get some GSPCLLC brochures or handouts
     for Jim, Mary and Dave to use on campus?

FYI, Houston Legal is recommending that we do not emphasize the Enron
connection.  I think that we are probably okay with the reference to Enron
in
the attached blurb that Marty and Dave put together (attached) but let's
avoid
suggesting to candidates that they can hire on here and then move into
Enron.
Jim and Marty, when you send the attached doc to campus, you might want to
add
your name at the bottom in addition to Dave's to make sure that the
students

know that they can contact you.

David Howe and Mike Parker, do you want to go to any of these campus
visits?


Thanks, Hoyt

     Dave, do you have a date set up?  Let's talk.  go ahead and send it to
     Syracuse.

     Jim Burkhead is working on Maine, i have to call Rutgers and NJIT.
     But I would really like to find 2 Dec grads from the paper schools if
     we could.

     Hoyt

     I believe the attached document is the final version for the process
     engineering position. Please review it. If it looks OK I would like to
     send it off to Syracuse to be posted in the Pulp and Paper Science
     Department. I will schedule a recruiting trip there in November.

     Is anyone going to Maine or Rutgers/NJIT?

     Dave
