Subject: FPL Update

Many of you that had an interest in E2/Endeavor probably heard yesterday that 
FPL and Entergy agreed to merge.  This was a complete surprise to us, and 
unfortunately kills our chances for creating a JV with FPL. We are looking at 
other options, and I am confident that we will be back with another partner.

Thanks for your time and help in this process.

Regards,

Don
