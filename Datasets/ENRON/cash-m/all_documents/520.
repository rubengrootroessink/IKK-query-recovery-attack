Kathy, I think we should do some sort of an assignment agreement.  It does 
not have to be as long and involved as our current ones, but we should paper 
it up.  Michelle

Michelle:

Gary Hanks is putting together a plan on how to better utilize his team in 
supporting Bridgeline with their gas control training.  It may result in 
having his team rotate during this one-month cross-training.  With this, do 
we need to put together assignment letters indicating they will be rotating 
on a monthly basis or can this just happen without an assignment letter.  I 
don't think we need to add any additional compensation for this one-month 
cross training.   All expenses will be paid by Texaco.

Let me know what you think.
