Jeff, Good luck with the EES rotation.  I would like to clarify one thing:  
at this point, I don't know for sure if we are having law students work with 
us during the summer.  Why don't you check with me in April or May to see 
whether we are hiring summer associates.  If so, you are welcome to go 
through the interview process.  Thanks.  Michelle

Thanks for speaking with me yesterday.  I'm leaning toward accepting a 
position at EES, which is the business unit that I believe offers the best 
fit with my background.  Let's plan on speaking again in a few months, 
because I would enjoy devoting the summer to your group.  I can probably 
bounce from EES to Legal, then back to EES to finish out the Associate 
program.  If possible, pencil me in.

Jeff

Michelle:

I'm close to the point when I need to accept an offer.  Adding value to the 
legal function would be my first choice.  Is this still a possibility?  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional information, or if you 
would like to meet.  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but will return on 
Friday.

By the way, I recognize that our legal group doesn't have training and 
development resources like those devoted to new Associates in law firms.  
That's not what I'm looking for, and it doesn't apply to me at my age and 
experience-level.  My proposition is to use primarily my non-legal 
intellectual capital to add value to your group, and only secondarily the 
legal intellectual capital, which I'm still developing, and which will 
improve through osmosis if I'm in your group.

Thanks,

Jeff

To confirm my voicemail, my current rotation ends December 31.  I'm 
interested in a six-month rotation in the legal department beginning January 
2.  I completed 46 hours at the University at Buffalo Law School, before my 
teaching contract expired and the Enron opportunity arose.  The ABA allows 30 
credits to be transferred between law schools, so I began at South Texas 
College of Law with 30 credits, and will complete nine credits this 
semester.  A total of ninety are required.

My schedule tomorrow afternoon and late morning is open.  If you can schedule 
time to meet, I'd appreciate the opportunity.

Jeff
