I am available at 3:00 Wednesday.  I agree that we should convene and 
discuss.  I would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge, but we can 
keep our fingers crossed.  If we don't, then we could discuss strategy for 
negotiations.  Thanks.  Michelle

Subject: Strategy Group conference call


Vincente suggests a conference call Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 or 3:00pm,
to discuss whether there are grounds to challenge the election and to
discuss future strategy.

He will be at the facility Wednesday morning and will have a report about
what happened Friday and the possible grounds for an election challenge.

I think this is a good idea,  Is it ok with you?  If so, is the time
convenient?
