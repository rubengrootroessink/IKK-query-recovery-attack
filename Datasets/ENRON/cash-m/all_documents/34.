Dee, what do you think?  I suggest that we let them handle that, but defer to 
your opinion.  Thanks.  Michelle

Mr. Del Vecchio,
?
We have received materials concerning the pension plan for non-union  
employees at Celgar. The company's latest actuarial report disclosed that as 
of  January 1, 2000:
?
1. The going-concern liabilities exceeded the actuarial value of assets  by? 
C$1,922,342; and
?
2.? The solvency liabilities exceeds the market value of plan assets  by? 
C$1,805,819.
?
We have also received the full text of the plan and its amendments.
?
Will you be reviewing these matters internally or shall we retain a local  
actuarial firm to perform the due diligence?
