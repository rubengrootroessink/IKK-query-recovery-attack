Mark, 

The pay equity issue sounds like the reviews we do every year to ensure that 
people are being paid equitably.  Given that the company has until November 
of next year to get in compliance and to report out on the compliance issue, 
it should be no big deal -- unless there currently are pay inequities.  A 
list of persons in each job, with salary and gender, could allow us to 
determine whether an issue even exists.

Michelle

Christopher -

Based upon your memo and our due diligence effort to date, is there any 
indication of (a) any steps Daishowa has taken to put the committee required 
under the Pay Equity Act or (b) any increase in compensation that would be 
consistent with the Pay Equity Act and therefore enable Daishowa to dispense 
with the need for a committee?  Is there any way to currently assess what 
potential liabilities could be or to view any industry data on this issue 
that may indicate how extensive liability could be???

The main concern is that we are negotiating with Daishowa to be in a position 
to undertake, as of closing, all responsibilities associated with all matters 
disclosed, unless there is a legal noncompliance issue (e.g., failure to 
maintain proper permits).  Since the requirements of the Pay Equity Act have 
not been identified to management as a concern, I need to ensure that this is 
a real issue (mostly from a $'s exposure standpoint) vs. something so remote 
that it should not even be discussed.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.
