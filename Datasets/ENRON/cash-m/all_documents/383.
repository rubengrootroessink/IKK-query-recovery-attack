Dear all,

As promised at today's weekly team meeting, please find attached a copy of 
the "policies and procedures" information that was distributed yesterday to 
MG staff.   
We will be facilitating meetings next Thursday here at Enron House on this 
material so as to afford MG staff an opportunity to ask questions, etc.

Fiona
