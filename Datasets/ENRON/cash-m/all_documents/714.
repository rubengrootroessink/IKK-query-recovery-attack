I was on 38 this a.m. so dropped by your office but you were at a meeting. 
James Mcmillan called me this morning as Ned and I provide legal services on 
the Venezuela LNG project . FYI -  I am working on the commercial documents 
and Ned is working on the construction contract. James called me this morning 
to inquire who the right attorney is that he should be dealing with on 
consulting agreements related to the construction fo the project. ( It does 
get confusing as Ned is handling a consulting agreement for another fellow 
and we have each done consulting agreements for this group in the past - many 
international . )  James advised that you had been in a meeting with him a 
few weeks ago and he understood that you would be assisting and he was 
looking for confirmation of who to contact.  One particular agreement is with 
an individual named Voker Eyerman  who has been working with Enron on a 
contract basis   for 5 years. This individual is due to start work on this 
matter January 8th and James is concerned that this matter be taken care of 
before the holidays. This one seems pretty straight forward and I would be 
happy to do it this week but wanted to run this by you first. 

Let's talk about this at your convenience  today/tomorrow. I told James that 
I would have the time to attend to Voker's contract this week if you were 
unable to do so and that I would discuss this contract and the others with 
you. He is sending me Voker's existing agreement . Look forward to meeting 
you. Nancy 6,7790
