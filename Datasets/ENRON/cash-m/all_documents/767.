Fran,

I am not sure that I ever had an executed document on the loans.  By copy of 
this email, I am asking Twanda to send you what she has that has been signed 
by Dosier.  I will let you fight the payment battles!

Michelle

Michelle, I do not have a copy of the executed document.   Can you provide me 
with the amount due so that I can issue instructions - is this through A/P or 
payroll (with taxes withheld).

Fran

Hi Fran,

Wade Dosier is now in EBS and informed me that he has a forgiveable loan from 
ENA.  He asked me to make sure that the funds were being processed and that 
they were being paid by ENA.  Can you please confirm?  thanks
