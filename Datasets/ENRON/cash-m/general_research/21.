AU - ESSO FINED AU$2M FOR OHS FAILURES THAT KILLED TWO: The Victorian
Supreme Court recently levied maximum fines on Esso Australia for breaches
of occupational health and safety laws relating to an explosion at one of
the three gas processing plants the company runs at Longford in Victoria.
The blast in September of 1998 killed 2 employees and injured eight others.
The Court found Esso's failure to identify hazards in a most hazardous
workplace and to properly train employees about risks justified the maximum
penalties. See: " DPP  <http://www.ecruiting.com.au/express/esso300701.htm>

employers of expatriates, the New South Wales Court of Appeal has recently
upheld a AU$570,000 pay out to an employee who was physically attacked while
on an assignment in Papua New Guinea. The sales employee developed reactive
depression after a thief knocked her to the ground, punched her, and stole
her handbag. The Court found that the employer had breached its duty of care
by failing to provide her with adequate safety advice or measures in a
dangerous location. See: " Pacific Access Pty Ltd v Davies

AU - COURT EXPLORES EXTENT OF EMPLOYERS VICARIOUS LIABILITY: The Supreme
Court of Queensland has confirmed that an employer is not vicariously liable
for the conduct of an employee for acts that are outside their normal range
of duties, such as criminal behavior. In a recent decision, the Court had to
determine whether the plaintiffs, children who were allegedly assaulted by a
teacher, could sue the State Education Department because of its purported
negligence. The Full Bench found that it remains the law in Australia that
an employer generally is not vicariously liable for an assault by an
employee that is an independent and personal act not connected to work the
employee is expressly or impliedly authorized to perform. See " Rich v State
of Queensland <http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/qld/QCA/2001/295.html> ."

Commission. If the union's test case succeeds, employees would be granted
extra days of annual leave for working "extreme hours." The unions' purpose

hours. The hearings for the test case have been set for November of 2001.

Government recently passed legislation which will allow victims of crime to

died as a result of the offence. The entitlement to unpaid leave would cover
attendance for court sitting days including reasonable traveling time. See "

on August 1, 2001 found that the collective agreement covering mine
operator, Ebenezer Mines, applies to an outsourcer of its coal handling
preparation plant due to the operation of the transmission of business
provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The Court found that the
preparation plant was a distinct part of the business which had been
transferred when the outsourcing arrangement was entered into. The
transmission of business provisions operated to transfer Ebenezer's
collective agreement to a successor, assignee, or transmittee of a part of
the business. See " CFMEU v Henry Walker Eltin Contracting Pty Ltd

US - FEW DISABLED WIN BENEFITS: A recent study by the University of North
Carolina concluded that U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
rarely wins benefits for disabled workers filing discrimination claims and
allows most cases to grow stale. The EEOC, however, responds that past
backlogs have been reduced, positive results for claimants have increased,
and the study fails to account for cases that have little legal merit. See "

US - FAILURE TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES OF METHOD OF CALCULATING FMLA LEAVE CAN
RESULT IN LIABILITY: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows
employers to choose among four methods for calculating the twelve month
period in which employees are eligible for twelve weeks of FMLA leave. In a
decision issued on August 8, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit held that if an employer fails to notify employees of its method of
calculation, "the option that provides the most beneficial outcome for the
employee" must be used to determine whether the employee's absences were
covered by the FMLA. See " Bachelder v. America West Airlines, Inc.

US - DESPITE EMPLOYER'S INCLUSION OF MANAGERS ON EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION
COMMITTEES, NLRB RULES COMMITTEES ARE LAWFUL: In a unanimous decision, the
U.S. National Labor Relations Board recently ruled that an employer's use of
employee participation committees that included management members was
lawful and did not violate the National Labor Relations Act. Key to the
ruling was the fact that the committees did not deal with management in a
bilateral fashion of making proposals that are accepted or rejected by
management. Rather, the committees exercised authority, delegated by
management, to operate the plant within certain parameters. See " Crown Cork

US - LOUISIANA SHIPYARD ORDERED TO PAY US$10 MILLION AWARD AND REINSTATE
WORKERS FIRED DURING 6-YEAR ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN: In one of the largest
awards ever obtained against an employer accused of wrongfully running an
anti-union campaign, Louisiana based shipyard Avondale Industries (owned by
Northrop Grumman) was recently ordered by an administrative law judge of the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to pay US$10 million in legal fees,
back pay, and benefits, and to reinstate 22 workers who were fired during
the company's 6-year anti-union campaign. In addition, the employer was
ordered to publish the NLRB order in the primary New Orleans newspaper once
a week for a month. The case arose out of interrogations, warnings, layoffs
and firings conducted by the company after its 4,100 employees voted in 1993
to be unionized by the New Orleans Metal Trades Council. See " Fine For
