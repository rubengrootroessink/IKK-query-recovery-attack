recently informed union leaders that it would be making thousands of job

the slowing worldwide economy coupled with the effects of the U.S. terrorist
attacks will result in weakened consumer confidence which would further harm
the European auto market. Many European automakers have announced similar
production and workforce cutbacks in reaction to the terrorist attacks. See

automaker Fiat recently announced plans to reduce auto production by 30,000
cars and lay-off 20,000 employees in reaction to the terrorist attacks in
the U.S. The attacks have caused many companies, including automakers, to

during the final quarter of 2001. Laid-off workers have been assured that

responsibilities of the trade union. The planned revisions to the Trade
Union Law would establish the protection of employees' legal rights and
benefits as the main mission of trade unions. Unions would also be directed
to negotiate and work to meet employees' "reasonable" demands if employees
stop working or institute a work slowdown. The revisions also would

TW - ESTABLISHMENT OF LABOUR DISPUTE ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION:
Non-governmental labour dispute conciliation groups have established the
"Labour Dispute Arbitration Association of the Republic of China" (LDAA)
which is scheduled to start by the end of 2001. This is the first labour
dispute arbitration institute established by law in Taiwan. According to
Taiwanese Arbitration Law, an arbitration award rendered by LDAA has the
same effect as a court judgement. Although arbitration may lower the
expenses and shorten the period needed to resolve labour disputes, the
arbitration procedure would not be initiated if any one party refuses. The
LDAA said that arbitration is the world trend for labour dispute resolution.

UNDER TITLE VII: Following the termination of her affair with an executive,
a plaintiff alleged that her supervisor gave her poor performance reviews
because the supervisor was friendly with the executive's wife. In a recent

court held that such allegations did not state a claim for sexual harassment

discrimination. See " Pipkins v. City of
