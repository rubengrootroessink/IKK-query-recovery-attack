AU - COURT DENIES PRIORITY TO SOME SEVERANCE PAYOUTS IN REDUNDANCY: A recent
decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court could prevent employees of
insolvent companies being paid a severance payment on redundancy in priority
to ordinary unsecured creditors. The Court found that any order for
severance payments made after a worker's employment was terminated would not
qualify as a "priority payment" under the Corporations Law which gives
priority to severance payments over other unsecured debts when a company is
being wound up. The Court found that claims and debts must exist at the
termination of employment to be entitled to priority. See: " Madden v
Fisher.

INFLATION: A recent paper published by the Reserve Bank of Australia says
that decentralization of wage fixing and productivity growth in the 1990's
have been key elements in Australia's current low inflation economic
environment. Key influences in this environment are the end of comparative
wage justice which required the preservation of pay relativities by
Industrial Tribunals. This has allowed high wage growth areas to remain
isolated. See " Changes In The Determinants Of Inflation In Australia

Government recently enacted reforms aimed at reducing the government-run

groups who have organized several strikes against the new laws which they
say will reduce workers pay-outs. As a result, a judicial inquiry into the
reforms has been commissioned which will stall the full implementation of
the law until its expected report on August 17, 2001. See " Workers'

do so strategically and after consulting with employees or face the loss of
core skills and employee commitment. The study says downsizing in the 1990's
had mixed results, but where it was done as part of a strategic
re-organization to re-focus and improve a business, it has a much less
negative effect on employees. See " Downsizing In Australia

IDminimum - LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE LAWS CONFLICT: Existing
Indonesian law, Staatsblad 1925 No. 647, prohibits children under 14 years
old from working from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. This law generally has been
interpreted to mean that children under 14 years old can work outside those
hours. However, in 1999, Indonesia ratified ILO Convention No. 138 of 1973
on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, which stipulates that the
minimum age for child labour is 15 years old. The convention was ratified by
local law No. 20 of 1999 and therefore supercedes law 647 and as such the
minimum working age in Indonesia is 15 and not 14 years of age. See "

MXfarmworkers - MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLASS ACTION SEEKS WAGES WITHHELD FROM
MEXICAN FARM WORKERS IN 1940'S: Recently, five prominent plaintiffs'
employment law firms filed a multimillion-dollar class action against the
U.S. and Mexican Governments, Wells Fargo Bank, and three Mexican banks to
recover an estimated $US70 million in alleged overdue wages. The suit is
based on a program set up in the 1940s that was designed to protect Mexican
laborers working in the U.S. by deducting 10% from the Mexican workers'
wages to be transferred to Mexican banks where laborers would be able to
withdraw their money. However, the Mexican workers claim they never knew
about the money. See " Migrant Workers Aim For Backpay

on July 12, 2001, the Florida Supreme Court held that an employee who was
injured in a car accident on her way to work was not entitled to workers'

not compensable under the workers' compensation law. The court held that the
"dual purpose" exception to this rule did not apply, since delivering the
newsletter was incidental to her trip. See " Gilbert v. Publix

EMPLOYMENT ACTION: In a decision issued on July 19, 2001, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that the transfer of an employee from
the first to the second shift is not an adverse employment action and
therefore cannot support a claim of constructive discharge under Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The employee argued that the transfer was
deliberately designed to make her working conditions intolerable because she
could no longer be a dedicated wife and caregiver for her husband. The court
rejected this argument, noting that this argument, "rather than eradicating
gender stereotypes that pervade the workplace, instead reinforces them." See

times, building owners often neglect necessary repairs and maintenance that
results in microbial growth in humidifiers, dust and dirt buildup, and
contamination of air intake vents. Improperly maintained air-cooling towers

causes Legionnaire's disease, a form of pneumonia that infects 10,000 to
15,000 Americans annually. Earlier in 2001, Ford Motor Co. shut down a

US - ACCOUNTING CLERK WITH NECK AND ARM PAIN ALLOWED TO SUE UNDER FMLA, BUT
NOT THE ADA: On July 9, 2001, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois ruled that a former accounting clerk fired after
repeatedly requesting leave due to pain in her arms and neck failed to
demonstrate that her employer violated the Americans With Disabilities Act.
However, the employer may have breached the employee's rights under the
Family and Medical Leave Act by refusing to allow her to take unpaid time
off to deal with the symptoms of her condition. See " Shivakumar v. Abbot

US - TERMINATION FOR SEXUALLY OFFENSIVE E-MAILS WAS FOR "JUST CAUSE,"
PRECLUDING EMPLOYEES FROM RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION: Recently, the
Utah Court of Appeals ruled that two employees who were fired for sending
non-business-related e-mail messages with sexually explicit content to
co-workers were not entitled to unemployment compensation because they were
fired for "just cause." The court overruled the state agency's finding that
the employees did not have the requisite "knowledge" of the gravity of their
misdeeds, noting that the employees' conduct was "a flagrant violation of a
universal standard of behavior." See " Autoliv ASP Inc. v. Utah Dep't Of
