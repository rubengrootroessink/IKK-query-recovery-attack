I am pleased to send you the Mid-September 2001 web-based e-mail "Alert"
prepared by Baker & McKenzie's Global Labour, Employment & Employee Benefits
Practice Group ("GLEEB"). The Alert's purpose is to provide our clients and
friends with timely updates in a short "user friendly" fashion with
hyperlinks to articles with more detailed information on employment law
developments from around the world. The Alert is organized into six sections
- Global, Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa/Middle East, South America, and North
America. The Alert consists of short, one-paragraph "blurbs," organized by
country and region. You can quickly scan the Alert for items of particular
interest, and then click on the hyperlinks provided for each blurb for
additional information.

If you would like to be removed from my mailing list for the Baker &
McKenzie Global Employment Law Alert, please type "REMOVE" in the subject

AU - COURT RULING QUESTIONS EMPLOYER ANTI-DISCRIMINATION OBLIGATIONS: A
recent decision of the Victorian Supreme Court challenges key tenets of
Australian anti-discrimination laws and overturns a record AU$161,000
damages award. The Court found that the provision of a modem and a fax
machine sought by an editor to allow her to work from home to care for a
sick child was a "favor" rather than a "reasonable accommodation." The
decision raises the prospect of employers having a lesser obligation than
previously required to make a reasonable accommodation for employees with a
disability or caring responsibilities. The Court found that it would often
be the case that making a reasonable accommodation would not extend to
meeting the "very special needs of people who have recurrently sick
dependants." See " State of Victoria v Schou

Labour Court recently overruled a decision of a district labour court and
granted a part-time employee who had received less wages per hour than his
full-time colleagues for the same work damage compensation under Section 823
of the Civil Code in the amount of the differential pay. According to
Section 2 of the former Act on the Promotion of Employment, which is
identical to Section 4 of the new Part-time and Fixed-Term Employment Act,
it is unlawful to discriminate against part-time workers in favor of
full-time workers on unreasonable grounds. The Court ruled that this was the
case due to the different wages and that Section 2 of the former Act on the
Promotion of Employment was a "statute intended for protection of others
within the meaning of Section 823 Civil Code." See " Part-Time Ruling

DE - NO UNLIMITED DAMAGE CLAIM AFTER VOID DISMISSAL: The Labour Court of
Frankfurt ruled recently that an employee who received a notice of
termination that had been held void by the court cannot claim damages which
result from a termination of his life insurance contract. Due to the loss of
his job, the dismissed employee could not afford to continue to pay his
contributions to his life insurance and terminated the contract. After the
Court stated that the dismissal was in fact void he purchased a new life
insurance with less favorable conditions than the former one. The employee
claimed compensation of the damage resulting from the different conditions
of the life insurance contracts. The Court dismissed his claim on the
grounds that such financial risks have to be borne by employees. See " No

DE - DISMISSAL ONE WEEK AFTER DEATH OF SPOUSE IS NO VIOLATION OF GOOD FAITH:
The German Federal Labour Court recently reaffirmed its general rule
concerning the timing of dismissals. In general, an employer who respects
the mandatory notice periods and the termination protection rules can give
notice whenever and wherever it wants. For example, a notice is not void
because it was given on Christmas day. A dismissal can be contrary to good
faith only in extreme situations. This is, for example, the case if the
employer gives notice at a particular moment in order to deliberately harm
the employee. According to these rules, the Court stated that it is not an
extreme situation when an employee is given notice only a few days after the
death of his spouse. See " Termination

MX - MEXICAN VOLKSWAGON STRIKE HALTED: On September 5, 2001, Volkswagon and
Mexican union leaders reached an agreement effectively ending the 19 day
strike that had crippled the German automaker's production plant near Mexico
City. Negotiations between Volkswagon and Mexican labour officials resulted
in a 10.2% pay raise for the 16,000 workers at the plant. After the union's
initial demands for a 30% wage raise were rebuffed, the unions began a
strike which virtually halted production at the plant, costing Volkswagon an

manufacturing industry was the hardest hit, having lost over one million
jobs since July of 2000. Many economists are worried that continued cutbacks
and job losses will worry consumers, whose steady spending in the midst of
the slowdown has kept the U.S. economy from collapsing into a recession. See

leaders lobbied the U.S.Congress to legalize the status of millions of
undocumented workers, while voicing criticism of an expansion of the
guest-worker program. Union leaders and migrant workers spoke at a news
conference detailing some of the problems faced by undocumented workers,
such as low wages and fears of deportation. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
criticized the guest-worker program as one that would exacerbate the
problems of undocumented workers, putting the workers in "virtual bondage"
with their employer. See " U.S. Labor Unions Back Amnesty For Immigrants
