In light of the recent scare regarding Anthrax, we have prepared a
memorandum for our clients to use in communicating with their employees
about this serious issue, a copy of which is attached.  This memorandum is
based in large part on information recently released by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC").  More information can be obtained at
the CDC's website located at www.cdc.gov.  Please feel free to use the
memorandum as you see fit, and if you have any questions, please contact
Larry Stuart at (713) 427-5027 or reply to this e-mail.
