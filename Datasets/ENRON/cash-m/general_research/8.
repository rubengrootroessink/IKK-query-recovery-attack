Filipino, Chinese, and Korean prisoners of war who claim that they were used
as slave labour by Japanese companies during World War II may not sue for
damages in U.S. courts. U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that
the Treaty of Peace signed by the United States and a multitude of other
nations bars so-called slave labourers from seeking damages from Japanese
companies for work that may have been tantamount to slave labour. The court
decided that allowing the suits to carry on would "unsettle half a century

similar suits. See " Judge

JP - JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS JAPANESE SLAVE LABOUR CASE: On September 18,
2001, a California state court judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a
Japanese company brought by a man who alleged he was forced into slave
labour during World War II. In attempting to dismiss the lawsuit, the
defendants asserted that the Japanese Government made accords to deal with
the slave labour claims, but the judge rejected this argument, stating that
"no prior decision of any branch has approved of the defendant's actions,"
and no treaty ratified by the U.S. addressed the claims of the plaintiff.
There are currently over two dozen cases alleging wartime slave labour in
U.S. state courts, leading many to speculate that this decision may spur
Japanese companies to settle these lawsuits. See " Judge

DE - THREAT OF SICK LEAVE JUSTIFIES TERMINATION FOR CAUSE: The Labour Court
of Cologne recently ruled that an employee gives reason for a termination
for cause if he threatens the employer that he will go on sick leave even
though he is not ill. During a dispute with his superior, the employee in
the case at issue announced that he would go on sick leave for at least
three months. The following day he submitted a medical certificate, stating
he had a tumor on his hand. The tumor, however, would not necessarily have
kept the employee from working. The court therefore held that the employee's
behaviour was clearly an attempt to "punish" the employer and that it
therefore would justify a termination for cause. See " Threat Of

problems, the employee could not work as driver any more and was on sick
leave for more than one year. Therefore, the employer gave constructive
dismissal to him and assigned him a new job as warehouseman, where the
employee was paid less salary then before. The Labour Court of Frankfurt
ruled that the employee had to accept the new job even though his new salary
was lower than his previous salary. See " Constructive

DE - EMPLOYER CANNOT CONTEST LABOUR AUTHORITY'S DECISION REGARDING DISABLITY
STATUS: The District Social Court in Rhineland-Palatine recently ruled that

disability status of an employee. Even though the employee is given special
rights by such a decision, such as extended vacation claims and special
termination protection, the employer must not contest the decision if it
feels it was wrong. According to the District Social Court, the applicable
disability law is meant to protect employees only but does not give any
rights to the employer. See " Disability

DE - SHOP AGREEMENTS DO NOT ALLWAYS SUPERSEDE EXPIRED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENTS: The German Federal Labour Court recently ruled on that in case
of a transfer of business, shop agreements applicable to the buyer's company
do not necessarily supersede other collective regulations applicable to the
employees of the acquired company. In the respective case, the buyer
acquired a company that was previously bound by a collective bargaining
agreement that provided for annual extra payments. The buyer was not a
member of the respective employers' association and therefore not bound by
the respective collective bargaining agreement. The court ruled, however,
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became part of the
individual employment contracts of the employees in accordance with the
German Civil Code. Since the acquired company was located in another city
than the buyer's company, provisions of the collective bargaining agreement
were also not superseded by shop agreements applicable to the buyer's
company. According to the Court, these shop agreements are applicable only
to the employees of the respective plant location but not to the employee of
the acquired company. See " Transfer  <http://bundesarbeitsgericht.de/> of

recently indicated that it remains confident of the future and that
"evolution perspectives for 2002 remain positive." "Growth should be higher

are an indication that the non-stop increase in unemployment since May of

the Ministry of Employment, France is affected by "the slow-down of economic
activity," even if it is "less affected than its European partners."

the National Football League (NFL) Referees Association accepted a six-year
contract, increasing existing salaries by 50% and ending a strike that had

salaries for the referees escalates each year through the 2006 season, when
it raises 125% higher than their current salaries. See " Ref

US - TAMPA JURY FINDS OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE GUILTY OF SEX DISCRIMINATION AND
RETALIATION: On September 19, 2001, a jury in the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Florida awarded US$2.2 million to a former employee
of Outback Steakhouse on whose behalf the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission had brought suit. The jury found that Outback paid the employee
considerably less than a similarly situated male employee who performed the
same job duties. The jury also found that Outback subjected the employee to
different terms and conditions of employment because of her sex and
terminated her in retaliation for her complaints about discrimination. See "

US - FLORIDA APPELLATE COURT QUESTIONS WISDOM OF UNEMPLOYMENT LAW: In a
decision issued on September 21, 2001, Florida's Second District Court of
Appeals upheld the denial of unemployment benefits to a former bank employee
who accepted part-time employment as a telemarketer after she was laid off
from her bank job, then quit her part-time job because it interfered with
her ability to interview for full-time employment. Noting that Florida's
unemployment statute mandates the denial of unemployment benefits in such a
situation, the Court questioned the wisdom of the law, stating that "(i)t
seems inconceivable that any legislator would actually have intended to
forfeit (the employee's) right to unemployment benefits relating to her job
at the bank simply because she attempted to aid her family and maintain her
own self-respect by taking a part-time job that just did not work out." See

agreed to air television ads that detail claims made by disabled persons not
hired by Wal-Mart and pay US$427,000 to the Arizona Center for Disability

with Disabilities Act. The TV ad will feature the complainants describing
their allegations against Wal-Mart and will air daily for two weeks on every
major Tucson and Phoenix television station. The US$427,500 payment will go

US - BANS ON WORKPLACE LANGUAGE NOW LIMITED IN CALIFORNIA: On September 12,
2001, California approved legislation under which, effective January 1,
2002, it is unlawful for an employer to adopt or enforce a policy that
limits or prohibits the use of any particular language in any workplace
except under specific circumstances. Under the new California Government
Code Section 12951, the restriction must be justified by business necessity.
The employer also must notify its employees of the circumstances and the
time when the language restriction is required to be observed and the
consequences for violating the restriction. For the purposes of this
section, "business necessity" means an overriding legitimate business
purpose such that the language restriction is necessary to the safe and
efficient operation of the business, that the language restriction
effectively fulfills the business purpose it is supposed to serve, and there
is no alternative practice to the language restriction that would accomplish
the business purpose equally well with a lesser discriminatory impact. See "
