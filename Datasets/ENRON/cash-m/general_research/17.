articles with more detailed information on employment law developments from
around the world. Hence, the descriptive title of Global Employment Law

World Bank reported that pension reform is becoming an increasingly
important global issue for developing and high-income countries. Many
countries have basic pension plans in place; however, most only cover 10% to
30% of the working population and impose a heavy strain on economic
development. The World Bank favors a multi-pillar pension plan consisting of
minimal contribution by the lifetime poor, access to various financial
instruments for the large informal sector, and a diversified sector for
formal workers.  <mailto:david.w.ellis@bakernet.com>

Organisation of East Carribbean States (OCES), the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) found excessive limitations on
the right to strike for many employees, evident workplace discrimination,
and non co-operation with the ILO. The report coincides with a review of

report. The ICFTU report states that from joint ventures of private
companies and public authorities to complete privatisation of the prison

businesses to the detriment of their inmates, whose basic rights are
regularly violated. See " ICFTU Prison Labour Report

** - EMPLOYER SUED IN WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION WITH INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS:
In a recent wrongful death suit filed in the United States, an employer has
been joined in an action against its employee who allegedly struck and
killed a teenager while driving and making cell phone calls on company
business. In the first case of its kind, the victim's family sought to
extend an employer's liability to the actions of its employees while talking
on a cell phone about company business after business hours. The employer in
this case did not have a internal policy on cell-phone use. Cases such as
this and increased reliance on cell-phones and other remote technology are
prompting many employers to address this issue on an international basis.

breached the employer's internet and email policy, the breach was trivial
and the employer's application of the policy was inconsistent with its
conduct elsewhere. The decision highlights the need for employers to be
careful of overreacting to trivial or technical breaches of email policies
and that they need to properly explain to employees what constitutes
inappropriate or offensive material for the purposes of their policy. See "

UK - LONDON UNDERGROUND STRIKE AVERTED AFTER AGREEMENT WITH UNION: On June
2, 2001, London Underground workers called an end to two days of planned
tube strikes following an agreement on jobs and safety. Representatives from
the Rail Maritime and Transport Union (RMTU) announced the cancellation of
the planned strikes after securing promises from London Underground
management that staff would not face compulsory redundancies or job cuts
which may undermine safety. The RMTU was concerned that proposals to
semi-privatise the tube would lead to job losses which would compromise
safety in the tunnel. See " Jobs Deal Ends Tube Strikes Threat

US - TEXAS INCREASES ITS MINIMUM WAGE TO MATCH FEDERAL LEVELS: Texas
recently enacted a law raising its minimum wage to match the levels set by
federal law under the Fair Labor Standards Act. This new law is largely
symbolic, as Texas employers have historically already had to comply with
the federal minimum wage levels ever since they exceeded the Texas levels.
Prior to the new law, Texas minimum wage levels had been set at US$3.35 per
hour for nonexempt employees and US$1.68 per hour for tipped employees.
Current federal law sets these levels at US$5.15 per hour and US$2.13 per
hour, respectively. See " Bill HB533

ruled that front pay awards in cases under Title VII are not an element of
compensatory damages, and, therefore, not subject to damages caps. The
court's decision was based on the fact that front pay is a remedy that was
authorized under Section 706 of Title VII. Thus, the Supreme Court found
that front pay is not included in the compensatory damages caps imposed
under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  <mailto:gerald.l.maatman@bakernet.com>

US - FEDERAL RESERVE SAYS IMMIGRANTS WAVE MAY SLOW PRODUCTIVITY: On June 12,
2001, a Federal Reserve Report stated that over the next century, U.S.
immigrants will enlarge the labor pool at a time when a growing proportion
of the nation will be retiring. The arrival of these immigrants will
contribute greatly to the U.S. working population. However, the gap between
the average educational attainment of the foreign-and native-born
populations is large. Economists and policy makers are concerned with how a
small workforce will be able to provide for a relatively large number of
dependants without a decline in the U.S. standard of living. See " Fed Says
Immigrants May Slow Productivity

Americans With Disabilities Discrimination Act ("ADA") and air it for two
weeks on major Arizona stations. As a result of the consent decree, in
January of 2000, Wal-Mart hired two deaf employees and paid them back wages
and damages. Wal-Mart also hired a sign-language interpreter during a two
week training period for the employees. However, Wal-Mart was found in

US - CONSUMER CONFIDENCE EDGES UP IN JUNE: The Conference Board reported on
June 27, 2001 that renewed confidence in business and job prospects prompted
a 1.8% point increase in consumer confidence in June, the second straight
monthly jump. The report suggested that "consumers are currently more
optimistic than they have been all year regarding business and job prospects
over the next six months, and while their assessment of current conditions
weakened, the present situation index remains at historically high levels."

US - FEDERAL APPEALS COURT REINSTATES ARBITRATOR'S RULING THAT ORDERED
SEXUAL HARASSER BACK TO JOB: An arbitrator did not violate public policy or
exceed his authority by reinstating a Texas factory worker who had been
discharged for sexually harassing female employees, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled June 7, 2001 . The court stressed that
the pertinent issue was not whether the worker's sexual harassment of female
co-workers itself violates public policy, but rather, whether the collective
bargaining agreement, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does so. In
reversing the lower court's ruling that vacated the arbitration award, the
Court found that there was no explicit, well-defined, dominant public policy
contrary to the arbitrator's decision. See " Arbitrator's Ruling

US - NEW TENNESSEE LAW INCREASES CHILD LABOR PENALTIES: Legislation
increasing the civil and criminal penalties for child labor law violations
(S.L. 01-378) was signed by Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist on June 12, 2001 .
Under the new law, employers of minors younger than 14 years of age and
anyone violating youth peddling provisions are subject to Class D felony
charges and fines of between US$1,000 and US$10,000 for each violation.
Previously, such violations of child labor laws were Class A misdemeanors,
and civil penalties ranged from US$150 to US$1,000. Labor law violations
involving minors aged 14 years or older remain subject to the lower
penalties, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann. 50-5-112. See " Tennessee Child

US - "NO-PIN" POLICY DOES NOT VIOLATE 1ST AMENDMENT: On June 21, 2001, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled a police department's
"no-pin" dress code policy for employees does not violate the 1st Amendment.
The court said the cross pin in this case does not address a legitimate
public concern, and therefore, does not violate the U.S. Constitution. See "
