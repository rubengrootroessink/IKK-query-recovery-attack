Per updated advice today from the bankruptcy attorneys, we are on hold for issuing refunds to employees for pre-petition deductions  that were not remitted to vendors.  This occurred for November's United Way, savings bonds and direct stock purchase deductions.

What happened -
Payroll occurred on Friday, November 30th (pre petition).
The remittance wires to the vendors were prepared on Monday, December 3rd (post petition) and were held from payment.

I know this seems rotten, but we're absolutely on hold until they advise us whether we can issue refunds to employees.
We'll keep you posted.

Terrie

To All -

Just a heads up that the current payroll deductions we are processing include:
Taxes
Benefits (Until Cynthia notifies us otherwise)
401(k)
United Way (But Enron is no longer matching this amount & we're getting a lot of 2002 drop-outs)
Child Care
Garnishments
Accounts Receivable Balances due Enron
Parking

We've discontinued deductions related to:
Body Shop/Met Club/River Athletic Club
Energizer/Marriott
PAC
Savings Bonds
University Donations
Enron Share Purchases (Direct Service)
Auto Repair
Executive Car Care
We or the Program Sponsor have notified the participants by eMail of discontinuance.  Amounts will be refunded on 12/31 payroll, if any, for deductions taken that were not remitted to these vendors.

In addition we've discontinued payments/reimbursements and imputed income related to:
Executive Physicals
Cash Flex Perks
Club Dues
Click-at-Home  (Weil Gotshal said ok since CAH team is gone and amount is small)
Metro Mass Transit (No more free parking tickets.  Employees must pay for out of their pocket.)
