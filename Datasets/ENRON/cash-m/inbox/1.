Michelle,

My previous email was recalled for a minor correction.  If you did receive
the previous email, please replace it with the corrected attachments below.
Again, I have attached the Amendment to the Professional Services Addendum
per your conference call with Jacqueline Barnette, the Siebel Corporate
Counsel.  A copy of the Professional Services Addendum between Siebel and
Enron is also attached as you requested.  If you have any additional
questions or comments, please feel free to contact Jackie directly at (678)
319-4510.
