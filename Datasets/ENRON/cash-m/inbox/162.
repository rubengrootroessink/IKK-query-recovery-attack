Jane:

Can you confirm that Carey resigned all of his director/officer positions?

Nony, can you check and see if Carey is listed in the corporate database as being an officer/director of any companies?

Alan,

I got a request from Carey Sloan that we confirm in writing that he was no longer an officer or board member of any Enron entity as of the last date of his employment.  Can we do that?  If so, who can assist?

Thanks.

Michelle
