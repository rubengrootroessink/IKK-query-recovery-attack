Subject: Question on Employement Contract


Why do lawyers at Enron not return calls from ex-Enron employees.  I would just like a clarification on an employement contract that ended a year ago.  Unfortunately it has a clause stating a non-compete of 90-days from when I resign from Enron.  My supposed contact is Michelle Cash.  Thank you in advance for your response.
