Pat-- 
I am glad that you are back! 
Would you mind reading this string of emails and letting me know your thoughts? 
Thanks.

Michelle, 
It sounds like this employee has a severance agreement, as referenced in Laura Kinningham's message to you and Lizzettee dated 10/9/2001.  Was severance paid outside of the Severance Pay Plan pursuant to a special severance agreement?  Such agreements are not needed when severance is paid under the Severance Pay Plan.  It would be interesting to review this severance agreement.
