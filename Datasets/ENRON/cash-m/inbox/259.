Pursuant to our conference call earlier today, I have attached draft TRO
pleadings for the Jenks, Oklahoma project which can be included in your
files.  These pleadings are simply a guide to what will be prepared for
Arizona and Mississippi.  I will prepare a list of all current local counsel
for the relevant projects and also include proposed local counsel for the
Arizona and Mississippi projects.  At the moment, I am incorporating Mark's
revisions to the statement of position and I will send them as soon as they
have been included.  Please let me know if you need any further information.
