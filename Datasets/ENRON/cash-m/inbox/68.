Michelle-

I hope that this message finds you well and that you are having a great
week.  I spoke with Mark Broadfoot this afternoon and he suggested I try
to reach you through e-mail.  I just would like to inquire with you to
see if you have any feedback regarding the PWD sample that Darlene
Donlan forwarded back to you last week.  If you could please let us know
where that stands, or if you have any feedback and/or questions it would
be greatly appreciated.  Thanks and have a great evening.

Respectfully,

David A. Smith
