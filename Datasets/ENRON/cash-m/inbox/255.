Two things:

here's a list of talking points that Terrie James has mocked up. Comments?

Secondly, is there anything my team can do to help you through your workload around approving all these questions and statements?

I'm can quickly develop some talking points, but can we get concensus on what the messages should be prior to the 3:30 pm meeting?

Here's something for discussion purposes only:
Per the Enron analyst call, we've established which businesses are core to Enron and will move with the merger, as well as those businesses that are no longer core.
To that end, we will quickly begin to restructure the company by downsizing non-core businesses and non-essential functions in an effort to immediately reduce operating expenses.
The timing is unknown, but is expected in the next two to three weeks.
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE REVISED SEVERANCE PACKAGE
No one could have anticipated the convergence of events that have brought us to this point.  While many are saddened by the merger, we must acknowledge that this was by far the best alternative for Enron and its employees.
All employees, including managment, are experiencing some degree of grief and disbelief.  Please continue to maintain your professionalism and treat your coworkers with respect during this difficult time.

This is a rough outline.  I'd enhance whatever we provide HODs.  Keep in mind too, that any new messaging is going to invite a whole new series of questions.  Some initial questions might be 1.) will the revised severance be set until the merger (could it be reduced again for a later round of layoffs), and 2.) will service be bridged if you are layed off by Enron but hired on by Dynegy after the merger.

David,
we have an HR generalists update meeting at 3.30 today. The intent is to provide them an update on the past few days, explain why the questions answering process takes a while, boost their morale a little, and provide them a selection tool/spreadsheet.
I think some updated talking points would be a good idea to add to this.

...following on from the conf call yesterday and specifically covering the implications and methodology around core, non-core and not yet decided?

Lot of people seemed impressed by our comprehensive Monday communications but are increasingly uneasy by lack of updates.

Thoughts?
