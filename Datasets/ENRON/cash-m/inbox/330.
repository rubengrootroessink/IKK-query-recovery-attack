Do you all want to talk/ write to her directly or do you want me to?  Clearly the document she executed was a draft document and didn't even have the consideration section filled out.  We are all so busy so I'd really like to just deal with this once.  We know how persistent she can be.  Please advise.

Thanks!

Mary,

After weeks of consideration, I executed the Separation Agreement and Release to be paid via wire transfer on November 28th.  You were not available, but I left it with Michelle Cash for delivery to you this evening.  I would like payment under this Agreement by wire transfer on Wednesday.  I have made certain those I work with closely know I am available to completely transition as per the terms of the agreement.  

Please execute this Separation Agreement and Release and I will arrange to pick up a copy of this fully executed Agreement tomorrow morning.   Should you have any questions, I will be available at my office number -  713-853-3411.  

Thanks,
Wanda Curry
