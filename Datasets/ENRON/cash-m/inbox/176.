Michelle,
 
Gee, not sure if you've gotten this lovely little bit o' Houston trivia  making its way on the web.  But sure is funny and a nice commentary on how  we use Powerpoint presentations to do just about everything  today.
 
Hey, sent you a Christmas card, um, to your parent's address.  Gee,  where did I put your new address? Want to send it on over for next  year??
 
Unfortunately, won't get to see you in Houston this year b/c, gasp, my  parents are coming to California!  It's gonna be the whole family plate -  Mom, Dad, Laura, Mary and I.  Add Ben and his mom and it's going to be a  terrifying holiday.  Don't you wish you were  here???
 
Karin Snelson might come down, but not sure she wants to join us.   Shoot.
 
Hope all is well with you.  I realize work must just be nuts.   Wishing you a bit o' peace there, too.
 
Cheers,
Suzy
 
PS - just gave notice here at work (a good story, detailed in my  Christmas card), so from now on, it's best to use my personal email (which I  actually  might start checking), which is  suzannethomas@yahoo.com
