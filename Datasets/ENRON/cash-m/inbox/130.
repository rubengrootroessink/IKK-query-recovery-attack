Michelle,

We have processed some employee referral bonuses with a paydate of 12/3/01.  These payments are to 25 employees and total $72,000 gross.  These paychecks have not been released.  Please advise whether these payments should be distributed to the employees or whether they should be reversed.


Thanks,
Diane
