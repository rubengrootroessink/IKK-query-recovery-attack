Act exceptions to 60-day notice are:  (1) Faltering company.  This exceptio=
n, to be narrowly construed, covers situations where a company has sought n=
ew capital, or business in order to stay open and where giving notice would=
 ruin the opportunity to get the new capital or business and applies only t=
o plant closings; (2) Unforeseeable business circumstances.  This exception=
 applies to closings and layoffs that are caused by business circumstances =
that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice would otherwise hav=
e been required; and (3) Natural disaster.  This applies where a closing or=
 layoff is the direct result of a natural disaster, such as a flood, earthq=
uake, drought or storm.          [IMAGE]       Click the following to acces=
