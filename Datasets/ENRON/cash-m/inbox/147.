Anthony,
 
  I'd like to see if you've been able to do anything about my vestment in the cash balance plan.
Currently there is over $18,000 in there and based on Monday's date, I am only 6 days away from
vesting.  As I said before, I have turned down jobs earlier this year so that I can atleast meet this
5 year mark.
 
  Please call me at 281-485-3911 or reply as soon as possible.  
 
Thanks again
 
Jeff lewis
