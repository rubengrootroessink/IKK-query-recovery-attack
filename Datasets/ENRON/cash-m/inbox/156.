This guy has called multiple people over and over again today with the below question.  We have communicated to him that the non-competes are still valid at this time and he would be contacted when and if that changes.  Any further word on this?

Thanks, 
Sarah

Sarah, could you respond on the status of my 90 day
non-compete clause.  With the unforeseen changes to
Enron's business and the subsequent firing of
employees under employment contracts, I would assume
that the 90 day non-compete is no longer valid.  At a
minimum could you please call me at 281-829-1292 or
respond via e-mail.

Thanks,

Juan Hernandez
