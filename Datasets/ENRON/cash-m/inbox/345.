Jenny - Thanks for your help with Comanche.  As a result of some of the earlier work we are now interested in further review of a few individuals.  Could you have your team pull as much of the historical e-mail as possible for the following:
terrie_james@enron.net
Please advise how far back you can go with this.  Also, we would like to include this name in a mailsweeper filter for future e-mail traffic.  
 
We do want to compartment this a little from our overall Comanche effort so we ask that you help us with a second mailbox for this material.  My boss, Scott Tholan, will be the lead on the second mailbox and needs your help getting started.  Could you help him with the following:
    A.) Add the current mailbox, mbx_projcomm, to his desktop.
    B.) Create a second Comanche mailbox with the above filter and add to his desktop.
    C.) Install the pst viewing software on Scott's machine
    D.) Provide the above historical e-mail to Scott
 
Scott can be reached on 58889 should your team need to contact him.  We are on a very short timeframe and need to accelerate this as soon as possible so we greatly appreciate your help.  As always, thanks for your support and please let one of us know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Rus

FYI...  You might want to touch base with Oxley and see if he can send a one liner to Jenny to say "I approve."   Give me a call if you have questions.  Thanks, Rus

Rus,  But this doesn't request PST.   
 
David/Michelle, could one of you ok this?  PST is software that allows viewing of these various file formats.  We are very restricted with who has this software for obvious reasons so I need one of you to ok this request.
 
Thanks.   JR
