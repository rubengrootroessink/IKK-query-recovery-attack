Any update to this?

Is there a way for Enron to pay Infinity electronically?

Dan

Michelle,
What would you suggest?  To jog your memory, Infinity is the outsourcing group Freight Markets is using in Chicago?not for recruiting at all.  Should we just add a PWD (or whatever they're called) reflecting the different rate for the Director?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy,

Who do I need to talk to about changes to our Infinity Customer Solutions contract?

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the contract should reflect that.

Thanks
