Would you mind checking into something for me?  One of our lawyers was called by someone from Industrial Markets who was laid off.  He indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non-compete for involuntary termination.  He said that he called HR to get a waiver of the non-compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted.  Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis?  I find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non-compete for someone we've laid off, so why not grant the waiver?  If this is not the policy, we need to get this straightened out.
