I was wondering if you had read this.  You have to know that people at Enron are getting 5 ratings that do not deserve them.  There is a very big problem.  Even though my situation is not an executive situation, Enron has been my life for 14 years.  I have been a dedicated, hard-working, employee that did not in any way deserve to be forced out of a position because the bosses got along better with other individuals in the group.   I questioned procedures, and shared my knowledge, came up with better ways of doing things and look where it got me.  I was not given the recognition I deserved because of corrupt individuals that were afraid for their own jobs,  now I am leaving and they get to stay.  It looks like this is happening even at high levels.
 
I have been looking every day at postings.  It's not looking promising since I have only until November 18.
