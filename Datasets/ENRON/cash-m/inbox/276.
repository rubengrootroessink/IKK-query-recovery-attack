Mike/Alan,

Jim Weisser below was an EBS employee who was terminated in the last couple of weeks.  He was hired as EJ and seconded to EBS.  This is what has been done with EBS, Metals and EPower.  We have discussed his termination with Baker & McKensie, our local attorney, and they believe there is little merit.

We will keep you abreast.

Joe

I have just received a fax sent to Joe, copied to me, from Jim Weisser, stating that he will be filing suit against Enron Japan Corp. for wrongful termination.  A copy of the fax is on its way to Michelle and Anthony.  Joe, I expect you'll be receiving the original in the mail today.
