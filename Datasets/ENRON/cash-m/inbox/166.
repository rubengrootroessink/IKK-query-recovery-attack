David, Diane really needs to get with you to make sure that our record is clean on the bonus trust establishment.  Would you email her with a time that may be good for her to call you on it?  Thanks.  Mich

I am preparing the documents related to the Trust we established for the retention bonuses.  I need details to prepare the papers.  Please call or e-mail me and let me know when we can talk.  Thanks.
