Michelle,

I hope you had a good Christmas.

I would appreciate if you could please let me know
where you stand with the agreement to release both me
and Enron from the obligations contained in my
employment contract.

I have a firm offer for employment that is running out
of time. I would greatly appreciate your help in
resolving this issue as soon as possible.

I look forward to receiving a draft of the agreement
by email as per our understanding.

Thank you for your attention.

Regards,

Valter Stoiani
