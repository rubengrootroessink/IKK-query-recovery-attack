FYI.

We are trying to get local law advice on the proper termination of the Koran employees.

Alan / Bruce / Anthony

I spoke with YH Jo of Kim & Chang today. He would be prepared to act for us if we are able to pay a fee estimate in advance. I have briefed YH Jo on what we would require, ie:-

1.	Opinion on terminating 3 employees of ECT Korea and assisting in the actual termination (I forwarded the 3 employment contracts for preliminary review).
2.	Dealing with the Landlord of EI Korea regarding handover of the premises and recovering the security deposit.
3.	Deregistration of ECT Korea and EI Korea (including dealing with the freeze on the bank account, if necessary).
4.	Working with accountants (eg. PWC Korea) to sort out assets and liabilities, if required.

I have also asked for their fee estimate and account details if the advance payment is approved.

Alan - I have not copied Michelle cash and Scott Gilchrist on this note. Please advise if I should at this stage.

Will keep all advised.

Regards
Matt
