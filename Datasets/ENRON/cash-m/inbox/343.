Terrie, Cole; I'm forwarding these to Michelle.  Michelle, my view:  1.  Employees who qualify to the 401K class, may exercise their rights without risking their severance.   The severance waiver is not a universal surrender of rights to bring claims.   Regards, Rj.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.
