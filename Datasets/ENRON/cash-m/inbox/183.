Gene,

Following our conversation this morning, I would add 2 further points:

- John D agreed we could add something to 1b that explains what %age of bonus is paid in rest stock (i.e. 25% with a 25% discount) and it's vesting period.
- Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9. Can you let me know whether this is OK with you?

With above and the discussion we had earlier on a couple of other points, could we get a final version?

Thanks

David
