Employee's remedy for a breach of this Agreement by ____ shall be limited to specific performance of ____'s obligations hereunder to make cash payments of the severance benefit described herein, and Employee shall not have a right to any other remedy, including, but not limited to, rescission or reformation of this Agreement.
