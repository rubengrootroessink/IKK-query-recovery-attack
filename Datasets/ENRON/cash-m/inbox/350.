Diane -
Attached is a WORD document addressing the requested items. Please note that this pertains to all Enron companies as we do not purchase insurance on a separate basis for the subsidiary companies. All insurance is purchased in the name of Enron.

Please review and call me at x37904 should you have any questions.
