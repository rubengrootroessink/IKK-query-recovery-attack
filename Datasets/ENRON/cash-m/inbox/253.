I thought it may be helpful to review my notes on information needed to
respond to the Botchlett/Straub charges (although I know you have notes on
the information needed).  We need: 1. The name, title, description of job
function (e.g. had crude oil trading portfolio) and ages of all persons
reporting directly to Wade Doshier and John Nowlan for the period 1/1/99 to
6/1/01 and what happened to them in the organization (e.g. still there,
transferred, terminated) including dates.  For each person if they had
established P&L goals in each year what they were and how well they did
against the goal. 2. The P&L for Botchlett on his own books (as opposed to
his team result) for both 1999 and 2000. 3. The organization charts for the
group managed by Doshier then Shankman back to 1995 if available. 4. Data on
Straub's actual presence in the building from security.
