I received a suspicious phone call from Kathy Delano at Portland General who was asking for the names of the employees who were still reporting to me.  Kathy said that she works for Arlene Barnett (VP HR), who wants to send all of us a 25 page document.   

Without providing them any information, I took down their names and checked the Enron phone book.  I verified that the names are Portland General HR representatives; however, I am not sure why Portland General HR would be wanting to send something to us.    

The number Kathy provided was (503) 464 - 8000 - which appears to be the main Portland General switch board.

Maybe I am being a bit too paranoid - however - can you follow up on this.
