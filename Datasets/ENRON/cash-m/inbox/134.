Please let me know what the bankruptcy folks say in terms of whether the stay extends to regulatory/investigatory proceedings like the EEOC.  Even if the stay applies to the EEOC proceedings, we may need to continue investigating or be unable to claim that we conducted prompt and thorough investigation of claims.
