Attached is both the sick leave policy and link as well as the FMLA policy.  I believe Anne Labbe sent these policies to one or both of you while I was on vacation.  The deadline for approval on these polices has passed.  Please let me know of any changes that you wished made as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Sarah

I think it best that Michelle and I see what you have drafted and provide comments to that.

Have you had a chance to give this some thought - if you want any "must do" language to be put in the policies directed exclusively to HR, please let me know as soon as possible.

Lizzette,

The plan is that effective Jan. 2002 FMLA and Enron's sick leave will run concurrently.  We are also going to have "tier" information - meaning that HR people will view more policy information than the basic employee will.  Do you have any suggestions on what should be included in the tier information for HR regarding FMLA and or sick leave.  At the very least I think we should make it clear that HR is responsible for sending the FMLA notice letter out to employees when they are out sick and HR believes that the illness may fall under FMLA.  What are your thoughts?


Thanks,
Sarah
