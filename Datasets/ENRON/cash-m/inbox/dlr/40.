U.S. WORK-RELATED DEATHS DECREASED 2 PERCENT IN 2000, BLS
SAYS

Fatal injuries in U.S. workplaces dropped by 2 percent from
1999 to 2000, falling from 6,023 to 5,915, according to data
released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of
deaths in 2000 is the lowest total since BLS began counting
workplace deaths nearly a decade ago.

Although the workplace fatality rate declined for most
demographic groups, it increased among Hispanic workers last
year. The figures raise concerns about training and
compliance programs, according to top officials at the Labor
Department and the AFL-CIO. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

D.C. CIRCUIT AGREES WITH NLRB THAT PACIFIC BELL ILLEGALLY
REFUSED TO BARGAIN

Pacific Bell committed unfair labor practices by refusing to
bargain with and provide relevant information to the
Telecommunications International Union, which was in the
process, later aborted, of merging with the Communications
Workers of America, a federal appeals court rules ("Pacific
Bell v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1039, 8/10/01). The
District of Columbia Circuit finds substantial evidence
supports the National Labor Relations Board's determination
that Pacific Bell did not have a good-faith, reasonable
doubt regarding TIU's authority to represent a unit of the
company's service representatives in northern California.

Rejecting Pacific Bell's argument that it was
"understandably uncertain" as to which union was the
bargaining representative, Judge Garland finds the
memorandum of understanding between the two unions clearly
stated that TIU was solely responsible for representing the
workers at the time the company refused to bargain. Garland
also rejects the company's contention that there was a
dispute between the two unions as to which had authority to
bargain for the unit. . . . Page A-6

UAW FILES NLRB PETITION FOR ELECTION AMONG 4,100 NISSAN
WORKERS

The United Auto Workers files a petition with the National
Labor Relations Board seeking an election among some 4,100
production and maintenance employees at a Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. plant in Smyrna, Tenn. If the board can
get an agreement between the company and the union, an
election could be held in approximately 42 days, an NLRB
official says. If a hearing is necessary, an election could
be scheduled within 50 or 60 days of the petition's filing.

This is the fourth attempt by UAW to organize the Nissan
employees in Smyrna since production began at the plant in
1983. In 1989, the union lost an election by a vote of 1,622
to 711. In both 1997 and 2000 the union walked away from
active organizing campaigns, according to Nissan. . . . Page

WTI PROJECTS MODEST PAY GAINS IN WEAK LABOR MARKET

Reflecting sluggish demand for labor as the economic
slowdown persists, the Wage Trend Indicator points toward
modest private industry wage increases at least through the
end of this year, according to the latest WTI figures
released by BNA.

The WTI's preliminary reading for third-quarter 2001 is
100.47, down slightly from 100.50 in the second quarter and
100.71 in the first quarter (second-quarter 1976=100). "The
WTI is suggesting that wage inflation will remain just below
4 percent over the next few months," says economist Joel
Popkin, whose consulting firm developed the quarterly
measure for BNA. . . . Page D-1

LABOR SOLICITOR REJECTS ALJ USE OF SUBPOENAS IN
WHISTLEBLOWER CASE

In an effort to adopt a uniform approach to the use of
subpoenas in administrative litigation, the acting solicitor
of labor rejects an internal holding that administrative law
judges may issue subpoenas in whistleblower cases brought
under the Energy Reorganization Act. In a staff policy
directive, Howard Radzely, acting solicitor of labor,
disagrees with a decision of the Labor Department's
Administrative Review Board holding that administrative law
judges have subpoena power under the ERA's whistleblower
provision. The board, he says, ""in dictum, "reached the
novel conclusion that administrative law judges possess the
authority to issue subpoenas under" the ERA "despite the
absence of any clear indication that Congress authorized
their use in whistleblower proceedings."

A review by the solicitor's Fair Labor Standards Division
determined that the board's conclusion "is at odds with the
principle that agencies possess subpoena authority only upon
a clear grant of such authority by Congress," the directive
says. "Because the board's reasoning is erroneous," the
Labor Department should not rely on its ""dictum" in
requesting subpoenas or responding to subpoenas in
litigation before the department's adjudicative agencies,"
the directive says. . . . Page A-1

USE OF RACIAL SLUR DURING ELECTION DID NOT TAINT OUTCOME,
COURT AFFIRMS

An employee's use of a racial slur while waiting in line to
vote in a representation election did not taint the
election's outcome, the Sixth Circuit affirms, enforcing an
order by the National Labor Relations Board requiring a
Cleveland foundry to bargain with the United Auto Workers
("NLRB v. Foundry Div. of Alcon Ind. Inc., "6th Cir., No.
00-5062, 8/9/01).

The use of the slur in this case did not constitute an
appeal by UAW or by Foundry Division of Alcon Industries
Inc. to the racial prejudices of the employees, Judge Jones
finds, ruling that the employer violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain. . . . Page A-1

   nonunion contractors working under the agreement to bring
   a certain "core" of nonunion workers. However, all

   agree to recognize the signatory unions as "the sole and
