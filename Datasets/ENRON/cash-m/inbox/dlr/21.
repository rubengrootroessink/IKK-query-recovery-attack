D.C. CIRCUIT DIRECTS NLRB TO RECONSIDER DECISION ON
GOOD-FAITH DOUBT

The National Labor Relations Board must reconsider whether
Willamette Industries Inc.'s objectionable conduct before a
decertification election lost by a union contaminated the
election and left the company unable to claim a good-faith
doubt that a majority of employees supported the union, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules ("Willamette Indus. Inc.
v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1366, 6/19/01). Judge Ginsburg
decides the board misapplied the good-faith doubt standard.
The board held that Willamette, by waiving its right to
appeal a hearing officer's determination that the
decertification election should have been set aside because
of the company's objectionable conduct, left the election
result tainted and therefore had no basis for a good-faith
doubt.

"Even if Willamette's waiver can be construed as an
acknowledgment that 'the results of the tally ... stood
tainted,'--a matter cast in some doubt by the
[administrative law judge's] statement that Willamette
agreed to the waiver 'in an effort to expedite a rerun
election,'--this court has clearly held that objectionable
conduct during an election campaign does not always carry
such a taint," Ginsburg says. . . . Page AA-1

SEVENTH CIRCUIT ENFORCES NLRB ORDER REQUIRING BACK PAY,
PENSION CREDITS

The Seventh Circuit enforces a National Labor Relations
Board order requiring U.S. Can Co. to pay $1.5 million in
back pay plus pension credits and other fringe benefits to
28 employees who were denied opportunities to transfer to
other plants ("United States Can Co. v. NLRB, "7th Cir., No.
99-2828, 6/19/01). In so ruling, the appeals court refuses
to give the company credit against the back-pay award for
pension benefits the employees received when they were laid
off and denied the opportunity to transfer to another plant.

The court rejects U.S. Can's contention that the 28
employees would not have transferred, even if they had been
offered the chance. "For an employee eligible to retire, the
decision to work another year at a distant plant is no
different from the decision to work another year locally,"
Judge Easterbrook writes for the court. "The employee gives
up the pension benefit that could have been received
immediately, getting in return a salary plus pension
contributions that increase the monthly benefit later.". . .

DOCTOR'S LACK OF ENTERPRISE, NOT PREGNANCY, WAS CAUSE FOR
FIRING

A Chicago pediatrician was terminated from her
hospital-subsidized position because of her lack of
enterprise, not her pregnancy, the Seventh Circuit rules,
dismissing her sex discrimination claim against her former
employer  ("Clay v. Holy Cross Hospital, "7th Cir., No.
00-2916, 6/14/01).

In affirming a lower court's summary judgment in favor of
Holy Cross Hospital, the Seventh Circuit rejects Dr. Pamela
Clay's allegation that the discharge--a week after she
formally announced her pregnancy and two months before she
gave birth--was prompted by her condition in violation of
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Clay, who was discharged along with eight other physicians,
was terminated from a hospital-affiliated network of private
doctors because a Holy Cross vice president determined that
she "lacked the drive, work ethic, and dedication to grow
her practice into a profitable enterprise," the appeals
court says. . . . Page A-1

COURT SAYS NONWHITE WORKER CAN SUE  BASED ON ANTI-WHITE
SLURS

A Maryland state prison employee with a Filipino and Native
American ethnic background whose co-worker repeatedly called
him  "white boy" and "cracker," can sue the prison for
failing to address a racially hostile environment, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland rules ("Bell v.
Md., "D. Md., No. CCB-99-451, 6/13/01).

It was irrelevant that the harasser was not "technically
accurate" in describing plaintiff Steven P. Bell's race,
Judge Blake finds, saying Bell established that the racially
hostile comments were directed at him. In addition, given
the trust needed between co-workers in a correctional
facility, Bell established that the harassment threatened
his physical safety and interfered with his job, the court
states, denying the prison's bid for summary judgment on the
hostile environment claim under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. . . . Page A-4

OLDER WORKER NOT SIMILARLY SITUATED TO CO-WORKER WITH BETTER
REVIEWS

A 57-year-old claims handler for State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co. could not show that he was
similarly situated to a younger co-worker who received
better performance reviews, the Eighth Circuit rules,
finding Frank X. Wilcox failed to prove that the reasons for
his firing were a pretext for discrimination ("Wilcox v.
State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., " 8th Cir., No. 00-2516,
6/11/01).

Wilcox was "repeatedly admonished" for including personal
opinions in his claims files, the court says. He also was
the only person among his co-workers "who continually
received complaints from State Farm's policy-holders about
his rude and uncourteous attitude" and who showed a
persistent unwillingness to address criticisms and accept
directions, the court adds. It finds Wilcox cannot fairly
compare himself to his co-worker to raise an inference of
pretext on State Farm's part. . . . Page A-3
