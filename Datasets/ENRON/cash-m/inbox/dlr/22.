FULL NINTH CIRCUIT RULES PRIVACY CLAIMS NOT PREEMPTED BY
LMRA

A state law suit challenging Consolidated Freightways Inc.'s
secret surveillance of employees in the restroom of a
California trucking terminal is not preempted by the
Labor-Management Relations Act, the Ninth Circuit rules 10-1
("Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways Inc., "9th Cir. (en
banc), No. 98-55657, 6/15/01). Reversing a lower court's
dismissal of the invasion of privacy claims, the appeals
court finds the claims "are not even arguably covered by the
collective bargaining agreement" between Consolidated and
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 63. The appeals
court clarifies the analysis that should be used in
determining whether state law claims are preempted by LMRA
Section 301, which gives federal courts jurisdiction to
decide suits alleging breach of a bargaining contract.

The appeals court ruled 9-2 that, because California
criminal law bars the use of two-way mirrors in restrooms,
employers and unions cannot bargain for contracts allowing
such illegal surveillance. Again ruling 9-2, the court
reverses dismissal of claims by approximately 274 workers of
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Judge Fisher
says because the challenged conduct violates California
criminal law, it is therefore "outrageous," a requirement
for proving intentional infliction of emotional distress. .

FIRED UNION SALTS ENTITLED TO BACK PAY, D.C. CIRCUIT AFFIRMS

Five union advocates denied jobs or discharged from
positions with an Oregon electrical contractor because of
their union activity are entitled to back pay under the
National Labor Relations Act, the District of Columbia
Circuit affirms ("Tualatin Electric Inc. v. NLRB,  "D.C.
Cir.,  No. 00-1242,  6/15/01).

Judge Ginsburg rejects Tualatin Electric Inc.'s position
that the National Labor Relations Board erred in awarding
the union "salts"--union members who apply for work at
nonunion firms in order to organize the workforce from
within--back pay and in calculating the amount of back pay
due. The board's determination was based on a reasonable
interpretation of the act, the court says, enforcing the
board's order requiring Tualatin to pay the workers $50,518
plus interest. . . . Page A-1

NUMBER OF REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS DECLINED IN 2000

The number of representation elections and the number of
eligible voters in elections won by unions decreased in 2000
from the totals in 1999, according to preliminary findings
from National Labor Relations Board data analyzed by BNA
PLUS, BNA's research division. At the same time, the union
win rate edged up somewhat.

The number of elections held in 2000 decreased to 2,849 from
3,114 in 1999, an 8.5 percent decrease. The number of
elections won by unions decreased to 1,484 in 2000 from
1,598 in 1999, but the union win rate increased to 52.1
percent from 51.3 percent one year before. The number of
decertification elections held in 2000 decreased to 357 from
387 in 1999. Unions prevailed in 31.1 percent, down from
34.9 percent in 1999. . . . Page B-1

ILO MEMBERS AGREE TO EXAMINE SOCIAL IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION

 Members of the International Labor Organization agree to
carry out a comprehensive assessment of the social impact of
globalization, a move that is being viewed as a possible
solution to the debate within the World Trade Organization
on trade and labor standards.

Representatives from governments, employer groups, and labor
unions, meeting under the aegis of the ILO's Working Party
on the Social Dimension of Globalization, agree to carry out
what the ILO secretariat proposes to be a "major,
authoritative report that makes a comprehensive and in-depth
analysis of the social dimension of globalization,
particularly the interaction between the global economy and
the world of work."

The report, to be prepared over the next two years, under
the overall responsibility of the ILO's director-general,
would "constitute a first effort within the multilateral
system to map out all the highly complex issues involved in
achieving a more integrated approach to the social impact of
globalization," according to the ILO secretariat's proposal.

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED PROVISIONS OF NEW TAX LAW SUMMARIZED

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001, signed into law June 7, contains tax breaks for
employers offering tuition assistance and child care
facilities or referrals, as well as more than 60 items that
reform employer-sponsored pension plans. Employment
provisions of the law are examined in a report in this
issue.

Among other things, the law: permanently extends the
exclusion for employer-provided education assistance; gives
tax credits to employers that provide child care facilities
and referral services to employees; raises the dollar limit
for annual elective deferrals for Sections 401(k), 403(b)
annuities, 457, and salary-reduction simplified employee
pensions; increases the maximum annual benefit payable at
retirement for defined benefit plans; and increases the
maximum elective deferrals to SIMPLE retirement plans. . . .
