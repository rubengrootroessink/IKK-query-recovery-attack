FAILURE TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE RULED SEX BIAS

In the first federal court decision on the issue, the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington rules
that Bartell Drug Co. violated the sex discrimination
provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by
excluding prescription contraceptive coverage from its
employee health benefit plan  ("Erickson v. Bartell Drug
Co., "W.D. Wash., No. C00-1213L, 6/12/01).

"Although the plan covers almost all drugs and devices used
by men, the exclusion of prescription contraceptives creates
a gaping hole in the coverage offered to female employees,
leaving a fundamental and immediate healthcare need
uncovered," Judge Lasnik writes, in granting summary
judgment to a class of female employees.

 "Title VII requires employers to recognize the differences
between the sexes and provide equally comprehensive
coverage, even if that means providing additional benefits
to cover women-only expenses," he holds, citing U.S. Supreme
Court rulings dating back to 1976. Bartell, a Seattle-based
chain of family-run drug stores, says its policy already has
been changed and that there was no intent to discriminate.
The National Women's Law Center hails the ruling as
"historic." . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

SEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES NLRB WAS JUSTIFIED IN DISREGARDING
SETTLEMENT

The National Labor Relations Board was justified in
disregarding a settlement agreement that nursing home
operator Beverly California Corp. reached with two illegally
fired nursing assistants and awarding higher amounts of back
pay than called for in the agreement, the Seventh Circuit
rules ("Beverly Calif. Corp. v. NLRB, "7th Cir., No.
99-4121, 6/8/01). The board ruled that Janet Glenn and Debra
Wiley, who worked at a nursing home in Kokomo, Ind., were
discharged because of their pro-union views and their
complaints about working conditions. The board later
affirmed an administrative law judge's decision to disregard
the settlement agreement, which covered race discrimination
claims and purported to settle back pay for unfair labor
practice charges filed by United Food and Commercial Workers
Local 917. The board ordered Beverly to pay Glenn $23,169
and Wiley $34,203, far more than the $4,000 and $5,000
payments called for in the settlement.

"NLRB is not statutorily obligated to honor settlement
agreements," Judge Bauer points out. He emphasizes that both
the NLRB general counsel and the union "were completely
circumvented" and opposed the settlement when they learned
of it. The appeals court also agrees with the board's
finding that the settlement amounts were unreasonable under
the circumstances. . . . Page A-7

INDEPENDENT STEEL UNION MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACTS WITH
WEIRTON STEEL

Members of the Independent Steelworkers Union ratify three
separate 15-month contracts covering some 3,500 Weirton
Steel Corp. workers. Almost 75 percent of union members
voted in favor of the contracts, which cover the company's
3,100 hourly production and maintenance workers,
approximately 400 salaried, nonexempt workers in technical
and clerical positions, and eight nurses on the professional
staff, says Mark Glyptis, president of the union. The
contracts are retroactive to March 25 when the previous
54-month contracts expired.

 Glyptis says a reopener option included in the new
contracts is "unique" in that either side can initiate
bargaining if conditions in the steel industry improve or
worsen. Gregg Warren, Weirton's spokesman, says the
contracts do not contain any concessions, retain the
existing health package, maintain the base wage structure,
and enhance retirement formulas for those who retire while
the contracts are in effect.

John H. Walker, president of Weirton, says the contracts
provide the company "with a greater ability to restructure
in a more effective and expedient manner as the market
changes ... [and] include the option of reopening
negotiations to deal with market conditions." . . . Page A-1

SEATTLE ELECTRICIANS APPROVE THREE-YEAR CONTRACT RAISING
PAY, BENEFITS $7

Members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local 46 in Seattle approve a new three-year contract with
the National Electrical Contractors Association that
provides wage and benefit increases totaling $7.01 per hour
over term for about 3,000 inside wiremen in four counties in
western Washington.  Increases under the agreement take
effect every six months and will result in a total wage and
benefit package of $46.84 per hour for journeymen in the
final six months of the contract, according to data provided
by Local 46.

Barry Sherman, assistant manager of the NECA chapter in
Seattle, says the six-month splits made less impact on
current projects, but he expresses concern that the
settlement may impact long-term market share of union
contractors competing with nonunion firms. Included in the
new agreement were several language changes, including an
expansion of start-time hours. Under the expired contract,
employers could require workers to start work between 6:30
a.m. and 8 a.m. without incurring premium pay charges. Under
the new contract, employers have the option of requiring
workers to report to work as early as 6 a.m. . . . Page A-4

BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S BLUEPRINT FOR OSHA DISCUSSED AT
CONFERENCE

Labor Secretary Chao will decide within weeks the future of
Clinton administration rules governing the recording of
workplace injuries and illnesses, the acting head of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration says. Acting
Administrator Layne tells participants at the American
Society of  Safety Engineers Safety 2001 conference and
exposition in Anaheim, Calif., that Chao also has scheduled
hearings on ergonomics and will decide by September how to
proceed on the issue.

Over the next few years, a greater emphasis will be placed
on reaching out to employers, employees, academia, and
professional  associations to determine better ways to
implement job safety and health protections, Layne says.
Also at the meeting, OSHA's head of the Directorate of
Construction presents figures showing fatality rates in the
construction industry and how OSHA is seeking to reduce
those numbers. . . . Page C-1
