Route 66: Legal Kicks and Conflicts
Texas Lawyer
It started with a talk show comment about beef, but it turned into
one of the biggest legal beefs in Route 66 country -- a circus
atmosphere prevailed when Oprah Winfrey came to trial under the
so-called "veggie libel law." This week Texas Lawyer's Route 66
series continues with the Oprah trial in Amarillo, as well as a
look back at a high-profile murder trial that was moved to Potter
County. Harris County DA Chuck Rosenthal recounts the prosecution's
underdog victory.

***  Texas Supreme Court  ***

OTHER - ELECTION LAW
Perry v. Del Rio
Dominant jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a court by the filing
of a claim, either by an original or amended pleading, unless the
claim was ripe when the filing was made; a claim's lack of ripeness
when filed is not a jurisdictional infirmity requiring dismissal if
the case has matured. Supreme Court of Texas, No. 01-0728; Posted
September 10, 2001.

There is nothing to prohibit appellant from claiming ineffective
assistance of counsel during the punishment hearing on appeal; the
record is therefore "necessary to the appeal's resolution" as is
required by Rule 34.6(f)(3). Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, No.
1193-00; Posted September 12, 2001.

Because the blow with the bottle indisputably caused serious bodily

Court of Criminal Appeals, No. 1195-00; Posted September 12, 2001.
http://www5.law.com/tx/sub/opinions/fulltext/cca/2001c/1195-00.htm


CRIMINAL - TEXAS PENAL CODE ?12.42(C)(2)
Scott v. State
When a statute explicitly restricts the collateral consequences of
an offense, the defendant is entitled to rely on that restriction;
punishment for the offense is increased by the removal of the
statutory restriction, and such an increase in punishment
constitutes an ex post facto law. Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,
No. 1220-00; Posted September 12, 2001.
http://www5.law.com/tx/sub/opinions/fulltext/cca/2001c/1220-00.htm

Testimony concerning the meaning behind appellant's tattoos was

http://www5.law.com/tx/sub/opinions/fulltext/cca/2001c/73-591.htm


CRIMINAL - JURIES
Wamget v. State
The notion of "race" ought to be as broadly understood for purposes
of Batson and the Equal Protection Clause as it is has been

No. 926-00; Posted September 12, 2001.

***  Texas Courts of Appeal  ***


INSURANCE - TEXAS INSURANCE CODE ARTICLE 21.21-8
Cortez v. Progressive County Mutual Insurance Co.
The plain language of article 21.21-8 provides a definition of
unfair discrimination; looking exclusively to article 21.21-6 to
define such term would ignore the plain language of article
21.21-8. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-99-00846-CV; Posted
September 13, 2001.

Because the Legislature has not limited with unmistakable clarity
the power of a home-rule city to withdraw from a regional plan, a
city may so withdraw. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-00-00689-CV;

CRIMINAL - DWI

Absent a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had

offense. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-00-00185-CR; Posted
