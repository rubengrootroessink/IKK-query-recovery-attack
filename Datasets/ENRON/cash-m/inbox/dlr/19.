SENATE AGREES TO REPEAL LIABILITY IF PATIENTS' RIGHTS BRINGS
COVERAGE LOSS

Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy patients' bill of
rights legislation (S. 1052) win two battles in the Senate,
as the chamber votes down a motion to pull the bill from the
floor for scrutiny by Senate committees and an amendment to
fully exempt employers from new liability under the bill.

However, Republicans win approval of an amendment that would
repeal liability provisions in the bill if it is later found
to spur a large increase in the number of uninsured.

Under the amendment, if the Institute of Medicine were to
find that more than 1 million individuals lost their health
coverage as a result of the bill's enactment, the liability
provisions would be repealed. . . . Page AA-1

ULP FOR TASTY BAKING TO DEMOTE UNION ACTIVIST'S WIFE, COURT
AFFIRMS

Tasty Baking Co. committed an unfair labor practice when it
demoted a supervisor whose husband was a union activist and
later transferred her to the night shift, the District of
Columbia Circuit affirms ( "Tasty Baking Co. v. NLRB,  "D.C.
Cir.,  No. 00-1030,  6/22/00 ).

With this opinion, the D.C. Circuit joins the Third and
Seventh Circuits in finding that it is a violation of the
National Labor Relations Act for an employer to take action
against a supervisor in retaliation for a relative's union
activities. In addition, Judge Garland affirms that the
company committed various unfair labor practices when
supervisors threatened and disciplined the union activist,
Michael Flannery, and other employees.

The court enforces a National Labor Relations Board order
requiring the employer to reinstate Flannery's wife, Edwina
Flannery, to her supervisory position and to stop committing
the unfair labor practices. . . . Page A-2

IBT DELEGATES APPROVE CONSTITUTION CALLING FOR MEMBERS TO
ELECT OFFICERS

Delegates to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
convention approve a package of constitutional amendments,
which the union's leaders labelled a "democracy package."
Among the amendments are ones that will make permanent the
process of direct membership election of the union's top
officers.

IBT President James Hoffa had made approval of the
"one-member, one-vote" election process the capstone of his
convention agenda. Delegates approve the constitutional
amendments on a voice vote.

With minor changes, the amendments make permanent provisions
that were first added to the IBT constitution in 1991 as
part of the consent decree settling the government's civil
racketeering suit against the union. The amendments require
direct, secret ballot election of international officers by
members. They specify the direct election of international
trustees, positions that in the past were appointed. . . .

SEVENTH CIRCUIT FINDS RLA REQUIRES ARBITRATION OF DISABILITY
CLAIM

The Railway Labor Act's mandatory arbitration scheme bars a
covered employee from litigating an Americans with
Disabilities Act claim that "requires a potentially
dispositive interpretation" of a collective bargaining
agreement, the Seventh Circuit holds ("Brown v. Illinois
Central R.R. Co., "7th Cir., No. 00-2349,6/20/01).

 Rejecting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's
position that Congress intended the ADA to override the RLA,
the court finds that allowing Robert Brown to litigate his
disabilities claim against Illinois Central Railroad Co.
"would lead to the evisceration of the grievance and
arbitration procedures provided by the RLA." A "clearer
Congressional mandate" would be required for such a "bold
step," Judge Bauer writes for the court. . . . Page A-1

TWIN CITY NURSES RATIFY CONTRACT, ENDING STRIKE

Members of the Minnesota Nurses Association ratify a
three-year contract with Fairview Health Services, ending a
strike that began June 3 at two Minneapolis-St. Paul
hospitals. Nurses will begin returning to work at 7 a.m.
June 29.

To address workload and staffing problems, which were major
issues in the strike, the contract allows charge nurses to
temporarily close their units to admissions for up to two
hours when there are not enough nurses to provide care and
alternative resources are not available, according to Sue
Buesgens, chairperson of the MNA bargaining unit. . . . Page
