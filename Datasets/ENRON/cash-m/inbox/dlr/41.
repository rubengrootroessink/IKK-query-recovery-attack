EEOC REVOKES POSITION ON RETIREE HEALTH PLANS, MEDICARE

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission revokes its
position that employee benefit plans that either end or are
reduced when a retiree becomes eligible for Medicare violate
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

In a unanimous vote, the commission decides to rescind and
review its previous policy as set forth in its internal
compliance manual. The change means that the commission will
no longer litigate such so-called "Medicare bridge" cases
while it is reviewing the policy.

The commission "recognized the reality" that the previous
policy could have the practical effect of discouraging
employers from providing health care benefits for retirees
before they become eligible for Medicare, an EEOC spokesman
explains. An internal commission task force is currently
studying the issue and getting input from employers,
insurers, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to examine
the issue further. The previous policy had been in effect
since October 2000. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

FIFTH CIRCUIT AGREES WITH NLRB THAT TEXAS FIRM COMMITTED
MANY ULPS

Plastics manufacturer Poly-America Inc. committed numerous
unfair labor practices relating to a 1996 work stoppage at
its plant in Grand Prairie, Texas, the Fifth Circuit rules,
upholding most of a National Labor Relations Board decision
("Poly-America Inc. v. NLRB, "5th Cir., No. 00-60013,
8/9/01).

The appeals court says substantial evidence supports the
board's findings that the company violated the National
Labor Relations Act by establishing and enforcing an overly
broad solicitation/distribution rule, threatening workers
with loss of wages and other detriments if they chose union
representation, interrogating workers about their union
activities, videotaping workers' union activities,
destroying union materials, and firing workers for engaging
in a work stoppage. The appeals court enforces the board's
order that Poly-America reinstate with back pay 19 workers
who participated in a work stoppage that began as an
economic strike and later turned into an
unfair-labor-practice strike. The company also must give
back pay to two workers suspended for insubordination after
refusing to stop distributing union material in the company
parking lot. . . . Page A-2 , Text E-2

VERIZON AND CWA AGREE ON TENTATIVE ACCORD FOR 4,200 TEXAS
WORKERS

Verizon Communications and CWA reach a tentative agreement
on new three-year contracts for some 4,200 employees across
Texas.  The proposed settlement calls for annual wage
increases totaling 12 percent, upgrades for employees in
certain smaller communities, benefit improvements, and
continuation of a team performance award plan. The proposed
agreement would apply to some 4,000 employees, primarily
technicians and customer service representatives, throughout
the state.  A separate proposed agreement, covering about
200 employees at Verizon Logistics (formerly GTE)--a unit
that provides material handling, storage, and administrative
services--mirrors the larger contract.

The settlement also calls for annual increases of 6 percent,
or a total of 18 percent, for 1,400 employees working in
smaller communities to bring their pay scale in line with
the wages in more urban areas.  In the second year of the
contract, residential and customer service representatives
who work at large call centers in north Texas would receive
an additional 4 percent increase as an upgrade. Employees
also can earn bonuses of up to 4 percent of their base pay
under the team performance award plan, if their team meets
goals established by the business unit.  . . . Page A-1

HARASSMENT POLICY NO DEFENSE TO ULP CHARGE AGAINST DIESEL
ENGINE MAKER

A North Carolina diesel engine manufacturer's investigation
of allegations that two workers "talked up" the union to
co-workers who felt harassed by the conversation, and the
company's decision to document the harassment charges, was a
violation of the employees' right to organize under the
National Labor Relations Act, the Fourth Circuit rules
("Consolidated Diesel Co. v. NLRB, "4th Cir., No. 00-2545,
8/15/01).

Pointing out that the pro-union workers were not abusive or
threatening in discussing the pros and cons of unionization,
Judge Wilkinson affirms the National Labor Relations Board's
order against Consolidated Diesel Co. It was no defense to
the unfair labor practice charge that the company had an
antiharassment policy prohibiting any unwelcome action
interpreted by the recipient or a third party as harassment.
"There would be nothing left of Section  7 rights if every
time employees exercised them in a way that was somehow
offensive to someone, they were subject to coercive
proceedings with the potential for expulsion," the court
writes, adding that "Section 7 rights are not that
vulnerable to the heckler's veto."  . . . Page A-1

IRON WORKERS IN ST. LOUIS APPROVE THREE-YEAR ACCORD WITH
CONTRACTORS

Negotiators for Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Iron
Workers Local 396 in St. Louis approve a new three-year
agreement with the Associated General Contractors and the
Erectors and Riggers Association that increases wage and
benefit payments by $4.50 per hour for about 1,500
union-represented iron workers.

The union's bargaining committee was authorized to ratify
the contract, which calls for wage and benefit increases of
$1.55 per hour in the first year, followed by increases of
$1.50 in the second year, and $1.45 in the third year. A new
program will provide a $100 payment to any journeyman who
completes 10 hours of training to upgrade skills during
nonwork hours.  . . . Page A-8
