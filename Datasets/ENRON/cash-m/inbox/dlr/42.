REPORTER'S TYPING, WRITING RESTRICTIONS NOT LIMITING UNDER
ADA

A newspaper reporter who was fired because a repetitive
stress disorder made her unable to type or write for
extended periods of time is not limited in a major life
activity under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
Ninth Circuit rules in a 2-1 decision ("Thornton v.
McClatchy Newspapers Inc., "9th Cir., No. 99-15857,
8/15/01).

Finding that "Fresno Bee" features reporter Jacalyn Thornton
was not limited in the major life activity of performing
"manual tasks" despite impairments that significantly
limited her ability to type or write, the court holds that
"manual tasks" included a broad range of activities and that
she could perform those tasks, and thus other jobs. "That
Thornton could perform certain manual tasks for only a
limited amount of time does not present a triable issue that
she was 'substantially limited' in a broad range of manual
tasks," Judge Hawkins says. Hawkins points out that Thornton
could grocery shop, drive, make beds, do laundry, and dress
herself, all manual tasks that demonstrated she was not
significantly limited under the ADA.

 Judge Berzon dissents, saying the majority's finding
ignores the increasing reliance on computers in today's
society. "The sum of the matter is that the ability to use
one's arms and hands to operate a computer and handwrite is,
in the modern world, a skill that is essential both in
getting an education and in earning a living, and is useful
in carrying out many activities of daily living," Berzon
writes. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-7

MINNESOTA COURT AGREES TEAMSTERS LIABLE TO OVERNITE FOR
STRIKE DAMAGE

Teamsters Local 120 is liable for damage to an Overnite
Transportation Co. facility in Blaine, Minn., caused by
striking employees who were not union members and for
two-thirds of the company's increased security costs, the
Minnesota Court of Appeals rules ("Overnite Transp. Co. v.
Teamsters Local 120, "Minn. Ct. App., No. C3-01-153,
"unpublished opinion" 8/14/01 ). Although the union was
certified to represent employees at the Blaine facility in
1995, most or all of the workers are not union members
because the union promised not to charge initiation fees or
union dues until it reached a collective bargaining
agreement with the company, which still has not occurred.

Affirming a district court decision, the appeals court finds
the union had an agency relationship with the picketers and
therefore was vicariously liable for the damage caused by
the picketers' misconduct during the strike that began in
October 1999. "[T]he evidence indicates that while the union
was aware of the picketers' repeated acts of misconduct, it
was either 'unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps
to control its pickets,' " Judge Foley says. . . . Page A-8

NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER PRECLUDES MAINTENANCE WORKERS' JOB
COMPLAINT

Maintenance workers who were denied the right of first
refusal to continue working in a federal building when a new
service contract was awarded are precluded by a recent
executive order from appealing the job denial to the Labor
Department ("Eddis v. LB&B Associates, "DOL ARB,No. 01-086,
8/8/01). President Bush's executive order withdrawing
certain hiring restrictions that previously had been imposed
when government agencies changed service contracts did not
include any language "suggesting that cases pending at the
time the order was issued could be litigated further," the
Labor Department's Administrative Review Board rules.

Bush's executive order rescinded a 1994 executive order that
required that contractors who took over custodial and other
services in federal buildings from another contractor give
that contractors' employees the right of first refusal on
jobs for which they were qualified. In considering a 1999
complaint alleging a violation of that order, the review
board says the Bush executive order did not include a
"savings clause" preserving its jurisdiction over cases
pending under the old order. Nor did the Labor Department's
move to rescind the regulations implementing that order
include such language, the board says. . . . Page A-2

COURT REJECTS BID FOR EXEMPTION FROM FAA'S AGE-60 RULE

The Seventh Circuit rejects the bid of a group of older
commercial airline pilots who sought exemptions from the
Federal Aviation Agency's longstanding rule prohibiting
flying after the age of 60 ("Yetman v. Garvey, "7th Cir.,
No. 99-2821, 8/14/01).

The 69 pilots, all of whom were either approaching or had
reached the age of 60, argued that more flexibility was
warranted in light of recent advances in medical technology.
FAA has never granted such an exemption in the 42 years that
the policy has been in effect.

"The FAA has the discretionary power to establish a rigid
policy, whereby no exemptions are granted, until it is
satisfied that medical standards can demonstrate an absence
of risk factors in an individual sufficient to warrant a
more liberal exemption policy from the age-60 rule," Judge
Flaum writes for the appeals court. "Until the FAA
determines that such standards exist, it may adhere
inflexibly to a rule whose validity has been upheld by the
courts and reevaluated by Congress, so long as it continues
to consider, as we are satisfied it has done here, new
advances in medical technology." . . . Page A-1

FIFTH CIRCUIT FINDS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR QUALIFIES AS
ERISA BENEFICIARY

Overturning a jury award of $100,000 against Provident Life
and Accident Insurance Co., the Fifth Circuit finds an
independent contractor qualifies as a beneficiary under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("Hollis v.
Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co., "5th Cir., No.
99-60877, 8/8/01).

In a case of first impression in the circuit, the Fifth
Circuit joins other appeals courts to decide the question
and rejects J.L. Hollis's claim that as an independent
contractor, he was not an ERISA beneficiary.  "Hollis's
independent contractor status does not preclude him from
being a beneficiary," the Fifth Circuit says. "Because
Hollis is an ERISA beneficiary, his claims directly affect
the relationship between traditional ERISA entities.
Therefore, ERISA preempts Hollis's state law claims against
Provident for bad-faith denial of disability benefits."  . .
