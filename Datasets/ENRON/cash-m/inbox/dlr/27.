PANEL WITNESSES DEBATE BILL TO ALTER WAY BONUS PAY AFFECTS
OVERTIME RATES

At a House subcommittee hearing, lawmakers and witnesses
hold fast to opposing positions on a bill (H.R. 1602) that
would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to give employers
more leeway in the way they calculate overtime pay rates for
nonexempt employees who have received performance bonuses.
Rep. Biggert (R-Ill.), vice chairman of the House Education
and the Workforce Committee's Subcommittee on Workforce
Protections, says the bill would eliminate disincentives in
current law that deter employers from offering
performance-based bonuses and "make it easier for employers
to share the wealth with their employees."

Michael Leibig, an attorney testifying on behalf of the
AFL-CIO, says the bill would give employers the authority to
legally designate as bonus pay any portion of an employee's
compensation beyond the minimum wage. While critics contend
that only "unscrupulous employers" would attempt such a
move, Leibig adds, "we should assume that all employers who
are scrupulous will answer to their stockholders. It's
something that any employer would take advantage of."

Rutgers University professor Charles Fay disagrees with
Leibig that employers could get away with a scheme to use
language in the bill to reduce employees' base wages. "Given
the language of the bill, it would be impossible," he said.
The bill includes language that requires employers to put
any incentive-based compensation plan in writing and make it
available to employees, he says, and it requires those bonus
payments to be based on a formula that is stated in the plan
and maintained in good faith. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB RULES CASINO ILLEGALLY BARRED HANDBILLING BY RESTAURANT
WORKERS

The owner of the New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las
Vegas committed unfair labor practices by prohibiting
handbilling in certain nonwork areas by off-duty employees
of restaurants located inside the casino, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in two decisions ("New York New York
Hotel LLC, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 87, 7/25/01; "New York New York
Hotel LLC, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 89, 7/25/01). Two unions were
attempting to organize employees of Ark Las Vegas Restaurant
Corp. who work in restaurants inside the casino owned by New
York New York Hotel LLC. The handbills stated Ark paid its
employees less than unionized workers and explicitly
disclaimed any dispute with the hotel-casino.

In the first decision, NLRB Chairman Hurtgen and Members
Liebman and Truesdale find the off-duty Ark employees had
the right to distribute handbills to customers in the
porte-cochere area just outside the entrance to the casino
because it is a nonwork area. In the second decision, the
board finds the hotel-casino committed an unfair labor
practice by stopping off-duty Ark employees from
distributing handbills to customers in the porte-cochere
area and in spacious passageways outside two casino
restaurants operated by Ark. . . . Page A-5

HARASSMENT STEMMED FROM UNION DISPUTE, NOT WORKER'S SEX,
COURT FINDS

A former U.S. Postal Service union steward who was harassed
by co-workers after being ousted from her union post failed
to show that the harassment was linked to her sex, the
Second Circuit rules ("Brown v. Henderson,  "2d Cir.,  No.
00-6347,  7/24/01).

Affirming summary judgment for the Postal Service on the
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act claim by Madeline E.
Brown, Judge Calabresi finds that while the harassment
included sexually charged behavior, it stemmed from a
union-related dispute, not that Brown was a woman. "Here ...
there is overwhelming evidence that the hostility toward
Brown was grounded in workplace dynamics unrelated to her
sex and that even [the obscene] pictures [posted near
Brown's desk] did not reflect an attack on Brown "as a
woman"," the court concludes. . . . Page A-7

PENNSYLVANIA LABOR LAW PROTECTS MUSHROOM WORKERS, COURT
RULES

In a ruling that removes an obstacle to organizing efforts
among Pennsylvania's 5,000 mushroom workers, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court upholds a lower court's finding
that mushroom workers are not agricultural laborers ("Vlasic
Farms Inc. v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd., "Pa., Appeal
Dkt. 1999, 7/25/01).

The pertinent provisions of the Pennsylvania labor law were
modeled on the pre-1947 version of the NLRA, under which
mushroom workers were not considered agricultural laborers,
the court says. "The Pennsylvania General Assembly, unlike
Congress, has not acted to modify such workers' status, and
the PLRB maintains a consistent and reasonable
interpretation of the prevailing statute," the court writes.
"It is therefore appropriate for the courts to also enforce
a consistent interpretation unless and until the General
Assembly alters course." . . . Page A-2

SALES CLERK CANNOT SHOW PRETEXT IN FAILURE TO PROMOTE

An African American department store clerk, allegedly
perceived by co-workers as a "shark" who stole customers
from other clerks, failed to show that the store's reasons
for not promoting her were a pretext for race
discrimination, the Seventh Circuit rules ("Johnson v.
Nordstrom Inc., " 7th Cir.,  No. 00-3827,  7/20/01).
Although Gail Johnson claimed that her manager at Nordstrom
Inc. showed favoritism to a white employee, "simple
favoritism cannot be the basis of a race-related complaint
under Title VII," Judge Cudahy writes for the court.

"To demonstrate pretext, 'a plaintiff must show more than
that the employer's decision was incorrect; the plaintiff
must also show that the employer lied about its proffered
explanation,' " the court explains. Johnson failed to show
that Nordstrom was lying about its reasons for not promoting
her, the court decides. . . . Page A-1
