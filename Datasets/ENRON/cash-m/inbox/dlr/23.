SUPREME COURT ASKS SOLICITOR GENERAL TO FILE BRIEF ON ADA
'DIRECT THREAT'

The U.S. Supreme Court invites the solicitor general to
express the view of the Bush administration on the scope of
the "direct threat" defense available to employers under the
Americans with Disabilities Act ("Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Echazabal, "U.S., No. 00-1406, "interim order" 6/18/01).
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. is seeking Supreme Court review of the
Ninth Circuit's 2-1 decision last October that employers
cannot exclude workers who do not pose a threat to the
health or safety of others in the workplace but may pose a
threat to their own health or safety. The three-judge panel
initially issued a unanimous decision in May 2000, but Judge
Trott later switched sides, and the court issued an amended
decision adding his dissent.

The appeals court reversed the summary judgment granted to
Chevron by a federal district court and allowed Mario
Echazabal, an oil refinery worker with hepatitis C, to
proceed with his ADA suit. The appeals court majority
rejected an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
interpretive regulation stating that employers may assert a
direct threat defense regarding employees who pose a threat
only to their own health or safety, as well as those who
pose a threat to the health or safety of others. The Supreme
Court's action in requesting the federal government's view
indicates an interest in granting review of this case or
another case raising the same issue. . . . Page AA-1

HIGH COURT DECLINES TO RULE ON 'PEEK AT THE MERITS' STANDARD
OF REVIEW

The U.S. Supreme Court refuses to take up a West Coast
regional airline's appeal of a circuit court's decision to
only "peek at the merits" of the National Mediation Board's
decision that the airline interfered in a representation
election ("Horizon Air Industries Inc. v. NMB,  "U.S.,  No.
00-1297,  "cert. denied", 6/18/01).

The Ninth Circuit in a November 2000 opinion observed that
federal court jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act over
NMB actions is "extraordinarily limited." The court adopted
a "peek at the merits" standard of review and affirmed that
the NMB did not act outside its statutory authority in
finding that Horizon Air Industries Inc. interfered in an
election involving the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. The court also affirmed the NMB's order that the
employer post workplace notices explaining that a rerun
election was necessary due to the interference.  . . . Page

BUSINESSES, LABOR SQUARE OFF OVER CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY
RULES

Federal contractors square off against labor, civil rights,
and environmental groups regarding controversial contractor
responsibility rules that were suspended by the Bush
administration in April. The FAR Council is accepting
written comments until July 6 on a proposal to repeal the
regulation.

Speaking at an open hearing before the Federal Acquisition
Regulatory Council, representatives of contractors tell
council members that the Clinton administration's contractor
responsibility final rules are vague and unworkable and
would require contracting officers to make "unilateral
decisions" about a company's compliance with a wide range of
laws without clarifying how those laws relate to the
contract.

Supporters of the rules, on the other hand, tell the Far
Council that the rules are a logical extension of current
procurement law, clarifying the already vague requirement
that the federal government contract with businesses that
have "integrity and business ethics."  Labor and civil
rights groups also plan to run print advertisements in
several major newspapers this week calling for Bush to lift
the stay on the rule. . . . Page A-8

D.C. CIRCUIT DIRECTS NLRB TO EXPLAIN WHY NEW ELECTION NOT
REQUIRED

The National Labor Relations Board did not adequately
explain why union supporters' threatening conduct during an
election campaign did not require overturning a
representation election won by the union, the District of
Columbia Circuit rules ("Randell Warehouse of Ariz. Inc. v.
NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1155, 6/12/01). The board certified
Sheet Metal Workers Local 359 to represent employees of
Randell Warehouse of Arizona Inc., ruling in a 4-1 decision
that photographing employees while distributing union
literature, without making any express or implied threats,
was not objectionable conduct.

The board overruled its 1988 decision in "Pepsi-Cola
Bottling Co. of Los Angeles", which held that a union
representative photographing employees, without giving an
explanation or justification, while the employees engage in
protected activity violates the National Labor Relations
Act. But the board declined to overrule its 1989 ruling in
"Mike Yurosek & Son Inc.", which ordered a new election
because a union representative threatened an anti-union
employee in connection with photographing employees'
campaign activity.

 Citing "at least three separate instances of potentially
threatening conduct" by union supporters, none of which was
connected directly to the photography, the appeals court
concludes the board should have considered the applicability
of "Mike Yurosek". . . . Page A-10,  Text E-4

AIRLINE EMPLOYEE'S CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME RULED NOT
PROTECTED DISABILITY

An American Airlines gate attendant with carpal tunnel
syndrome was not a disabled individual under the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the First Circuit rules
("Gelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines Inc., "1st Cir.,
No. 99-2324, 6/13/01).

The appeals court finds that since Lisa Gelabert-Ladenheim's
condition did not substantially limit her in the major life
activity of working and she was qualified for a broad range
of other jobs, she failed to meet the act's definition of
disabled.

"There is no question that carpal tunnel syndrome is a
physical impairment that has affected Gelabert's life," the
appeals court acknowledges, but its impact on her ability to
work was not substantial. "Gelabert's educational
background, skills, abilities, and work experience have
proven and continue to prove attractive to various
employers, her CTS notwithstanding," the First Circuit
holds, in affirming the judgment of a lower court. . . .

BNA DATA SHOW 4.3 PERCENT AVERAGE HIKE IN NEW
NONMANUFACTURING PACTS

 According to data compiled by BNA in the first 24 weeks of
2001, newly bargained contracts in the nonmanufacturing
(excluding construction) industry provide a weighted average
first-year increase of 4.3 percent, compared with 4.1
percent in 2000, while agreements in the manufacturing
sector produce a weighted average increase of 3.3 percent,
compared with 3.5 percent in 2000.

Major settlements in the latest report include a new
three-year contract between Boeing Co. and International
Association of Machinists; a four-year contract between
Northwest Airlines and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal
Association; and four-year contracts between the Mid-America
Regional Bargaining Association and Carpenters and Joiners
of America. . . . Page D-1
