SUPREME COURT LETS STAND RULING ALLOWING EPA SUITS AGAINST
STATES

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court decision
that the 11th Amendment does not bar Equal Pay Act suits
against state employers, clearing the way for a class action
by female faculty at Illinois State University who allege
they are paid less than their male colleagues ("Illinois
State Univ. v. Varner, "U.S., No. 00-1277, "cert. denied"
6/11/01). In April 1996, a federal district court certified
a class of all female faculty members from 1982 to the
present.

This is the second time the Supreme Court has taken action
on the case. The Seventh Circuit in July 1998 affirmed a
district court ruling that the school was not immune from
suit. In January 2000, the Supreme Court vacated the appeals
court decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in
light of "Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents", which held that
the 11th Amendment barred Age Discrimination in Employment
Act suits against state employers. The Seventh Circuit in
September 2000 again ruled that Congress, in passing the
EPA, validly exercised its authority under the 14th
Amendment to abrogate state immunity under the 11th
Amendment, taking away any impediment to EPA suits against
state employers. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

COURT REVIVES ARBITER'S RULING REINSTATING SEXUAL HARASSER

An arbitrator did not violate public policy or exceed his
authority in reinstating a Texas factory worker who had been
discharged for sexually harassing female employees, the
Fifth Circuit rules ("Weber Aircraft Inc. v. General
Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 767, "5th Cir., No.
00-40284, 6/7/01).

"The question to be answered is not whether [employee Roy]
Sewell's sexual harassment of female coworkers itself
violates public policy, but whether the [collective
bargaining agreement], which (as interpreted by the
arbitrator) for his reinstatement, does so," Judge  Dennis
writes for the Fifth Circuit, reversing a district court's
ruling that had vacated the arbitration award. Applying
Supreme Court precedent, the court finds no " 'explicit,'
'well-defined,' 'dominant' public policy to which the
arbitrator's decision 'runs contrary.' " . . . Page A-1

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY  THREE-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH EXELON CORP.

Members of Local 15 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers vote overwhelmingly to ratify a new
three-year pact with Exelon Corp. that will provide
employees of the Chicago-based electric utility with 3.5
percent wage increases in each year of the agreement.

The new agreement covers about 7,500 Exelon employees in
northern Illinois--nearly all of Exelon's nonsalaried
workers in the state. Covered employees include clerks,
underground technicians, repair and maintenance workers, and
technicians operating Exelon's fleet of nuclear power
plants.  Exelon, an energy generation and distribution
company, was formed last year through the merger between
Unicom Corp. and Peco Energy Inc. . . . Page A-7

EU MEMBER STATES AGREE ON MEASURE TO REQUIRE WORKER
CONSULTATIONS

European Union member states reach agreement on
controversial labor legislation that would require companies
with 50 employees or less to consult with workers before
implementing layoffs or decisions related to relocation or
other economic restructuring. The Council of Social Affairs
Ministers meeting in Luxembourg also approves legislation to
set noise limits in the workplace and require equal
treatment for male and female workers.  All three measures
must still be approved by the European Parliament, and any
differences between the two institutions must be worked out
in a conciliation committee.

 The United Kingdom and Ireland had blocked the worker
consultation legislation since it was proposed by the
European Commission in 1998.  Under an agreement proposed by
Sweden--which holds the rotating EU presidency--a seven-year
exemption for the United Kingdom and Ireland was added to
the measure. In addition, language was removed from the
proposed legislation that would have allowed member states
to financially sanction any company that violates the
legislation.  . . . Page A-1

TRAINING IN EMPLOYMENT LAW HELPS MANAGERS, PREVENTS LAWSUITS

Employment law training is being called safety training for
managers and inexpensive insurance for employers. A number
of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in recent years that allow a
company's policies and procedures to be part of a defense
against charges such as sexual harassment are leading many
companies to recognize the need for such training to prevent
situations that could lead to expensive employment lawsuits.

According to one company's training director, three Supreme
Court decisions--"Faragher v. Boca Raton, Fla." in 1998,
"Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth" in 1998, and
"Kolstad v. American Dental Assoc. " in 1999--made many
companies realize the need for employment law training. They
"have made employers responsible for managers' conduct,
particularly in harassment situations," she says.

A broad spectrum of training tools is available and growing
all the time to meet employers' demands for teaching
managers and others about employment law. They include
on-site classroom training tailored by lawyers, company
policies, generic classroom training by employer
associations on specific employment law topics, e-learning
at employees' desks about aspects of a particular law,
videos, and printed materials. . . . Page C-1
