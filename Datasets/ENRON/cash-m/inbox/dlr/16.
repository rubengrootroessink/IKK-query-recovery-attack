"GARRETT" CONTROLS STATE WORKER'S SUIT CHARGING VIOLATION OF
TITLE V OF ADA

Sovereign immunity bars a former California state senate
committee staffer's federal lawsuit alleging he was fired in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act after
telling a state senator that the committee's refusal to hire
a disabled campaign worker violated federal law, the Ninth
Circuit rules ("Demshki v. Monteith,  "9th Cir.,  No.
00-15599,  7/2/01).

Reversing a trial court's refusal to throw out David
Demshki's claim against the California Senate Rules
Committee, Judge G. Silverman finds that the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent holding in "Board of Trustees of the
University of Alabama v. Garrett, " which found unconsenting
states immune from suits brought under Title I of the
ADA--prohibiting disability-based employment
discrimination--also is applicable to cases brought under
Title V of the act. Title V prohibits discrimination against
those who oppose discriminatory acts or practices made
illegal by the ADA. . . . Page AA-1

RETIREMENT PLAN WITH LOWER HEALTH BENEFITS DID NOT VIOLATE
ADEA

A voluntary retirement plan initiated as a cost-savings
measure by the University of Rhode Island did not violate
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, even though it
provided a lower health insurance stipend for participants
over the age of 65 when they became eligible for Medicare
coverage, a federal judge rules ("Gutchen v. Board of
Governors of Univ. of Rhode Island, "D.R.I., No. 99-319,
6/22/01).

"In short, the health benefit stipend component of the
voluntary retirement incentive plan complies with the ADEA,"
Judge Lagueux of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Rhode Island writes. "The ADEA ensures equal, not
preferential treatment for older employees. There is no
violation of the ADEA when the employer provides the same
level of benefits to older workers as to younger workers."

He grants summary judgment to the university and rejects the
claims of two professors, whose challenge to the plan was
supported by the AARP Foundation Litigation, the nonprofit
legal advocacy arm of AARP, the senior citizens'
organization. . . . Page A-6

BEST BUY AGREES TO PAY $5.4 MILLION TO SETTLE OVERTIME
DISPUTE

Best Buy Inc., the national chain of electronic products
stores, has agreed to pay $5.4 million to settle a dispute
regarding its payment of overtime to employees, the Labor
Department announces. The Minneapolis-based firm was charged
with not properly compensating some 70,000 current and
former workers as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
According to DOL, workers were not paid for hours worked on
their days off, time worked during meal breaks, hours worked
after they punched out on the time clock, and time they
waited for managers to unlock doors at the end of shifts.
Best Buy also did not keep an accurate record of hours
worked by employees as required by the FLSA, the Labor
Department says.

Best Buy "disputes the Labor Department's findings, but
decided to resolve the case to avoid protracted litigation,"
a company spokeswoman says. The company expects that
"qualified employees will receive a letter and checks in
approximately six to 10 weeks," she says. Best Buy has
"agreed to comply with the federal overtime pay law in the
future and cooperated fully during the investigation," says
Denise Scharlemann, director of DOL's Wage and Hour Division
in Minneapolis. The nationwide agreement covers employees of
the company's 400 stores who worked from February 1998 to
February 2000. . . . Page A-1

ASARCO, FOUR UNIONS REACH AGREEMENT TO COVER 1,450 COPPER
WORKERS

 Asarco Inc. and four unions reach a tentative agreement on
new three-year contracts to cover some 1,450 employees at
the company's Southwest copper mining and refinery
operations. Union members are voting on the proposal and a
tally of votes is expected to be completed July 5.

The proposal calls for two wage increases and some
improvements in benefits. The first increase of 50 cents per
hour would occur when the price of copper reaches $1 a pound
or on July 1, 2002, whichever occurs first. The second wage
increase, also 50 cents per hour, would become effective
July 1, 2003.  A union representative says the price of
copper is currently in the 70-cent per-pound range. The four
unions that are party to the agreement are the United
Steelworkers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the
Operating Engineers. . . . Page A-1

NO NEED FOR LAYOFF NOTICE IN WISCONSIN IF BUSINESS CONTINUES
DESPITE SALE

A company that sold its business assets to another firm that
continued operations without interruption was not required
under Wisconsin law to provide employees 60 days' advance
notice of a permanent or temporary shutdown, the state
supreme court rules (" Wisconsin v. T.J. Int'l Inc., "Wis.,
No. 99-2803, 6/28/01). Norco Windows Inc. did not violate
Wisconsin's business closing law when it sold its window
manufacturing plant to Jeld-Wen Inc., which continued to
operate the company without interruption, the court says.
The court's decision overrules the state workforce
development agency's determination that the law covered the
company's sale and that both the seller and buyer should be
penalized for failing to give advance notice to the 47 Norco
employees Jeld-Wen failed to hire.

The Wisconsin Business Closing and Mass Layoff Law's
definition of "business closing" does not include "the sale
of business assets where there is no actual operational
shutdown--permanent or temporary--of the employment site,"
the court says. "Where, as here, the transfer of ownership
continues rather than interrupts or ceases the operation of
the employment site, there is no 'business closing' under
the statute, and no 60-day notice of the sale is required,"
according to the court. . . . Page A-7
