BARRING CONSIDERATION OF UNION-MEMBER APPLICANTS WAS ULP,
BOARD RULES

A Buffalo, N.Y., demolition contractor committed an unfair
labor practice when it changed its hiring policy to exclude
from consideration any applicant who revealed his or her
union affiliation on a job application, the National Labor
Relations Board rules 3-0 ( "Mainline Contracting Corp.,
"333 N.L.R.B. No. 120,   8/2/01 ).

Although the three-member panel unanimously finds that
Mainline Contracting Corp. acted with an illegal
discriminatory motive when it changed its hiring policy, the
board splits on a second point. Members Liebman and
Truesdale decide that the policy would have violated the
National Labor Relations Act even if it were not
specifically aimed at keeping the union members out. The
policy "unambiguously penalizes and deters protected
concerted activity," they find. Chairman Hurtgen dissents,
disagreeing that the policy would be invalid even if it were
not discriminatorily motivated. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

APPLE WORKERS VOICE COMPLAINTS AT NAFTA FORUM

Apple workers testify about alleged violations of state and
federal wage and hour laws at a one-day public forum in
Yakima, Wash., hosted by the Labor Department's National
Administrative Office. It is the first forum on a farm
worker complaint filed under NAFTA's labor side agreement.

The forum is an outcome of a 1998 complaint filed by several
Mexican unions alleging violations of the side agreement.
Several apple workers testify about instances where they
were not paid Washington state's minimum wage and in some
cases were not paid at all for work performed. . . . Page

EEOC ANNOUNCES $3.5 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN NATIONAL ORIGIN
BIAS CASE

A former picture frame manufacturer based in Gilbert, Ariz.,
has been ordered to pay $3.5 million to settle charges that
it discriminated against its Hispanic workers based on their
national origin and sex, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission announces. ("EEOC v. Quality Art LLC, "D. Ariz.,
No. CV-00-1171-PHX-SMM, "settlement approved" 7/31/01 ).
EEOC brought a wide-ranging suit against Quality Art LLC in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona,
alleging that the company's Hispanic female employees were
sexually harassed, discriminated against on the basis of
their sex, and retaliated against for opposing the unlawful
employment practices.

According to the EEOC complaint, Quality Art's Hispanic
female employees were subjected to intrusive searches, while
male and Anglo female employees were not. In addition, EEOC
claimed that Quality Art discriminated against its Hispanic
workers, most of whom were Mexican and Guatemalan, by
providing them lower wages and benefits than their
nonHispanic counterparts. EEOC also alleged that Quality Art
terminated certain employees who protested the
discriminatory employment practices and that the company
contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service in an
attempt to have the protesting employees deported. . . .

HILL WATCHERS PREDICT LITTLE ACTIVITY IN LABOR AND
EMPLOYMENT LAW ARENA

Attorneys representing unions and employers should not
expect any major labor and employment legislation to be
adopted in the coming months, Capitol Hill observers tell
participants at the annual meeting of the American Bar
Association's Section of Labor and Employment Law. Political
division is expected to hamper major legislative changes and
few labor and employment issues are capturing Congress's
attention, they say.

 Speakers add, however, that a number of side issues, such
as efforts to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act,
compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay, and privacy
in the workplace issues may arise.

"No one in the business community is talking about major
changes in the labor laws," says Randel Johnson, vice
president for labor and employment at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. "Nevertheless, there is some interest in trying to
pursue some of the narrow issues, such as peer review on
occupational safety and health standards, comp time, and
bonus/gainsharing," he says. . . . Page C-1

NONMANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS PRODUCE WEIGHTED INCREASE OF 4.1
PERCENT

Data compiled by BNA in the first 32 weeks of 2001  show a
weighted average first-year wage increase of 4.1 percent in
newly bargained contracts in the nonmanufacturing sector
(excluding construction), up from 4 percent in 2000. The
median increase in these contracts is 4 percent, compared
with 3.5 percent last year.  Manufacturing agreements
provide a weighted average increase of 3.1 percent, compared
with 3.3 percent in 2000, and a median of 3 percent,
unchanged from the same period of 2000. Construction
contracts provide a weighted average increase of 4.4
percent, compared with 4.2 percent in 2000, and a median of
4.1 percent, compared with 4.9 percent.

Major settlements reported in the latest biweekly tabulation
include a new four-year contract covering about 1,200
workers represented by the United Steelworkers at Lone Star
Steel Co. and new three-year agreements between Safeway Inc.
and Albertson's and the United Food and Commercial Workers,
covering approximately 10,000 workers in northern
California. . . . Page D-3

the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks show most regions of
