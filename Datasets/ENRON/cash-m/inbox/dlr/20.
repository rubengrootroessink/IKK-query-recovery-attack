SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR TWO TITLE VII CASES INVOLVING
FILING PERIODS

The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to review two cases involving
limitations periods for claims under Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act. The high court will hear a challenge to a
long-standing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
regulation that allows an employee alleging discrimination
to verify a charge after the statutory filing deadline in
situations where the individual already filed a timely but
unsworn discrimination charge ("Edelman v. Lynchburg
College, "U.S., No. 00-1072, "cert. granted" 6/25/01).
Leonard Edelman, a former biology professor at Lynchburg
College in Virginia, sought Supreme Court review of an
October 2000 decision by the Fourth Circuit finding the EEOC
rule invalid. The circuits are split 4-2 on the issue. The
acting solicitor general filed a brief supporting the EEOC
rule.

The Supreme Court also agrees to consider whether an Amtrak
worker could invoke the continuing violations doctrine and
seek damages against his employer for five years of
allegedly discriminatory conduct, even though it would have
been reasonable for him to file charges against the company
at an earlier time ("National Railroad Passenger Corp. d/b/a
Amtrak v. Morgan,  "U.S.,  No. 00-1614,  "cert. granted,"
6/25/01). The Ninth Circuit in November 2000 ordered a new
trial on Abner Morgan's Title VII race discrimination claim,
finding that the trial court erred in ruling that incidents
that occurred more than 300 days prior to the date Morgan
filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC were
time-barred. . . . Page AA-1,  AA-2

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR FMLA CASE ON DOL'S ADVANCE NOTICE
RULES

The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to review an appeals court
decision finding invalid a Labor Department regulation
requiring employers to provide employees with advance notice
that their paid or unpaid medical leave will be counted
toward their 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical
Leave Act ("Ragsdale v. Wolverine Worldwide Inc., "U.S., No.
00-6029, "cert. granted" 6/25/01). Tracy Ragsdale sought
review of the Eighth Circuit's July 2000 decision dismissing
her FMLA claim against Wolverine Worldwide Inc. Ragsdale
took seven months of employer-provided medical leave while
under treatment for cancer but was not told it would count
toward her FMLA allotment. She returned to work but then was
turned down when she requested FMLA leave.

A DOL regulation provides: "In all circumstances, it is the
employer's responsibility to designate leave, paid or
unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying, and to give notice of the
designation to the employee." Another rule states that an
employee will retain the right to 12 weeks of FMLA leave if
the employer fails to provide prior notice that the leave
will be counted toward the FMLA allotment. The latter DOL
rule "creates rights which the statute clearly does not
confer," the Eighth Circuit said, agreeing with an Eleventh
Circuit decision. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit endorsed
the DOL notice rules. The acting solicitor general submitted
a brief arguing the rules are valid but asking the Supreme
Court not to take this case. . . . Page AA-3

IBEW LOCAL REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH AMERITECH

International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 21
reaches tentative agreement with Ameritech on a three-year
contract that would provide more than 12,000 employees of
the SBC Communications Inc. subsidiary with wage increases
totaling 12.25 percent over term. The bargaining team was
successful in expanding a two-year wage reopener into a
three-year agreement expiring June 26, 2004, according to
the union. Originally, negotiations were reopened to set the
terms only for wage provisions in the final two years of a
five-year contract.

The tentative agreement contains a 4.25 percent wage
increase in the contract's first year, effective June 24,
2001; a 3 percent increase effective June 23, 2002, and a 5
percent increase effective June 22, 2003. The agreement also
contains improvements to current health, medical, dental,
and vision benefits, including a new provision allowing
employees to select Blue Cross/Blue Shield's preferred
provider organization health insurance plan.

IBEW is recommending ratification of the agreement that
would cover more than 12,000 workers. The local will mail
ratification ballots to union members in mid-July and will
count them the first week in August . . . Page A-1

JUSTICES ASK ADMINISTRATION VIEW OF ERISA AND 'WILLING
PROVIDER LAWS'

The U.S. Supreme Court asks the Bush administration to weigh
in on the ability of the states to regulate managed
health-care networks, by inviting the solicitor general to
file a legal brief on whether state "any-willing-provider"
laws are superseded by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ("Kentucky Ass'n of Health Plans Inc. v.
Miller, "U.S., No. 00-1471, "interim order "6/25/01).

Any-willing-provider laws bar health benefit plans from
discriminating against or excluding from their networks any
health care provider located within certain geographic
bounds who is willing to abide by the terms of participation
in the plan.

The Supreme Court has been asked to review a 2-1 finding of
the Sixth Circuit that any-willing-provider laws "relate to"
health benefit plans under ERISA, but are "saved" from ERISA
preemption because they regulate insurance--an area carved
out from ERISA's preemptive sweep because the regulation of
insurance has traditionally been reserved for the states.
The Supreme Court has not yet indicated whether it will
grant or deny the petition for review. . . . Page AA-4

NO HIGH COURT REVIEW OF MAN'S CLAIMS THAT HMO LIABLE FOR
WIFE'S SUICIDE

The U.S. Supreme Court leaves intact a federal appeals
court's decision to allow a Pennsylvania man to proceed on
state tort law claims that a health maintenance organization
was liable for allegedly denying treatment requested by his
wife prior to her 1993 suicide ("Aetna U.S. Healthcare v.
Lazorko, "U.S., No. 00-1641, "cert. denied" 6/25/01). The
high court's decision not to review the case leaves
undisturbed a December 2000 ruling by the Third Circuit
addressing whether Jonathan Lazorko's tort claims against
Aetna U.S. Healthcare and other defendants were preempted by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Aetna U.S.
Healthcare had sought high court review of the appeals court
decision, arguing that the issues raised by the case are
important and that the federal courts are divided over
whether beneficiaries have the right to bring direct
liability and vicarious liability lawsuits against managed
care organizations. . . . Page AA-4,  Text E-1
