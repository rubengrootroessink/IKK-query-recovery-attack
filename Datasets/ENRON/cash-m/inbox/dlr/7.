SENATE PASSES AIRPORT SECURITY BILL; BLOCKS WORKER RELIEF

Senate Democrats fail in their bid to bring to a vote an
assistance package for workers who have been laid off from
airlines, airports, and aircraft manufacturers in the wake
of recent terrorist attacks. The package was being offered
as an amendment to an airport security bill (S. 1447) that
won unanimous approval from the Senate.

A few hours before approving the security bill by a vote of
100-0, the Senate came four votes short of the 60 votes
needed to cut off debate and allow a vote on adding the
worker assistance package. Democrats who sponsored the
worker assistance package pledge to offer a similar measure
as an amendment to an economic stimulus package being
crafted by lawmakers. . . . Page AA-1

LABOR-HHS BILL MOVES IN HOUSE; SENATE CLEARS MEASURE FOR
FLOOR VOTE

The House late Oct. 11 was preparing to vote in favor of the
fiscal year 2002 spending bill (H.R. 3061) for the
departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education. Earlier in the day, the Senate Appropriations
Committee cleared its version of the measure for a vote on
the floor. Both the House and Senate measures have strong
bipartisan support, and the differences between the two
appear negligible with respect to funding levels for the
Labor Department.

Both of the $123 billion measures set DOL's FY 2002
discretionary funding levels at around $11.9 billion. This
represents an increase from the slightly more than $11.3
billion requested by the Bush administration and is more
than the nearly $11.7 billion allotted for FY 2001. In
addition to setting forth spending levels for Labor
Department programs and agencies, which are subject to
change pending a House-Senate conference, the reports
accompanying the bills contain directives reflecting certain
concerns on the part of various appropriators, such as
access to DOL's budget office and increases in workplace
fatalities among Hispanics. . . . Page A-10

NLRB RULES 2-1 STRIKE-NOTICE FAILURE DID NOT UNDO WORKERS'
PROTECTION

The failure of a union representing convention exhibit
workers in New Orleans to give prior notice of a strike did
not deprive the workers of protection under federal labor
law, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1
decision ("Freeman Decorating Co., "336 N.L.R.B. No. 1,
9/28/01 [released 10/10/01]). Members Liebman and Walsh
decide 11 contractors violated the National Labor Relations
Act by "terminating" hundreds of workers who previously had
obtained short-term jobs with any one of about 80
contractors through a hiring hall run by Local 39 of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The
board finds the workers did not have an actual employment
relationship with the 11 contractors when the strike began
and therefore could not be deprived of protected employee
status by the union's failure to comply with the
strike-notice requirement.

Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen takes the view that the workers
lost their status as employees covered by the act when the
union failed to comply with Section 8(d). Having lost their
protected status, the contractors could legally discharge
the workers and refuse to hire them in the future, Hurtgen
says. "To adopt the position of my colleagues would mean
that the loss-of-status provision of Section 8(d) does not
operate in hiring hall situations," the chairman says. . . .

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULES FOR NEW JERSEY CASINOS FOUND
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

A federal judge orders the New Jersey State Casino Control
Commission to eliminate the portions of its equal employment
opportunity regulations that required Atlantic City casinos
to set specific affirmative action goals for hiring
minorities and women, holding that the rules violated the
Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution ("Rudolph v.
Adamar of New Jersey, Inc., d/b/a Tropicana Casino and
Resort,"D.N.J., No. 00-CV-190, 10/10/01).

The brief order from Judge Orlofsky of the U.S. District
Court for New Jersey is entered as part of a pending class
action against the Tropicana Casino and Resort by former
employee John Rudolph, who alleged he and a class of other
white and male employees had been harmed by the
state-mandated policy.

The commission stopped enforcing the portions of the
regulations that were invalidated by Judge Orlofsky's Oct.
10 order more than a year ago, according to a commission
spokesman. But Rudolph's attorney says the order is
significant, in that it will require the commission to
notify each casino about the ruling and to take the
regulations off the books. "All of the casinos'
employment-related policies will have to be changed to
provide equal employment opportunity for everyone, without
concern for race or gender," she says. The casinos employ
more than 47,000. . . . Page A-2

ABRAHAM SAYS SUPPORT HAS GROWN FOR DATA FUNDING

Looking back at her eight years as head of the agency,
Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Katharine Abraham
says in an interview that she believes support has grown
among various constituencies for funding research and
improvements of key economic data programs. She is leaving
the agency after serving two terms as commissioner.

 During her tenure, which will end Oct. 12, Abraham says the
agency has been able to initiate new labor market measures,
including a survey of job openings and labor turnover that
will begin regular publication early next year. Also "the
BLS has been able to make improvements in just about all of
its major data series" in recent years, she says. . . . Page

NO ULP TO FIRED NURSE WHO CRITICIZED HOSPITAL  ON TV, EIGHTH
CIRCUIT FINDS

A Missouri hospital did not violate federal labor law when
it fired a prounion nurse who appeared on a local news
broadcast and accused the hospital of "jeopardizing the
health of mothers and babies" by altering shift assignments
and duties of certain labor and delivery nurses, the Eighth
Circuit rules ("St. Luke's Episcopal-Presbyterian Hospitals
Inc. v. NLRB,  "8th Cir., No. 00-3169,  10/10/01).

Denying enforcement of an order by the National Labor
Relations Board, Judge Loken disagrees with the board's
conclusion that St. Luke's Episcopal-Presbyterian Hospital
in Chesterfield, Mo., violated the National Labor Relations
Act by terminating registered nurse first assistant Carol
Hollowood based on protected concerted activity. There was
"overwhelming evidence" that Hollowood was fired because her
comments were false and disparaging to the hospital, and
they alienated her co-workers, the court decides. . . . Page
