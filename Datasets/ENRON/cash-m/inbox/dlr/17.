NLRB AGAIN RULES AGAINST LEE LUMBER BUT DECLINES BARGAINING
ORDER

Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp. illegally withdrew
recognition of an incumbent union before a reasonable time
for bargaining had passed, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in its third decision in the longrunning case,
but this time the board declines to impose an affirmative
bargaining order ("Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp.,
"334 N.L.R.B. No. 62, 6/28/01). On remand from the D.C.
Circuit, the board decides 4-0 "that when an employer has
unlawfully refused to recognize or bargain with an incumbent
union, a reasonable time for bargaining before the union's
majority status can be challenged will be no less than six
months, but no more than one year."

The board says the length of time that would be reasonable
depends on an analysis of several factors--whether the
parties are bargaining for an initial agreement, the
complexity of the issues being negotiated and the parties'
bargaining procedures, the amount of time spent bargaining
and the number of bargaining sessions, the amount of
progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are
to agreement, and the presence or absence of a bargaining
impasse. Applying these factors, the board decides Lee
Lumber did not bargain for a reasonable time before
withdrawing recognition from United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners Local 1027. . . . Page AA-1,  Text

FULL SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS BARGAINING PACT IRRELEVANT TO
LIABILITY

The full Seventh Circuit rules 6-3 to affirm a district
court's decision that evidence regarding an employer's
duties under a collective bargaining agreement was
inadmissible to prove that the company reacted reasonably in
failing to respond promptly to the misdeeds of a "serial
harasser" ("EEOC v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co. Inc. d/b/a
Ameritech Indiana,  "7th Cir. (en banc), No. 99-1155,
6/27/01).

Judge Easterbrook, in a portion of the ruling joined by four
of the judges, rejects Ameritech Indiana's argument that the
evidence is relevant to the issue of liability in sexual
harassment cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and affirms $15,000 in compensatory damages to
three female Ameritech workers. However on a second issue,
Easterbrook, joined by a different line up of five judges,
reverses a $635,000 award in punitive damages against
Ameritech, finding that evidence regarding arbitration and
the collective bargaining agreement was admissible as to the
issue of punitive damages.

Judge Flaum dissents in part, criticizing the majority's
"sweeping dictate" that bargaining agreements are
inadmissible in Title VII cases on the issue of liability.
Judge Rovner dissents on the issue of punitive damages,
arguing that the trial court's refusal to admit the evidence
was harmless  error.  . . . Page A-10,  Text E-7

 JUSTICES WILL REVIEW ERISA PREEMPTION OF EXTERNAL REVIEW IN
HEALTH CARE

Amid heated debate in Congress over a patients' bill of
rights, the Supreme Court decides to rule next term on
whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempts
statutes adopted in at least 37 states requiring external,
independent review of managed care organizations' medical
necessity decisions ("Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran,
"U.S., No. 00-1021, "cert. granted" 6/29/01).

The high court will review whether Illinois' external review
law is preempted by ERISA or whether it is "saved" from
ERISA preemption because it regulates insurance, an area
traditionally reserved for the states. The case arose after
Eileen Moran tried to recover $94,841 in surgical costs she
had paid after they were denied by Rush Prudential.

In adding the dispute to its 2001-2002 docket, the Supreme
Court opts to rule in a case the Justice Department, in an
amicus brief, had urged the justices not to accept, on
grounds that external review currently is being debated in
Congress.  . . . Page B-1

BNA SURVEY NETS PREDICTIONS OF MODEST ECONOMIC REBOUND

The sharp downturn in the nation's economy during the first
half of 2001 is still not showing any signs of improvement,
yet most economists and policymakers remain confident that
growth will accelerate by the end of the year, according to
BNA's mid-year economic outlook survey.

Among the 24 economists participating in the survey, all but
one believe that growth will rebound by the end of the year
to exceed the first quarter's anemic growth rate of 1.2
percent . Prior to the fourth quarter, however, three of
those economists fully expect to see data showing that the
country had slipped into a mild recession during the second
and third quarters. . . . Page D-1

NO NEW TALKS SCHEDULED IN IBEW DISPUTE WITH CHICAGO ELECTRIC
UTILITY

Two days into a strike by Local 15 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Chicago-based Midwest
Generation Co. has "no timetable" for resuming negotiations
over a new contract covering 1,150 of the electric utility's
employees, a company spokesman says. The strike is "not
about money," he says, but rather language that the union
was attempting to insert in the contract that would restrict
the company's use of outside contractors for work beyond the
scope of normal power plant operations.

Maintaining that the company is misrepresenting its position
in the dispute, Local 15 says no contract language has been
proposed to impede or limit the use of outside contractors.
Midwest Generation, it insists, is refusing to bargain in
good faith. While, the company attributes the strike to a
"union failing to recognize that it no longer works in a
utility environment, but in a competitive marketplace." . .

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND NATIONWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY
ENTERPRISES

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand a corporatewide remedial
order imposed by the National Labor Relations Board against
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises for its widespread
pattern of unfair labor practices ("Beverly Cal. Corp. v.
NLRB, "U.S., No. 00-1563, "cert. denied" 6/29/01). The
Supreme Court denies Beverly's request for review of a
Seventh Circuit ruling substantially upholding the board
decision. The board found the company committed more than
100 unfair labor practices involving 26 nursing homes
nationwide.

The board first issued a corporatewide cease-and-desist
order against Beverly in 1993, but the Second Circuit
overturned it, finding the evidence insufficient for such a
broad remedy. However, the Seventh Circuit in 2000 found
mounting evidence that Beverly "continues to violate the law
with regularity." The board was "entitled to conclude,
especially after specific remedies in [the Second Circuit
case] did not appear to stop the efforts from the company's
central management to stop unions in any way possible, that
the time was past for piecemeal relief," the Seventh Circuit
said. . . . Page B-2,  Text E-1
