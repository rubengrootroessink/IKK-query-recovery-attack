ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS SUPERVISOR DID NOT TAINT SIGNING OF
UNION CARDS

A Georgia heating and air conditioning firm's withdrawal of
its voluntary recognition of the Plumbers and Pipefitters
union was not justified by a supervisor's actions in signing
a union authorization card and speaking in favor of the
union, the Eleventh Circuit rules ("Waldinger Corp. v. NLRB,
"11th Cir., No. 00-14015, 8/24/01). The appeals court
affirms the National Labor Relations Board's 2-1 decision
that Waldinger Corp. committed an unfair labor practice by
withdrawing recognition of Local 72 and refusing to
negotiate a contract.

The board adopted an administrative law judge's findings
that the supervisor's involvement did not taint the signing
of union authorization cards by eight of 12 nonsupervisory
workers and that the branch manager voluntarily recognized
the union, requiring good-faith bargaining for a reasonable
period of time. Judge Birch finds substantial evidence
supports the board's ruling that the supervisor did not
create the impression that the company supported the union
or do anything to pressure employees to sign authorization
cards. . . . Page AA-1

ULP FOR PUBLISHER TO HIRE STRINGERS DURING BARGAINING, THIRD
CIRCUIT SAYS

A local newspaper publisher in Ellwood City, Pa., committed
an unfair labor practice when it hired "stringers"--
independent contractors who took photographs for the paper
on an ad hoc basis--to perform night and weekend photography
work when its regular, union-represented photographer became
overworked, the Third Circuit rules ("Citizens Publishing
and Printing Co. v. NLRB,  "3d Cir.,  No. 00-2825,
8/24/01).

Affirming an order from the National Labor Relations Board,
Judge Fuentes also decides that the strike that was prompted
by Citizens Publishing and Printing Co.'s decision to hire
the stringers was an unfair labor practices strike, not a
mere economic strike. The company violated the National
Labor Relations Act by falsely informing Teamsters Local 261
that it had permanently replaced the striking workers and by
not reinstating them when they made an unconditional offer
to return to work, the court holds.  . . . Page A-10

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACT FOR 3,000 WISCONSIN ELECTRIC
EMPLOYEES

A new three-year agreement between Wisconsin Electric Co.
and IBEW Local 2150 calls for wage increases totaling 9.35
percent over term and improvements in certain benefits. The
agreement, which applies to a wall-to-wall unit of about
3,000 employees, provides an initial general wage increase
of 3 percent, retroactive to Aug. 16, the effective date of
the new agreement. There are further increases of 3 percent
next August and 3.35 percent in August 2003.

 In addition, a cost-of-living provision in the second and
third years could give employees additional adjustments
amounting to one-half of the difference between the
negotiated increase and the inflation rate. Thus, if
inflation is 4 percent next year, an additional 0.5 percent
would be added to the 3 percent negotiated for 2002.
Employees will continue to pay 10 percent of the cost of
their health care premiums for the first two years,
increasing to 15 percent in the third year. However, the cap
on employees' out-of-pocket payments for health services
will be lifted. . . . Page A-6

TRADE-IMPACTED  COMMUNITIES FACE DIFFICULTIES, GAO FINDS

Communities that have experienced high worker dislocation
because of trade have difficulty re-employing many of those
workers because they have low education levels and limited
English proficiency, according to a recently released report
from the General Accounting Office. The problems stem in
part from confusion between two trade adjustment assistance
programs that have different requirements and an unstable
source of funding for states, according to the report. Other
inconsistencies in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program
hamper its effectiveness in re-employing dislocated workers,
the report says. For example, participants are eligible for
up to two years of occupational training, but only 18 months
of income support.

The president has been silent on TAA except to state that he
wants to propose changes to it. The administration is
expected to issue a position statement on TAA in early
September, according to a Labor Department spokesman. The
program expires Sept. 30 unless it is reauthorized by
Congress. . . . Page A-1

EPITHETS BY CO-WORKER ARE ENOUGH FOR TRIAL ON RACE
DISCRIMINATION

An African American leasing agent who was subjected to
racist epithets from a co-worker can proceed to trial with
her claims of race discrimination under Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, a federal judge in Baltimore rules
("Collier v. Ram Partners, Inc., "D. Md., 00-3294, 8/21/01).

Judge Davis of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland observes that cases of hostile environment race
discrimination are rare, "[g]iven the coarseness of modern
discourse." But he finds that Rhonda Collier's claims
against RAM Partners, if viewed in a most favorable light,
were sufficiently severe to warrant a trial. Collier not
only protested against the "verbally-created racist regime,"
which she contended was tolerated by company officials, but
was subjected to serious threats of physical harm after
complaining, he finds, in denying the company's motion for
summary judgment. . . . Page A-9

OSHA TO OFFER OUTREACH ON RECORDKEEPING, VPP ASSISTANCE

The new head of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration says the agency will launch a sweeping effort
to educate employers on new injury and illness recordkeeping
regulations set to go into effect in January 2002.

OSHA Administrator John Henshaw also announces a new
agreement with an association representing work sites in the
OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. The Voluntary Protection
Program's Participants' Association and OSHA have "agreed to
reach out to companies" that were recently warned by the
agency to cut their higher-than-average injury and illness
rates. . . . Page C-1
