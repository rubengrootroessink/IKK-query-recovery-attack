D.C. CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION  ON 'SHAM' SALES,
BARGAINING ORDER

The National Labor Relations Board made inadequate findings
to support its decision that an affirmative bargaining order
was necessary because a mobile food catering business made
"sham" sales of catering trucks and routes to avoid
unionization, the District of Columbia Circuit rules
("Douglas Foods Corp. v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1241,
6/12/01).

"While anti-union animus may well have motivated the
decision [by Douglas Foods Corp.] to sell the [ ] trucks and
routes, there is not substantial evidence to support the
NLRB's conclusion that the sales were 'sham' transactions,"
Judge Sentelle says. He vacates the board's order that the
company re-establish its hot truck operations, expressing
"grave doubts" about its legality even if sufficient fact
findings had been made. . . . Page AA-1

DOL STATISTICS SUGGEST DROP IN TRADE-RELATED JOB LOSSES

Recent Labor Department statistics suggest that there may be
a decline in U.S. job losses related to international trade.
The Labor Department determined in fiscal year 2000 that an
estimated 97,764 workers could be eligible to apply for
benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and
that 47,275 might be eligible for benefits under the North
American Free Trade Agreement's Transitional Adjustment
Assistance program. These figures compare with the 158,649
DOL estimated as eligible for TAA benefits and the 68,730
estimated as eligible for NAFTA-TAA benefits the previous
fiscal year.

The department certified 842 TAA cases and 403 NAFTA-TAA
cases in FY 2000, compared with 1,634 TAA cases and 518
NAFTA-TAA cases the previous fiscal year. Incidents in which
the department determined that workers could be covered by
both programs, "dual certifications," dropped to 260 from
384 last fiscal year. This corresponded with a fall in the
estimated number of workers covered under either program
from  54,769 to 31,617. . . . Page A-1

UNIONS UNFAZED BY "KENTUCKY RIVER"; ADVOCATES DEBATE NURSES'
STATUS

Undeterred by the Supreme Court's recent ruling rejecting
the National Labor Relations Board's latest test for
determining whether nurses are supervisors and therefore
unable to join a union, many unions representing health care
professionals say they will continue with organizing efforts
among nurses despite the adverse ruling.

In May, the justices ruled in "NLRB v. Kentucky River
Community Care Inc." that the board's test for deciding
whether a worker exercises independent judgment in
performing certain job tasks--and therefore qualifies as a
supervisor--was inconsistent with the National Labor
Relations Act. In so ruling, the court affirmed by a 5-4
vote a federal appeals court's refusal to enforce the
board's decision that six registered nurses at a health care
facility run by the Kentucky River Community Care Inc. were
not supervisors because they did not exercise independent
judgment in performing their duties.

Some health care employer advocates and labor lawyers agree
that bringing the issue back before the board could be a
daunting task. Not only is this the second time the Supreme
Court has shot down NLRB's attempt to characterize certain
nurses as nonsupervisors, but the changing political climate
may signal a board less inclined to tackle this issue again,
they said. Nonetheless, while advocates for employers and
employees debate the significance and possible ramifications
of the decisions, most health care employee unions continue
organizing efforts. . . . Page B-1

COMAIR, PILOTS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO END 12-WEEK
STRIKE

 Union representatives for Comair pilots will begin contract
briefings June 18 on a tentative agreement that, if
ratified, will end a crippling 12-week strike against the
regional airline.  Details of the five-year contract are not
being released in advance of ratification, but  J.C. Lawson,
chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association's unit at
Comair, says the union is recommending adoption "because we
believe it satisfies the pilots' fundamental requirements."

 Comair's 1,350 pilots walked off their jobs March 26
following three years of unsuccessful contract negotiations.
Compensation, work rules, job security, and retirement
benefits were the sticking points of negotiations, according
to the pilots' union.      Tentative agreement came June 14,
after three days of intense negotiations between ALPA and
Comair management at National Mediation Board offices in
Washington, D.C.

 Pilots will be briefed on the agreement at informational
meetings June 18-19, the union said. ALPA members will then
vote by telephone June 20-21. If pilots approve the
contract, Comair planes could be flying again by July 15,
the company says. . . . Page A-4

STANCE OVERTURNED ON PREEMPTION OF WORKERS' MECHANIC'S LIENS

Mechanic's liens filed under Indiana law by a group of
union-represented workers seeking to secure unpaid vacation
pay from their economically failing employer were not
preempted  by the Labor-Management Relations Act, the full
Seventh Circuit rules in a 7-5 decision ("In re: Bentz Metal
Products Co. Inc., "7th Cir., No. 00-1320, en banc, 6/7/01).

Reversing a decision by a three-member panel of the court,
Judge Evans observes that the amount owed to the employees
of Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Bentz Metal Products Co. Inc., an
amount governed by the company's collective bargaining
agreement with  United Auto Workers  Local 2298, was not in
dispute. Therefore, the claim did not require an
interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and
was not preempted by the act, he finds.

Judge Bauer dissents, accusing the majority of
"side-stepping the law to reach an equitable result." Even
though the amount due to the Bentz workers was not in
dispute, Bauer says, preemption applied  because the workers
were seeking to enforce the bargaining agreement. . . . Page

JUMP IN FUEL PRICES LIFTS CPI 0.4 PERCENT IN MAY

Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May as fuel prices
climbed higher for a second consecutive month, the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Excluding
the volatile food and energy components of the index,
consumer prices rose a slightly better-than-expected 0.1
percent in May, the smallest monthly increase since December
2000, BLS says.

 "This was a very favorable report. We were obviously
plagued by gasoline hikes that didn't show up in the [June
14 release of the] producer price index,  but price
pressures have generally been quite mild," says Carol Stone,
senior economist at Nomura Securities in New York. Mickey
Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York, was
less impressed by the report, saying that once price
increases for the housing component and the medical care
component begin to rise, "it is hard to stop the increase."
