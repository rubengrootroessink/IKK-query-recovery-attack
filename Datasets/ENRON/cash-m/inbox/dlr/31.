STUDY FINDS WIDE DIFFERENCES  AMONG EEOC OFFICES HANDLING
ADA CHARGES

There is an "enormous variation" in the way that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission's 50 field offices handle
discrimination charges under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, according to a study scheduled for fall publication in
the "Kansas Law Review".

Reviewing nearly 150,000 ADA charge resolutions between 1992
and 2000, the study finds that differences among the offices
existed in every outcome measured--including overall benefit
rates and cause determinations. "It is possible that these
differences in outcomes by office reflect significant
differences in the merits of the cases brought to the
office, but it is highly unlikely that merit alone accounts
for these differences," concludes Kathryn Moss, a social
scientist at the University of North Carolina and Scott
Burris, a law professor at Temple University, and others.

An EEOC spokesman acknowledges a variation in performance,
but says the study fails to consider factors such as
controlling court rulings, the involvement of the local bar,
and the nature of the charges themselves. "If we see
something in one of the offices that is way off, it raises a
red flag on how we evaluate and review," he says. "We'd like
to do more monitoring, if we had more resources."  . . .

JOB LOSSES SLOW TO 42,000 AS FACTORY CUTS EASE

Holding out the possibility that the tide of manufacturing
losses is ebbing, the July employment report shows a much
smaller drop in nonfarm payrolls--42,000--than in June,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless
rate held steady at 4.5 percent.

The latest jobs report buttressed the widely held
expectation that the second quarter will turn out to be the
weakest of the economic downturn. Pointing out that
employment is a lagging indicator, Bank One chief economist
Diane Swonk says she had expected to see "some improvement
in July, and we did in manufacturing" where the decline of
49,000 was the smallest since last December. . . . Page D-1

NLRB ISSUES REVISED CORPORATEWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY

The National Labor Relations Board, on remand by a federal
appeals court, issues a revised corporatewide
cease-and-desist order against Beverly California Corp. to
remedy numerous unfair labor practices committed at its
nursing homes ("Beverly Cal. Corp. f/k/a Beverly
Enterprises, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 79, 7/23/01).

In August 1998, the board issued the nationwide order
against Beverly to remedy the board's finding of a
widespread pattern of unfair labor practices stretching back
before 1988 and involving 240 violations at 54 facilities in
18 states.

The Seventh Circuit in September 2000 upheld most of the
board's findings and upheld its determination that a
corporatewide remedial order was appropriate. But the
appeals court returned the case to the board for preparation
of a revised order to clarify which specific directives
apply nationwide and which apply only to specific
facilities. The U.S. Supreme Court recently denied Beverly's
request for review of the appeals court ruling. . . . Page

COURT FINDS NO FMLA VIOLATION IN FIRING DIRECTOR RETURNING
FROM LEAVE

A Wisconsin nursing home did not violate the Family and
Medical Leave Act by refusing to reinstate its activities
director after she took maternity leave,  the Seventh
Circuit rules, finding the employer would have fired her
regardless of her taking leave ("Kohls v. Beverly Enter.
Wis. Inc.,  "7th Cir.,  No. 00-2064,  8/1/01).

Even though Beverly Enterprises Wisconsin, doing business as
Maple Manor Healthcare, made the decision to fire Amy Kohls
after she took the leave, Kohls was unable to rebut the
employer's evidence that she was fired for mishandling funds
and poor performance. In addition, the fact that the
employer liked the work of Kohls's temporary replacement
better than Kohls's did not demonstrate that the nursing
home violated the law, Judge Kanne finds, affirming summary
judgment for Beverly.  . . . Page A-6

SENATE CONFIRMS HENSHAW TO HEAD OSHA, DEROCCO FOR ETA

The Senate, by unanimous consent, confirms John Henshaw as
assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and
health and Emily Stover DeRocco as assistant secretary of
labor for employment and training.

Henshaw, a former corporate safety and health official with
Astaris LLC and the Monsanto Co., has called for a balanced
approach at OSHA that will provide enforcement where needed,
but also a significant focus on compliance assistance and
education.

DeRocco was formerly executive director of the National
Association of State Workforce Agencies, a trade association
representing administrators of state unemployment insurance,
employment and training services, and labor market
information programs. . . . Page A-1
