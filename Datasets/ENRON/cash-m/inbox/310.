SCALIA CONTROVERSY COULD DELAY NLRB NOMINATIONS

Resistance in the Senate to moving on the controversial
nomination of Eugene Scalia as labor solicitor could delay
approval of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board,
GOP sources tell BNA. Senate Republicans are pushing for a
floor vote on President Bush's pick for the Labor
Department's top legal post, but several Democrats are
protesting the nomination.

Before lawmakers adjourned for the week-long Thanksgiving
recess, Senate Republicans thwarted an attempt from the
Democrats to unanimously approve the nomination of Dennis P.
Walsh (D) to the NLRB, according to a GOP aide. While
Republicans have no substantive objection to Walsh as an
NLRB member, they are insisting on a floor vote for Scalia
before other labor-related nominations are considered,
sources say.

Threats to hold up NLRB nominations are "not going to
advance the debate" on Scalia, according to a spokesman for
Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the committee with
jurisdiction over labor-related nominees. An aide to Senate
Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells BNA that several
Democrats who are not on the Labor Committee have expressed
concerns about Scalia and want to research his positions
before allowing his nomination to come to the floor. . . .

GEORGIA COURT OVERTURNS $45 MILLION AWARD IN BREACH OF
CONTRACT SUIT

Overturning a $45 million judgment for a sales
representative who was fired without being paid commissions,
base pay, severance pay, and company stock, the Georgia
Court of Appeals orders a new trial on damages for breach of
an employment contract but not various tort claims
("ServiceMaster Co. v. Martin, "Ga. Ct. App., No. A01A1093,
11/15/01). As a sanction for ServiceMaster's discovery
abuse, the trial court entered a default judgment for Ray
Martin on liability for breach of contract and tort claims.
A jury awarded Martin over $1 million in compensatory
damages, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees and $135
million in punitive damages. The trial court, however,
reduced the compensatory damages amount to $461,000 and the
punitive damages to $45 million.

The appeals court rules that the default resulted in
ServiceMaster admitting to all the well-pleaded allegations
in the complaint but did not bar the company from showing
that Martin could not recover on certain theories even if
the factual allegations were admitted. The appeals court
decides that the admitted facts establish the company's
liability for breach of contract but not for tortious
interference with property, breach of duty, or fraud.
Punitive damages are not available for breach of contract. .

PROSPECTS DIM FOR CHANGES TO FLSA COMPANIONSHIP EXEMPTION

Numerous concerns have been raised about a Clinton
administration proposal to broaden Fair Labor Standards Act
coverage of domestic service employees who provide certain
"companionship services," dimming chances for final action
on the plan. Among concerns are those raised by the Bush
Small Business Administration, which asserts that the Labor
Department did not meet its obligations under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act when it analyzed the impact the proposal
would have on small businesses. There is not "enough
information to provide an adequate basis to support a
finding" that the proposal would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,
the agency says

Employers in the home health care industry are stridently
resisting the change. In comments to the Labor Department,
they insist that the current regulations interpreting the
companionship services exemption are legally valid and
reflect the intent of Congress when it amended the FLSA to
provide for the exemption. However, the Service Employees
International Union, whose members include workers who
provide in-home personal care, contends that the  current
definition of companionship services is "clearly
inconsistent" with the FLSA because it defines such services
to "include an unlimited amount of ordinary domestic
services." . . . Page C-1

DOL OFFICIALS GRANTED IMMUNITY IN LONGSHORE CASE

A disgruntled marine machinist whose former employer was
challenging his entitlement to benefits under the Longshore
and Harbor Workers Compensation Act cannot sue the Labor
Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges or members
of its Benefits Review Board for rulings they made in the
course of considering the challenge, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California rules ("Olsen v.
Herman, "N.D. Cal., No. 00-3165 MMC, 10/31/01). "ALJs and
judges serving on the BRB are entitled to absolute immunity
for performing judicial acts," the court says. The court
also bars charges against a district director with the Labor
Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs who
was involved in the proceedings.

The charges were brought by Tom Olsen, who was injured while
working as a machinist aboard a vessel and awarded
compensation for permanent and total disability under the
longshore law. Olsen's former employer, Triple A Machine
Shop Inc. subsequently initiated review proceedings under
the law, claiming that Olsen's physical condition and
employment status had changed since he was awarded benefits.
The review was referred to a Labor Department administrative
law judge, a move that Olsen resisted and prompted the suit
against the DOL officials. . . . Page A-9

SEVENTH CIRCUIT NIXES OFFICER'S FREE SPEECH CLAIMS, $175,000
AWARD

A jury should not have awarded a city police officer
$175,000 on her claim that she was fired in violation of her
right to free speech, the Seventh Circuit rules, reversing a
district court's grant of judgment for Draphy Durgins in her
suit against the city of East St. Louis, Ill. ("Durgins v.
East St. Louis, " 7th Cir.,  Nos. 00-3271, 00-3486,
11/16/01). Durgins had pressed for the discipline of two
fellow officers in a horseplay incident and subsequently was
fired for resume fraud.

Finding that Durgins failed to raise a First Amendment
Claim, Judge Easterbrook notes that communications about
personnel matters are not covered by the First Amendment.
Even if they were covered, he says, "resume fraud is not
protected speech."

The court also finds that Durgins's claims should have been
dismissed at the outset because she split her theories
between state and federal courts instead of seeking a
consolidated proceeding. . . . Page A-5
