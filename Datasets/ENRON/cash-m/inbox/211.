Jenny - Enron Human Resources and the Competitive Analysis Group, in coordination with General Counsel, request IT assistance for an ongoing, sensitive project involving numerous outside firms.  In conjunction with Enron Corporate policy, we have requested your group, via Keith Dziadek, generate periodic Call Detail Records (CDRs) involving outside telephone numbers of interest and to log visits to specific URLs.  We have also requested MailSweeper assistance, via Bob McAuliffe and Chris Behney, for the related outside e-mail addresses.  We have already provided a significant list of these numbers, URLs and addresses and will periodically update this list in the days to come.  The duration of this effort is likely to continue for several more weeks.  Thank you in advance for your support and please give myself or one of the principals above a call should you have any questions.  Thanks again, Rus
