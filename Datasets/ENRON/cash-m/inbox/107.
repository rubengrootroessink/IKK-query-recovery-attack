Michelle,

Our group has been asked by EEL (Liz Barrett) to deploy the attachment survey.  We (HRGIM) would like to ensure the language of the survey is consistent with the policies and procedures of Enron Corp.  Legal (Jon Chapman) has reviewed the document.  Any insight you can provide is appreciated.

 

Regards,
Milton

P.S.  Liz Barrett's comments are below regarding the rationale behind the ethnic descriptions in the survey.

 "I worked with Jon Chapman on the survey, so it has been comprehensively done over by legal!  The reason why I've chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the Commission for Racial Equality, who are the governing body on race relations in the UK, and are aligned to their counter-parts in Europe.  If we do have a legal challenge, we will be asked to provide data in this fomat, rather than the US descriptors which are not as relevant to the European ethnic profile (for instance 'Hispanic' is not a meaningful category for Europe, whereas it is very significant for the US).  I'd prefer to map the US definitions onto the European ones, but to collect the European data in the CRE's format."
