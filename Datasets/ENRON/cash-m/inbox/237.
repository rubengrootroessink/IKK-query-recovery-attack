          I was informed by John Blaylock that part time employees 
are not eligible for severance benefits.  
Section 2.1 of the Plan states in part that all regular full time active employees of Enron or participating employer in the Plan are eligible to receive the severance benefit. 
Eligibility does not mean entitlement.  The rest of the Plan describes entitlement.
