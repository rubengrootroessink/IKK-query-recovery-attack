Dear Michelle, Lisa,  and Bob:
    I  am attaching with this e-mail a second request for production I intend to send  to plaintiff's counsel tomorrow; please let me know whether you have any changes  or additions.  Thanks for your assistance.
    I  am also attaching a letter I sent to John Glover this  morning.
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks
