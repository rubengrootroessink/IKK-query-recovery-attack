Michelle:  I hope you will remember me.  We graduated from law school together and I used to see you on occasion downtown when you were with Bracewell & Patterson.
Congrats on your move to Enron.  It sounds like such a dynamic place to work.
I am looking for new employment and have always been interested in going in-house.  I have been doing commercial and mass tort litigation for the last 12 years at Woodard, Hall & Primm and I am ready for a change.  I am open to changing my whole career focus away from litigation if I can find the right fit.
If you have time, I would love to talk to you about opportunities at Enron.  Lunch or anything would be great.  I can also send you my resume if that will help.  Any advice would be appreciated.
I hope all is well with you and your family.
You have my return e-mail address.  My phone is (713) 221-3835.
Thanks,
-Greg Clark
