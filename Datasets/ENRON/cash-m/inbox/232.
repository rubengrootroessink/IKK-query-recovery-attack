Does ADEA even apply when it comes to rescinding an offer?  I thought it only applied to terminations.

The minimum number of days should be 21, and they should have 7 days to revoke it.  Although the ADEA probably would not apply to A&A candidates, it could be an issue for the rest of the organization.  Michelle

Michelle - After getting your message regarding the waiver, and discussing it with Hector McLoughlin, I've added some language to the original letter.

Attached is a proposed letter to use when rescinding an offer of employment.  I have consolidated drafts done by Fran Mayes and Terry Bosien.  If you have other forms that you think work better, please send them our way. I think it will be useful to work from the same document across Enron.

Please note that each situation should be handled consistently with others in similar circumstances, and that special care should be taken for those who have quit prior jobs, relocated, or are in precarious visa situations.
