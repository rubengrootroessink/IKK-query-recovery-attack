I spoke with Margaret regarding this issue and let her know that I was
wondering about that.  How is it being handled for other issues?

I think we could continue to use the current annual report, but I think that
it would be best to amend the INS forms to show whatever the more accurate
numbers are.

Charles and Alice,

Please advise your opinion regarding the INS forms, there are two places
which refer to:
*	Gross Annual Income: $100 billion
*	Net Annual Income: $979 million
Should these be revised to reflect our recent adjustments and if so,
what would you require to attach to the annual report when submitting
these to the INS?  Or should we continue utilizing only the annual
reports and the figures held within?
Thanks!
