Michelle,

I would appreciate it if you would call Mark and get the local counsel mater
resolved. ODNSS' recommendations/suggestions on a variety of matters and
their support activity for NEPCO over the last couple of years has been well
received and valued by our internal clients. Thanks.

Mike

David,

For clarification, I was present during Mark Stubley's brief training
session over the phone.  I memorialized the key points in a summary email.
Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.

On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more
cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had
indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since
Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I
just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing
lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be
some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to
travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does
that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it
since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that
arena.

I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not
believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already
have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get
them "engaged" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred
at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to
line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their
recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local
labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Mike,

I know of no hold up here.  I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not

withheld or said different to retaining this counsel.  I would suggest that

you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to

the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside

counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with

in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.

As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by

copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I saw the correspondence from Mr. Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the

Mayor of Lake Worth.  I interpret this as a public official saying what is

expected, neither favoring the picketers or us, just saying he will up-hold

the law.  We appreciate that.

                I forwarded our recommendation for local counsel to Michelle

Cash. She

                indicated that Enron might want to use another firm. In the

meantime, we

                will continue to use Cole Fitzgerald.  On September 24, I

copied you (as

                well as Michelle Cash and David Lund) on Cole's

correspondence concerning

                his meeting with the mayor of Lake Worth. So, his

connections should prove

                helpful.

                Lund has provided me a copy of NEPCO's subcontract. Our

review and comments

                should be complete by Friday.

                We conducted the quick, over-the-phone training for the

management team at

                Lake Worth approximately two weeks ago.  We agreed to

conduct on-site

                training when more of the project management team is present

at the site. No

                specific time is scheduled.

                We have not received a plat for the project. We have not

determined the gate

                setup. We have determined, however, that all construction

traffic and

                deliveries would use the southern gate, not the main gate to

the facility.
