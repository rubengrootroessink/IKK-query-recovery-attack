Michelle:  I've been meaning to call you.  I understand that there are a
number of issues regarding paying European employees' expenses.  My
schedule is pretty filled up for Thursday.  If none of my meetings run
over, then I have a break between noon and 1:00 or 2:00 and 3:00.  Or I
could discuss these issues after 8:00 p.m.  Let me know when you would like
to talk and if you continue to have issues in this regard.  Thanks - Sylvia
