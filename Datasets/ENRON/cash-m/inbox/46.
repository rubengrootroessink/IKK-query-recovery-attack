Michelle,

Since we are wanting to include our 5 Canadian employees in Montreal I passed some questions to Dawn Doucet in Calgary.  Our Montreal employees receive payroll and benefits via Enron Canada.

She has referred me to the following employment attorney in Canada.  Please see his contact info below.  Assume someone from your group will want to handle the legal inquiries?

Thanks
Cathy

Dawn,

Yes, can you forward a name?  Maybe Michelle Cash already know someone, not sure though.

Thanks

Cathy,
I think you might be ok with the severance package you suggested but I strongly recommend that you seek a legal opinion from a Canadian source.  I can't do the research in this short a time period.  Sorry.  Let me know if you'd like a contact name.....

Dawn, Tricia,

No doubt you've seen recent announcements form the CEO and COO of EEL regarding headcount reductions.  To that end EEL has rolled out a voluntary redundancy program.  Following suit, Metals NA is also rolling out a Voluntary Separation Program to all staff in the US and we want to include those employees in Montreal.

I've been working with Michelle Cash to finalise the plan, attached are two documents that will give you a summary of the plan.  In essence, its 2 wks base pay per year of service PLUS 2 wks base pay per 10K of salary for an executed Waiver and Release.

Do you see any issues with making the Montreal staff eligible for this plan?

A general employee meeting is being held tomorrow to announce the roll out and Monday will be the 2 wk kick of the program when employees will receive more detail of the plan.

Practically speaking, we anticipate keeping only 2-3 people in Montreal.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks
Cathy
