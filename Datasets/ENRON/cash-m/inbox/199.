Subject: RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO


I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. =
The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the=
 unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally,=
 people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the e=
state which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to spons=
or green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the fo=
rm of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
=20
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as di=
fficult as this may be.
=20
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
=20
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at =
least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a p=
erson as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typica=
lly, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr=
ent have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NE=
TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th=
e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that=
 is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr=
on's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of =
cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. =
This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com=
mitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to rep=
ay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each cas=
e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the sp=
ecific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting per=
iod but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take En=
ron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their pl=
an requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obvious=
ly will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years=
 in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contr=
asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is the=
re a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on ne=
gative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too=
 much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is a=
pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l=
ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these wil=
l take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who hav=
e VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will =
not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou=
nter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid travel=
ing outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be=
 legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from s=
cratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil=
l support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enro=
n estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officia=
lly proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although e=
ach counter-party has indicated a desire to "normalise" the terms with thos=
e of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate pla=
ns to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective bu=
yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working =
assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, w=
ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that indi=
viduals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not=
 honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions =
that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation her=
e.
=20
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary review=
s, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out=
, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after al=
l the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks =
in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over=
 the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while=
 to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal postin=
g process).
=20
As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON"T want to go and=
 why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an "offer" to switch and NOT accepti=
ng it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the "offer" are unlikely to=
 be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t=
hem out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance=
, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh=
o had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.
=20
Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points fo=
r all. Lets get them out Weds.

Importance: High


David,
I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zh=
iyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me =
why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discus=
sing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However=
, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exager=
ration.
=20
I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the differenc=
e between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking wit=
h everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be ta=
lking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did te=
ll the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a prob=
lem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon dea=
l closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it =
would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us no=
w if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer =
same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time =
of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited informa=
tion but we would update the group when more became available.=20
=20
It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their =
visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but=
 my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have =
also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is th=
at we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until dea=
l closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital a=
nd will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole.=20
=20
In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns =
are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they fe=
el like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are =
on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process =
over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked =
to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with s=
ome options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we reque=
sted but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns.=20
=20
I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to corre=
ct this miscommunication. Please keep me updated if you hear anything else.=
 Thanks!

Subject: I am getting heat from IT.....



....Essentially I am guessing that what we asked them to communicate re NET=
CO and what they did may be two rather different things. While the 1078 mil=
es (I counted them - it broke up boredom of drive) between me picking up vo=
icemails here and what is actually transpiring, it sounds like we a mis-com=
munication mess in IT.

People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told, they had no choice but to =
go and if they didn't they would lose there visa, etc., etc.,

This was not our intention clearly. We (I thought) made it clear that we wo=
uld initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate bu=
t we'd like to talk with them about why. If it's VISA's we have that nailed=
, they shouldn't be concerned. If it's getting "offered a lower paid job" t=
hat simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay an=
d Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they=
 would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated=
 company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them=
 to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties ben=
efits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bri=
dge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (c=
urrent proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, sto=
ck awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working=
 assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherw=
ise.

On retention, we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those p=
eople who didn't receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for th=
is to be paid to employees in the form of a cash "retention/bonus" payment =
on or as soon after deal closure as we can. As you guys know these dollars =
approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if =
Enron was solvent.

Help me manage this please.=20
