It looiks like we have 30 days to get this done.  Joyce, is there someone we should be coordinating with at Enron in case they are filing a consolidated Form 10?

Mack,

As explained below, Enron's filing is a "reportable event" with respect
to PGE's Pension Plan.  Please give us a call if you would
like to discuss.  Thanks.
