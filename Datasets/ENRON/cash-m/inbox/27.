Dear all, 
Attached is a draft document titled  'Enron Diversity Overview'.  It is a consolidation of the major diversity efforts at Enron.  If you are aware of other diversity efforts, please let me know.  The first two areas listed have been the focus of the Diversity Sub-Committee.   

I have requested an update from the owners of the other areas and hope to have this updated by our 2:45 p.m. meeting.  

Community Relations - Misha Siegel (for Elyse Kalmans)
Enron Investment Partners - Barbara Paige (for Kevin Garland)
Minority & Women Business Development - Calvin Eakin, Jennifer Medcalf
Social Responsibility -  Lauren Iannarone
BU Efforts - Kalen Pieper, Robert Jones
