Michelle,

We have a reconciling item between SAP Account 0530-10220019 Outflow Clearing and the actual bank balance with Citibank New York 40781075 in the amount of $5,346.46.

On 10-26-01 your forwarded to Treasury Wire Transfer Requests as follows:

Payee                                   Amount     Curr    US Amount
Denton Wilde Sapte Tokyo   $492,120      JPY    $4,024.20
Rajah and Tann                   $2,425.65     SGD   $1,332.26

It appears that these two (2) Wire Transfer Requests have not been forwarded to A/P to record the expense.

Please arrange to forward the appropriate documentation to A/P during November 2001.
