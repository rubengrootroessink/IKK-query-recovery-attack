For the following question from Michelle's list:


8.  Para 18:   Please update $15 million figure to reflect tuition
reimbursement expenses


Can you please run the following reports:

YTD payments for Wagetype 1350 (Tuition Non Taxable) and 1351 (Tuition Taxable).    For an estimate for December, I would suggest running the same wagetypes for the month of May.  (I am assuming that May and December are comparable for reimbursement requests).

Thanks,
Diane
