Michelle:
 I am currently leading the due diligence effort for Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline as it relates to the Dynegy merger.  Dynegy has scheduled an all day due diligence session this Thursday beginning at 9 a.m. which obviously conflicts with the Bill Rome Mediation.  First thought: can we re-schedule? Second thought: the Dynegy meeting will be here at Enron - I can be in and out of the meeting but need to be here in the building.  In addition, how long will this take?  I would rather not re-schedule the mediation if at all possible but can't re-schedule the Dynegy meeting either.
