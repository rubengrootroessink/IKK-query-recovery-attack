Michelle, 
Here are some thoughts: 
If the benefits which require employees to be actually in attendance are insured benefits, it would be a good idea to contact the insurance company to see how the WARN leave of absence or furlough affects coverage under the group policy.  The insurance company may not pay the benefit regardless of what Enron wants to do.  If when the insurance company understands the circumstances, would be willing to pay a benefit to an employee on WARN leave of absence, then it would be a good idea to have the Welfare Benefits Plans Committee adopt a procedure for such insured plans that states employees on WARN leave of absence or furlough with pay are considered to be actively at work during such period that they are instructed not to come to their work location during such time. 
As to Section 2.3(e) of the Plan, we could either delete that section and add a six month active employment eligibility period with no service bridge to Section 2.1, or revise (e) to state the same thing.
