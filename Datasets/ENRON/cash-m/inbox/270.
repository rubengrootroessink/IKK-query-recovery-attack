EIGHTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS NLRB VIEW THAT TV STATION WORKERS NOT
SUPERVISORS

Substantial evidence supports the National Labor Relations
Board's ruling that a television station's assignment
editors and producers are not supervisors and therefore are
entitled to vote in a union election, the Eighth Circuit
rules ("Multimedia KSDK Inc. v. NLRB, "8th Cir., No.
00-1684, 11/15/01). The appeals court agrees with the board
that KSDK-TV in St. Louis committed an unfair labor practice
by refusing to recognize International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local 4 as the bargaining representative
of a unit of news department assignment editors, producers,
and tape coordinators following the union's election win.
The television station refused to bargain, arguing the
assignment editors and producers are supervisors and
therefore not covered by the National Labor Relations Act.

The three-judge panel unanimously finds assignment editors
are not supervisors because they "largely react to incoming
news sources" and in "a mechanical and routine process"
assign photographers and editors and coordinate lunch
breaks. However, the panel splits 2-1 on the producers, with
the majority finding they act within a "collaborative
process" and do not exercise sufficient independent
judgment. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

AVIATION SECURITY BILL CREATES FEDERAL SCREENER JOBS

The House and Senate approve a conference agreement on
aviation security (S. 1447) that creates a federalized
baggage screening workforce for two years, clearing the way
for President Bush's signature. The Senate passed the bill
on a voice vote, and the measure then passed the House on a
vote of 410-9.

Bush says he will sign the measure. In a statement, the
president commends members of the conference committee for
reaching agreement on a measure "that puts the federal
government in charge of aviation security, making airline
travel safer for the American people." The bill provides a
one-year transition period before the new system is put in
place, with the federal government immediately assuming
responsibility for all baggage screening. . . . Page A-11,

HOFFA DECLARES VICTORY OVER LEEDHAM IN TEAMSTERS ELECTION

Teamsters President James P. Hoffa declares victory in his
bid to continue leading the 1.4 million-member union for the
next five years. Hoffa took an early and decisive lead over
Tom Leedham, out-polling his challenger by about 2-to-1 in
the ballots counted in the first three days of the week-long
tallying process.  Leedham concedes defeat, posting a
statement on his campaign Web site saying he had been
"outspent 10-to-1 by an incumbent with a famous name."

Flanked by members of his slate of executive board
candidates on the steps of the Teamsters headquarters near
Capitol Hill, Hoffa declares "the membership has spoken loud
and clear" by re-electing him. "They want a union that is
democratic and united. They want a union that is fiscally
responsible, yet forward looking," he says. . . . Page A-1

EMPLOYER'S REQUEST OF LEAVE DELAY MAY HAVE CHILLED FMLA
RIGHTS

The Sands Hotel and Casino may have violated the Family and
Medical Leave Act rights of one of its employees by asking
him to delay his leave until after the Memorial Day weekend,
a federal judge in New Jersey rules, rejecting the
employer's motion for summary judgment  ("Shtab v. Greate
Bay Hotel and Casino Inc., "D.N.J., No. 00-2122, 11/13/01).

 Ira Shtab, a cook at the hotel for five years, had sought
leave to care for his toddler son, who was
autistic."[R]easonable persons could conclude that [the
human resource representative's] request 'chilled' Shtab's
assertion of his rights under the FMLA or could conclude
that Shtab's decision to take leave over the Memorial Day
weekend contributed to the Sands's ultimate denial of his
request," Judge Orlofsky holds, allowing the employee to
proceed to trial with his claim. . . . Page A-7

OSHA GUIDANCE ON ANTHRAX DISCUSSES RISKS, PRECAUTIONS FOR
BUSINESSES

OSHA issues promised guidance for employers responding to
anthrax exposure in the workplace. The "anthrax matrix,"
available on the agency's Web site, organizes possible
employer responses according to the likelihood of
contamination and worker' exposure to the bacteria.
Workplaces are categorized into three zones according to
level of risk: a green zone, where contamination with
anthrax spores is unlikely; a yellow zone, where
contamination is possible; and a red zone, where public
health or law enforcement authorities have confirmed or
strongly suspect anthrax contamination, or where an
emergency response and clean-up effort is under way.

The level of risk in any particular workplace is based on
various factors, the guidance says. These include the
current pattern of contaminated workplaces, the likelihood a
particular workplace would be a target or would receive mail
or other items from a contaminated facility, and the type of
workplace where the threat is being assessed. "Based on
information currently available, contamination with anthrax
spores ...  [is] unlikely in the vast majority of American
workplaces, represented by the green zone," the guidance
says.

Labor Secretary Chao cautions that the department is
providing needed guidance, not creating new requirements.
"The world has changed since Sept. 11," Chao says. "Threats
to our national security now can clearly involve the
workplace." . . . Page A-6

WORKER ALLEGING FORCED FMLA LEAVE FAILS TO SHOW ADVERSE JOB
ACT

A marketing graphics manager in Minnesota who alleged she
was constructively discharged after being forced to take
medical leave failed to establish that her employer violated
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Minnesota Human
Rights Act, or the Family and Medical Leave Act, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota rules
("Tremblay v. Liberty Enterprises Inc., "D. Minn., No.
00-1983 (DWF/AJB), 11/9/01).

Each of Ruth A. Tremblay's claims required her to show that
she was subjected to an adverse job action, but she did not
meet that burden, Judge Frank finds, granting Liberty
Enterprises summary judgment on all the claims. "[N]o
reasonable jury could conclude that the incidents described
by Tremblay were severe and pervasive enough to compel a
reasonable person to quit," Frank decides. . . . Page A-9
