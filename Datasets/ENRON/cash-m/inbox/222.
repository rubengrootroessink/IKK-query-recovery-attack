Michelle/Jo Ann, these people do not show up in the HR Data Warehouse (HRGIS or EPC structures) from what we can tell based off the names provided.  If they have identification numbers that we can use, it may help since names can be misspelled easily.  We searched by last name then checked each one for a match on first or middle name.  Let me know if you have any other information.
 
Kathy

Kathy -- please see attached file.  For those individuals listed as having no record in SAP, can you please check to see if these people are in either EPC or HRGIS and provide the requested information?
Please return the file to Michelle Cash.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Michelle -- that's why I worded it the way I did.  I only have enterprise access to SAP.  Kathy Schultea would be the person who could query the global system and/or the old EPC system if they were terminated in EPC.  

Any other questions, please let me know.
Thanks. 
Jo Ann

Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14 
individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for certain 
that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that there 
is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR datawarehouse 
tell us more information? 

Thanks, 
Kevin
