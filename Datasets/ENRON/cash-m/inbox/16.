Michelle:

After I sent you my prior emails, Garry Mathiason responded with the
following emails on the two subjects that you raised.  Garry usually has
helpful insights so I thought I would pass them along:

Regarding the terrorism audit, this is an "external" threat assessment and
requires a qualified security company.  I think that Johnathan Tal could do
such an audit as well as some other more established security firms.

 <<Johnathan Tal>>

Regarding the HR consultant, the potential list is endless.  I have some top
level contacts with Delotte's Human Capital group.  Meanwhile, I think the
best non-attorney group on downsizing is probably  Right and Associates.
This is an area that we (Littler) have developed into a science.  At Cisco,
HP, AA, AOL, Solection, etc. we have advised on many of this issues.  Call
me if you would like specifics.  Garry

Michelle, here is the local contact for Right & Associates whom I have met:

 <<Joe A. Bowden>>

It does not look like we have an off-the-shelf memo on legal issues related
to Terrorism, but with our workplace violence work, we probably can put
something together less expensively and more thoroughly than other firms.
Let me know what we can do to help.
