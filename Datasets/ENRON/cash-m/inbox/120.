Please see the attached reports detailing the gross and net payrolls for 11/29 (weekly/biweekly) and the 11/30 (semi) paydays.  I have also included the breakout by tax company for the Gross Amounts.   This first version has the tax company numbers as I wanted to get it to you as soon as possible.  We are in the process of including the names and will send you an updated file.


 


Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks,
Diane
