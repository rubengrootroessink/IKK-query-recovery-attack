Here is the offer letter template - the offer consists of an offer letter, a term sheet and a summary of terms and conditions.  We assume that we would be obligated to pay the guaranteed minimum bonus even if the employee were laid off prior to February.  (I know a lot of non-A/A's get guaranteed minimum bonuses in their offer letters as well - the Global Compensation database  should have a comprehensive list).
