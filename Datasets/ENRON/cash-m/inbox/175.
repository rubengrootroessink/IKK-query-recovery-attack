Can you forward me a list of the bankruptcy companies?  Thanks.

FYI...just to let you know that I am waiting on them to get me a list of bankruptcy companies.  You wouldn't happen to have that, would you?

Hmmm, good question. I will make sure Marsha makes a distinction. Thanks!

No it doesn't sound crazy, it is exactly what I was hoping you would provide.  Please send the company numbers with the list.  Also, just to make sure, you want employees only, not contractors or joint venture employees, right?

Thanks,
Johnna

I talked to Marsha and Mr. Bowen is going to give us a list of bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies. Then could you send us four lists - bankrupt domestic employees, non-bankrupt domestic employees, bankrupt international employees, non-bankrupt international employees? Does that sound crazy? :-)

I'll forward the list when I get it.

Thanks-
Cyndi

Cindi,

I need some clarification on the lists that you need.  We currently have lists for ALL SAP US which should provide the domestic people, and by combining the ALL GLOBAL list with the ALL SAP UK list you should have the international people.  How do we distinguish between the bankrupt and non-bankrupt entities?  Do you have a list of companies that define this?

Regards,
Johnna

Can you talk to the people that manage global messaging and make sure that they have the ability to segregate broadcast messages into domestic and international and bankrupt and non-bankrupt entities.  It is important that we clean this up.
