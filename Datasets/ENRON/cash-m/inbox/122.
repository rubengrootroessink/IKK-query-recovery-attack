Michelle,

Long time no see - hope you're doing well despite the difficult times we're in.  

I'd wish to consult your employment law expertise.  Staff in Oslo and Stockholm are employed by the captioned company, incorporated in Delaware.  The question has arisen what guarantee, if any, there is for salaries and other employment benefit under a US bankruptcy or Chap. 11.  Perhaps you have a memo or something to send over. Thanks.

Martin
