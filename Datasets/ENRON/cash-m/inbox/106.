Attached is a form due diligence list I have put together using the Pomona DD list as a go-by.  The technical questions are light and will be largely dependent on the type of asset we are pursuing (pulp or paper).  We can have the techical gurus draft their questions.  The formatting is messy but we can fix that when we complete it.  Have you sent me the info we discussed last week?  If so, as of today I haven't received it.  

Give me a call if you have any questions or comments.
