Michelle-

Good morning, and I hope that this e-mail finds you well.  The reason
for my message is to follow-up with you regarding the conversation
myself, Darlene Donlan, and Greg DeLuca from our organization had with
you a few weeks back.  We had discussed making additions to the Enron
master PWD and getting copies of Enron's Code of Ethics, background
check requirements, and Enron's benefits package regarding the
indemnification clause.  Darlene, who is one of TEKsystems' Controllers,
sent to your attention a copy of the revised PWD with payment terms and
TEKsystems' services, and Mark has been working and communicating with
myself regarding the other requested information.  I just wanted to
follow-up with you to see what additional steps, if any, that TEKsystems
may need to take in order to continue moving forward in the contract
execution process.  If there is any additional information you may
require of us on our end, please let me know and I will be happy to help
assist in any way possible.

I know that you are extremely busy, and that you probably have other,
more pressing matters to spend your time on.  Any feedback you could
provide would be appreciated  and most helpful.  Thank you once again
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Respectfully,

David A. Smith
Regional Sales Manager
