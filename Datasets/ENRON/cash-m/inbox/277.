Michelle, I have talked to Steven Sheldon, Martin Sacchi, and soon to talk to Marc Hensel and Ed Smida as well as Michele Nezi Marvin re: broadband litigation support work.  Luckily for the effort, I think all of these people, with the exception of Steven have a longer term position at broadband or elsewhere at Enron.  If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.  Sherron.

I'm wanting to use Martin Saachi and Steven Sheldon, both directors from EBS.  The quant work would be people from Vince's shop that are probably not as effected by the 'surplusing'.  I'll confirm Monday.  Thanks, Sherron.

I need to have the names as soon as possible, even if they may choose not to do it.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michele - I have not yet gotten a hold of the 2 individuals I'd like to work with on this.  Mark H. had asked me not speak to them until after I'd met with Richard Sanders.  At any rate, I should be able to speak to them next week and get their names to you - I want to ensure that they want to work on the project.  I'll be in touch as soon as possible next week.  Regards, Sherron
