Here is the updated memo.  You might have someone review it before you start
using it, especially the part in red.  I wouldn't want anyone to perceive
that you or I are doing anything to discourage students from considering
Enron as their first choice.  I think it does need to be addressed, as I'm
sure you will be asked this with increasing frequency in the upcoming
months.
