That is correct  -  I pulled the information for 0985 only.

Thanks very much.

Just to confirm, the information provided pertains to company #0985, correct?  That is the only EES company that we are preparing bankruptcy analysis for at this time.

Also, is it possible to breakdown the gross payroll on 11/30 by salaried and hourly employees?

Thanks,
Carrie

Carrie - as per our conversation the info that I have available on the 11/30 payday is as follows:

Gross Payroll	$5,022,034.58

Unemployment Taxes	$3,455.74

Employer Taxes (excluding unemployment)	$245,696.15

I think we discussed the remainder of the request on the phone.

Sorry this response has been delayed.

Diane,

My name is Joshua and I am an analyst working with Carrie Evans
to assimilate the needed information for EES' bankruptcy filing.
There are a few questions we need your help on.

E. When is payroll funded (how many days in advance of actual payment date)?
H. Break-down of amount of all payroll taxes?
I. Amounts owed in respect of unused vacation?
J. Amounts owed to employees for reimbursement for business expenses etc.?

Thanks so much, Diane. Call me if you have any questions?
