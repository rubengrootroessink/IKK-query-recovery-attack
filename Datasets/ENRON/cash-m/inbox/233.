PAST DISCIPLINE CAN BE CONSIDERED IN REVIEW OF POSTAL
FIRING, JUSTICES SAY

In reviewing the reasonableness of a U.S. Postal Service
worker's termination for cumulative misconduct, the Merit
Systems Protection Board may consider past discipline of the
employee even if those actions are being grieved, the U.S.
Supreme Court rules, reversing a Federal Circuit decision
("USPS v. Gregory, "U.S., No. 00-758, 11/13/01).

Writing for the court, Justice O'Connor acknowledges that a
federal employee may be faced with a board decision that
reaches a different result than the grievance arbitrator
ultimately might reach, or never have his or her grievance
resolved because a collective bargaining agreement requires
union withdrawal of a grievance when the board issues a
final decision. There is nothing unfair in those results,
however, the court says, because a union-represented federal
employee who elects to pursue a board appeal does in fact
receive an independent review of the reasonableness of the
agency's discipline.

 Nevertheless, the court remands the case involving Postal
Service employee Maria A. Gregory--who was accused in
September 1997 of deliberately inflating an overtime
request--because one of the three minor disciplinary actions
relied on by MSPB in its ruling was decided in Gregory's
favor by an arbitrator prior to the its decision. . . . Page

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND RULING THAT UNION'S TORT CLAIMS NOT
PREEMPTED

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court ruling
that the National Labor Relations Act does not preempt state
law tort claims by union representatives who were detained
by a nonunion contractor for trespassing on its jobsite
("Rainbow Constr. Co. v. Radcliffe, "U.S., No. 01-424,
"cert. denied" 11/13/01). Rainbow Construction Co. sought
review of a June decision by the Ninth Circuit that allowed
four representatives of the Bay Counties District Council of
Carpenters to proceed with claims of false arrest, false
imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.

The union representatives inspected various publicly
financed construction projects in Mendocino County, Calif.,
to investigate allegations that contractors were not
complying with prevailing wage and health and safety rules.
On three occasions, Rainbow made citizen's arrests of three
of the union representatives, who were then taken into
police custody. The county district attorney prosecuted all
four officials for criminal trespass. California trespass
law does not allow property owners to exclude persons
engaged in lawful union activity. The Ninth Circuit decided
California's interests in protecting its citizens were
sufficient to avoid preemption. . . . Page AA-2,  Text E-1

IOWA MAYTAG WORKERS END STRIKE AFTER ACCEPTING THREE-YEAR
CONTRACT

Workers return to Maytag's Middle Amana, Iowa, manufacturing
plant after voting to accept a new contract, effective
immediately and running until September 2004. The vote ends
a seven-week strike by some 1,800 employees represented by
the Machinists at the refrigerator and microwave oven
manufacturing plant.

The new contract addresses three issues that prompted the
strike: mandatory overtime; a two-tiered wage system; and
health insurance premium increases. Ed Miller, business
representative for IAM Local 1526, says although union
members are not entirely satisfied with the changes, they
approved the contract in the belief it was the best that
could be achieved this year. The union recommended approval
of the pact. According to Miller, the contract calls for an
hourly pay increase of $1.47 over term, with a 60-cent raise
this year, 46 cents next year, and 41 cents in late 2003.
Average pay at the plant is currently $14.40 per hour. New
hires will receive 80 percent of the previous minimum pay
and will not reach the top of the pay scale as quickly as
under the previous contract.

Maytag proposed increasing mandatory overtime to 12 hours
per week per worker, but the union was able to keep it to
eight hours per week per employee, Miller says. Union
negotiators were less successful in addressing their
concerns with health insurance, and the new contract
includes both higher premiums in the last year of the
contract and reduced benefits. A Maytag spokesman says the
company is pleased with the contract agreement. . . . Page

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO CONSIDER VICARIOUS LIABILITY FOR
SEXUAL HARASSMENT

The U.S. Supreme Court refuses to review an appeals court's
decision upholding a jury's verdict that a mine owner was
vicariously liable for sexual harassment because the company
failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the harassment
of a female miner by her male boss ("Eddy Potash Inc. v.
Harrison,  "U.S.,  No. 01-383,  "cert. denied," 11/13/01).

Eddy Potash Inc., which operated an underground potash mine
near Carlsbad, N.M., asked the justices to overturn the
Tenth Circuit's decision to affirm a jury's finding for
Jeanne Harrison. In this case's second trip to the Supreme
Court, Eddy Potash urged the court to revisit its decisions
in ""Faragher v. Boca Raton"" and "Burlington Indus. Inc. v.
Ellerth" because, it argued, those decisions did not address
whether an employer should be held vicariously liable for
sexual harassment by a supervisor where both the employer
and the employee have acted reasonably. . . . Page AA-3,

WORK CHANGES AFTER HARASSMENT CHARGE JUSTIFY TRIAL ON
RETALIATION CLAIM

A Philadelphia Housing Authority worker can proceed to trial
with her claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, based on her allegations that she was
given additional work and shift changes after participating
in the sexual harassment complaint of a co-worker  ("Jenkins
v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, "E.D. Pa., No. 00-CV-609,
10/24/01).

Monique Jenkins established "sufficient evidence of a
possible causal link" between her claim of the job changes
and her protected activity under the federal civil rights
law to warrant a trial, Judge Buckwalter of the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
holds.

Although dismissing Jenkins' other claims against her
employer, the court finds that comments from some of her
supervisors, who referred to her as a "snitch" and "not a
team player," support her allegation of retaliation. . . .
