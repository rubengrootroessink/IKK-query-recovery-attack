Tim:  I asked Tindall & Foster to answer various visa related questions that I have received over the past few days, and they have sent me the attached which covers both the non-immigrant (visas) and the immigrant (permanent residency) areas of concern.

Please have these posted as soon as possible. 
Thanks 
Margaret
