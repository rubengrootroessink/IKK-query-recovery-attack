Jane and Caroline,   Please find attached a further revised version of the =
letter, incorporating Lizzette's comments.  Also, the letter states that Ji=
m Weisser sent a letter to Joe Hirl on November 16.  Could I please get a c=
opy of that and any other letters he has sent since the November 8 letter? =
 My fax number is 713-646-8537 (and I will copy Lizzette).  The November 8 =
letter is the only one I have.  Thank you, Michelle =20

Dear Michelle and Anthony,

This is a draft response to Jim's letter of November 16, 2001 (which has be=
en faxed to you both today) that I would like to send him tomorrow (after w=
e get any comments from you two). Caroline has reviewed it already.

Also Anthony, I am a little concerned about Jim's statement that he is stil=
l working for Enron Japan albeit at home.  I wonder if you should call him =
to chat about this and see what he means (and possibly take advantage of th=
at opportunity to let him know from the horse's mouth (so to speak) that (i=
) unless EJ can identify investors for its various businesses, it will prob=
ably need to be closed in the not too distant future anyway and (ii) in any=
 case he cant get water out of a stone - i.e. he can sue EJ till the cows c=
ome home but it has no money to pay him and given that the Enron name will =
disappear from the face of the earth, Enron Corp. probably doesn't really c=
are about preserving its reputation in Japan any more so is as likely as no=
t to lust let Jim wind up Enron Japan if he is willing to spend the money.)=
  It could of course well be that he is just trying to show us that as far =
as he is concerned he is still employed and rejects the "unlawful" terminat=
ion in which case i am not so concerned.

I suggest we wait and see what his lawyer puts in the writ before deciding =
what to do next.

Thanks.
