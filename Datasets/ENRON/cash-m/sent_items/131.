Michelle 

Attached is the information I received from Alfredo Bottone (HR, Elektro) that includes Britaldo Soares' compensation related to his contract/employment with Elektro.

It is my understanding from Scott that you need to complete the new employment agreement.

Please call me if you have questions.
