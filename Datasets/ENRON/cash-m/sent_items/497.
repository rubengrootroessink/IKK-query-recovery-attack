           Can we use credited service date for sev calc?  I have a 
person who was hired in 1997, left in 1999 and was rehired 
           in April 2001.  The system is using a 1998 service date 
for severance.  I calculated in on the 2001 re hire date. 
Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.   
I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.
