I would suggest that we require a waiver before we pay the money.

Attached is the letter that I am planning to send to individuals who have accepted offers from the A&A program, but have not yet begun employment with us.  I assume that no waiver of liability is needed, since an offer letter does not incur liability.  Please review and let me know if this is adequate, or if some sort of waiver is needed as well.  Thanks.
