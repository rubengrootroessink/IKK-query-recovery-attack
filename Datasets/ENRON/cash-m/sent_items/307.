I guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like.  Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.  Michelle

We should be able to direct employees to the web site <http://home.enron.com> for plan information.

The answers so far have stated current Enron Corp Severance Plans are in place for those employees laid off.

What are the Enron Corp Severance Plan details? Where can they be found?

Thanks
