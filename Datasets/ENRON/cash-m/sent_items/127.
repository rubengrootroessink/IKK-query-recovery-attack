Michelle,

We are interested in developing a "Manger's Notebook" that would allow Managers to keep notes on employee's performance throughout the six month period of PEP.  Issues surrounding the use and storage need to be discussed before we begin our project.

Please let me know when you are available to meet and I'll make the arrangements.

Thanks,

Dave
