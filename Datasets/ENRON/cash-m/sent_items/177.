Michelle,

Attached is Joel's resume.  I'm sorry this took a while  -- I needed to
confirm his compensation requirments -- and learned that he will fit within
your range.  Please call if you have any questions.  I will be out of the
office until Monday, August 20, but  Trisha Lowery in our office will be
glad to assist you.
