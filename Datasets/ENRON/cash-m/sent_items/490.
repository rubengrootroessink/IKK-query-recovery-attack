Dear Tulane Traveler,

http://www.ahitravel.com/tulane/results/yaa/

Here's the deal:  you fly to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, then
are transported from the airport to a first-class hotel for
6 days/5 nights, for the bargain basement price of $895.*
You want more?  The evening of your arrival, there will be a
cocktail party at your hotel so you can meet the other young
Tulane travelers on the trip.  Upon your awakening, enjoy the use
of a knowledgeable local at the travel desk who can guide you to
either the insider's Amsterdam or the tourist bit.

In order to provide you with maximum flexibility, four different
departure dates will be offered for this trip: January 26 to
February 1, February 2 to 8, February 9 to 15, February 16 to 22,
February 23 to March 1, and March 2 to 8.

Amsterdam is a modern international city, at the crossroads of
Europe and at the heart of the Dutch experiment in social
freedom. It is also the historic city of Rembrandt, van Gogh,
and the Anne Frank House.  It is not only the center of Dutch
culture but also a melting pot of diversity.  The distinctive
architecture and numerous canals make Amsterdam one of the world's
most unique cities.  Easily covered on foot, Amsterdam abounds
with historic museums, great live music and clubs, international
cuisine, and superb shopping.   There simply is no other city in
the world like Amsterdam.

Check out http://www.ahitravel.com/tulane/results/yaa/ to learn
more about this affordable (long live the American dollar!) and
fun journey to Europe sponsored by the Tulane Alumni Association.
The more the merrier, so take advantage of this blue (and green)
light special--forward this message to your friends and start
planning today!
