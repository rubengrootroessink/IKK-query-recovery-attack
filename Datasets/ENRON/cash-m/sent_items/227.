Hi, Felicia.

As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.  I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.  As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.  So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.

I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.  The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.

I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

In my new roll in Compensation, I am trying to get comfortable that we have all the Employment Agreements up-to-date in the Corporate Compensation Database so that we can ensure that payments are made in a timely matter and contracts are looked at for renewal in the same timely manner.  What would help us tremendously is if we could get copies of all the contracts you produce for Corporate employees both VP and above and below VP so we can make sure they are entered into the Compensation Database.  Mary Joyce's group enters the VPs and above but Cindy Ward and I are responsible for making their payments under the contracts.  Because of this, I want to make sure we have copies and do not miss anyone.   As always, your help is very much appreciated!

Thanks!
