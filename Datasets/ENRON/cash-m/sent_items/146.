Cameron sleeps in a real bed, but would be happy on the floor as well.  No more cribs, yea!!

Great news about the tix.  We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats -- if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door, that works for us.

We are so excited!!

Good news, Rich got the tickets for Sat. (the 18th) at 1:05 p.m.
against Atlanta, it's only four tickets so we will have to find one more or
smuggle Cameron in, I'll try my friends Kathy and Don or our neighbors,
shouldn't be a problem getting one more.

Hey, what do you suggest for a bed for Cameron when you visit?  Is he in a
crib type bed or a real bed now? I can't remember.

      Hello there!

      Proposed plans are as follows:  We arrive in SF on 8/15, rent a car,
   and
      then go to Carmel for a couple of days.  We're back in SF on Friday
   for
      the
      weekend with you.  We leave on Monday.  How does that work with
   ya'll?

      More later.

      Mich

         Got your message on the voicemail at home but haven't been home in
      the
         evening to call you back, and won't be home this evening either!
      I've
         been
         so busy at work since we got back from vacation.  We had a great
   time
      I
         love
         Scandinavia, can't wait to go back.

         Hannah and Erik and the two boys are great, the kids are cute - so
      very
         blonde, but Hannah is thinking of having a third....and if she
   does
      her
         doctor has said she will be in a wheelchair for half the pregnancy
   -
      she
         has
         that pelvic thing, she was on crutches with Frankie.  Sounds like
   a
      bid
         idea
         to me, but she is a stubborn little one.

         So what's up?  Still coming out to see us I hope?  Everything else
      going
         well?
