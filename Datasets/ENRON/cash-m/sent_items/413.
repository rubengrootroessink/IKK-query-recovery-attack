Unbelievable!!  I guess he has sour grapes.  We only paid him not to apply for a job -- unfortunately, insults were not contemplated in our agreement.  Ignore him.  Michelle

Didn't we pay this guy to go away.  How can we make him stay there?

WOW Enron stock at $11.10 per share are you buying??  
It has been a year since I was escorted out of the 
Enron building by security because I did not fit the 
Enron culture.  WHAT BULLSHIT.

You actually did me a favor and I am doing great, 
however I still think you are a prick.

ps I never did hear anything about a rail 
transportation trading platform, did it happen?
