Michelle,

Has the ER Marketing Campaign Roll-out been discussed with the HR heads?  If not, I think this should be an agenda item at David Oxleys next HR heads' meeting.  I met yesterday with Gary Smith and he expressed some concerns about ER marketing its services; he's concerned that it may encourage employees who have in the past handled their concerns internally or by working with their HR Reps to come out of the woodwork and swamp our resources.  I explained to him that we are not trying to drum up more business but rather ensure that employees are aware of mechanisms in place to address workplace issues.
