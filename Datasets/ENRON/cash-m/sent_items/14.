Point well taken.  I softened the language up after sending out the e-mail, but can probably go further.  As to protection of intellectual property, the employees still have that obligation correct? Our concern is that we spent $17MM for the IP, and we now have a former employee brazenly declaring that he can use our IP to start his own business.

Although all employees did sign the non-compete, I believe (without doing any research on Florida law) that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce since there is no ongoing business of AMPS to protect.  As such, I believe that such a statement is kind of like rubbing salt into the wounds of these employees.  
 
A gentle reminder of confidentiality would be appropriate, but any mention of a non-compete probably would not be well received.

I would like to include the following paragraph in the termination letter to AMPS employees: 
Please advise. 

NON-COMPETE/CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

When you became an AMPS employee, you signed a confidentiality and non-compete agreement promising to maintain company information in strict confidence.  The provisions of the confidentiality agreement include a non-compete agreement, which is in effect for 24 months after you leave AMPS.  The non-compete and confidentiality provisions are in effect, and we would like to remind you of your responsibility not to share proprietary company information with new employers or competitors of AMPS until the expiration of the 24-month period.  If you have any questions, please refer to the employment agreement which you signed when you became an AMPS employee.
