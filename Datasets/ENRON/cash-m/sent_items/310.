I agree that it is best to leave alone.

Last I checked, the severance plan is not currently listed on the intranet.  I wonder whether we should provide information regarding the current plan as it may change in the very immediate future.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks, Cole.

We should be able to direct employees to the web site <http://home.enron.com> for plan information.

The answers so far have stated current Enron Corp Severance Plans are in place for those employees laid off.

What are the Enron Corp Severance Plan details? Where can they be found?

Thanks
