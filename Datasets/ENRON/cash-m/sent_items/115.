This is resume for a good guy and a friend of mine from my judicial clerkship days who is looking to move back to Houston (he was with VE here for several years) and is hoping to find a litigation position in house.  Sanders says EWS isn't looking.  Any ideas re Corp. or our other subs.?

Eddy:

Attached is Field's resume.  Obviously, give him or me a call as you see
fit.

Again, thanks for your help.
