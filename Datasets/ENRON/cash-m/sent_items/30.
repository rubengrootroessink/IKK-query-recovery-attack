George,

I spoke with Fran about the Leaf River contracts.  She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from Eric Connor.  Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.  I understand that Fran has asked Eric for this data.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle
