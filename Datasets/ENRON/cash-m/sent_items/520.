I have retained Kerry Notestine from Littler Mendelson to help me on this project, so we don't need to get Bob Vote involved.

Michelle, 
After our conversation on Wednesday, we put together a summary of RIF Issues and Strategies to review with the key HR personnel.  Attached is a copy of the summary for your review.  In addition, attached is a copy of recommendations from a compliance  perspective on areas that we would like to see considered as plans are made.  Robert Jones has recommended that we meet with you and Robert Vote from a litigation perspective on what we should be looking at from a compliance standpoint, specifically with adverse impact analysis.  Please let me know when we can quickly get together. Thanks. ay
