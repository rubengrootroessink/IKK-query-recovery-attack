Alan,
 
I understand that you have approved the request below.  Is this because they are WRA personnel?
 
Thanks.

Hi Michelle, please see below.  Should I just take this for face value or inquire as to why?  I've only been asked to take off 1 person for harrassment before.  This just seems strange getting a list of people without any explaination.
