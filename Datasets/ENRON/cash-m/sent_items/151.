Last night Sheila Walton asked if I would be interested in being the Generalist for Corporate HR (just an extra assignment along with my other responsibilities).  I told her I would be interested but would need to talk with you about it and of course she would need to discuss it with David.

The reason I'm interested is because it would allow me to keep up with what is happening in the Generalist world.  When I was the HR Rep for HR North America, I mostly dealt with Employee Relations type issues for the HR group.  Although those type problems with HR occur infrequently it requires someone who could handle information confidentially and with sensitivity.  Sheila feels that someone from our group would also lend a certain amount of neutrality since our group is somewhat separate from the other Corporate functions.  Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now, dealing with Employee Relations issues.  Sheila said she would provide all the administrative support needed and there is staffing to deal with hiring.  

I expect that the added duties would take less than 5% of my time.  Although I already have my hands full now with the OLER duties I think I could make it work even if it means extending my work day or doing more week-end work.  I recognize the big undertaking that we have going with the Employee Relations and would not compromise the quality of work that would be needed to be successful.

What do you think?  Do you think we could make this work?

Valeria
