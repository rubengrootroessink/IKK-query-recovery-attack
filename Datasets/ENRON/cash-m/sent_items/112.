Kathy, we should go ahead and remove these people.  They are employed by WRA, which is in a transition process on a confidential matter.  Please remove them.  Thanks.  Michelle

Hi Michelle, please see below.  Should I just take this for face value or inquire as to why?  I've only been asked to take off 1 person for harrassment before.  This just seems strange getting a list of people without any explaination.
