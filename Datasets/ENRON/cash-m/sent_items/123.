Mike,

Would you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the NEPCO charge?  I would like to obtain information from him and be "in the loop" on all legal matters involving NEPCO's employment practices issues.

Thanks a lot.  I am looking forward to visiting with you in person next week.

Michelle
