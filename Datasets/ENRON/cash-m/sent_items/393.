Lizzette, 
If we have to reinstate or hire new employees in the near future, will we have a sample re-instatement or sample offer letter available?   I don't need one now but I anticipate possibly needing one in the future.

Hector, this may be coming - We need to get approval from Net Works OTC and then Oxley, but just fyi.  I will forward emails to you as I receive them.

Per our conversation yesterday, below is a list of EGM employees that we would like to reinstate.  Please use this for changes to the budget and I will provide a justification memo by lunch time today.
1.) Bill Kasemervisz - Manager 
2.) Marilyn Schoppe - Staff 
3.) Tara Bryce - Staff or Specialist
4.) Paula Lacour - Staff or Specialist 
5.) Elizabeth Hernandez - Sr. Specialist  
6.) Linda Ewing - Specialist 

Thanks
