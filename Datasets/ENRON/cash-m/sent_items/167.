This is the background to my conversation with Shanna. I have a copy of the document I can give to you tomorrow. Thanks for following up on this. Per

Per -

I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher. Could you please ask Shanna to take this situation to Sharon tomorrow?

John, Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions. I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur. 

Thank you

Paula
