We absolutely need to hold him to his evergreen.   It is his responsibility to understand the contract he signed.   If we have to, we should sue him to prevent him from working.

My understanding from Doug Miller is that he was taking a position at Calpine.  I indicated to him that he was still under an Evergreen Clause on his employment agreement.  I believe that there is some confusion with employees under a standard agreement where they think that there time to sit out 3 months post their agreement not 3 months following there termination with Enron.  I explained this to Doug and he stated that he needed to work and would continue with his plans to go to Calpine since he had to look after his family.  That being said, I spoke with Michelle Cash and she thought we needed to hold him to the non compete. She suggested that I speak with the business unit to assess their interest.  What are your thoughts?
