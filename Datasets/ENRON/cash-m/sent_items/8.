Hi Randy;  thanks for helping Kelly with these consulting agreements.  Hopefully, attached above are the 2 emails that I think you'll need.  One is a note from Kelly with basic information on the 2 consultants and how he wants to approach the scope of work (for now, they are to be on a real tight leash, where, at our request, they will set up and attend mtings with folks in the environmental community, as we direct), and to let them propose their hourly rates.  The other email is the form that Michelle Cash says we should use for these "political"/"quasi-political" consultants.

Thanks again for your help.  Kelly is in SF the rest of this week (he's not traveling after all, for all the obvious reasons).

All the best,
Karen
