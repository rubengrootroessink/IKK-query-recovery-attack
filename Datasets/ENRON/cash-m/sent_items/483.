Michelle: 
Lynn would like to get the discovery responses back before taking the Plaintiff's deposition.  Have you had a chance to review the latest draft of the discovery requests?  If they meet with your approval, we will send the requests out today.  We will start attempting to find a workable date for the deposition.  Will you be attending?  If so, please let me know what dates will work for you and then we will attempt to find an agreeable date with Plaintiff and his attorney.
Christine Neely, 
Secretary to Lynn Paul Mattson and Kristen L. Brightmire 
Doerner, Saunders, Daniel & Anderson, L.L.P.

Thanks, Lynn, for the update.  If they have no interest in putting a 
settlement offer out there, then I suggest that we schedule the plaintiff's 
deposition.  Let's turn up the heat.  Michelle
