I am happy for us to paper the deal.  I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset.  Michelle

Lizette, attached is the consultive service draft that Mike Vlaming @ scarth lyons prepared and submitted. This agreement will be for the REF L.L.C.  This draft represents the compensation and recovery concerns that Scarth Lyons have as a result of the early termination of 2 prior agreements with Enron development spvs. They loose out when Enron flips a deal and the successor terminates.  Please review and let me know your views on the best way to proceed.  Michelle has agreed that this is "just papering up a deal that is already underway".  Once ready, I'll ask Michelle's support for the execution approval and I will let the commercial team know.  Thanks, Rj.

Rick: 

Attached is the proposed Consulting Services Agreement incorporating changes as we discussed.  In particular, I have modified the following paragraphs:    (1), (3), (3.b), (3.d), (3.e), (13) and (14.c). 

Once you and Michelle have had an opportunity to review this revised Consulting Services Agreement, please contact me to discuss the changes.
