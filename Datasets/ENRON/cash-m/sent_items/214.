FYI.  I've left him a message that it is "no problem" in this instance.  But, I know that you were interested in having it reviewed before it went out, so I wanted to let you know what was happening.  MHC

No problem with the review process however it is worth noting that attempts
were made to contact you however you were out of the office for a few days.
Taking the next step, I tried to contact Dave Lund and or Dave Hattery and
they too were out.  In needing to get the response out I did not have the
luxury of waiting for everybody to return.  Thus, I went a head and sent it
out as we have historically.

Thank you for your time, assistance and input on this case.

Frank Garrard

Thanks, Frank, for the update.  It sounds like this one will go away.  If
you don't mind, in the future, I would appreciate the opportunity to review
the response before it goes to OSHA.  Thanks a lot.  Have a good weekend.
Michelle

   Michelle,
   This is to advise of the  action taken by NEPCO and the current status
   of the claim mentioned in the  subject line of this e-mail.  In
   maintaining contact with the OSHA  Investigator on this case, I've had
   several amiable conversations regarding  She's status and stance in the
   matter.  As you know, by virtue of my  initial call to the Investigator
   (Randall L. Ounce) NEPCO satisfied the first  requirement of the 15 day
   response window.  I advised him during that call  that NEPCO was in the
   discovery phase whereby documentation was being collected  to support
   NEPCO's position.  He admitted to not yet having dialogue with  the
   claimant and therefore took no exception to our needing more time.  He
   in fact added one additional week to the two weeks I had requested.  He
   felt it may take this long for him to review the allegations and contact
   the  claimant.  In a subsequent conversation a week later, I advised him
   of the  fact that information was still coming in about the case.
   Again, he stated  he was unable to contact the claimant despite numerous
   calls to the claimants  home.  On August 15, 2001 I completed NEPCO's
   formal response to Mr.  Koonce's which was mailed the same day
   certified-return receipt.  I called  Mr. Ounce to advise him that our
   response had been mailed.  Once more he  said that he had been unable to
   contact the claimant.  She's plan is to  send written notification to
   the claimant with a set number of days in which the  claimant must
   respond.  In the event claimant doesn't, OSHA will close the  case.  At
   this time, Mr. Ounce does not have a strong feeling the  claimant will
   respond.  Additionally, after discussion of the supporting  documents,
   timelines and the lack of response by the claimant, Mr. Ounce  admitted
   to believing this to be a classic case of employee  disgruntlement.  My
   feeling is that the case will be closed by OSHA  with no further action.
   So that you may enter it into your file, I will  mail you a hard copy of
   NEPCO's formalized response.

   Regards,
   Frank Garrard
   Manager, EH&S
