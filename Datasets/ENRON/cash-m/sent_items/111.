Not a problem if the employee does not date it.  The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company.  MHC

Michelle,
I have run across a few agreements where the employee has signed the agreement but not dated it.  Is this something that could potentially be a problem?
I think that, for our (exec comp) purposes, the agreement is not actually in effect until it is signed by the person "offering" the terms.  Is this true?
Thank you

Dana
