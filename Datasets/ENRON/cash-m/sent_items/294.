I think this works.  What is the best way to incorporate this into the plan?

Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. 
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.
