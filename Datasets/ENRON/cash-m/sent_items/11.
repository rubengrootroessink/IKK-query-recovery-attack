George, attached for Enron's review and comments, please find initial drafts of the following documents:

1.	LLC Operating Agreement
2.	Black Liquor Exchange Agreement
3.	Tall Oil Purchase Agreement
4.	Turpentine Broker Agreement
5.	Wood Fiber Supply Agreement
6.	Leaf River Services Agreement
7.	Material Spreading Agreement
8.	Pulp Supply Agreement

Please note that in the interest of time we are circulating these documents prior to complete review by G-P.  Accordingly, the attached agreements remain subject to further review and comment.

G-P plans to distribute an initial draft of the Human Resources Agreement and a Railroad Services Agreement next week.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Please also copy Tony Rothermel at trothermel@KSLAW.com.  Just you and I, and maybe one lawyer from each side, should schedule time next week for an initial Enron/GP video conference call review of the attached agreements and your draft of the contribution agreement.  After next weeks discussion and any resulting changes, we can convene a larger meeting with all the lawyers to work through the second versions of all agreements.  Thanks!
