Cathy Bates contacted me earlier today and asked that I look into her conce=
rns.  I am in the process of investigating this matter and will contact you=
 back with my findings.  According to Fran Mayes, there were other issues i=
nvolved in the decision to end Ms. Bates' employment.

THIS MESSAGE IS PERSONAL  AND CONFIDENTIAL
=20
Mr. Lay:
    After attending the  All Employee Meeting at The Hyatt on Thursday, Aug=
ust 16th during the Q&A  period, someone sent the comment stating "Redeploy=
ment is a  Joke". You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions=
 or  concerns regarding this matter to shoot a e-mail to you, and you would=
  respond .  After that statement regarding redeployment, I felt  compelled=
 to do just what you said-- send a message about my redeployment  experienc=
e.  I am doing this for two reasons: 1) to  prevent what has happened to me=
 (from the HR representatives side of  redeployment) from happening to any =
other Enron employee whether redeployment or  any other experience with Enr=
on's HR reps and,  2) to let  you know the redeployment process at Enron is=
 effective and efficient  and two of  the MAIN values of Enron must be exal=
ted higher.   Those values are Communication and  Respect.
=20

    I received redeployment from  Enron Broadband Services- Investment grou=
p on Monday, June 18th, 2001.   Sheila Walton, a HR rep spoke to me regardi=
ng what the process would  entail.  During this meeting, Sheila mentioned t=
he redeployment process to  me, but discussed and stressed to me more, my o=
ptions  when I departed the company, rather than my options to locate anoth=
er  position with the company, not at all promoting the advantage of  redep=
loyment and its many success stories.  With no directions from Sheila  Walt=
on, I took it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment grou=
p  for advice and guidance.  I met Joyce through a info-luncheon hosted for=
  EBS assistants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment =
and how  the process works and it's successes.  Because of a lack of  Commu=
nication, to the redeployment department, after a  week I did not have any =
information about me going into redeployment,  so at the end of the week, I=
 had no location for a redeployment desk and I  was leaving my department a=
t the end of the week of June 18-22.  =20
=20
    Due to this lack of  communication, I had to take off Monday & Tuesday =
June 25th, 26th, to have  my desk churned and locate a space for me for 45 =
days.  Joyce Barrett  contacted me with a location and more information reg=
arding my redeployment  process.  Located in 3 Allen Center, I set-up my se=
arch for  a "new" job at Enron, and my goal was to do my best to find a job=
  within Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and=
  Enron as a whole, by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions  a=
nd values.  I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume  and sh=
arpen my interview tactics.  Joyce  Barrett, Michele Hargrave and Brinella =
Knight were in contact with me to find  out how my job search was going and=
 lending support in any way.   I  had many interviews with companies outsid=
e and within Enron.  An  experience to meet new and interesting people and =
a opportunity that I feel  I would have not been able to have without redep=
loyment, so I  have no regrets about being redeployment.   I must tell you =
 that I was afraid, because a lot about this process, I was unsure of and m=
y  HR rep did nothing to assure me or inform me that this transition  is on=
e that can be rewarding, as well as a strong  challenge.
=20
    With Enron's values  system, Respect, Integrity, Communication and Exce=
llence in place and  strongly promoted by you  and Jeff Skilling (before hi=
s  departure), I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side =
of  redeployment, has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes =
 and I'm sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting  =
had every meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a  way that "a jo=
ke" is a kind way of putting it. No one should be  treated this way.   On J=
uly 31, 2001, I took a   temporary position in the Associate & Analyst Prog=
ram headed by Billy  Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis, John=
 Walt and Cathy Lira as  well as supporting the group as a whole.  I worked=
 in this department  until  August 21, 2001.  I received a message from Shi=
rley Cox,  Sheila Walton's assistant inquiring whether or not I had a  posi=
tion within Enron.  I called Shirley back and gave  her information about t=
he temporary assignment I had taken in the Associate  & Analysts Program. O=
n  August 14th, a call was made by Sheila  Walton to a Sr. Admin in the Ass=
ociate & Analyst Program,  inquiring whether I was working this department.=
  The admin passed the  information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila W=
alton as to where I was  working and how long I had been working in the dep=
artment.  With a  remorseful sounding voice, Sheila proceeded to inquiry to=
 Jeff more details, to  which Jeff provided her.  I had overtime hours that=
 I tried to put into the  system, but I was unable to get into the time sys=
tem.  After the  conversation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton, I  find  o=
ut Sheila  had started the process to delete me from the system,  before my=
 original end date of August  15th.   I accepted a permanent position with =
Enron Networks as a Admin  Assistant II on August 14, 2001 reporting to Sam=
 Leuschen.  I started  that position on August 22, 2001. On August 24, 2001=
, after 2 days  of employment was terminated from the position and Enron du=
e to  Business Reorganization in Enron Networks. =20
=20
    I am very concerned about the  way this matter was handled and the seri=
es of events that surrounded this  action.  As a result,  I would like to d=
iscuss with you and or  someone in the responsible capacity and go into fur=
ther detail.   I have received a form letter stating that Enron can termina=
te my employment at  will, at any time and for any reason.  I feel this act=
ion has been provoked  for other reasons.=20
=20
     In ending this message to  you, Mr. Lay, you must know that redeployme=
nt at Enron is  a effective tool that should remain in place.  You should a=
lso know and  commend those persons who work in and closely with the redepl=
oyment group.   Enough good things cannot not be said about those people wh=
o go  out of their way to get you the help, the encouragement, the tools yo=
u need  while facing this process.  I realize that a business  decision was=
 made, and EBS downfall was a business decision, but this matter is  not a =
business one.  When redeployment takes place, the human side of you  feel s=
omewhat lost, hurt and you take it personally,although I realize it  was a =
business decision.  This occurrence was targeted and directed at  me person=
ally by Sheila Walton. Human resources should work with the human  being to=
 make you a better person through visions and values, not to be treated  in=
humanely.  Whether they are Enron's values or values in  general, HR repres=
entatives should portray what human  beings should have most of all...VALUE=
S, and  when there is no communication, no respect, no integrity, "the  jok=
e" begins and excellence is lost..
=20
    I look forward to hearing from  you or someone in your office soon.   I=
 can be contacted at the  numbers listed below at any time.   Thank you in =
advance for the  opportunity to discuss this matter.
