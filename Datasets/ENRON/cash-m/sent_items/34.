Kathy Cook talked with Ben Herman about the problem employee who was abusing personal time, sick time, etc. 

They decided that since she has used more than her  allotted sick leave, any future time off will be charged as vacation or at no pay.

No need to call Kathy Cook back unless you have something additional to tell her.
