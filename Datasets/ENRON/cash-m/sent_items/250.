That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.

We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.

Novarco (one of the companies identified on John Ashman's affidavit as a hands off account) is being aquired by a company that is not on the list.  There is some language in the affidavit (3c1) which appears to extend the list to the companies identified and their "subsidiaries, affilitates, heirs, and assigns"; would a buyer be considered one of these?
