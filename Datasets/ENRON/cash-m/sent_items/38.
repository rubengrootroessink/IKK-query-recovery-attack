Diane/Lizzette -- 

I would say that the background check issue is a business call.  They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.

Same with the guarantee language.  If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.  That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.

Subject:	Question from Vendor re Recruiting Agreement

Lizzette:

We got a call this morning from DBI (a contingency recruiting agency) regarding the Agreement. I've pulled this Agreement so you can see the specific language she is questioning.  She wants to modify the Agreement re the following:

	1.	Vendor wants to change Guarantee language so that she would provide:

			90-day unconditional guarantee (refund placement fee), or														120-day replacement of employee


	2.	With regard to background checks, her Agency checks employment references but does do the extensive background checks we generally require 			(verification of SS#, verification of address, state and district court check for criminal records, etc.)

		DBI has the Candidate sign an acknowledgement that all the information provided to her Agency is correct and that the candidate understands that falsification 		of data makes them subject to termination by the Employer.

		Bottom line -- she doesn't want to spend the money or hassle with the extensive background checks .

		What would you recommend?


		We're so glad you're here......
