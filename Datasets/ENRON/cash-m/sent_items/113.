Michelle,

Dovie Keprta suggested I send this attachment to you for your approval.  I have revised an existing PRC Evaluation form.  I am going to use the attached form to evaluate the summer GTT interns.  Will you let me know if this is an appropriate tool for recording their performance and the supervisors hire/no hire opinion.

Thanks!
