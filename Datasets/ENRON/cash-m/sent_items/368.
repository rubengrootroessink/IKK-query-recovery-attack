Good morning.

David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.

We will need those segregated as follows:

Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.
Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations.
EEL employees
Employees remaining in the Enron estate.

Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.

Thanks!!

Michelle
