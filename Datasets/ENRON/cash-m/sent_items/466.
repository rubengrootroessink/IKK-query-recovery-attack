Mary Joyce/Michelle,
 
I hope all is well with you. Rob Walls has asked me to contact you relating to the payments that Enron needs to make based on the ECI and my own Employment agreement.
 
As I mentioned in my previous emails and messages these payments are late for a number of months now and it has become extremely URGENT from my standpoint that they are made immediately. I realise a lot is going on at Enron and that you must be very busy but this matter is really long overdue as well as fairly simple so please let me know what I need to do or who at Enron I need to contact in order to receive the payments.
 
Beginning Monday I can be contacted by email at diomedes@cumulouscapital.com  or by phone at my office in London (011-44-20-70728410). Today and tomorrow I can be contacted in Rioat the following numbers: 011-55-21-24957893/24913777.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
Diomedes.
