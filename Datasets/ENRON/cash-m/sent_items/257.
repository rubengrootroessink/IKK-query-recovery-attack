I think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because our annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.  Also, we usually use some other language.  I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter.

Michelle,
Please review attached Incentive Bonus Contract.   It shouldn't take long, as it is only one page. These payments will be made on July 15th, so we'll need to obtain employees' signatures on these contracts prior to payment.

Thanks,
