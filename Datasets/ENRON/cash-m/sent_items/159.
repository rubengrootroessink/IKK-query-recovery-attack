	Can you cover for me today? I am in mediation.  I left a voicemail for Sharon Butcher, as well, just to make sure it is handled. My schedule shows an afternoon session. Do we have 2 sessions today? If so, you may want to split and cover.

Thanks a ton. I will take you next one in August.

Thanks,

Kriste
