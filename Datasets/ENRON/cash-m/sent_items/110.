The consent form should be kept in PH file.   The background check results should be maintained separately.  MHC

Subject:	Background Checks

Unfortunately I was unable to attend the session today regarding background checks.  Can you please tell me what we are supposed to do with the original signed consent forms?  I thought we were supposed to shred them, but I was told that we are supposed to file them with the original background check report in the PH file.  I know from several of the staffers that today you clarified that we are not supposed to keep the background check reports in the PH file, but in a separate file.  I would appreciate your clarification of where the consent forms are to be kept.

Thank you,
