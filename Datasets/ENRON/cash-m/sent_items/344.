I think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $4500 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 12/31.  Please refer her to the Q&As on the web site for details.  Michelle

Tim/Michelle:  To follow-up on our meeting yesterday...I received a call from one of my clients, Takiyah Gordon, regarding her maternity leave status.  She had her baby on November 14th and will be under a doctor's care until January.  She informed me that she also received the news that she will not qualify for unemployment while under a doctor's care.  Please advise.  Thanks.
