Michelle/Diane -

Do you want the same info from EEL?  We have record of approx.140 employment agreements in our database from EEL - some are expats, most are locals.  Please advise ASAP as we will need to get the London HR team working on theirs.

Sheila:  I understand Tammy is on vacation.  We need  someone to review the database that Tammy Joyner maintains and determine if the Business Unit named in the Employment Agreement is actually the Business Unit the employee is currently working for. If the employee is now working for a different Business Unit, then we will need to make sure the Agreement gets assigned to the appropriate Business Unit. 

So, we need a list of the employees whose Agreements to be assigned.

Please let me know who can get started on this project. 

By copy of this e-mail, we are asking Fran Mayes, Jeanie Slone, Shanna Funkhouser and Kim Melodick to let us know of any Agreements that need to be assigned.  We need to do this clean-up as soon as possible.
