Unfortunately, I do not think we'll have time for this today, given other critical priorities.  I would suggest that the deadline may be slipping in light of other activities.

Hello Michelle and Lizzette,
I wanted to touch base with both of you before the approval deadline (tomorrow, November 15th) for the EEO and Harassment Prevention policies.  If you have additional revisions/suggestions that you would like to submit, please let me know.  

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Wendy Fincher
