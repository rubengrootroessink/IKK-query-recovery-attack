I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.  
 
As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.
 
Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary.
 
Thanks.
 
Michelle

I took a shot at combining the two spreadsheets.  Michelle, please provide correct ethic codes (I just guessed).  Tana, I'll need some help formatting the "Yrs. of Svc." and "Age" columns to calculate after we input date of hire and date of birth.  Comments?
 
Thanks,
