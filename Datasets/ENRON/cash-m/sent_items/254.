Why does this person need Expertfinder?  I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails.  If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him?  More information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access.  Thanks.  Michelle

Yes, this mail never works right from home.  
 
Michelle Cash needs to sign off on anyone asking for access that doesn't meet the requirements.  Since Mike is a temporary employee, he doesn't meet the criteria.  Via this email, I'll ask Michelle to approve or decline.
 
Thanks,
Kathy

Kathy -- we have a summer intern who needs to connect wtih specific groups.  In order to do this, he needs access to org charts.  Therefore, would you please set him up with a # to access ExpertFinder?  Thanks.

Name:   Mike Finger 
Ext:    5-4760 

He is listed in email list.  

Bruce Stram is the VP in this group and he approves this for Mike. 

Please let me know when this happens. 

Thanks!!!
