I'd like a copy of that, if possible.

I think it should state:  Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclosed to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department.  If possible, put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook.

As soon as we receive notice to move ahead, generalists will receive a training binder outlining the process of the WARN notifications.  I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page?  Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents.

Thanks - Tana
