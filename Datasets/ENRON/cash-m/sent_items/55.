Kevin / Michelle:

As I get ready for this mediation, I thought that these various presentations to ECT senior management (McConnell, Pres. of HPL, Rice and Hannon) would be helpful.  Special attention to the Hannon presentation which clearly shows that the real benefits of this new company were NOT primarily related to the monetization of the equipment (which Bill Rome contends), but instead were related to new business earnings and substantial cost savings.  This also has proved itself out as we go forward.

for a little laugh, but walks through the original deal strategic concept (which has nothing to do with a financing)
 << File: Story.ppt >> 
what you used to sell the deal to mcconnell

 << File: McConnell.ppt >>  
and the versions given to rice and hannon respectively
 << File: Rice.ppt >>  << File: hannon.ppt >> 
and the presentation given to hms employees re: new business opportunity
 << File: HMS Final Presentation.ppt >> 

have saved other analysis, etc if you need it...
