nce=20


(a) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a =
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or com=
pleted action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative =
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporatio=
n) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, emp=
loyee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of t=
he corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corpora=
tion, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expens=
es (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settle=
ment actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such=
 action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a mann=
er the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best inter=
ests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or procee=
ding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful.=
 The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, sett=
lement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, sh=
all not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in goo=
d faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or no=
t opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to an=
y criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the p=
erson's conduct was unlawful.=20

(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a =
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or com=
pleted action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a ju=
dgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a direc=
tor, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at=
 the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent o=
f another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterpris=
e against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incu=
rred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such act=
ion or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person re=
asonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corp=
oration and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any =
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to =
be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court o=
f Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall dete=
rmine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in v=
iew of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasona=
bly entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or =
such other court shall deem proper.=20

(c) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corpora=
tion has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any actio=
n, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this sectio=
n, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall b=
e indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and rea=
sonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.=20

(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unle=
ss ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized =
in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the prese=
nt or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumst=
ances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set for=
th in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be =
made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of =
such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not par=
ties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or=
 (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such d=
irectors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such direc=
tors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a wri=
tten opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.=20

(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director=
 in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, =
suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final d=
isposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertakin=
g by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it sh=
all ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemni=
fied by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (inclu=
ding attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other em=
ployees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, a=
s the corporation deems appropriate.=20

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted=
 pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exc=
lusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advanc=
ement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stock=
holders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such =
person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holdi=
ng such office.=20

(g) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on be=
half of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of =
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as =
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,=
 joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted ag=
ainst such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or aris=
ing out of such person's status as such, whether or not the corporation wou=
ld have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under thi=
s section.=20

(h) For purposes of this section, references to "the corporation" shall inc=
lude, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation=
 (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation o=
r merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had pow=
er and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or age=
nts, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agen=
t of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of s=
uch constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of an=
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, s=
hall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resu=
lting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to su=
ch constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.=20

(i) For purposes of this section, references to "other enterprises" shall i=
nclude employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any exci=
se taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; an=
d references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include a=
ny service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation whi=
ch imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, empl=
oyee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or=
 beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such p=
erson reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and ben=
eficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a m=
anner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to=
 in this section.=20

(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted=
 pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized=

n brought under this section or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockho=
lders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may s=
ummarily determine a corporation's obligation to advance expenses (includin=
g attorneys' fees).=20

questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service co=

r employment by the attorney, (c) the fee customarily charged in the commun=

 results obtained, (e) the time limitations imposed by the litigation, (f) =
the nature and length of professional relationship with the client, (g) the=
 experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer performing the services, =
and (h) a consideration whether the fee is fixed or contingent. Galdi v. Be=
