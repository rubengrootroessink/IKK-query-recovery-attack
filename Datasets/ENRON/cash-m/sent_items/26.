Irma, 
Thank you, for taking to time to meet with Cheryl and I.   We hope this simple plan will make it easier and faster to get the information we all need. 

I prepared the attached as minutes to our meeting, if you will.  It is intended to help us remember how we are to handle the American Express issues with your group going forward. 

Please let me know if you have any corrections or additions. 
Thanks again, 
Johnny and Cheryl
