Frank,

I enjoyed meeting you when I was in Bothell last week.  

During our meeting, you indicated that you were going to put together a draft of the response to the OSHA charge and circulate a draft on Wednesday.  I haven't seen a draft, and I understand that the response deadline is today.  Perhaps you were able to obtain an extension, but I hadn't heard of that if you were.

Would you please let me know the status?

Thanks a lot!

Michelle
