We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Let me know if you have questions.

Which deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?

Thanks.

Michelle

We need a list of all benefit plans of any "to be" Newco employee.  We also rep that we have made these available to the purchaser.  I believe you said that the actual documents were available somewhere, so I assume that the other side could see them?
