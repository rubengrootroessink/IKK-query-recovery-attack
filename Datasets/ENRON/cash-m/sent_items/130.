Michelle, 

Margaret advises that you need info on Joe Kishkill.  Here's all that is on the EI drive.  If you are looking for an executive employment agreement, we don't have access to those.

 << File: BrazilTerm.doc >>  << File: BrazilTermRev9.99.xls.doc >>  << File: ext.doc >> 

If you need anything additional, Robin Treadwell may be able to assist.

Thanks, 

Michael B. Jones
