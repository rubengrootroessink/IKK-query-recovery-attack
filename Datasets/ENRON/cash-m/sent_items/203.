Tim, 
I am sorry I missed catching up with you this afternoon.  My afternoon was  
cut short by a kidney stone problem I am experiencing. 
Nevertheless, I reviewed retention 2001 options6.doc and made significant  
revisions to it.  Please see the attached. 
You sent two forms of letters and I only reviewed the one document as the  
other seemed to be very similar after a cursory review.  If the attached is  
acceptable to everyone, the second document can be conformed to it.   
I've copied Pam Butler and Michelle Cash on this memo. 
Regards, 
Pat
