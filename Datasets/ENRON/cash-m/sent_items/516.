Based on my review of the files, we do not have signed agreements for the following:

Tom Alonso*
Mark Fischer*
Ben Jacoby
Laura Luce
Mike McDonald
Narsimha Misra
Dave Parquet
Gregg Penman
Frank Vickers
Andy Zipper

Would you mind asking the vault if they have these?  If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them?

Thanks.  (By the way, no one should know why).

Thanks a lot!!
