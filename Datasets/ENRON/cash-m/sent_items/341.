Please pull the following info and put into Excel:

BU = EA
Peer Group = Commercial
EE Status = Active or LOA

List all EEs, sorted by:
	1)  Job Title (high level to low level)
	2)  EE's Name (alpha order)

Be sure to include the following info, if the EE is on an ACTIVE, EXECUTABLE EE Agrmt:
	EE Agrmt Begin Date
	EE Agrmt End Date
