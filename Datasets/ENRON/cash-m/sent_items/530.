Valeria,
 
I agree that we need her to execute that note by a date certain.  This has gone on too long.

This is really great news!  I think that we need to let her know that Dale is interested in having her transfer to his group but we still have the outstanding issue of the promissory note.  We need to let her know that she needs to take care of that matter or she will not be able to retain her employment with Enron.  Since she has had it for quite some time we need to give her a short window to comply.  What do you think?
 
Valeria

Valeria/Michelle -  Chevondra was offered a 30-day trail period working for Dale Neuner and if she was successful in her efforts, then she would have an option to officially transfer to Dale's department.  The trial period was complete as of November 15th and Dale has contacted EGM HR requesting the transfer of Chevondra into his group.

However, there was a contingency in Chevondra's transfer.  She was to sign a promissory note (for outstanding personal calls on a company cell phone), as well as return the company cell phone.  Shanna and I are unaware of  the cell phone or the signed promissory note being returned at this time. 

Could you please provide the recommended next steps?  

Regards, 
Kim Hickok
