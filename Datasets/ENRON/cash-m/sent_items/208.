Subject:	Serious Health Condition based on Certification from a Nutritioni st

Client received an FMLA leave request based on a Certified Nutritionist's
completion of the serious health condition form.  This does not appear to be
a person authorized by the regs to certify a person as having a serious
health condition.  Any thoughts on how to respond to this leave request.
Billable credit for the most helpful response(s).
