Bummer about the flood insurance.  Of course, we had it and didn't need it.  We also pulled up our rugs, moved furniture, etc.  Had we not, the house surely would have flooded.  

Talk to you next week.

Thanks for the message.  We had about 2 inches of water in the house and we
lost most of our flooring on the first floor. Most everything else is ok.
No flood insurance because we are not in the 100 year flood plain as you
know.

Regarding Midwest Generation.  I asked around with our Chicago lawyers and
did not find out anything.  I have made some other contacts and will let you
and Jeff Hodge (whom I have met) know if I hear about anything.

Kerry,

We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.  I hope
all is ok, and that you didn't have too  much damage.  Bellaire was hit
pretty hard.

On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest
Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?
Twanda can connect you.

I'll be on vacation this week and will return the 18th.

Thanks.

Michelle

Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate
information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following
article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:


Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations
Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth
Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union
representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move
comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the
current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation
was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through
June 2002, company officials said.





Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a
confidential settlement?


Thanks for the advice.





Phil
