What do you mean by backdating?  I think our policy has been to make those current or close to current at the time of signing.

Hello, there. Hope you both are doing well.

Do we have any rules about backdating the US Exec agreements? We have someone who has been negotiating a contract for about 6 months now and he wants the contract backdated. I do not want to backdate it but need some support to say that we don't do this (if we don't, of course).

Thanks!
Tara
