Cole, here are the revisions to the benefit plan q&a doc.  I think these are ready to go if these comments are incorporated -- but check with Barrow on them.  On your question about being able to put some of them on the web, let's go through which ones can go and which ones need to be further reviewed.  Thanks.  Michelle
