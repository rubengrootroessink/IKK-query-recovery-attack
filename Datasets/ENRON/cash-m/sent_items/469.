Michelle,

Thanks for your response. I tried to call you but got to your voice mail
so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.

Please confirm that when you mention the "processing of the ECI
payments" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process
of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I
hope is complete by now.

Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the
Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is
the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the
payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate
(they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the
Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment
Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the
calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire
amount.

I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these
payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have
been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable
value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related
payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which
may be done at a considerable cost to me.

Please let me know if you have all the necessary information for the
wire transfers available to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Diomedes

Good day, Diomedes,

First, let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your
earlier email.

I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments
has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron
over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the
processing.  However, if you have questions about timing, please feel
free to call me at  713-853-6401 or Pam Butler at 713-853-6161.

Feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter
further.

Michelle
