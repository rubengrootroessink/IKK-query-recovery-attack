Jo Ann, I think it is a great idea to invite Todd, Brad and Melissa.  I know that Michelle would agree.  Please extend the invitation and I have asked Michelle to include everybody on the distribution list.  Thanks for the reminder.

Michelle -- I would like to attend this seminar.  Please let me know if I need to do anything further in response.  
Also, would Todd, Brad and Melissa (as Corporate HR reps) be able to attend?  Would it be OK to send to them?
Thanks.
