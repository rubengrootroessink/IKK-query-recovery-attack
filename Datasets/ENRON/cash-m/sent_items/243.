Diane, would you please track this down and let Cathy know that we'll respond asap when I return.  Or, you could have Kriste respond.  I do not remember seeing a letter from counsel, but it is possible that it fell through the cracks.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle,

Tom's been calling me for the Company's response to his attorney's letter.  Please advise and I can formally close the issue with him, i.e making his final day June 30th.

Thanks

Michelle,

I'm faxing you a letter I received this morning from attorney's representing Thomas Gramlich.

To refresh your memory, Tom was the chap that resigned in May but had a 6 months notice period in his MG employment letter.  He was the head sales person in our Lead Trading Group and given that he is going to work for a competitor, we wanted to use all of his notice period to keep him out of the market for as long as possible until we could find a suitable replacement.  September 26 would be the end of his notice period and his attorneys are proposing a June 30th release date.

As notice periods are not enforceable in the US, our hands may be tied, but I wanted to keep you advised.  Please let me know if you think there is anything we can do.


Thanks
