We need to talk about that meeting with me, Mike, and John.  I do not think it went well at all, but I would like to discuss it with you.  Michelle

Michelle, Here's the training the NEPCO HR group has on their schedule.  I
think the outcome of your meeting with Indivero and Schwartzenburg is that
Mike would forward through me all requests involving the retention of
outside counsel including the expected training needs from outside counsel.
Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Thanks.
