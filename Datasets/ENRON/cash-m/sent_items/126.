Sharon, I suggest that we ask Valeria Hope to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly.  What do you think?  Michelle

Michelle -

Since this is in Venezuela and thus part of wholesale, I am sending you a copy of this letter for you to review.  I'm not sure who should take the lead between you and Sharon but I'll leave that to you guys to work out.  Please let me know who is taking the lead on this.  Thanks.

I'm not sure I understand what has happened to this guy, but it's something that should be handled post haste.  Thanks, SRS
