I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.

They want the following asap:

Signed copies of contracts for Greg Whalley and Vince Kaminsky (who may not have a contract)
Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily
Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as Jay Webb (I think I can get this one as well).

They also want the following data for the 838:

	Name
	Position/title
	2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc)
	Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number)
	If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract
	Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount.
	Date of hire
	If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.

They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.

Thanks a lot!

Michelle
