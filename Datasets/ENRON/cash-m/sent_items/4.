Karen:  I like the questions and understand the need for them. We will have to be sure to loop Michelle Cash in on this for her input.

Molly/Meg,

Spoke with Tindall & Foster this morning with regard visa questions we can ask on our app form.   They have given us an additonal question as below (2) which would be helpful in terms of planning/budgeting etc for new hires.

Can we add to electronic form and see if we can add to hardcopy (subject to volumes already printed).


1)	Are you legally authorized to work in the United States? 
2)	Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status (e.g., H-1B visa status)? 

Margaret - can we look to arrange for the lawyers to come in again and present to HR and give us updates on immigration policy.


Thanks, karen.
