Rick, I believe that this probably is a duplication of efforts -- almost everyone has emailed me with that information already, pursuant to my prior request.  I'll forward those to you for your information.  I would like to institute some limitations on training for the group, due to costs and out-of-office considerations, but I have not finalized those recommendations yet.  Stay tuned!  MHC
