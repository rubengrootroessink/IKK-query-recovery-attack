Michelle:  Steve's name isn't on my list of those resumes we discussed last week.   Are you and/or Alan interested in talking with him?

Molly,

You mentioned you would be out of town some this week -- any possibility
that we could get a reaction to Steve Cochell's resume (attorney at FedEx)
before you leave?  Steve will be in town this Friday (7/13) and Monday
(7/16) if Michelle/Alan have any interest in speaking with him.

Thank you.

Elaine
