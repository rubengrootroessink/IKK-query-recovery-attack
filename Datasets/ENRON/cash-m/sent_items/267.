Micelle,
Can you please let me know what the status of the contract template for Japan is?  I understand you are working on this with Baker & McKenzie for Jane McBride.  I would be intersted in seeing the advice from B&M on this matter, because it would be helpful for me as the HR person in Tokyo.   As well, once the contract template is complete, if you could send it to me and Melissa Laing for our reference, that would be great.
Thank you for your help.
Caroline
