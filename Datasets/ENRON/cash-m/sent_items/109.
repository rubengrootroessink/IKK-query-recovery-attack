Attached is a handout on the HIPAA privacy regulations that our firm
prepared for the employee benefits session of the 2001 National Employer
conference.  The emphasis is on the regulations as they affect employers who
administer group health plans for their employees.  In many cases plan
amendments will be required.   In addition the regulations mandate training
of personnel and the development of internal complaint procedures.

If you have difficulty accessing this document, please contact me and I can
send you a hard copy. In addition, feel free to forward this summary to
others within your organization or others at different companies or
organizations. If you do not wish to receive these notices, contact me by a
reply to this email and I will delete you from my circulation list.

Littler Mendelson is the nation's largest law firm representing management
in employment and labor matters. With approximately 400 lawyers in 31
offices in the country, we have more lawyers practicing in this field than
anyone else. Please let me know if you have questions about these
regulations or any other employment or labor issue.
