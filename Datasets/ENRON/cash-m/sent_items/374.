I'd transfer to ENA effective 1/1.  If the people have employment agreements, we will need to assign.  Michelle

Amy

Can you find out from Louise/John whether they want to transfer in the ENW/Corp employees not on this list to ENA and consolidate all newco employee under the ENA umbrella prior to the deal going through ? Would suggest we leave them where they are. 

Michelle - does this make sense from an acquisition standpoint or should we transfer everyone to ENA ?

Amy can you pull in Anne, Sarah and Tana and check for all of newco/ENA employees as per the most current list. I'm completing the data room this am and info ready for a counterparty

There will be some ENA folks who are not on the newco list 

Thanks

Neil
