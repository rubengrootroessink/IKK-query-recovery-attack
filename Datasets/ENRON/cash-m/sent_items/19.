Michelle:

FYI, here is a survey done by one of our lawyers in California about the
military pay issue.  I replied to his original email and you may be the
"energy company" mentioned below.  You were referenced anonymously.

Christina:   Here's a synopsis of the replies I received from within the
firm so far:

  *  One Fortune 500 client told a Littler attorney that he had participated
in a 100-company conference call about the issue earlier this week. The
sense he got from the call was that almost every company was planning to pay
employees the difference between their normal wages and military base pay,
exclusive of allowances, for a certain period which varied among the
companies. Many were going to pay for 90 days; some, for 180 days, and a few
for a year. One of the companies that was opting for 180 days had previously
provided a pay differential for 4 weeks.

  *  Another attorney was advised by a major energy industry client that it
was paying the difference between the military pay and the employee's salary
for one year.

  *  One attorney has spoken to several firm clients over the past few days
about this, and almost all of them are going to exceed the legal
requirements by offering some form of continued compensation, but no
specifics as to duration.

  *  Another Littler lawyer was told by a large industrial client that it
would pay the difference between military pay and normal salary, and
continue benefit coverage, with no indication about maximum duration.

Hi Christina-- I'll check it out. I've seen a few references to what
employers may be doing lately, and I'll see if there's anything there that
you may find useful.

Do you know what most of your clients are offering in terms of compensation
to reservists called up for duty?  We are trying to do a little informal
benchmarking in advance of drafting our final policy.  Thanks.
