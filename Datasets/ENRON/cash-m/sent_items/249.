Yes, I should be involved.  Have you sent Noel prior information?

That is fine, just be sure to copy Noel Ryan on the email materials.  I

 I have seen some emails about this recently. I will see what I can find
out.  It probably will be next week before I can get back to you.

Kerry,

Has your firm done any legwork on sabbaticals?  We are thinking about
doing
a pilot program in EWS for people who have worked here for more than 5-7
years (to be decided).  Any information, policies, research, pitfalls,
or
other experience you or others at the firm may have would be
appreciated.

If you send stuff by email, please reply to all so that Noel Ryan can
see
what you send (since I'll be out of the office on vacation all next
week).

Thanks a lot!!

Michelle
