Pat, what do you think of this?  I view it as problemmatic because I believe the grant agreements and the stock plan should govern.  Your comments and suggested revisions would be appreciated.  Thanks.  Michelle

Dear All,

please find attached hereto the draft of the stock option agreement
according to our call held last Thursday and the subsequent electronic
messages. Modification includes (i) item 1 - ref. to the Committee and
Black-Scholes valuation; (ii) item 4 - ref. to the former vesting scheduled;
(iii) item 6 - expanded non-compete clause; (iv) item 7 - expanded
confidentiality clause; and (v) new item 8 - non-soliciting
(customers/employees) clause (please confirm/decide the terms for those
obligations). Having everything decided, please let me know so as to change
the Portuguese version.

Should you need any clarification, please write or call.

Kind Regards,

Eduardo Ribeiro Toledo
