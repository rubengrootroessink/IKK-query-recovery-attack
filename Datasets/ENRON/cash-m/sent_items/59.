Under the Enron Corp. severance plan, can we provide employees with the opportunity to take voluntary termination in lieu of future involuntary term?  One of our offices wants to offer employees that opportunity, with some sort of enhanced benefit if they take it.  

Your quick thoughts on this would be appreciated.
