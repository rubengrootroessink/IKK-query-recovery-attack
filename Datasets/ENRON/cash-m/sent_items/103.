No, this is not.  I am curious as to how this got to you.  I will give it a review and get back with you.

Alan

Attached is the Employment Agreement for Matthias Lee, for your approval. Do let us know when you have presented to Matt so that we could give him the original to sign and thereafter, send to Houston for your signature.
 << File: Executive Agreement_SIN_Matthias Lee.doc >> 

Need your advice on the effective date of the agreement. Tentatively, i have used 15 May, given that this is the date for changes in title, salary, etc. 

regards,
