Gary/Scott--

I believe that this was not meant for public distribution, but it is a sentiment that I thought you should hear.

Michelle,
We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers, Site Safety
Supervisors/Nurse Practitioners, Mike Indivero, Tony Bolar Softich(Safety),
Steve Olenik(Safety), Sean Mayer(Construction), Frank Petty(Director of
Construction), Mike Ranz(VP Construction), Bob Black(Manager Of Projects),
maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or
Frank Petty in attendance. I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting
because you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may even
want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to
emphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear "Enron has plenty
of money" and "Thats why we have lawyers" -the truth being we are the
guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility
to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the
stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we
do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and
Construction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks
regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of
the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions
effecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to
act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a
penalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of
the companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would
take with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like
it only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in our
decision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will
replace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as
something the EPC Industry talks about. I may be overreacting here but I've
been in the middle of Nepco's harassment, discrimination other issues for
the last 18 months. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks for asking.
