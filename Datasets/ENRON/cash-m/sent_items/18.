Michelle,

This is a heads up to an issue developing this morning at a project site in
Payne Creek, Florida.  As far as we know, the union is directing the
picketing against the general contractor, OCI (a subsidiary of B&V), and not
NEPCO who is the subcontractor to OCI.  Rick Johnson may want to
investigate.

By copy to Gail, Seth Price will evaluate whether additional claims are
developed against OCI for any delay impacts caused by OCI to NEPCO or vice
versa depending on who the union pipe fitters are picketing.

I have also requested Lark to contact Seath for review of OCI requirement to
provide access to site.
Any other comments ?

Thanks

The pipefitters union is picketing OCI at the Payne Creek jobsite this
morning. There are 4 pickets at the gate on Ft. Green Road. The gate system
at the entrance has no designation as to union and non-union so they can
picket any gate. The picket signs reference low wages according to Greg
Renz. OCI has an agreement with Forida Maint. union ironworkers to perform
work. Pipefitters think they should be doing the work. I am going to Payne
Creek to meet with our supervisors on how to conduct themselves when they
enter and exit the jobsite. At this point no activity is being directed at
Nepco. We want to keep it that way.
Call me on my cell phone if you need me.
Mike
