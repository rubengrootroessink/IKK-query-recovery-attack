I've received advice from Vinson & Elkins on this, which I will send your way.  It looks like we can.  MHC

I was going to ask Michelle Cash to take a look at it to see if we could dissolve it.  Pam Butler does not want Garland to know we had a carried interest plan.  

Michelle, since you initially were involved, can we quietly dissolve this plan since EIP is no more??  Please advise. Thanks.

Sheila - with the merging of EIP into Enron Principal Investments we need to discuss what happens with the incentive plan we developed for them last year.
