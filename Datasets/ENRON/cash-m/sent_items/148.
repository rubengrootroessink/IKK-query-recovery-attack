No, I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical!  I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman.

This meeting was to discuss the evolution or history of Crude and Products from EEL to EGM, who the players were, etc.  

This history really applies to Michael L. Brown, Botchlett and Straube.

Let me know if you decide that the meeting is not critical at this time; otherwise we will leave it scheduled as is.

Thanks,
Shanna
