Linda,

I can't make 10 tomorrow, so go ahead and meet without me.

Lunch this week would be difficult, as I'm out Thursday and Friday attending the SW Legal Foundation Labor seminar in Dallas.  Would you like to try something next week with me and Lizzette Palmer, my new attorney?  If so, have your assistant get with Twanda at 853-9402 to schedule, as Twanda works for both me and Lizzette.

Thanks.

Michelle

Dear  Michelle:
     We have set a meeting with Cristina Solomon and Liz Miller that I am assured is  set in stone.  It will take place tomorrow at 10am at Cristina's  office.  Can you attend?  I have given Cristina the agenda items so  that she and Liz can be prepared to answer all of our questions.   
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks
 
P.S.  Can you  have lunch this week with Laura Gibson and me?
