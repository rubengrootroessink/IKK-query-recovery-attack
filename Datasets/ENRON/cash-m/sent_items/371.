Don't give SSNs.  I'd suggest giving names only.

Are you aware of this?  Is this okay to provide?  Should I just give names or SSN?  Thanks.

Kathy,

Chris has a subpoena for 401(k) information and is needing a list of all 401(k) deductions by employee and by deduction date since January, 1996.  It is my understanding that this info is needed by Monday.

Thanks,
Diane
