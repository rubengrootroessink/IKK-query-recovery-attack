Go ahead and let them stay until vesting.  Please reverse their terminations and see if there is any work they can do until the termination day.  If they got the $4500, offset that amount from pay.  Michelle

Got to send the term packages out today for these folks so we need an answer.

My suggestion, extend sandra mcnichols to 55, don't do any of the 5 years.  

These guys need their packages to file for unemployement and I just can't hold them past today.

Kathy,

Would you mind re-running the list of people who are close to age 55 with 5 or are close to 5 years for vesting in cash balance plan?

We would like a 30-day cushion.

Would you please provide this data to me and Kalen?

Thanks.

Michelle
