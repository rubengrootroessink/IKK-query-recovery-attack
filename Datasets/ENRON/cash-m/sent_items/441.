Sure, we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people.  They would have issues around payroll and benefits, but those can be handled.  Michelle

Michelle,

Have you had situations in the past where we've needed to set up a company/LLC to house employees separate from EGM/Enron Americas, etc.?

I'm working with limited information, but the Freight group has a potential deal where they will buy a trucking company and need a place to house the workers outside of EGM.  Another idea we are considering is using an outsourcing company, similar to Administaff, but this is expensive and it will be difficult to find somone to take on the liabilities associated with this type of workforce.

Thanks,
Shanna
