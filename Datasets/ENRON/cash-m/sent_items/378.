I think we should have Charles Foster in on this call.  I will call to see his availability today and advise.

As we get closer to this transaction that we are working on I need to be sure what is the best approach for Lavo and Louise. Tim, who at Tindell and Foster is working their cases and Michelle and you and I call them today?
