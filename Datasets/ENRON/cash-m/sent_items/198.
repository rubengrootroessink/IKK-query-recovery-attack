Michelle:

I wanted to follow up with some additional information regarding the child
porn issue.

The consensus seems to be that the company does not need to report the child
porn if it does not want to.  The only exception to this is individuals
engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service
to the public are obligated under 42 U.S.C. 13032 to report child porn to
the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children.  I looked at the definitions of "electronic communication service"
and "remote computing service" and the second does not seem to apply
although the former could apply.  The statute appears to qualify both as
providing those services "to the public" so I would not think an email
system for employees would apply.  The definition of electronic
communication service is pretty broad though.  If you want me to investigate
this further let, me know, but I would think we have a good argument that we
do not provide these services to the public.

The child porn statute, 18 U.S.C. 2252A, covers pornography involving girls
under the age of 18, so much porn could be child porn.  There are enhanced
penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving
children under the age of 12.  There is an affirmative defense under the
statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law
enforcement agency.  Therefore, it seems the best course of action is to
destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting
obligation.  Ashley anonymously called the FBI and the DA and their
responses are indicated below.  The information obtained from the FBI and
DA's office is consistent with my recommendations.
