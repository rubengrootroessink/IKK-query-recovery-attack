I don't think that is a good idea.

We were intending to put these results (which would actually be preliminary and based on the prerating results for VP's) into the VP data books.

Who will get them?  I am happy to sit down with him in a privileged conversation and discuss those statistics, which I think is the best way to protect the privilege.  Otherwise, if it goes to him at his request, then there is no protection if we find undesirable results.

Hi Michelle;
 
Dovie told me that she has had a chat with you regarding the diversity stats we were preparing for the VP PRC on 23 July.  Delainey had asked specifically for these stats, and that's why wewere including them.  Is there any way that we can provide the data, perhaps marking it attny privilidge?  If not, can we discuss this with Delainey so that he is aware of the reasons PEP PRC cannot provide it?  I'd apprecuate your thoughts.  Thanks, Gina
