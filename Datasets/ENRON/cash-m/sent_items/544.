Here is a proposed communication regarding severance plan changes.  This proposal makes me most nervous.  My recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan, thus letting the plan speak for itself.  We then could arm HR with a list of FAQs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole.  What do you think?

Also, Kriste, we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication, as not all Enron entities have this plan (e.g., NEPCO).  Same thing with vacation.

Here's a revised version of the severence/policy memo.  Michele, should we discuss how to address the severence plan in an email?  I included an alternative here to direct people to a website with the plan.
