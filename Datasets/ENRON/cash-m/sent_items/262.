Michelle,

In our effort to develop a better program for Enron and transform HR in to commercial viable operation, we would like to enter in the relationship with Accenture that will help us to achieve such goals.  Attached below is a document that summarizes our intent.  Please review it and lets get together to discuss the language.  Some of the key points were we the originating arm are struggling is Warranty section.  I assume that between you and Accenture's counterpart you will be able to work out the version that is acceptable to Enron and the provider.

Accenture will provide the name of the attorney involved in this initiative.

Sincerely,


Yevgeny
