Michelle:

Here are the referrals that I received.  Some of the referrals came from
more than one source within our firm.

Kerry--

I suggest that you speak to Barry Cosloy at PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global
HR Practice.  Barry heads up the PwC Employment Compliance Risk Management
Solutions.  I am attaching his contact information and suggest that you
contact him directly.  I am also attaching two presentations that describe
the exact type of practice group you need.

Kerry,

I have been networking with William M. Mercer Company, a subsidiary of Marsh
McLennan Companies.  They are one of the largest, if not the largest, human
resources consulting firms in the world.  They have 15,000 employees and
offices all over the country.  They are clearly the top in their field.
Here is a contact person in Houston: Philip Tenenbaum in Mercer's Houston
office.  Philip can be reached at 713-653-5253. Here also is some
information about Phillip and Mercer.

Kerry:

I have a strong relationship with Hewitt.  I forwarded an edited version of
your e-mail to my primary contact at Hewitt and inquired as to who he
recommends in Houston.  Below is Dick's response.  Hopefully, this will be
useful to you.

Christy


Christy, we'd certainly appreciate it if you suggested Hewitt. We have a
rather
large center in the Woodlands, which is just outside Houston. Also, we have
a
number of consultants who work on the issues mentioned.

You could suggest Don Henderson as an initial contact. Don is a benefits
lawyer
in the Houston (i.e.., Woodlands) office who could help them locate the best
Hewitt resource for the client. Don's number is 281-363-0456  I'm copying
Don in
case he has a suggestion of someone else who the client might contact.

It was good seeing you at the reception. Thanks for thinking of us!

We also had reference to Jeanneret & associates, but I know you know them.
Here is another person in that line of business if you want to go that
route:

If you need an economist, try these folks.

Based on our conversations to date, I would think the PriceWaterhouse and
Mercer contacts would be your best bets.
