Sure, sounds like a good plan to put the flag in Personic to discuss the time limitations.  Other than the specific gas-related folks, I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees.  I'll double check to confirm, though.  MHC

Have told recruiters
 
Will get all their resumes into personic ( if not already in their ) and put a precautionary note against their record.  Michelle is this ok ? 
 
Have you or Michelle been able to find out if we can hire from AEP ( non ex HPL employees ?)
 
Thanks
 
Neil

        Attached is the final list of employees who transferred to AEP.  If any of these employees are considered for re-hire, please ensure 

        that the following procedure is followed: 

        1.      Any former HPL rehired into Enron must come in via a resume submitted to an open posted position.  (i.e. No slam dunks)

        2.      The candidate should be interviewed with other qualified candidates. (i.e. No single candidate on the job applicant summary).

        3.      If the candidate is offered a position, it cannot be at a higher level and/or higher salary (i.e Inducement).  FYI, all HPL

                employees received an increase when they started at AEP.   The exception to this is if they are being rehired into a 

                higher level position. 

        4.      All re-hires must sign a letter stating they were not solicited by Enron to return. 


        Please share this information with all recruiters, staffers and generalists.
