These changes look fine to me for employees working in Japan.  Thanks.  Michelle

Kriste/Michelle,
We are in the process of integrating 7 Enron Metals Far East Ltd employees from their former payroll to the Enron Japan payroll.  As part of this process, we are requiring them to sign the attached standard Confidentiality Agreement.  I'm getting a lot of pushback re: non-solicitation, and the fact that it governs all terminations (including involuntary).  Is there any possibility of amending?  Jane McBride and I have reviewed, and while we haven't yet sought advice on the matter, feel it would likely not be enforceable in Japan in case of involuntary termination without cause.  
Are we able to make the proposed change (redlined in purple in the attachment - I guess a lot of changes have been made to this document before either Jane or I were involved)?  As well, would it be an issue to insert something about jurisdiction?
If you could let me know as soon as possible, it would be most helpful.
Thanks,
Caroline
