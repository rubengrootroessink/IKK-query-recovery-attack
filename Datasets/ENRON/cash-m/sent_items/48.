Michelle,

Joe has caved in on the home leave issue.  We only need to add the following to Exhibit A at the end of the Repatriation and Related items section:

"The items described above must be used within the six-month non-competition period; after that time, they will be forfeited.  If household goods are to be shipped to Argentina, Employee will have until May 15, 2002 to provide for duty free importation of goods into Argentina.  Additional time will be allowed where Enron must provide documents for duty free import of goods into Argentina."

Change Furniture Storage from reimbursed to Provided.

Once we resolve 7.9 and 7.10 below, he'll sign.

Tim

Michelle,

Discussed the latest draft separation agreement with Joe today.  He has just a couple more questions.

1.	Article 7.9 was adjusted to add the first sentence, which references articles of the employment agreement.  He wants to know the intent of this addition.  Also, article 4.4 is referenced and there is no 4.4 in the employment agreement.

2.	Article 7.10 - He is still concerned about the situation where Enron is acquired by a company where he was employed.  I explained to him that such a situation would not fall under "rehire" by Enron.  However, he would like the last sentence to read, "This provision would not apply if Employee is employed by an entity that may be acquired by or acquires a Company after the effective date of this agreement."

These are all the items for you.  I'm still haggling with him over home leave and timing on shipment of goods.  Let me know your thoughts on the above and I think I can get him to agree to some terms that we can finalize.
