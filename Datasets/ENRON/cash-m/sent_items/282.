I can't attend, as I'll be out of the office in Austin at a mediation.  Michelle

Kerry/Michelle/Kriste:

	Please plan on attending a meeting to address the above-referenced matter on Wednesday, July 18 at 8:30 in EB 1136.  Feel free to call me beforehand if you'd like to preview the issues and the "mind-set" that we are currently operating under.  However, please be prepared to address the legal landscape of our variable pay practice under the FLSA and any and all of the methods of compliance.  Thanks,

Brian
