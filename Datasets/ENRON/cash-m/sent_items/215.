Today, I received a demand from Art Bieser's attorney.  He basically wants a year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).  I have given Fran a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand.  Let me know if you want to know the details. 

I suggest that Fran and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.

In any event, Art will not be returning to the office at all.
