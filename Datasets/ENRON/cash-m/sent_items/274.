Thanks, Pat.  It is only temporary (at least, that's what I keep insisting!).

I just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in Wyoming or Montana (I can't remember now).  Data room to be opened in Denver on Monday.  I'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along.  Would you be available?

Thanks.

Michelle
