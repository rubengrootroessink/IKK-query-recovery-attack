Tara,

Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.

Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.

So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.

Call me with any questions.

Michelle

Michelle,
David Portz has referred me to you regarding a friend's resume.  Jon Solem is a friend who just recently graduated from Rutgers Law, and is looking to get into corporate law.  I told him that I would try to get his resume into the system for him.  It is enclosed.  Please let me know what else I can do to help in the process.
Thanks so much for your time,
Tara
