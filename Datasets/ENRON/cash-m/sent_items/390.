in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decision here though. 

As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term. I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not. Let me know if you want me to check the latest version
