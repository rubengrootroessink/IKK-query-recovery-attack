FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.

One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).
