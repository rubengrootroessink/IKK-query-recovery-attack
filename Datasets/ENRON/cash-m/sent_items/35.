No risk to non-compete.  The payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete.  MHC

Subject:	Question from Amy Fitzpatrick

Holly Krebbs left Enron (Portland). She had a 3-month evergreen and was supposed to be paid her salary through that 90-day period.  Due to a computer glitch, Holly got terminated from payroll and did not receive a regular paycheck from August 8 through September 26.  As soon as Holly made Amy aware of the situation (Sept. 26), Irma got the computer records corrected and requested a check to pay monies due. The employee was sent a check via Federal Express.

Amy is concerned that we may have somehow "breached" the settlement agreement which would allow Holly to ignore her obligations re non-compete.  Is the non-compete still in effect as long as she got the money, even if it wasn't paid on time? 

We know Holly is going to AEP at the end of the 90-day evergreen and Amy has already had to remind her of her non-compete obligations because Holly was seen lunching with an AEP executive.

Is there a risk here re non-compete?

Thanks....
