Mike / Connie - Please send discrimination charge info to my Houston Office -  EB 1676:  I will not pursue fact finding until we establish privilege with legal counsel.  Michelle Cash is out of the office on vacation.  I will contact Kriste Sullivan in her absence.
I will be in Houston through Thursday 6/14 and back for the  following week. Please ask Lakeland office to send duplicates of charge notice, info, exhibits etc. to my Houston location. 
Regards, Rj. 
Houston Ph. 713-853-9253
