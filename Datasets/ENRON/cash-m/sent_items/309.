Ann, I've looked over this list and realized I have no relevant information, so I've forwarded it to Sharon and Kriste, who should be able to help you.  Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.  Michelle

Michelle,

Here's the list of information I need for Northern Natural Gas:

1.  EEOC charges, lawsuits and/or judgments entered or settlement agreements reached in the last 2 years (including discrimination, harassment, workers' comp and ERISA claims, or otherwise), including any compliance agreements, consent decrees, etc. with any governmental agency (i.e..  OFCCP, EEOC, DOL, etc.)

2.  List of any pending government compliance audits, administrative proceedings, employee grievances regarding compliance with wage, overtime, or safety and health issues.

I talked with Valeria and she is pulling the EEOC charge information.  Of course, I need this as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.

Ann
