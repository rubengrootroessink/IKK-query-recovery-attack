I wouldn't put it exactly that way but ...  Sometimes you need to let them
know that if they give a good response, the client can be billed a quarter
hour.  Otherwise, we may not get a response.  I also do not want to bill for
cursory or not well reasoned statements.

   Client received an FMLA leave request based on a Certified
   Nutritionist's
   completion of the serious health condition form.  This does not appear
   to be
   a person authorized by the regs to certify a person as having a serious
   health condition.  Any thoughts on how to respond to this leave request.
   Billable credit for the most helpful response(s).
