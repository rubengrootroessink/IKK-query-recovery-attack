I got this request a second time.  Probably Fran would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid.

I don't think so because they roll up under EIM and I don't think they were included.  I'll check my query on who I included in the initial pull I did.  Diane may have included them in the second pass at that data.

For purposes of determining the Garden State Paper (GSP) first day motions to be filed, the attorney at Weil I am working with (Chris Marcus) has asked whether GSP employees were included in the "count" of "Enron" employees to be covered under its motion for approval to pay payroll.  If you have any questions, please email or call me.  Thanks
