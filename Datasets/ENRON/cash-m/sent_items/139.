Teresa,

The employment lawyer at Littler, Mendelson is named Kerry Notestine.  He is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements.  I also will have emailed him my summary of the Bob Henderson agreement, so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena.  His number, in case you need an immediate response while I am at NEPCO next week, is 713-652-4748.
