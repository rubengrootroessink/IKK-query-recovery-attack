Dan, Wayne Perry has issues with the consulting agreement I drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past.  Do you want to pick it up?  By copy of this, I am asking Twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him.  Michelle

Les,

Attached please find a draft Consulting Services Agreement for Gary Gentry.  I'll need some input from you on Exhibit A, as well as the rate to use in the compensation section (Section 2.01).  Otherwise, this document should be in a form that will facilitate quick negotiation/execution with Gary.  I'm still waiting on a response from EE&CC Legal (John Schwartzenburg) re getting a release from some of the continuing obligations that Gary has under his previous CSA with them.  I suggest that we obtain any such release in a separate document in order not to slow our progress on this document.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments at your convenience. 

Kind regards,
Dan
