Neither did I.  I just got the comments yesterday.  I'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments.  Michelle

FYI.

Have you reviewed the suggestions/comments raised?

Also, I did not know that HR in Singapore had shown the draft to Matt.

Chor Lim has been working with me on my draft Employment Agreement (which is quite different from the Singapore Employment Agreement I have seen). Chor Lim forwarded amendments for Houston's consideration yesterday (see Chor Lim's e-mail below), but she was re-sent the original draft overnight (without comment on the amendments) advising that you will be speaking to me about it in our call tomorrow. I'm not sure if you have seen the amendments, so I requested Chor Lim for a copy for your reference.

Looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Regards
Matt

Matt and I have reviewed the document and made some changes in line with local practice. Pls advise if we could proceed on this. Also, in Singapore we do not use Form B but have employee signed Certificate of Compliance. Matthias signed this on 7 Sep 99.
