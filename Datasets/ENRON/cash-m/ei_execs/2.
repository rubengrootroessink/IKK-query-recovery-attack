Quick update from this week:

Joe reviewed & approved all but 5 expense reports this week.  Last 5 to be review & approved by Orlando since we just located them (4 are U.S. reports).

Still attempting to resolve returned tickets ($150k) with Brazil travel agency.  Actually returned?  If so, who got the credit?  Estimate $150k in question.  Travel agency accountant will back in their office Monday to discuss.

Confirming Diomedes' Finland travel with Mark Metts.

Banking instructions eMailed to Diomedes so he can pay ENE for London Property.  Payment s/be forthcoming.

Audit completed duplicate and overlapping travel review.  5 items in question totaling $11k - $25k depending on stance we want to take.

Hope to have this wrapped up next week.  Will provide summary to you then.  Have a great weekend!

Terrie
