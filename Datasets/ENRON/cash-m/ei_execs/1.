Mary - We've completed out analysis and attached are 2 spreadsheets with a summary page for your review.

(1)  DC XMS Recap File 
Contains an analysis of his expense reports showing the following:

Personal Due Company in US $		$ 23,975
Missing Receipts in US $		$ 70,070
Missing Airline Ticket Receipts in US $	$ 99,177
Personal Meals in US $			$   2,097

Total to Collect from Diomedes		$195,319

(2)  DC Expense Overlap File
This file contains an analysis of overlapping travel & hotels, or hotels with not air travel, and vice versa.  Note that the summary shows you a min & max recovery amount of $11,288 and $18,474.  These amounts are where the hotel stay doesn't track with the air travel dates.  I understand that quite often a ticket may be used for dates other than what's printed on the ticket receipt.   So this may account for the discrepancies her.  Also, note that one of the amounts did not have a receipt and hence are already included in the "Missing Airline Ticket Receipts" category above.

(3)  4 US and 1 Brazil expense reports have been sent to Orlando for his review.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, he seems reluctant to sign anything and referred us to Joe.  However, GG Garcia has drafted Orlando a memo and again is requesting his review.

(4)  Payment for London flat s/be rec'd next Tuesday.  Monday is a banking holiday for them.

See updated notes below in red.

Quick update from this week:

Joe reviewed & approved all but 5 expense reports this week.  Last 5 to be review & approved by Orlando since we just located them (4 are U.S. reports). See latest comment (3) above. 

Still attempting to resolve returned tickets ($150k) with Brazil travel agency.  Actually returned?  If so, who got the credit?  Estimate $150k in question.  Travel agency accountant will back in their office Monday to discuss.    Credits could not be located.  Included in Missing Airline Ticket Receipts in our analysis in comment (1) above. 

Confirming Diomedes' Finland travel with Mark Metts.    Not business per Corp Dev.  Included in Personal Exps in our analysis in comment (1) above. 

Banking instructions eMailed to Diomedes so he can pay ENE for London Property.  Payment s/be forthcoming. See separate eMail from London today that I forwarded to you.  Monies s/be rec'd next Tuesday. 

Audit completed duplicate and overlapping travel review.  5 items in question totaling $11k - $25k depending on stance we want to take.     See comment (2) above. 

Hope to have this wrapped up next week.  Will provide summary to you then.  Have a great weekend!
