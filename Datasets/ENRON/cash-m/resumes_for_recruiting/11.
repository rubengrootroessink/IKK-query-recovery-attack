Thanks, Alan.  I just got off the phone with the other candidate, Donald
Duncan, and he, too, appears strong.  Donald has been an in-house energy
lawyer in Houston for 24 years, most recently with Eagle Global Logistics
(EGL), an international freight forwarder, which he left in May.  EGL is
suffering severe financial problems which comes as no surprise since their
principal client base are the computer manufacturers and tech companies that
have all suffered dramatic losses over the past 3-5 quarters.

Notably, Donald spent 9 years with Pennzoil's mining business and, as such,
is intimately familiar with the coal industry.  He also worked on a major
coal seam degasification project for Sonat in the '80s in the Black Warrior
Basin of Alabama.

Donald has the advantage of being familiar with both the coal and freight
industries and of being already in Houston.  He is very interested in you
and, as with Jerry Prager, let me encourage you to call him directly if you
are interested in speaking with him.  He is available anytime after 2:00
p.m. today and anytime tomorrow morning.  He can be reached at 713.515.4863.

Of course, if you are interested in additional information, please feel free
to give me a call.  Best regards,

Lee Allbritton
