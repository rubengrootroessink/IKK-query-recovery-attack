Guy looks interesting.

Might be a good athlete that we could plug in to various assignments (EGM or otherwise). We could check him out from Foley & Lardner as well as Cadwalader due to our contacts at those firms. I haven't see the transactions list yet.

Is he open to moving to Houston? As you know, it is more complicated when we have to move someone.

Here is a candidate referred by Bruce Menke at Associated Counsel.  Bruce also forwarded me additional information at my request, specifically addressing why he has moved around so much.  I'll forward that on as well.

Let me know if you want to talk with him.

 Michelle,

I hope your week is going well.

Please find attached the resume of Mitch Ludwin. Mitch has great academics
(JD '89 cum laude-top 8%, Law Review, Order of the Coif, etc.) and extensive
transactions experience with an emphasis on finance. Mitch is currently
Senior Associate at Troutman Sanders in Atlanta. Mitch was originally from
New York and began his career practicing for three years with Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft in that City. Mitch then joined Mudge, Rose, Guthrie,
Alexander Y Ferdon, spending two years with the firm's New York office,
followed by a year and a half with the firm's Los Angeles office. Upon
dissolution of Mudge, Rose, Mitch joined Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &
Jacobson in Los Angeles.  Mitch then accepted an opportunity with Foley &
Lardner in Milwaukee, where he practiced four years. Mitch joined the firm
to participate in the start up of the firm's project finance practice and to
be closer to his wife's family. This area of the firm's practice did not
develop as anticipated and the attorneys brought in with this expertise
moved to other firms. Mitch joined Troutman to focus on asset-based lending.
I would be happy to provide any additional information concerning Mitch
which you may wish and to arrange an interview, if you so desire. I
anticipate receiving a transactions list, which I will forward to you. I
have also submitted Mitch's resume to Enron Energy Services for
consideration.

Regards, Bruce Menke
