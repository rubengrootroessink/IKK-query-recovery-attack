The catering companies that were selected to submit proposals for the Legal 
Museum Event included:  A Fare Extraordinaire, Abuso, M,lange, The Stone 
Kitchen and Tony's At Home.
After carefully reviewing all the proposals, I have determined that M,lange 
is offering us the most for our money.

Listed below is the proposed menu for the event.  Please review and let me 
know if you have any changes or suggestions for the menu.
Thanks.
