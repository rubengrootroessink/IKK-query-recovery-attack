Fortunately we have already received some advice on the effects of bankruptcy 
on NOxTech from our patent counsel, which is attached. This is very promising 
and appears to put us very much in control of the intellectual property. 
Turning to the employment of the key individual, Bruce Sudduth, you will see 
from the covering email that we might want to take some immediate steps to 
preserve our ability to access him in the event bankruptcy is declared, 
however I am not convinced on the limited amount of information that we would 
not be running the risk of a tortious interference claim, unless we agreed it 
with the directors of NOxTech first and then proposed it to Bruce. What do 
you think?

Marcus,
In case you had not seen this yet, attached is a memorandum we had prepared
at Bart Clark's request anticipating NOxTech's possible bankruptcy.  I have
forwarded your contact information to Bill Bates, and he should be calling
you tomorrow.

Best regards,
Dave
