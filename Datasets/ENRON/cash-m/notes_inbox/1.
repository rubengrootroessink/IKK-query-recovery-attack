VOTE CAN BE CONTESTED AFTER NLRB OFFICER OVERSLEPT,
RESCHEDULED

A St. Louis waste hauler was justified in challenging a
representation election won by Teamsters Local 682, when the
National Labor Relations Board Officer in charge of the
initial vote overslept and then unilaterally scheduled a
second election, according to the Eighth Circuit  ("NLRB v.
Superior of Missouri, Inc., "8th Cir., No. 99-3648,
11/7/00).

Considering the circumstances surrounding the "hotly
contested election," the board officer's unilateral action
might have had an impact on the second vote and warranted an
NLRB hearing on Superior of Missouri's objections to the
election, the divided appeals court panel holds.

A dissenting judge finds that the objections raised by the
employer were insufficient to warrant an evidentiary
hearing. He rejects the employer's argument that the board
agent's conduct and the rescheduling of the election "caused
prejudice and destroyed the laboratory conditions necessary
for conducting a fair election."  . . . Page AA-1

FACTORY WORKER EXPOSED TO PORNOGRAPHY HAS NO SEX HARASSMENT
CASE

An electronics factory maintenance specialist whose
co-workers left pornographic pictures around the workplace
for her to find because they believed she had complained
about a racy swimsuit calendar has no claim against her
employer for sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a federal trial court in Indiana
rules ("Garton v. Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.,  "S.D.
Ind., No. IP99-1218-C-T/G, 10/25/00).

Plaintiff Aletha Garton "was subjected to boorish, crass and
offensive behavior in the workplace by her co-workers, but
the conduct of which she complains does not rise to the
level of actionable sexual harassment," says Judge Tinder,
granting Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.'s motion for
summary judgment. . . . Page A-1

PAY PRESSURE UNLIKELY TO RECEDE, WTI PROJECTS

Despite evidence of slower growth across the U.S. economy,
key labor market measures pulled together in the Wage Trend
Indicator suggest wage pressures will remain strong into
next year, according to the latest report released by BNA.

"The new WTI figures suggest there will be no easing in wage
pressures into next year," said economist Joel Popkin, whose
firm developed the indicator for BNA. Labor shortages are
likely to make it hard for many companies to hire workers
over the next few months, the WTI report suggests. . . .

STATE RULES APPLY TO 'HYBRID' SUIT WHILE IN STATE COURT,
NINTH CIRCUIT SAYS

A suit by a member of the International Union of Bricklayers
& Allied Crafts alleging "hiring hall and collective
bargaining violations" by the union and various employers is
not barred by the six-month statute of limitations in
federal law, the Ninth Circuit rules ("Prazak v. Local 1
Int'l Union of Bricklayers & Allied Crafts, "9th Cir., No.
98-36129, 11/13/00). Reversing the decision of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Alaska, the court of
appeals holds that in a "hybrid" claim originally filed in
state court, "if the federal statute of limitations is
initially complied with, the state procedural rules apply
until the case is removed to federal court."

"[William] Prazak's complaint originated in state court,"
writes Judge Nelson. "Thus, state procedural rules should
have been applied until the case was removed to federal
court. The [defendants] could have avoided the application
of Alaska's procedural rules by immediately removing the
case to federal court. As a tactical matter, however, the
[defendants] chose to litigate Prazak's initial lawsuit in
state court. The [defendants] must live with that choice." .

PHILADELPHIA SEIU LOCAL RATIFIES ACCORD WITH BUILDING OWNERS

Janitors and other building maintenance workers represented
by Service Employees International Union Local 36, whose
mail ballots were counted Nov. 14, overwhelmingly approve a
three-year contract with the owners of about 80 commercial
buildings in Philadelphia.

Local 36 Organizing Director Joseph M. Shields says the
agreement with Building Owners Labor Relations Inc., which
bargains for about 24 building owners, provides for wage
increases totaling 10.5 percent and a 70 percent increase in
pension contributions over term.

The contract runs from Oct. 15, 2000, through Oct. 14, 2003,
and covers 2,300 building service workers in Philadelphia. .

SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS JURY MUST DECIDE IF NEUROPATHY VICTIM
IS DISABLED

A former employee of Sears, Roebuck & Co. may proceed with
her discrimination claims under the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the Seventh Circuit rules, holding that a
rational jury could conclude the employee was disabled
("EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., "7th Cir., Nos. 99-3734 and
99-4037, 11/8/00).  Reversing a lower court's grant of
summary judgment, the appeals court says a jury should
determine whether Judith Keane was disabled under the ADA
and therefore entitled to reasonable accommodations.

"It is not our role to come to a decision as to whether
Keane was disabled under the ADA," writes Chief Judge Flaum
on behalf of the panel. "Rather, we only need decide whether
a rational jury, viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the plaintiffs could come to such a decision.
We believe they could. Thus, we conclude that summary
judgment should not have been granted on the basis that
Keane was not disabled." . . . Page A-2
