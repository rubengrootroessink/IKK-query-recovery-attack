Subject: House Lease Termination  

On the advise of Michelle Cash, we are sending out letters by Fed Ex today to 
both the real estate agent (Greenwood King) and the landlord (Eileen Urban) 
giving 30 days notice on termination.  If they come back to us wanting the 
remainder of the rent through the lease date of July 14, 2001, we will 
negotiate subletting.  Louise, do you still have someone in mind who may be 
interested?
