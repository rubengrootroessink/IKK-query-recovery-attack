Peter & Michelle,
?
Brian Hiebert forwarded to me Peter's questions regarding the risk of  
asbestos litigation at Celgar. 
?
Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British  Columbia are 
required to contribute to an accident fund which provides  compensation for 
injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment. In  turn,?the 
Act?provides employers statutory immunity from?damages  in respect of any 
personal injury, disablement or death arising out of and in  the course of 
employment.
?
The accident fund would cover asbestos claims. There are no  exceptions?which 
would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.  The Act does?not 
prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.  manufacturers of asbestos, 
but employers, as stated, are immune from such  actions.
?
Compensation is payable if the worker sustains pulmonary injury by a  
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the appropriate enquires about 
any  compensation paid to Celgar employees.
