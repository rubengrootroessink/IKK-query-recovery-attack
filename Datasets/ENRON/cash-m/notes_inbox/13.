David:

Your organization currently has seven job postings for Exempt positions that 
mention overtime requirements.  It is recommended that overtime requirements 
be used for non-exempt jobs only.   The use of overtime in association with 
exempt jobs could be a risk in the case of a Department of Labor Wage and 
Hour audit.  Exempt means that the employee is exempt from overtime 
calculations.   Exempt employees are paid on a "salary basis" --this means 
that the employee is paid the same, pre-determined amount for each week they 
work.  The reasoning behind this is that a white collar exempt worker is paid 
for the work done, not for the number of hours worked.    If an employee 
wants to make a claim that we had classified them exempt but they feel they 
should be non-exempt and we have required them to work what we have referred 
to as "overtime" and not compensated them for it , we may be creating a 
liability for ourselves.   I would recommend that for exempt jobs instead of 
using the term "overtime may be required", use "long work hours may be 
required as necessary" or something similar.   I would also recommend that 
the active postings be modified as soon a possible.    Please share this 
information with the recruiters or persons responsible for writing job 
descriptions and your compensation specialists in your group.   If you wish 
to discuss this, please contact me at ext. 39815.

The jobs referenced above for your organization are:
