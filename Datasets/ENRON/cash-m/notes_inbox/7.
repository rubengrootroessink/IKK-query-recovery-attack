JUDGE APPROVES $9 MILLION SETTLEMENT OF HARASSMENT SUIT
AGAINST FORD

A year after Judge Bucklo criticized a conciliation
agreement between the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and Ford Motor Co. for lacking "bite," the judge
approves a $9 million revised agreement settling class
allegations of sexual harassment at two of the company's
Chicago plants ("Warnell v. Ford Motor Co., " N.D. Ill., No.
98 C 1503, 11/17/00). Bucklo of the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois approves a settlement
agreement between Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford and hundreds of
current and former female employees of the company's Chicago
Heights Stamping Plant and its Chicago Assembly Plant.

The settlement agreement resolving claims under Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act modifies a $7.5 million
conciliation agreement affecting the same two plants that
was reached between the EEOC and Ford in September 1999. The
settlement enhances monetary terms for the plaintiffs and
places the settlement process under judicial supervision.
"What this does is take the conciliation agreement ... [and]
incorporates that into something larger and gives it some
teeth," according to plaintiffs' attorney Darnley Stewart.
Bucklo criticized the lack of any legal enforceability in
the earlier agreement one month after it was heralded by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as an innovation. .

NLRB RULES 2-1 ALBERTSON'S ILLEGALLY BARRED TWO UNIONS'
SOLICITATION

Albertson's Inc. committed unfair labor practices in
violation of the National Labor Relations Act by barring two
unions' members from distributing handbills outside 11
grocery stores in Oregon and Washington, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Albertson's Inc.,
"332 N.L.R.B. No. 104, 10/31/00 [released 11/8/00]).
Chairman Truesdale and Member Liebman decide the grocery
store chain violated Section 8(a)(1) by forbidding United
Food and Commercial Workers Local 555 from soliciting
employees to join the union and stopping International
Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 582 from soliciting
Albertson's customers to boycott products from a dairy
company involved in a labor dispute.

Finding Albertson's regularly granted access to the
Salvation Army, a number of youth and school organizations,
and veterans groups to solicit donations and sales, the
majority decides this activity exceeded "the small number of
isolated beneficent acts that the Board regards as a narrow
exception to an otherwise valid, nondiscriminatory
no-solicitation policy." Dissenting, Member Hurtgen
maintains Albertson's did not discriminate against union
activity because it drew "a line between (1) solicitations
by charitable groups which are well known to the community
and (2) solicitations by political groups, commercial groups
which seek to sell goods or services, and charitable groups
which are unknown to the community." . . . Page A-6

TYSON'S FAILURE TO FORM NONCOMPETE DOOMS TRADE SECRETS
LAWSUIT

Tyson Foods Inc.'s failure to protect its alleged trade
secrets with a noncompetition agreement between it and three
former executives doomed its lawsuit against the competing
poultry producer to which the executives defected, the
Supreme Court of Arkansas rules ("ConAgra Inc. v. Tyson
Foods Inc.,  "Ark.,  No. 00-446,  11/16/00).

The trial court erred in determining that it was inevitable
that the executives would disclose Tyson's trade secrets to
their new employer, ConAgra Inc., Judge Brown finds. Tyson,
Brown says, failed to established that it had any secrets to
protect because it had in place no protection against
postemployment revelation of confidential information. The
high court reverses the lower court's injunctions barring
ConAgra from misappropriating any of Tyson's trade secrets,
Jerry Dowd and John Curren from engaging in sales and
marketing of poultry for one year, and Mike Hamblin from
continuing a marketing relationship with certain clients.

DELAYED RETIREMENT NOT NECESSARY IF WORKERS SAVE MORE

If workers' incomes continue to grow at a rate of a 1
percent to 2 percent over the next several decades, the
workers can use those increases to finance longer, more
comfortable retirements, an economist tells a group of
researchers at a hearing sponsored by the Senate Special
Committee on Aging.

The population of older Americans continues to grow, causing
increases in the costs of pensions, Social Security, and
health benefits. However, worker productivity is likely to
keep pace with those costs, according to Gary Burtless, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
D.C.-based think tank. Because more women are in the
workforce, he says, the amount of time Americans between the
ages of 25 and 54 spend at work has risen in the last 30
years. The increased work hours can help pay for shorter
hours and longer retirements after age 55.  . . . Page A-10

COURT ENFORCES ARBITRATION AFTER SEVERING UNCONSCIONABLE
PROVISION

A plaintiff may be compelled to arbitrate her pregnancy
discrimination claim under a binding pre-dispute arbitration
agreement with her employer, even though a provision
requiring her to bear all costs of court and administrative
proceedings is unconscionable and must be severed from the
rest of the agreement, the California Court of Appeal rules
("Shubin v. William Lyon Homes Inc.", Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
A088858, 11/14/00).

Relying on a recent California Supreme Court decision, the
court holds that a provision in the arbitration agreement
was illegal that required employees to pay all costs and
fees for any court action brought by the employee, even if
she prevailed. Such a clause "chills the exercise of the
employee's right to legitimately pursue her claim before the
[Department of Fair Employment and Housing]," the appeals
court says. But that provision could be severed "without
adversely affecting the central purpose of the contract," it
says. . . . Page A-2

NEWSPAPER GUILD MEMBERS STRIKE SEATTLE DAILIES

Some 1,000 news, business, advertising, and circulation
employees at the"Seattle Times" and "Seattle
Post-Intelligencer" strike the newspapers in a contract
dispute over wages and other working conditions. Members of
the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild reject a final
contract offer from the employers and also vote against
postponing the previously authorized strike, according to
the first edition of the union's online newspaper, the
"Seattle Union Record". Union members reject a final
contract offer from the papers that included hourly
increases that averaged 55 cents per year over a six-year
period, the union says. . . . Page A-8
