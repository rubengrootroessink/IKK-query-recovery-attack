D.C. CIRCUIT RULES AIRLINE ILLEGALLY OUSTED ALPA WORKERS
FROM PROFIT-SHARING

Cargo airline Atlas Air Inc. violated the Railway Labor Act
by excluding pilots and flight engineers from participation
in a profit-sharing plan "for the sole reason" that they
voted for union representation, the District of Columbia
Circuit rules ("Atlas Air Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n,
"D.C. Cir., No. 99-7223, 11/21/00). Reversing a district
court's grant of summary judgment to Atlas Air, the appeals
court acknowledges that employers covered by the act may
change working conditions when no bargaining contract exists
between the parties.

However, Judge Sentelle decides "where the challenged
modification to the status quo is far from merely formal,
and is in fact the equivalent of a substantial decrease in
compensation having a real and material impact on the
conditions of employment, and is justified on no other
grounds than union certification, we may presume that the
carrier's actions were motivated by anti-union animus and
are in violation of RLA Section 2, Third and Fourth."

Atlas Air sued for a declaratory judgment that its exclusion
of some 550 newly unionized pilots and flight engineers from
the profit-sharing plan was legal and that it could make
more changes in employment conditions before collective
bargaining began. The Air Line Pilots Association
counterclaimed, alleging the airline interfered with
workers' right to organize. . . . Page AA-1

PROBE OF HARASSMENT CHARGE AGAINST UNION ADVOCATES BARRED BY
NLRB

A North Carolina diesel engine firm violated the rights of
two employees by investigating and then documenting a
harassment complaint waged against them for distributing a
union organizing newsletter, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Consolidated Diesel Co.,"332
N.L.R.B. No. 94, 10/31/00 [released Nov. 7]).

Although neither of the two employees was disciplined, the
board says that the process still had the potential of
interfering with their rights to engage in protected
activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations
Act.

"Clearly [Consolidated Diesel Co.'s] requiring employees who
engage in protected concerted activity to submit to a
process with the potential for interrogation about protected
activity, discipline, discharge, and permanent
documentation, simply because some person at one time
claimed to be harassed by that activity, has a reasonable
tendency to restrain the exercise of Section 7 rights,"
Chairman Truesdale and Member Fox write. Dissenting Member
Hurtgen finds no violation and "nothing coercive" in the
actions. . . . Page A-1

VIGILANCE REQUIRED TO CLASSIFY COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS' WORK
UNDER FLSA

With computer professionals becoming more integral to the
work of high-tech, and even not-so-high-tech, companies, it
has become more important for employers to understand and
apply correctly the Section 13 (a) exemption under the Fair
Labor Standards Act overtime law for computer professionals,
according to attorneys interviewed by BNA.

Employers seeking to apply the overtime exemption must be
certain that the work performed by the "computer
professional" at issue falls within the parameters of the
statute. In addition to considering the statute, employers
determining whether employees are overtime-exempt must "walk
through" the implementing regulations issued by the
Department of Labor in 1992 and "make sure" that their
computer workers fall within the guidelines, according to
management attorneys. . . . Page C-1

FLSA APPLIES TO HOME FOR MENTALLY RETARDED

A nonprofit organization that provides community living
residences for mentally retarded adults must comply with the
Fair Labor Standards Act when it calculates overtime payment
rates for its employees, the Third Circuit affirms ("Madison
v. Resources for Human Dev., "3d Cir., No. 99-1821,
11/15/00). Staff members of Resources for Human Development
Inc. cannot be considered FLSA-exempt "domestic service
employees" because RHD residences are not private homes, the
court decides. Clients do not have full control over access
to their residences and do not have "unfettered freedom in
their day-to-day conduct."

However, the appeals court remands the case to a lower court
to decided whether cash payments from RHD's cafeteria
benefits plan should be taken into account when calculating
employees' overtime payments. The district court improperly
relied on an informal interpretive guidance when it granted
summary judgment to the plaintiffs, the court finds. . . .

 NUMBER OF EMPLOYER-PAID HOLIDAYS ABOUT THE SAME AS LAST
YEAR'S

Employees can look forward to about as much paid time off
this Christmas and New Year's season as last, according to
BNA's latest annual survey of year-end holiday plans.

Almost half of the responding employers (49 percent) will
grant three or more paid days off for the holiday season
this year, little changed from 50 percent in 1999-2000, when
the national holidays fell on Saturdays, and slightly more
than the 47 percent of employers in 1995-96, when Christmas
and New Year's last landed on Mondays. Employers' holiday
scheduling continues to be slightly more conservative than a
decade ago, when, in 1989-90, a year when the national
holidays also fell on Monday, six out of 10 firms gave
workers at least three paid days. . . . Page B-1

STUDY SHOWS 15 PERCENT OF JOB SEEKERS USE INTERNET

A new study of Internet use by job seekers shows that in
1998 about 15 percent of all unemployed people actively
looking for new jobs turned to various World Wide Web sites
in conducting their search.

About 7 percent of employed persons had used the Internet to
look for a new job in 1998, a higher proportion than shown
in earlier studies of traditional job-search methods,
according to economists Peter Kuhn and Mikal Skuterud in an
article published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
economists find little impact so far of increasing use of
the Internet on public employment agencies.. . . Page A-3 ,
