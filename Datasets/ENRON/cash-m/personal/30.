They do. Thank you. I'm off to Vegas Fri but will speak to you all in the
next couple of weeks I'm sure. Looks like x-mas won't happen but I think
we'll try and come down in the Spring. Are there any good times for you
guys? Does Cameron get a Spring break?

DVDs would be good.  I got him the Godfather Trilogy, but you might
consider other movies.
He has Playstation 2, so games are a good idea.
He always likes short-sleeved, solid color polo shirts in size XL.
His Rice Owls baseball cap got mutilated when the baggage cart ran over
his suitcase, so he could use a replacement.
Anything with the 40 theme would be fun.

Hope those ideas help.

Michelle
