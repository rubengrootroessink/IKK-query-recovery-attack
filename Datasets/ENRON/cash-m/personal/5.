Thanks.  I work for a criminal defense  lawyer and he thought of the address name.  Pretty appropriate.  When  you get a chance, let me know what and how much you will be baking.  I work  on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, so if you send anything out on Tuesday and  Thursday, please send it to my home email address.
 
Thanks again.
 
Lynda

Love your email address!  I'm glad you got my email; it  was working kind of
funny, so I wasn't sure it went through.
Count  me in from 6-7, or from 7-8 if you need that shift  instead.
Michelle

   Hi Michelle, Lynda  Carnegie here.  I  received your message and email.
    I've got you down for baked goods and we  will need your help at  the
   book fair.  What time would you like to work   during family night?  We
   have one person from 5 to 6 and  another from 6 to  7, but we will need
   more than one  person at those times.  Let me  know.  You can email me  at
   work at noguilt@swbell.net  << File: mailto:noguilt@swbell.net  >>   or at
   home at shanadog@swbell.net  << File: mailto:shanadog@swbell.net  >>  
   Thanks for your help.
   Lynda  C.
