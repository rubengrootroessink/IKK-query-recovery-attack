The Corporate Employee Relations group (formerly the OLER team) is planning a marketing campaign to ensure that employees are aware of resources available to assist in addressing workplace concerns.  The targeted roll-out date is October 1, 2001.  In preparation for this roll-out, the Employee Relations group will meet each week to plan related tasks and address issues such as selecting a call tracking system, managing employee expectations, defining roles and relationships between ER staff/HR Generalist/and other HR staff members, defining service standards, etc.  Please plan to attend the first meeting which will be held Friday, August  24, from 10 - 11:00am in EB 16C1.  

HR Heads:  Although we do not expect you to attend these meetings, please assign someone from your team to participate so that your group's ideas and views can be considered.
