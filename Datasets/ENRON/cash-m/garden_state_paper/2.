We are checking the status of two documents sent to you last week:

(1) GSP LLC Action approving Merrill Lynch as Trustee.  This was sent to David and Cynthia on June 14th and needs to be signed by the appropriate person at Enron (we understand that Enron is the sole member of GSP, LLC).

(2) Pension Investors Corp Intake Form.  This was sent to Louis and David on June 14th and needs to be completed and e-mailed or faxed to me or Pension Investors Corp.

Please return both documents as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Ann
