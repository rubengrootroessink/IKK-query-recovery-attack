Michelle, I need your help on this issue as we are in  the meeting phase an=
d=20
are getting questions=01(
As far as managed out employees, we=01,d like to include them in the system=
 in=20
some fashion.  If we make them =01&active=018 in addition to the legal impl=
ications=20
that may exist, we will skew our demographics.  Do you have any issue with=
=20
our making/calling  these managed employees terminated emp. 1, 2, 3 etc, if=
=20
that is possible in the system and keeping them separate from the =20
demographic numbers which Andrea is working with?  =20

Thanks Gina

As regards managed out employees, I believe the plan is to still include th=
em=20
in BU distribution.  The method of including them may give you some=20
heartburn.  In essence, in order to graph during the meeting to show=20
distribution with the  managed out people, we would either have to enter=20
dummy data into PEP (which corrupts our data and could mess up datamart whi=
ch=20
we feed into), or we have to add them into PEP as active employees (PEP can=
=01,t=20
pull inactive employees), or as business associates.
What is your take on this?=20

On another less troublesome issue, we will have the diversity system up and=
=20
running on Tuesday.  We can=01,t migrate the program into stage, because we=
=01,re=20
using that environment for PC driver training.  (more than you wanted to=20
know?)
If ok w/ you we can discuss diversity stats on Tuesday.
