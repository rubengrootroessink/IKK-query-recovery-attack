Michelle, I need your help on this issue as we are in  the meeting phase and are getting questions?
As far as managed out employees, we'd like to include them in the system in some fashion.  If we make them "active" in addition to the legal implications that may exist, we will skew our demographics.  Do you have any issue with our making/calling  these managed employees terminated emp. 1, 2, 3 etc, if that is possible in the system and keeping them separate from the  demographic numbers which Andrea is working with?   

Thanks Gina

Michelle;  
As regards managed out employees, I believe the plan is to still include them in BU distribution.  The method of including them may give you some heartburn.  In essence, in order to graph during the meeting to show distribution with the  managed out people, we would either have to enter dummy data into PEP (which corrupts our data and could mess up datamart which we feed into), or we have to add them into PEP as active employees (PEP can't pull inactive employees), or as business associates.
What is your take on this? 

On another less troublesome issue, we will have the diversity system up and running on Tuesday.  We can't migrate the program into stage, because we're using that environment for PC driver training.  (more than you wanted to know?)
If ok w/ you we can discuss diversity stats on Tuesday.
