I agree with Melissa and am in favor of a separate process.  

PT/RH employees need to be rated on a relevant scale.  A PT employee's job 
scope "the place the initial bar is set" is not relevant to a FT employee.  

Facilitation and Ground rules are great but as we know they change as the 
circumstances of a meeting change.  Consistency here has not been our 
strength.

I also agree that the PT/RH is an important talent pool.  If we don't give 
these folks a chance at equal rating we stand to lose the ability to offer 
this as a legitimate employee class.

In addition, we need to consider the message sent to FT employees.  Will they 
preceive the process as fair.

Thanks
Cb

In my opinion, a part time person who may add value in the time that they are 
able to work will invariably get "creamed" in the prc, and that might impact 
our ability to tap into this talent pool (assuming we want to).  I agree that 
a part time person can't possibly add as much value (in most cases) as a full 
time person, but it might be terribly demotivating to continually be rated as 
"bottom of the pack".  I advocate either (1) a separate process or (2) 
feedback without a ranking (like the non-exempts).

All, 

As you know I have been tasked with soliciting your views and suggestions on 
PT/RH employees and PRC.  From my personal point of view I don't think we 
should have a separate process for PT/RH employees.  I think that we should 
cover the issue in facilitator training and have a statement in the ground 
rules defining who is rated in PRC meetings, i.e. "all active exempt 
employees hired after January 1, 2001  who have full time, part time or 
reduced hours are rated in PRC."  Likewise, the new feature to provide 
employee accomplishments in the PRC meeting may help to  balance the 
committee's perspective on PT/RH employees.  Your thoughts?

Gina
