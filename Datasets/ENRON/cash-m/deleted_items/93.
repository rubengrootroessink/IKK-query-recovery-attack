NLRB RULES 2-1 FIRM MUST APPLY BARGAINING CONTRACT TO TEMPS

A gourmet foods distributor in New York committed an unfair
labor practice by refusing to apply any provisions of a
bargaining contract to temporary warehouse workers supplied
by various staffing firms, the National Labor Relations
Board rules 2-1 ("Tree of Life Inc. d/b/a Gourmet Award
Foods Northeast, "336 N.L.R.B. No. 77, 10/1/01 [released
10/18/01]). Members Truesdale and Liebman find the temporary
warehouse workers are included in the contract's broad unit
definition of "drivers and warehousemen." The majority
concludes Tree of Life Inc. "had a statutory obligation to
apply to those employees the contractual terms it had
negotiated, to the extent those terms regulate their working
conditions under its control."

 Liebman indicates she would apply the entire contract to
the temporary workers. Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen asserts
"the higher standard of accretion must be met" if the board
adds employees to a pre-existing unit without a
representation vote. Finding the temporary workers do not
share an "overwhelming community of interests" with the
workers solely employed by Tree of Life, Hurtgen says the
temporary workers should not be accreted to the bargaining
unit. . . . Page AA-1 , Text-E-1

COURT REFUSES TO HALT ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE OVER FIRING
DECISIONS

A metal processing and distribution company's decision to
fire three striking workers was subject to the mandatory
arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement
ratified after the firing decision was made, a federal
district judge in Philadelphia rules ( "Metals USA Inc. v.
Sheet Metal Int'l Assoc. Local Union No. 119,  "E.D. Pa.,
No. 01-4365,  10/15/01).

Judge Shapiro of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania denies Metals USA's motion to
preliminarily enjoin arbitration of the dispute with Sheet
Metal Workers Local 119, finding the company unlikely to
prevail on the merits of its case. Even though the union was
aware of the firing decision before the agreement was
reached, neither the union nor the three fired workers
received sufficient notice of the identities of those being
fired until after the agreement took effect, the court
decides.  . . . Page A-1

FORMER HERE BUSINESS AGENT FAILS IN CHALLENGE TO LOCAL
TRUSTEESHIP

A former union business agent who was removed from his post
with a Pittsburgh local after the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees International Union came under federal
supervision cannot seek monetary damages under the
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act's trusteeship
provision, the Third Circuit rules ("Ross v. Hotel Employees
and Restaurant Employees Int'l Union, "3d Cir., No. 00-3124,
9/17/01). The trusteeship provision--Title III of the
LMRDA-- does not "allow a private cause of action for
individual damages flowing from the termination of an
appointed employee," the Third Circuit finds in a case of
first impression.

 Relief under that provision "must be sought on behalf of
the local union organization and the entire membership must
reap the benefits," the court says. "Nothing in the
legislative history of Title III suggests that Congress
contemplated an individual bringing suit for compensatory
damages arising from the loss of an appointed union position
under that title," the court determines. "The statutory
scheme of the LMRDA strongly suggests that the individual
rights" the former agent "seeks to vindicate must be
redressed under Title I," which, the court says, was added
to the law specifically to address the rights of individual
union members. . . . Page A-8

OAS LABOR MINISTERS BACK ENDORSEMENT OF ILO LABOR RIGHTS
CONVENTIONS

The unanimous support of labor ministers of the Americas for
endorsing key International Labor Organization conventions
on basic labor rights and child labor represents a
significant commitment to taking action on these issues,
Canadian Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw says.

That commitment and the inclusion for the first time of
employer and worker representatives in developing common
labor policy directions are historic steps in adding a
social dimension to the processes of globalization and trade
liberalization, Bradshaw tells reporters at the conclusion
of the 12th Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor.
"It's a new beginning," she says.

The labor ministers' agreement to support ILO standards is
an important step, but adoption of the standards is
meaningless unless the OAS member countries also put in
place effective enforcement to ensure that the standards are
actually met, says Canadian Labour Congress Vice President
Hassan Yussuff. "It's a tremendous accomplishment if we can
adopt them and enforce them," he says. . . . Page A-2

MASSACHUSETTS AGENCY ALLOWS COMPLAINTS BY TRANSGENDERED
EMPLOYEES

In two separate rulings, the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination endorses bringing complaints of
discrimination against transgendered employees under state
bias laws aimed at both sex and disability bias, but not
under a law outlawing sexual orientation discrimination
("Jette v. Honey Farms Mini Market, "Mass. Comm'n Against
Discrimination, No. 95 SEM 0421, 10/11/01; "Millett v. Lutco
Inc., "Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination, No. 98 BEM 3695,
10/11/01).

The commission rules in separate cases brought by
male-to-female transsexuals that investigators can consider
claims based on sex and disability discrimination because
the statutory language does not specifically exclude such
claims. A claim based on sexual orientation, however, is not
possible, the commission says, because the statute
specifically lists orientations, and transgenderism is not
one of the listed possibilities.

The commission says federal and state courts have expanded
the concept of sex and gender discrimination and that the
"continual evolution and expansion" of the law has gone
beyond questions of anatomy and into the realms of gender
and appearance. . . . Page A-3
