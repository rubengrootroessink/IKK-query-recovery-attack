The fact that we specifically elected at the outset of our Green Card Process to proceed down the Consular route was to ensure that notwithstanding the inconvenience of traveling to the UK at relatively short notice, the benefit would be that we would stand a better chance, if we were to receive a Green Card, of receiving one in the shortest possible period of time.
	
I currently have little confidence in Tindall & Foster to be able to deliver on anything now that we are forced to parallel process with the Adjusted Status route. We need to be clear on this, this is not, and never was our preferred route. Unless there is something that provides me with significant comfort that the Consular route is an avenue that we are able to pursue in a timely manner, I would like to re-visit employing Tindall & Foster and would like to consider a firm in either New York or London.
