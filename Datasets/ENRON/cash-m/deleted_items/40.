My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year student at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specialist.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than the fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the expectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt efficiency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any information you may provide including both duties and necessary qualifications.  

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protections they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addressed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved in such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the ADA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I would feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss.  

Thank you for your time,

Jim Little
