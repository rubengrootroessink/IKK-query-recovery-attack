Thanks.  Great point.  We discussed but for the group of candidates they have this weekend are mostly from the US and they want to captured this level of detail.  A box called "Other" is put at the end to capture those non-US locations.

My one comment relates to the "where are you from" question.  We only list states in the US -- what about foreign-born students?  It seems like it would be a good idea to list regions of the US, then add Mexico, Canada, Carribbean, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, etc. to be more inclusive.  What do you think?
