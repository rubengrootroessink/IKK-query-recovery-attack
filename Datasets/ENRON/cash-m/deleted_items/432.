Hey Gang:

Dave's staff meeting was attended by women in a party mood and Kirk with some limited veto rights!  We have tentatively scheduled a casual family Christmas party for Dave's Gang for December 8 at Alicia's house in the Heights.  This is a kid-friendly event with a street party twist - we'll start with a casual dinner at 5pm at the Goodrows then, weather permitting, travel by foot, wagon, stroller, bicycles, scooters or similar modes to the Lights in the Heights Street Party a few blocks away.

We'll send out better invitations next week.  But please mark your calendars and inform your household event coordinators now.

Check out the attached link to Lights in the Heights for more info about carolling and carousing for Christmas!

Ho Ho Ho
