Michelle,

It looks like my contacts have added more than one addition to our list of
possible Enron employees.  I am forwarding on this complete list w/ 25 more
possible employees to search.  Can you let us know if these people were
Enron employees and their dates of employment?   Sorry, I didn't send this
list with the request yesterday, but it was not generated at the time of
the request.

Thank you,
Kevin Kosub
