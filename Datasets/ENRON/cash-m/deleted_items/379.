Michelle:  Just for my own curiosity, Bobbi Tessandori has informed me that in future all of the documents coming from Tindall & Foster now need Sheila Knudsen's signature, instead of mine?  

I believe Jane Allen, as Director, was the highest level individual ever signing the INS documents, as in most of the old files, I see the signatures of HR Specialists, etc., such as myself.

I certainly will abide by whatever management decides needs to be done in the future, but I am just interested to know why the sudden change?

I would appreciate your input.
Many thanks
Margaret
