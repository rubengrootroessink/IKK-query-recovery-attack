Dear Michelle,
I'm currently with Enron Wind and have recently been re-deployed.  My main goal right now, is to continue working for Enron, because I feel that Enron is such an excellent and innovative company.  Please allow me the opportunity to interview for the above referenced position.

My resume is attached for your consideration.  If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call at 5-5348.  Thank you.

Regards,
Delma Munoz
