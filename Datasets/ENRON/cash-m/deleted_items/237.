Attached is the revised summary of the recommendations coming out of the Diversity Subcommittee.  If there are additional comments, please feel free to pass them on.

Is is also my understanding that Jeff is working with Andrea and Michelle regarding the "metrics'' accumulated with respect to diversity performance with a focus on verification, context, and presentation so as to supplement our recommendations.  In that regard (and after discussing with Kirk), we should begin organizing a formal presentation for the OTC of these materials.  One approach may be as follows:

(1) Convert the Recommendations and Metrics into approximately 5 slides: (a) Slide 1-Overview; (b) Slide 2-What type of data was used as support and why; (c) Slide 3-  Presentation of the metrics and what we believe that data is indicating; (d) Review of Recommendations/Action Items and the supporting Business Case; and (e) Next Steps.

(2) Identify and present key metrics; identify backup slides with data points.

I am hopeful that we can finalize these items in the next week so we can review with Cindy in early October and be prepared to meet with the OTC sometime in October.
Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.  Thank you for your time.

Jordan
