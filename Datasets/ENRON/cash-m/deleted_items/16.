Michelle,

This is not a problem.  Twanda usually makes arrangements in her instructio=
ns to the temporary so we can work around it.  I agree with you that your f=
iles are highly confidential and no one should have access unless you so de=
signate.  My message was a general one that went out to everyone in the dep=
artment.  It's up to each individual to give access (or not) to whatever th=
ey would like a temp to use in order to support them in their Assistant's a=
bsence.  We have set up the temporary ID's as per Mark Haedicke's office to=
 give access mainly to calendars only in order to help the temp field phone=
 calls, make appointments, and to generally let the temp know where everyon=
e is in case Mr. Haedicke is looking for someone.

Becky,
=20
Given the nature of what I do, no one in my group will be able to provide t=
hese types of temporary rights to documents or calendar entries.  I do not =
believe that any of the other temporary ID's have access to our stuff, so I=
 would think that these new IDs would be the same.
=20
I hope that does not pose a problem, but I believe that the confidentiality=
 considerations should outweigh the convenience factor for a temporary work=
er.
=20
Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: New Temp IDs



Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temp=
orary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access ri=
ghts for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While do=
ing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are=
 listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access r=
ights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=20
For Outlook users only!=20

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e=
-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently,=
 the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to O=
utlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights =
to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control h=
ow much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you coul=
d give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail =
or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to y=
ou.

Please give access to the following IDs:=20
EWS Legal Temp 1=20
EWS Legal Temp 2=20
EWS Legal Temp 3=20
EWS Legal Temp 4=20
EWS Legal Temp 5=20
EWS Legal Temp 6=20
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.=20
EWS Legal Temp 8=20
EWS Legal Temp 9=20
EWS Legal Temp 10=20
EWS Legal Temp 11=20

To set up access:=20
1.      Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if y=
our folders list is not visible, click on "View" and

        then "Folder List")=20

2.      Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up=
=20

3.      Left click on the "Permissions" tab=20

4.      Left click on "Add".=20
        Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.=20
        Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the =
"Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not

        to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)=20
        Left Click "OK"=20

5.      You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first I=
D you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then

        left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not h=
olding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which

        access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do=
 not select anything that has "own" or "owner"

        in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".=20

6.      Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.=
=20

7.      [Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may =
have, right click on that folder and repeat steps

         2-5 above.=20

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be complete=
d only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come i=
n handy!

Thank you for your time and patience.
