Twanda, could you schedule some time for me to meet w/ Michelle on Wednesday, 10/23, to briefly discuss an Enron Freight Markets project?  I don't anticipate we would need more than 15 minutes.

I have a staff meeting schedule 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and an afternoon meeting scheduled 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., but am otherwise free -- thanks, Bob
