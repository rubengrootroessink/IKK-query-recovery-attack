All, 
I'm forwarding a message from Michelle Cash and Lizette Palmer re: Revocation Waivers.     I have not received any signed notices back as of today but if you have please forward them to me.    I would like to forward them to the vault.
Thanks, H

I would appreciate your help in communicating to the HR community that signed waivers related to the revocation of job offers are to be placed in two locations:  (1) original to the vault; and (2) a copy to the application file kept by HR regarding the individual.

Thanks,
