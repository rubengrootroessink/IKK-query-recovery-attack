I received an Out of Office AutoReply from Kathy Schultea, indicating she is out this week.  Did you receive the HR data from her last week?

Michelle/Diane, 
Assuming you received the updated file from Kathy, here's what I would like to see.

1.  Standard deviation by job group based on age, gender, ethnicity and performance rating
2.  Utilization of Forecast, Probability and/or Trend functions for age gender, ethnicity and performance rating to identify the likelihood of women and minorities promoted within the organization.. 

Please let me know if Jeanerette needs additional information.
