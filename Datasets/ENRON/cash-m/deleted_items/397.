Great!  Kriste, if there are any questions you believe to be inappropriate for general publication, please note and I will follow up with David Oxley.  Thanks, Cole.

Cole, I have passed these on to Kriste for final blessing.  I looked at these briefly, however, and would question whether we want these answers out for everyone to see.  I think that some of these questions really should be for internal HR only.  My guess is that David probably should decide what and how much he wants to raise in the public.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle, please advise whether the attached questions are ready for publication.  I don't think any of these specific require SEC Legal approval, let me know your thoughts.  Thanks, Cole.
