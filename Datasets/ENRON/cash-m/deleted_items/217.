Thanks Michelle - I will incorporate those changes and check with Lizzette.  I think Rick was just the messenger - I got the impression the group wanted procedures that were somewhat vague - not so many requirements.

Sarah, this does not strike me as too bureaucratic.  Exactly what were Rick's concerns?  Perhaps you could make it more of a "step by step" process instead of a paragraph.  One other thing -- we should have some sort of excuse for not calling if unable to due to impairment.  Also, if a person contacts a supervisor about a lengthy medical leave that is supported by a doctor's note, he should not have to call in every day.  You might want to check with Lizzette for some suggested language on this, as I believe she had some ideas.  
 
Thanks.
Michelle

SICK LEAVE POLICY 

Policy 

To keep the business and each department running smoothly and efficiently, it is important that every employee be on the job on time regularly.  For this reason, careful attention is given to promptness, absence record and overall dependability.

Enron recognizes, however, that an employee may occasionally be unable to come to work due to injury or illness.  As a result, the Sick Leave policy is designed to provide protection to employees against loss of income during pregnancy, illness or injury.

Eligible employees who are unable to perform their jobs due to pregnancy, illness or injury are eligible to receive sick leave pay for up to 1,040 hours (6 months) in a twelve month period, assuming certain procedures are followed.    Effective January 1, 2002, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) runs concurrently with Enron's Sick Leave policy.  An employee who is still disabled after using the 1,040 hours of sick leave pay ends may qualify for long term disability insurance.  Sick days cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next and employees are not paid for sick days either at the end of the calendar year or upon termination.

Procedures - 

To be eligible for sick leave pay, employees unable to report to work must telephone their supervisor directly, each day of their absence, as far in advance as possible.  If their supervisor is not available, the employee's human resources representative should be contacted.  If an employee is unable to make the call personally, a family member or a friend should contact the supervisor.  The supervisor or human resources representative must be contacted each day of absence.  An employee who fails to contact his/her immediate supervisor or human resources representative may forfeit the sick leave pay and may be considered as having voluntarily resigned.  This policy must be followed unless an exception has been made for a particular absence, and a written memo to this effect has been sent to the employees' human resources representative.

On the fifth day of continued absence due to injury or illness, in addition to notifying the employee's supervisor or human resources representative, the employee must also attain a doctor's certification indicating the estimated date in which the employee will be able to return to work.  Any absences exceeding 2 weeks will require a doctor's certification indicating that the employee is able to return to work.
