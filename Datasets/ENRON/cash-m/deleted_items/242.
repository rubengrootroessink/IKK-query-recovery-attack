Hi Michelle,
I received in today's mail a notice from the 127th District Court that the
Alonzo Williams case will be dismissed for want of prosecution unless we
file a sworn motion to retain, or motion for default judgment, before
November 2. We talked much earlier in the year about this, and I realize
that people have much larger priorities, but I never heard what the business
client wanted to do on this one. Can we have a conference call or meeting to
resolve this before the end of the month? Let me know your preference.
Best regards,
Bill Ogden
