Michelle,
 
Hope you had a nice  and uninterrupted by work weekend.  I have a lot of Georgia-Pacific plan  documents that our due diligence person copies and brought back for me to look  at if we needed to.  Do you want them?  Can you think of any reason  why I should keep them if you don't?
 
Carol
