Michelle,
I think what Gary really needs is a consulting agreement with a confidentiality clause.  Is this something you could draft for Gary?  If it is I will have Gary call you to discuss what it is that this group will provide Enron.
Thanks,
Brent

Brent,

please send a C.A. template to Riaz Siddiqi, Pres and CEO at Capstone Global Energy LLC. His email address is rsiddiqi@capstoneenergy.com.

We need the CA to cover a few things.  We plan to work together to offer corporate risk management solutions focused around weather.  We've targeted 3 customers to start on:  DTE, Connectiv, and First Energy.

The CA needs to address 3 things (we think):
1. the concept of working together to create these solutions
2. the specific clients
3. ideas we come up with

I assume "protected ideas" would need to be documented and stamped "confidential".

I know this is a pain - they want it and as a consulting company, intellectual property is all they really have.  And we know how you hate to start with someone else's CA... but we can get theirs if you'd like.

Gary
