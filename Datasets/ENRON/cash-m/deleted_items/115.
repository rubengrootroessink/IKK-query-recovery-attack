I will be out of the office on vacation on a walking tour traveling through Spain, Friday, October 19, 2001 returning on Tuesday, October 30, 2001.  I will not be able to access email or voicemail while I am away.  Please contact my secretary, Ava Syon at 713-853-5284 or one of the lawyers in my group, Kriste Sullivan at 713-853-7557, if you need assistance. Thank you.
