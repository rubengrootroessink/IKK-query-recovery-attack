Diane,

I have updated both you and Michelle into our demo site so you can access
the course as if you are a learner, the older passwords were no longer valid
for this particular site. This will allow you to demo manager and employer
versions unlike the actual product itself which only allows you to see the
version you are assigned by the organization. This will make it easier to
review the courseware.



INSTRUCTIONS:

Clicking on the link below will take you to a sign-in screen.

Your user names are:    dgoode   mcash  (first initial, last name)

Password is:   enron

All entries are in lower case.

After you click the "log in" button, you will be brought to a "Welcome"
screen.  Click on the "Course List" link.  You will now be brought to a
table with all of the courses available to you.

Click on any of the courses.  Your computer will check to make sure you have
macromedia installed, and if you do it will take you directly to the
"Launch" screen.  You'll want to click on "Launch the course with sound" and
you're all set.

If you get any security warnings simply click "yes".

ENJOY!  Please call if you have any questions.
