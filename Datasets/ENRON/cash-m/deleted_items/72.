Dear  Michelle:
     We have set a meeting with Cristina Solomon and Liz Miller that I am assured is  set in stone.  It will take place tomorrow at 10am at Cristina's  office.  Can you attend?  I have given Cristina the agenda items so  that she and Liz can be prepared to answer all of our questions.   
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks
 
P.S.  Can you  have lunch this week with Laura Gibson and me?
