	Mike Golden is flexible after November 9, 2001 until the end of the year for his deposition.  I believe he was on the original second list requested by Hetzel; however, we have discussed noticing him ourselves.

	Marni Cosse is flexible after November 17, 2001 until the end of the year for her deposition.  She was originally included in the second list requested by Hetzel; however, Glover indicated to you he no longer wants to take her deposition but we may notice it.  This will be at our costs and Marnie is willing to come based on the representation that she can expense the flight as she is still employed until November 15, 2001 and I will take care of the hotel.

	Chad Beers is in the process of transferring to Houston and can be available any time.

	Michelle is checking with Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to round up the second list of requested deponents.
