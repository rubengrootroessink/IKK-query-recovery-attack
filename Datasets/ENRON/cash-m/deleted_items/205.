RYAN'S STEAK HOUSES' ARBITRATION PACT UNENFORCEABLE, APPEALS
COURT FINDS

The Seventh Circuit finds unenforceable an agreement
employees hired by Ryan's Family Steak House in Indiana were
required to sign with an arbitration service. The
obligations of Employment Dispute Services Inc. are so vague
and general that the agreement is unenforceable, the court
rules ("Penn v. Ryan's Family Steak Houses Inc., "7th Cir.,
No. 00-2355, 10/17/01).

 Judge Diane P. Wood finds the contract between Ryan's food
server Craig Penn and EDS was "hopelessly vague and
uncertain as to the obligation EDS has undertaken" and that
EDS "could fulfill its promise by providing Penn and Ryan's
with a coin toss." Finding the contract unenforceable, the
court affirms a district court's denial of Ryan's motion to
compel arbitration of Penn's claims of disability harassment
and retaliation.

 Penn worked as a food server at a Ryan's in Fort Wayne,
Ind., from 1996 until 1998 when he was fired. He filed a
suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act charging that
Ryan's maintained a hostile work environment and that he was
fired for complaining about harassment. When Penn was
initially hired by Ryan's, he was required to sign a
contract with EDS to have EDS provide an arbitration forum
for all employment-related disputes with Ryan's.  Relying on
Indiana law, the court says the contract between EDS and
Penn lacked mutuality of obligation and contained only an
"unascertainable, illusory promise" by EDS while placing
significant obligations on the employee. . . . Page AA-1,

COURT LIMITS SEX BIAS CLASS ACTION AGAINST BOEING TO SEATTLE
AREA

A federal judge in Washington state certifies a class of
some 30,000 female Boeing Co. employees who allege they were
discriminated against in job assignments, promotions,
training, retention, and bonuses ("Beck v. Boeing Co., "W.D.
Wash., No. C00-301P, 10/19/01).

The class of hourly employees--represented by the
International Association of Machinists--and nonexecutive,
salaried employees are employed at facilities in the Puget
Sound area of Washington. The plaintiffs had originally
sought to represent 42,000 workers nationwide, including
employees in St. Louis, Wichita, Kan., and Long Beach,
Calif., but Judge Pechman of the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Washington limits the class to improve
manageability, calling the sweep of the proposed class
"immense."

Boeing has been the subject of two other class actions
alleging bias by African American and Asian American
employees. In 1999, a court awarded $14.2 million to the
black plaintiffs, and the second suit is still pending. . .

NLRB RULES 2-1 ILLEGAL CONFIDENTIALITY RULE REQUIRES NEW
ELECTION

Freund Baking Co.'s maintenance of a personnel handbook
provision illegally barring employees from discussing wages,
hours, and other terms and conditions of employment requires
setting aside a representation election, National Labor
Relations Board rules 2-1 ("Freund Baking Co., "336 N.L.R.B.
No. 75, 10/1/01 [released 10/22/01]). Ordering that a third
election be held in the longrunning case, Members Truesdale
and Walsh agree with a hearing officer that employees could
reasonably interpret the confidentiality provision "as
prohibiting them from discussing their wages and working
conditions with a union, as well as with others outside of
the company." Going one step farther than the hearing
officer, the board finds the provision could reasonably be
construed as prohibiting workers from discussing terms and
conditions of employment with other employees.

Chairman Hurtgen agrees the handbook rule is illegal.
However, Hurtgen, finding no evidence that the rule was used
to punish employees' protected activities, asserts that
maintenance of the rule did not merit setting aside the
election. Local 119 of the Bakery, Confectionery, and
Tobacco Workers lost the second election by a 30-3 vote. . .

SIXTH CIRCUIT FINDS TVA NUCLEAR SECURITY WORKERS NOT EXEMPT
FROM FLSA

The Tennessee Valley Authority willfully violated the Fair
Labor Standards Act by denying overtime pay to 20 former
nuclear power security employees, the Sixth Circuit rules
("Ale v. TVA, "6th Cir., No. 99-6642, 10/17/01). Despite
having some supervisory duties, the workers could not be
fairly characterized as bona fide executive and
administrative employees exempt from the overtime
requirements of FLSA, the court decides.

The 20 former employees, who alleged TVA had eliminated
their right to overtime compensation, had worked in site
security offices at TVA's Watts Bar and Sequoyah nuclear
power plants. Regardless of TVA's position descriptions and
other paperwork, the employees' actual duties did not
support the exempt classification, the appeals court says.
"The words 'in charge' are not a magical incantation that
render an employee a bona fide executive regardless of his
actual duties," the appeals court adds. . . . Page A-3

DRIVER TAKING ANTI-SEIZURE MEDICINE NOT 'QUALIFIED' UNDER
ADA, COURT SAYS

A commercial truck driver who was terminated after his
employer discovered he was taking anti-seizure medication
and had a history of "seizures, fits, convulsions or
fainting" has no claim under the Americans with Disabilities
Act because he was not "qualified" for the job, the Tenth
Circuit decides ("Tate v. Farmland Industries Inc.", 10th
Cir., No. 99-6329, 10/10/01). The court says even if Charles
Tate could show he had a disability under the ADA, he could
not meet a Farmland Industries Inc. job requirement of
compliance with Department of Transportation certification
criteria. "We hesitate to second-guess a legitimate business
judgment on the part of DOT and its covered employers as to
the necessary qualifications of CMV operators," Judge
Baldock writes.

In dissent, Judge Briscoe argues Farmland admitted in
pretrial discovery that Tate was "qualified" as a truck
driver, and the company should not be allowed to argue the
contrary without withdrawing its earlier admission. Tate
should be able to pursue his claim because Farmland regarded
him as disabled and violated the ADA by firing him based on
that perception, Brisco adds. . . . Page A-4
