Per our conversation, I would appreciate your input on the questions from a legal perspective.  Thanks for your help.

Attached is the URL to test the questionnaire.  Please review the content for consistency.  I would like to complete any final changes today.  We will do our final/final walkthru at the hotel on Friday.   Once I clear the test responses, you will be live and will not want anyone going into the survey to play... 

Thanks...
