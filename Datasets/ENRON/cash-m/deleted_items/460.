I don't think the plan would call for an employee to withdraw from litigation to be eligible for benefits--just that the employee sign the waiver.  Then, I think that in the employee's lawsuit we'd argue that the waiver released the claims and that the claims should be dismissed.

Michelle, Lizzette;  is it our view that an employee who has subscribed to a class seeking certification would need to withdraw prior to executing the waiver?

I agree with Michelle.  I'm certain that the releases is designed to release such conduct.

I don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.

Terrie, Cole; I'm forwarding these to Michelle.  Michelle, my view:  1.  Employees who qualify to the 401K class, may exercise their rights without risking their severance.   The severance waiver is not a universal surrender of rights to bring claims.   Regards, Rj.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.
