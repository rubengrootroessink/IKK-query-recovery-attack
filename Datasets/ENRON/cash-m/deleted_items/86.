Michelle,

We offered an Employment Agreement to Claudio Ribeiro a few months back which he declined.  Mark Tawney and he have re-entered negotiations.  Mark wants to put in writing that we will compensate Claudio for the otherwise non-compensated 3 month non-compete period and offer him the same terms again.  Can I get a revised version from you this week? 

Thanks,
Dave
