Dave Maxey invited us to join him and Ann Marie at the opera on November 3 --

Tannh?user 
Opera in three acts
Music and libretto by Richard Wagner
Sung in German with English surtitles

He suggested doing the dinner first (starts around 5:30, he thinks) -- they have 4 Founders Box seats.  He also granted permission to leave earlier if the Wagner was too much to take after two acts.

I told him I did not know what we had on the schedule, and I would check with you.  Let's discuss when we visit next.
