MEMBERS:   Before you call me, READ NOTE BELOW....

Due to the overwhelming response to the "Texas Renaissance Festival" event, I am placing one more final order for tickets.   

I am NOT taking phone orders, so please don't call me.  If you want tickets, BRING ME A CHECK, made out to ENRON TRAVEL CLUB!

I have purchased 75 adult & 10 child tickets (tickets to arrive Friday 10/26).  I will sell these tickets on a First Come, First Serve basis!

Remember, members are limited to only 6 tickets per event, per year.

Donna is not placing the order; therefore, send all inquiries to Rose Rivera 3AC-761.
