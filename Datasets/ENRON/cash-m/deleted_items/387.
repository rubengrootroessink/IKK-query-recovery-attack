> The Department of State has advised that it is temporarily:
>
> 1) Suspending the on-line nonimmigrant visa appointment system and the 900
> number appointments for third country national (TCN) processing at border
> posts as of 11/16/01.  It appears that the suspension is across the board
> for all nationalities at the moment.
>
> 2) Notifying those with appointments to postpone their trip until the
> impact of the applicants' departure from the U.S. is confirmed with the
> INS.
>
> This action is the State Department's response to concerns that applicants
> at border posts have no way of knowing if 22 CFR 41.112(d) will still be
> applied to the supposed list of 26 countries whose nationals are subject
> to additional clearances, as reported in the press last week but treated
> as classified information by DOS.  Please note that more than the 26
> countries reported may be involved.
>
> According to DOS, the Visa Office will contact the INS today to follow up
> on the impact of the policy on applications for reentry into the U.S.
> after a visa application at a border post.  AILA is advocating that at
> least normal procedures apply.  Normal procedures would involve two trips
> to the consulate:  the first resulting in a 221(g) denial while clearance
> is pending. Then the applicant, if eligible, could return to the U.S.
> under 22 CFR 41.112(d). Once the clearance is completed, the applicant
> would then return to the consulate. At the moment, it is unclear whether
> this existing policy will apply and we have been warned that it may not.
> In light of this uncertainty, care must be taken that applicants are not
> stranded in Mexico or Canada.
>
> The DOS Visa Office also advises that it is increasing staff for
> revalidation of visas due to the increasing workload caused by this policy
> change and by the holidays.
