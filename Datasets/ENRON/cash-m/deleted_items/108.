Hi Diane, 
The attached files are Business Objects reports and should be converted to excel by Kathy Schultea.  Kathy should be adding the HR employees and then the files should go directly with Jeanneret.  No need to copy me on the files, due to confidentiality of HR data.  You can just let me know the files went.  Thanks.
