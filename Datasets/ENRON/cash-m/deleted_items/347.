Covinton & Burling were furnished with redacted Consulting Agreements (they specifically mentioned an E&Y agreement).  They need to get unredacted versions to determine what there obligations would be going forward.  Could you give me copies to supply them with.  I will need to make copies for the data room.  We may not leave them in there, but need to have copies for serious parties going forward.  Thanks.
