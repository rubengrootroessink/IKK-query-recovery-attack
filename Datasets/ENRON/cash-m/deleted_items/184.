Alice:

We need to change the header on the invoices you are forwarding to Michelle Cash.  Beginning immediately, the invoices should be addressed as follows:

Company Name   - Codes
Margaret Daffin, EID # 10004155
c/o Michelle Cash
P. O. Box 4734
Houston, Texas 77210-4734

Margaret will be reviewing and coding these invoices.  Michelle will provide a second review and approval on an as-needed basis.

Thanks for all your help.  I have enjoyed working with you.
