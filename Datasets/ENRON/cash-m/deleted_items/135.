Jeanie,

In response to your inquiry about  the above referenced non-solicitation provisions, I note as follows: The provisions are contained in the Employee Matters Agreement executed by Enron and AEP. HR should have a copy of this agreement.....if you need a copy please let me know.  The relevant provision is Section 1,subsection (c).  This is basically a 12 month mutual non-solicitation running from June 1, 2001. It is quite complex and factually driven.  In order to provide the requested legal advice I would need to personally discuss all of the surrounding facts with the ENA client who is contemplating  hiring an AEP/HPL employee.  Please ask that person to give me a call so that I may make the inquiries necessary to give appropriate legal advice. Of course, if you desire to join in the call , a conference call among the 3 of us would be welcomed.

 When you called me you mentioned that the client was quite sure that any non-solicitation restriction lasted only  a 6 months. Thus,  this note is merely a heads-up on the length of the non-solicitation period .  Please call me with any questions that you might have. Since you informed me that are new to Enron, I wanted you to make sure that you  were aware that it is Enron's policy that interpretation of legal agreements must be done by or on connection with an Enron lawyer, be it Michelle Cash (our ENA  lawyer who handles HR matters) or the ENA lawyer who worked on the transaction at issue.

I look forward to having the opportunity to meet you and hopefully working with you at some point.

Best Regards
Barbara
