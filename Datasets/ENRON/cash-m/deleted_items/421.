Ladies, 

I failed to mention that we have paperwork pending signature, waiting on a response.  If a quick response of continue "as is for now" works for me.

Michelle, 

On the INS forms, there are two places which refer to: 

Gross Annual Income:    $100 billion 
Net Annual Income:              $979 million            


Currently when Tindall & Foster are completing the forms they use our annual report to complete these.  Would you advise if we should revised these with the recent events and include the appropriate statement/restatement with the annual report we submit?  Or continue utilizing only the annual reports and the figures held within?

Thank you.
