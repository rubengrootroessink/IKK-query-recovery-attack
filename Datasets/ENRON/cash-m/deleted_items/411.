Michelle and Steve,
Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review?  This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago.

Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay?  Can you please let me know?  Thanks so much.

Regards,
Sandra
