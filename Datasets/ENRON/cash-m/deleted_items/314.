I hate to keep bugging you, but I wondered if you had a readout of Bonnie's investigation?  It is not getting better here with Jonathan.  I  called his agency to alert them to some of the issues we discussed (i.e. taking long breaks and leaving the office for appointments outside of his job).  I suspect they have spoken to him because now we are getting emails every time he leaves his desk and every time he returns.  

I would, more than anything, like to replace him before we get into the thick of the PRC process, and I am anxious to know what the outcome of the inquiry is so that I may consider options.   

Thanks in advance, 
Gina

Valeria returned my call and informed me that Bonnie Castellano is working with Jonathan Lane.  Bonnie is out until Monday; I will speak with her then.
