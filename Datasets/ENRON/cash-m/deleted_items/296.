DVDs would be good.  I got him the Godfather Trilogy, but you might consider other movies.  
He has Playstation 2, so games are a good idea.
He always likes short-sleeved, solid color polo shirts in size XL.
His Rice Owls baseball cap got mutilated when the baggage cart ran over his suitcase, so he could use a replacement.
Anything with the 40 theme would be fun.

Hope those ideas help.

Michelle
