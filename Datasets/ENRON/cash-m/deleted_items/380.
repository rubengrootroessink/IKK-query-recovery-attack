Valeria/Michelle -  Chevondra was offered a 30-day trail period working for Dale Neuner and if she was successful in her efforts, then she would have an option to officially transfer to Dale's department.  The trial period was complete as of November 15th and Dale has contacted EGM HR requesting the transfer of Chevondra into his group.

However, there was a contingency in Chevondra's transfer.  She was to sign a promissory note (for outstanding personal calls on a company cell phone), as well as return the company cell phone.  Shanna and I are unaware of  the cell phone or the signed promissory note being returned at this time. 

Could you please provide the recommended next steps?
