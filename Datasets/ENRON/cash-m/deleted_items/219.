Looks like Cameron is too young for the holiday camp -- too bad!

Dear Kidventure Family,

We hope everyone is doing great!  Believe it or not, the holidays are
just around the corner and this means Holiday Camp is too!  Winter in
Texas is the theme this year and we want to see everyone for this "cool"
event.

Attatched to this email is the brochure for Holiday Camp.  Registration
will begin at 12 noon on Monday October 29th and will remain open until
all spaces have been reserved. Simply log on to kidventurecamp.com or
call the office at 713.960.8989. You will have the option of selecting
all days or individual ones!

The camp will be highlighted by Kidventure's 2nd Annual Mt. Venture snow
day with sledding, snowman contest and much more.  Earlier in the week
campers will be part of teams that will design and build bobsleds to be
raced on Mt. Venture.  So break out the mittens and ear-muffs and join
us for this most memorable holiday event.


Kidventure Team
