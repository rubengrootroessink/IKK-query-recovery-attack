Thank you for the update.  We will change on the future billing.

We have a batch of final bills that will go out in a few days.  Can we leave
your name on them and send them to Margaret?  Or will that create too much
confusion?

(Sorry to hear that you are leaving!  You've done a wonderful job.)

Importance: High


Alice:

We need to change the header on the invoices you are forwarding to
Michelle Cash.  Beginning immediately, the invoices should be addressed
as follows:

Company Name   - Codes
Margaret Daffin, EID # 10004155
c/o Michelle Cash
P. O. Box 4734
Houston, Texas 77210-4734

Margaret will be reviewing and coding these invoices.  Michelle will
provide a second review and approval on an as-needed basis.

Thanks for all your help.  I have enjoyed working with you.
