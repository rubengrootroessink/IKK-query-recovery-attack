14th Court Extends Deadly Weapon Finding
Texas Lawyer
Houston's 14th Court of Appeals may have handed prosecutors another
plea bargaining tool on Oct. 11 when it upheld a jury's finding
that a man found guilty of failing to stop and render aid used a
"deadly weapon" in the commission of the offense. In a 2-1
decision, the court held in Cates v. Texas that a rational jury
could conclude from the evidence that Johnny Weldon Cates II
operated his pickup truck in a manner capable of causing death or
serious injury when he left the scene of a fatal accident that he
caused.

The now-repealed provision of 42 U.S.C. ?1437f(e) requiring that
public housing authorities make assistance payments only to those
property owners who keep public housing "decent, safe, and
sanitary" neither displays Congressional intent to create a private
right of action nor creates a federal right that is judicially
enforceable through 42 U.S.C. ?1983. 5th Cir. No. 00-11160; Posted

HEALTH LAW - GOOD SAMARITAN
Ramirez v. McIntyre
A doctor falls within the protection of the Good Samaritan statute
only if he or she would not customarily receive remuneration for
the services performed and would not legally be entitled to

protection waives or elects not to charge for the medical
assistance. Austin Court of Appeals, No. 03-01-00027-CV; Posted

CRIMINAL LAW - INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL
Blount v. State
In a case alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the court's
review of counsel's representation is highly deferential; the fact
that another attorney, even the defendant's own attorney on

necessarily indicate ineffective assistance. Texarkana Court of
