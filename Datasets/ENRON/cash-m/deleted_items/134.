This is a good news/bad news message:

	Good:	Robert Jones will buy pizza for the 		group!!! Yea...

	Bad:	Jack is starting a 2-week trial on Nov. 		5 and won't be available 11/8 or 11/15 		-- the proposed dates for his 			presentation.
I know you want to avoid the rest of November because of holidays and PRC.  Do you want me to schedule him for early January?

Let me now....
