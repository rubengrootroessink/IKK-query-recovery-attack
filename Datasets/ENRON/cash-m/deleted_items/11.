I like that idea.  How about going down to Director level?  I have started maintaining a list of people who have expressed an interest in diversity regardless of gender or ethnicity and will also include their names.

Andrea, I appreciate your protection!  Why not give them the names of several individuals who would be supportive of those events, including Hispanic VPs as well as others who have expressed an interest in diversity initiatives.  Plus, you could include some people who are not VPs per se, but may be attorneys (Coralina Rivera comes to mind) or other fairly senior level personnel.  That way, you are not necessarily revealing the diverstiy information, but are providing them with a great set of resources.
 
Do you think that will work?  If not, then I wouldn't have too much heartburn about giving them the names.  I just think that the prior approach would be better.
 
Michelle

Hi Michelle, 
I had a meeting today with Kelly Kimberly, Misha Siegal, Calvin Eakin, Jennifer Medcalf, Lauren Iannarone to share information about diversity initiatives.  There are several Hispanic events where GSS would like to invite representation at the senior level along with key vendors and the only person they are aware of is Dennis Vegas.  I was asked to identify senior level hispanics so that the invitations can be extended to them.  I came up with 12 hispanic VP's.  Can I share those names with GSS?  I would actually like to have a few guidelines on what to share and what not to share.  I'm pretty protective of HR information, but want to be extra cautious. 

Thanks... ay
