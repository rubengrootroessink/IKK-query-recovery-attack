Michelle -

Kim and I will be speaking with Jubran at 4:00 pm today.  If it is OK, I would like to offer COBRA costs of $7500 gross (current expenses for benefits are about $700).  Is this OK?

Also, with regards to section 5.3 of this agreement, can we add a clause that says he will be compensated for his time if needed to assist with litigation issues.....not sure if we have done this in the past, however, he has raised this as a concern.

Thanks!
Amy
