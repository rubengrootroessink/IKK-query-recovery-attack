Big Texas Law Firm Settling With Victims of Swindlers
The Associated Press
A major Texas law firm that once served President Bush is paying
millions of dollars to settle claims the firm was complicit in
fraud perpetrated by two of its clients. Locke Liddell & Sapp has
paid $30.5 million in the past two years to settle class-action
lawsuits by investors in enterprises run by convicted swindlers
Brian Russell Stearns and Russell Erxleben. The deals turned out to
be elaborate Ponzi schemes.

GOVERNMENT LAW - REDISTRICTING
In Re: Perry
Legislative immunity applies to the activities of the Legislative
Redistricting Board members and their aides in developing a
redistricting plan; there could be a circumstance, albeit
extraordinary, that might constrict the grant of legislative
immunity when, as in this case, a plaintiff alleges that the action
violates the Equal Protection Clause, plaintiffs have articulated
no basis for restricting legislative immunity in this case. Supreme
Court of Texas, No. 01-0979; Posted October 17, 2001.
