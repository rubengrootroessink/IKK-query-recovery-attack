I'll schedule the meeting after we get data from Kathy Schultea and we know it's in a workable format for Dick Jeanerret. Kathy said data would get to us today.

Thanks, Kathy!

Diane, would you please ask Dick to make sure that he can work with the files.  Once he has done that, let's set up a meeting with him, Jeff Donahue, Andrea, you, and me to discuss approach.  Kathy, do you think you need to attend? Dick can be in person or on the phone, although an in-person meeting may be preferable.

Thanks!

Michelle

Hi Diane, 
The attached files are Business Objects reports and should be converted to excel by Kathy Schultea.  Kathy should be adding the HR employees and then the files should go directly with Jeanneret.  No need to copy me on the files, due to confidentiality of HR data.  You can just let me know the files went.  Thanks.
