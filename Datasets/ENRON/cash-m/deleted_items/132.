Hi Michelle! See my note to Janet below... could I have this guy call you, or is there someone in your group that he could call? I greatly appreciate it!

Michelle Cash, a lawyer in our group, coordinates our recruiting.  If she can't do it, I would be certainly be happy to chat with him over the phone about it.
Hope all is well.

I worked with someone on a project that APQC did for us, and he is now looking for a new opportunity (just our of law school). I let him know that Enron doesn't typically hire right out of law school, but was wondering if there might be someone he could talk to about "a day in the life of a corporate lawyer."  Is there someone in particular who handles recruiting for legal?

Thanks for your help!

Missy
