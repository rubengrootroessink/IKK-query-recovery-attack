Hello Angela,

We are happy to inform you that you have met our qualifications and we are offering you a position with our company!
You will also be excited to know that we are going to compensate you not just for your efforts, but also on the efforts of each former Enron employee that you PERSONALLY assist in finding placement with our company!

As an additional bonus you will receive 2%-8% personal residual income for each customer you personally refer to our services, allowing you to over-ride the entire energy market in Texas, and that's just the beginning! There are additional bonuses in our compensation plan of which will be explained to you.

Angela, If you do not believe in GOD, you should start believing NOW! The magnitude of being able to essentially transfer companies along with your former employees can only be considered an ACT OF GOD.

This is a ONCE IN A LIFETIME opportunity to continue to work with the people you know and love, and NOT be affected economically by your recent layoff.

YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT.
We HIGHLY urge you to take advantage of this remarkable opportunity.

We will be hosting a special training Saturday, December 15th. The location of this spectacular event will be the Renaissance Hotel, 6 Greenway Plaza East.

Please meet your escorts in the hotel lobby by 9:45 a.m. as we will begin promptly at 10:00 a.m. Your personal hosts will be Mr. Jared Radden and Ms. Rachel Blake.

Our goal is for you to help us make this one of the most successful and memorable events in history, to be known as a "Weekend To Remember"!

If there are any further questions, please address them by e-mail.
That address is: timedecision@acninc.net


Welcome aboard, and we look forward to seeing you OVER the top!

Thanks,


Jared Radden
