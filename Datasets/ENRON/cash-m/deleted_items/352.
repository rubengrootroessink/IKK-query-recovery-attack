Michelle: 
There are a couple of blanks that we need filled in in this petition.  First, where is EGM incorporated?  We listed EGM as the plaintiff because that is the entity that was the party to the contract with McGowan.  Second, we need a last known address for McGowan.  We do not have that information from the documents you sent us. Thanks.
