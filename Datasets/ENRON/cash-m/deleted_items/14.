Hi Kriste,

Some 'light' reading for you?

For some background, I've attached a memo that Enron Metals North America sent out to our staff on Friday.  We sent it out under the cover of our lead commercial and lead commercial support execs.  It is an acknowledgement and response to a memo sent out by the CEO and COO of EEL announcing their voluntary redundancy program.

 

Further to the memo, my colleagues in London HR have forwarded additional details on how the program will work in London.  These next four attachments contain general information about the program that can also be found on the EEL intranet site.

General information Application for VR VR Q&A UK VR Calculation 


EEL plans on running the VR Program for 2 weeks starting today.  Following this 2 week program, they will then start a compulsory redundancy program with payout under the statutory requirements.  In preparation for this, each business unit will need to follow a selection process within each group to identify key employees.
Here in North America, we are going through the same selection process.  Attached is the selection guide and an example spreadsheets we are using.  

    

As much as we can, we want to offer a voluntary program in the US as well.  Doing so will help us send a unified global message within EEL; US employees will not be treated any different then their London colleagues.  However, as I noted in our telecon, our current involuntary severance is quite generous already and I can't imagine padding it even more.  I ran a quick calculation and based on the yrs of service employees carried over form MG, over 75% of our North America staff would eligible for over 4 months of severance.  There is a long history of tenure in Metals and the average time of service is 7 yrs.

Seems the selection process and criteria would also work for us in the US, as long as we apply it consistently, but I would welcome your thoughts.

Once you've had a chance to review it, please call me and we can discuss it further.

Thanks
Cathy

Cathy, I think realistically we need to be ready to run for a week today - just in case.

Let me know what you need from me.

I have spoken to Cathy and she has gone through most of the documents, she is passing them by legal and has done some basic calculations to ascertain whether it would be attractive to her employee base. 

Cathy will also try and get Philip and Marcello to look at the criteria to see if that works for their population before they come over here.  I think Cathy will be ready as soon as she needs to be.
