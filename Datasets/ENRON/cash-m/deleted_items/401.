Yes, Terrie James will coordinate that effort. 

 I am, however, working with Simone Lewis to coordinate the publication of the immigration Q&As on Livelink.  I am hopeful that this information will be published today by 1:30 p.m.   Simone will send an e-mail to the HR Generalists informing them that the information is available on Livelink.  Thanks, Cole.

Cole:  will all employees be notified that there will be an update to the Q&A's, as I believe it is important to do so?
Many thanks

Terrie, the attached immigration Q&As are ready to go for final publication and posting.  I am also submitting these Q&As for publication on Livelink.  Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.  Thanks, Cole.
