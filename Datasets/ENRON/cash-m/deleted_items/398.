Hi Michelle,
 
Thanks for the fyi, however the Service Center doesn't generate our documents for us.  In fact, due to the distance, they provide us support on an as needed basis, but what I will do is make sure we get all current documents from Irma so that we can make sure we are using the right versions.
 
 
 
Thanks
Cathy

Cathy, Unless there is something unusual about this situation, I think that the service center can do these documents, as they are standard.  We generally don't do termination letters here in legal unless there is a change to the form or something really sensitive.  So, no need to wait on us!  Just get with Irma's team.  Michelle

Twanda, 
Cathy is terminating this employee on Monday.  Need a current term letter and waiver.  Please prep for my review. 
Cathy, 
It would be a help if you could hold off until Monday afternoon to do communicate the termination.  We'll e-mail you the docs, and I can initial the waiver once she's returned it but before the Company signs.

Hi Lizzette, 
Just want to make sure I'm using the current term letter for performance term.  I also need to get the Waiver referenced in the attached.  Can you please forward this to me?
Thanks 
Cathy
