Thanks for the info.  Hope I don't have to bug you.  
 
Watch out for the drink special of the day; you get a fancy flourescent drink glass, a paper umbrella, and cheap refills!
 
Happy Thanksgiving,
Lizzette

As you know, I leave tomorrow for a cruise to Mexico with my family.  I will be working from home in the morning (713-218-7155 or on my cell at  713-302-5522).  The ship does not depart until about 6, so my cell should work in the afternoon.

While on board, I can be reached on ship-to-shore.  The cost is $9.50 per minute.  The number is 1-877-225-7447.  You must haven the ship's name (Celebration) when you call.

I return to Galveston at 8 am on Saturday the 24th. 

Thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving! 

Michelle
