Last week Teresa was waiting to hear back from Aaron (sp) regarding the threshold and process for approval. Michelle, Tom Kalb and I have a meeting this aft with Nutech and we all , including John Thompson per his meeting request last week, need to know the steps if any that we need to take on Nutech and similar matters.Michelle/Teresa, appreciate your advice on how best to track this down.
