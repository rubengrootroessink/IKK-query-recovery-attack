Alison,
The employment agreements for the Japan employees state in the vesting schedule [for the stock options granted as a signing bonus]:
vesting for the options will be as follows:
-One third on the first anniversary of date of employment
-A further third on the second anniversary date of employment
-The final third on the third anniversary date of employment

The options can not vest on the anniversary of the date of employment, rather it is supposed to vest on the anniversary of date of grant.
Michelle,
Correct me if I am wrong--we can still go ahead and grant these for the November 1 grant date, but we need to get an amendment to change that wording.
Thank you
Dana Bryant
