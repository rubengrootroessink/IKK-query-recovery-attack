Court Turns Back Employees' Stock Option Suit
Texas Lawyer
Reversing a 1st Court of Appeals decision, the Texas Supreme Court
held on Oct. 18 that former employees of a Monsanto Co. subsidiary
lost the right to buy company stock at favorable stock-option
prices after Monsanto sold the subsidiary where they worked. The
Houston court ruled unanimously in Monsanto Co. v. Kamel Boustany,
et al. that Monsanto's sale of Fisher Controls International Inc.
to Emerson Electric Co. in 1992 resulted in the termination of
Fisher employees, making them ineligible to buy Monsanto stock at a
price less than half the going rate.
