Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

    If you need any other info, please contact me:  (281)872-1197 Home
