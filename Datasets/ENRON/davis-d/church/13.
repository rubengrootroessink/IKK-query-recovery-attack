Dear Dana,
?
Thank you so much for that inspirational story and  poem. I really needed to 
correct my spiritual perspective today and the Lord  blessed me with a word. 
I had been focusing so much on my own situation, (which  in the scheme of 
things is not that bad) that I lost sight of how greatly I have  been blessed.
?
Scripture says that all things (situations) in  Christ work together for the 
good for those who believe and are called to his  purpose.? I truly believe 
that,?and  have faith that God is working out everything for me.? 
?
We really have not had an opportunity to talk and  really get to know one 
another, but I feel that we are already connected in the  spirit.? I 
appreciate your prayers.? I appreciate you as my sister in  Christ.
?
Well, I'd better go now.? May God continue to  bless you and your family in a 
mighty way.? Hope to see you at Powertime  tonight!!!!!!
?
Love Ya,
?
Betty
