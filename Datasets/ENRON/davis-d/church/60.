I just wanted to inform you that the web site for Veterans has been updated  
and changed some. ?I ask that you would visit the site  
????? 
??????www.veteransmemorialumc.homestead.com/veterans.html 

I encourage any suggestions or comments on how we may be able to improve the  
site. ?The second page is still under construction, so it is not completely  
finished. 

God Bless
