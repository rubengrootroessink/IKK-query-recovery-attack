Dana,

     All I know is take 45 south to Galveston.  Take the first(61 st) exit
(you will see the sign for Moody Gardens).  Turn right at the light.  Take
it all the way to the Seawall Blvd (which is the acutal seawall).  Turn left
on the Seawall.  It will down on your left hand side.  The Galveston Hilton
Resort and Conference Center  5400 Seawall Blvd.

Denise

Morning -
     Would you mind terribly, taking a few minutes to jot down a brief set
of directions to our retreat in Galveston please, sweetie, little kitty?

Thank you!
