       Fruits Of The Spirit
        Max Lucado)

       It's quiet. It's early. My coffee is hot. The sky is still black. The
 world is still asleep. The day is coming.

       In a few moments the day will arrive. It will roar down the track with
 the rising of the sun. The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for the
 noise of the day. The calm of the solitude will be replaced by the pounding
 pace of the human race. The refuge of the early morning will be invaded by
 decisions to be made and deadlines to be met.

       For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands. It
 is now that I must make a choice. Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose.
 And so I choose.

       I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrants
 bitterness, I choose love. Today I will love God and what God loves.

       I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance. I
 will refuse the temptation to be cynical...the tool of the lazy thinker. I
 will refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created by
 God. I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunity
 to see God.

       I choose peace... I will live forgiven. I will forgive so that I may
 live.

       I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.
 Instead of cursing the one who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.
 Rather than complaining that the wait is too long, I will thank God for a
 moment to pray. Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will face
 them with joy and courage.

       I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.
 Kind to the rich, for they are afraid. And kind to the unkind, for such is
 how God has treated me.

       I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take a
 dishonest one. I will be overlooked before I will boast. I will confess
 before I will accuse. I choose goodness.

       I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises. My debtors
 will not regret their trust. My associates will not question my word. My
 wife will not question my love. And my children will never fear that their
 father will not come home.

       I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.
 If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be
 only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.

       I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being. After this body is
 dead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.
 I choose self-control. I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassioned
 only by my faith. I will be influenced only by God. I will be taught only by
 Christ. I choose self-control.

       Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 gentleness, and self-control. To these I commit my day. If I succeed, I will
 give thanks. If I fail, I will seek His grace. And then when this day is
 done, I will place my head on my pillow and rest. >>
