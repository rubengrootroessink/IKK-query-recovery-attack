: )  I couldn't resist.  Attached to this email is a Word document that lists 
all the MOP members names, addresses and phone #'s.  I plan to revise it more 
with email addresses and alternate/emergency phone #'s but for now will you 
help me fill in the blanks where possible?  Later, if every one approves, we 
can distribute this.  Let me know what you think.

Lots of Love for my sister in Christ.

Dana
