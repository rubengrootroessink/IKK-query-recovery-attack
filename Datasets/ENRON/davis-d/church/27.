All,

      Here is the information on the blue jean shirts.  The exact price is
as follows:

M - XL         $22.65
XXL             $23.90
XXXL           $25.15

Please turn in your money to me as soon as possible.  The total for all the
shirts we have ordered is $551.  I have already made arrangements to pay for
half up front, due to such a high dollar order.

Pass the word on to those not on e-mail (Evelyn Morris, Evelyn Jackson, Nina
Nazir-ud-Din, Pamela Watts, Annette Richardson, Georgia Gillum, Danise
Johnson, Jackie Stewart, Marylyn Green, Ethel Ford, Cheryl Sumbler, and
Cheryl Curry). We need to try and have the money by Powertime on Wednesday.
If you need an accomodation, please let me know.

If you know of anyone else wanting a shirt, please get with me as soon as
possible.  I thought maybe the following might want a shirt (Rev Jacque,
Bobbie Poledore, Katherine Dailey, Valerie Piper).  It would be nice if all
women had one.

Also, thank Joe Stewart when you see him, for making all the arrangements
for us.

Thanks,
Denise
