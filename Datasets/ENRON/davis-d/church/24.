Hi Betty -
Hope this little note finds you doing well.  Didn't we have a wonderful time 
of fellowship last night.?  Claudette had such a fresh anointing on her.  She 
spoke so beautifully.

Listen, I have your email adress but not your phone #.  Is the some reason 
other than the fact that I've never asked?  You can reach me @ any of these 
#'s...
