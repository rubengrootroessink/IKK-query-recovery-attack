Yes, close will take priority.  That is a free time job.  Thanks for the update.

Subject:	Question

Is it OK that I let entries take priority over those documents that you wanted me to hole punch and place in binders for you?  I thought I could do it for sure today and I still might be able too but I want to make sure that I don't fall behind on the entries.  Is that OK?  Oh yeah, Brad and Lisa Kang had me working on projects for them Friday and Monday.
