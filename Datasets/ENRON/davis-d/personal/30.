Dana,

Mike wants a copy of the 4Q Reval book so let's keep his name on the distribution list.
We'll take his name out for this quarter.

Can you also do me a favor?
Do you mind inserting another column next to the "Location" and list the extension of each person?
Since I am not familiar with the people, it will help me greatly to know their extension.
Once it is done, please e-mail me the list.
This is not urgent so you can do this whenever you are free.

Thanks,
Lisa
