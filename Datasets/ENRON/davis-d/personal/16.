Since you will be on vacation or training on that day, please make sure that you are all packed and ready to go on 3/21 (LK, TB) and 3/22 (SR, BS).  I will order some moving boxes to have on hand, just in case anyone wants to get a jumpstart on packing.  Also please let Dana and Rufino know if you have items that will require archiving as soon as possible.

Nicole Mendez
