The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has received recommendations from you, our eHRonline users, on ways we might improve the time entry process as it relates to holiday pay.  Based upon these suggestions, the ISC is implementing a new time entry process to record holiday time, which is effective immediately, beginning with the February 16-28, 2001, time-entry period.  

Holiday pay for all eligible employees must be entered as "Company Observed Holiday", and the recent company-observed holiday of President's Day (Monday, February 19, 2001) must be coded "Company Observed Holiday".  However, if you're an employee who works a 12-hour shift schedule, there are no changes to your time entry process for Holiday pay.  Please continue to record your holiday time in the usual manner.

If you're a salaried, non-exempt employee and you work a holiday, you must enter "Company Observed Holiday" for that holiday and enter "Regular Work Time" for all hours worked on the holiday to ensure proper payment of overtime for the day.  

Discretionary holiday time has been limited to eight (8) hours for all eligible employees, per the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation (<http://hrweb.enron.com/policyandprocedure/docs/12-hours.pdf>).   eHRonline will not allow you to record more than eight (8) hours per calendar year under the "Discretionary Holiday" time-entry code.  

Detailed instructions on coding holiday time are available within SAP eHRonline Process Bulletin HR -01-04, which can be accesed through the following link:  http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=145.

If you have questions regarding this new eHRonline functionality, please contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4SAP (4727).  Questions about the Enron Policy on Work Hours/Holidays/Vacation should be directed to your Human Resources representative.

Thank you.
