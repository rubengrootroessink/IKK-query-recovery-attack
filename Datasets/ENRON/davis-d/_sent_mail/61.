Dana, If you need help preparing for the trip please let me know.
As far as the hair thing I have to have mine done tonight for sure,
tomorrow is bible study, Thursday Chanel has a class, she'll already
miss Saturday because they will be out of town, so if you can't do it for me
let me know
believe me I understand. It's just convenient because you're right there,
plus those lil-nubs
do a wondrous job. Oh! please let me have a copy of the directions for
back-up just in case
we'll have an extra one. Please advise :>

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am
also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.
