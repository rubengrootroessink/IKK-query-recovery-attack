Hey Pat -

I have to look for the 49,317.37 but the 460,060.97 will be in the mail 
Tuesday.  Is that good?

Hey, Dana - 

I hope your Friday is going well.  When you have a chance on Tuesday, can you 
tell me if these have come across your desk yet?  I think the $460k was wired 
on Wed, 2/14.

Thanks for your help.  Have a nice holiday weekend!
