I don't see that icon, but I don't really know what I'm looking for.

Thanks!  I will be placing it on the calendar.  Do you have the icon on your 
Lotus Notes workspace desktop?  It's the  "Merchant Finance on ECTHOU_..." 
icon.

That should be fine.  Just let us know for sure when you know.

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?
