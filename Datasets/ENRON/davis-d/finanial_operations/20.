Green Garden Grass snakes can be dangerous, Yes, grass snakes, not
rattlesnakes.

A couple in Sweetwater, Texas had a lot of potted plants, and during a
recent cold spell, the wife was bringing in a lot of them indoors to
protect them from a possible freeze.

It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of
the plants and when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it
go under the sofa.

She let out a very loud scream. The husband who was taking a shower ran out
into the living room naked to see what the problem was.  She told him there
was a snake under the sofa. He got down on the floor on his hands and knees
to look for it.

About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him in the butt.

He thought the snake had bitten him, so he fainted.

His wife thought he had a heart attack, so she called an ambulance. The
attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying
him out. About that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the
Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher.

That's when the man broke his leg and why he is in the hospital.

The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on
a neighbor man. He volunteered to capture the snake.

He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the
couch. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the
sofa in relief. But in relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions,
where she felt the snake wriggling around.

She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa, and the
neighbor man seeing her laying there passed out tried to use CPR to revive
her.

The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery
store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband
in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and
cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches. An ambulance was
again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization.

The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying
on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that he had
been bitten by the snake. She went to the kitchen, brought back a small
bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.

By now the police had arrived. They saw the unconscious man, smelled the
whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred.

They were about to arrest them all, when the two women tried to explain how
it all happened over a little green snake. They called an ambulance, which
took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.

Just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch, One of the
policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg
of the end table that was on one side of the sofa.

The table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke, it
started a fire in the drapes. The other policeman tried to beat out the
flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog,
who startled, jumped up and raced out into the street,  where an oncoming
car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it
on fire.

Meanwhile the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house
was blazing. Neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving
fire-truck had started raising his ladder as they were halfway down the
street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and put out the
electricity and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area.


Time passed -----------------


Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was re-built,

The police acquired a new car, and all was right with their world

-------

About a year later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a
cold snap for that night. The husband asked his wife if  she thought they
should bring in their plants for the night.

She shot him.
