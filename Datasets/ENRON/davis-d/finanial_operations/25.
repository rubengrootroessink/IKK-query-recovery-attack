Hold off on pulling together this information.  I need to have several 
clarifying questions answered by AA and also to sit down with Dana tomorrow 
to see if she can help me with most of the exercise.  I will need all of you 
to fill in any potential gaps and verify the information I pull together 
before I submit it to AA.

Thanks,

Brad

Mike-

We would greatly appreciate it if you could please see to it that we obtain 
the wire transfer and requests for all investments entered into during FY00.  
Please note that on a go-forward basis we would like to obtain this 
information when we receive an investment's DASH.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.


Thanks,

Kristi
