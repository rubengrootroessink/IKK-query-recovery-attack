Dana,

Hi.  How are you?  Just checking on the status of your conference
registration.  The balance is now due.  If you are staying the night the
balance is $70.  If you are commuting the balance is $15.  Please let me
know which one it is.  Just a reminder that the conference is Oct. 19 to 21.

Be Blessed,
Denise I. Moore
