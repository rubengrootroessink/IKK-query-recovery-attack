> Good Morning,
>
> I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a
> prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building
> Fund committee meeting last night. (As shared with me by our First Lady,
> Edith Wallace).
>
> Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that
> God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated
> that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to
> listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel
and
> follow the man of God.
>
> He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and
> pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone
> be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily.
>
> This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the
> church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to
> get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has
> gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order.
>
> God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing.
> Please forward this information to as many people with contact information
> before Sunday. Because this is something that we as a people can begin
> doing today and share the Word with the congregation on Sunday.
>
> Have a wonderful God Blessed Day,
> Denise
