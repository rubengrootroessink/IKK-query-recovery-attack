A judge was interviewing a woman about her pending divorce. He sat her
>down in his office and asked, "Now, what are your grounds?"
>
>She replied, "About two acres, and a nice little house in the middle and
>a stream running by."
>
>"No," he said, "I mean what is the foundation of this case?" "It's made
>of concrete, brick and mortar," she responded.
>
>"I mean," he said, "What are your relations like?" The woman said, "I
>have an aunt and an uncle living here in town, and my husband's
>parents."
>
>Becoming frustrated, the judge said, "Do you have a real grudge?" "No,"
>she replied, "Just a two-car carport."
>
>"Ma'am," he tried again, "Is there fidelity in your marriage?" "Well,
>both my son and daughter have stereos," she replied. "Though we don't
>really like that noise they call music."
>
>The judge sighed. "Ma'am, does your husband ever beat you up?" "Yes,"
>she responded, "About three times a week he gets up before me and makes
>breakfast."
>
>Finally, in frustration, the judge asked, "Lady, why do you want a
>divorce?"
>
>"Oh, I don't want a divorce," she replied. "I never wanted one. My
>husband does. He said he can't communicate with me!!!"
