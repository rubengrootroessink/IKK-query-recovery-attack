Subject:	Global Contracts/Facilities new responsibilities

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey
