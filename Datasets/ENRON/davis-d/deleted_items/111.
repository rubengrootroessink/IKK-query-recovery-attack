   It's good to see a little American humor again........ 
 
   "We are getting more and more insight into the life of Osama bin Laden. 
   Today the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States said that bin 
Laden 
   had an unhappy childhood growing up, 52 brothers and sisters. 
   You think his childhood was unhappy, wait 'til we deliver his mid-life 
   crisis." 
   Jay Leno 
 
   "It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has 50 brothers and sisters. 
   Which absolutely shocked me because I had no idea he was Catholic" Conan 
   O'Brien 
 
   "You read about all these terrorists, most of them came here legally, but 
   they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. 
   Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you are two days late with a video and 
   these people are all over you. Let's put Blockbuster in charge of 
   immigration." Jay Leno 
 
   "The Taliban has asked Osama bin Laden to voluntarily leave the country. 
   They said they delivered him a note asking him to leave, which is a pretty 
   good trick considering they claim they don't even know where he is." Jay 
   Leno 
 
   "I read in the paper today this bin Laden guy is the wealthiest guy in 
   Afghanistan. That's when you know your government is no good, when the 
   wealthiest guy in the country lives in a cave." Jay Leno 
 
   "There are reports on the news tonight that members of the Taliban feel 
   persecuted and fear their own safety. So now they know what it is like to 
   feel like a woman in their country." Jay Leno 
 
   "There was a rumor that Jesse Jackson was going to go over there to talk 
   with the Taliban, apparently they were having trouble rhyming the word 
   Jihad." Jay Leno 
 
   "U.S. Government has said they are now going to go after the terrorist's 
   electronic banking system. You know what they should do? They should 
   transfer bin Laden's funds to my bank. They'd mess up his deposits, screw 
   up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with service charges." 
   Jay Leno 
 
   "More and more details coming out now about spoiled rich kid Usama bin 
   Laden. Time reports this week he was one of 52 kids. Mother must be 
   exhausted. This guy inherited $80 million at age 13 and has since expanded 
   it to $300 million through construction, smart investments and gas and oil 
   investments. This way, he can use the money in his war against 
capitalism." 
   Jay Leno 
 
   "The leaders of the Taliban said today that killing bin Laden won't solve 
   the problem. But, you know, it couldn't hurt." Jay Leno 
 
   "More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden. You know, he never 
   sleeps in the same place two nights in a row - just like Clinton." Jay 
Leno 
 
   "This Osama bin Laden guy, spoiled rich kid worth $300M. I have three 
words 
   for this guy: Anna Nicole Smith. We send her over there, she'll get his 
   money, he'll be dead in a week." Jay Leno
