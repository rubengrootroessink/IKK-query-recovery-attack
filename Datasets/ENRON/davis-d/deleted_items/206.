Dana,

It has been a while since we have run into each other and had a chance to catch up.  I hope everything is going well for you and Rachel.  

I understand that there are currently opportunities in origination, structuring and trading within the East Power Trading group.  I am interested in those opportunties and would like to talk to you about them.  Do you have time to discuss the group, the opprotunities, etc.?

I look forward to talking to you,
Zac
