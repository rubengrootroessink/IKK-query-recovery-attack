Subject: a married man left work

A married man left  work early on Friday afternoon. in stead of going
home, however, he  squandered the weekend and his paycheck partying
with the boys. When he  finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran
into a furious  wife.

After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked,  how
would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple  days?!!!!

"That would suit me just fine!!!"

So Monday went by,  and the man didn't see his wife. Tuesday and
Wednesday came and went with the  same result. Come Thursday, the
swelling went down a bit and he could see her  a little, just out of
the corner of his left  eye....
