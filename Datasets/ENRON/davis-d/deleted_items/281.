Hello Mrs. Dana
    I know you send me a e-mail at work today but I click it off the screen where i was working and I forgot to go back after I finish and I though about it when I got home from prayer meeting.   I am at home right now and I really don't know what you was talking about on my e-mail at work but I do know Robert have not sent me a CD yet They was in Dallas this weekend at Six Flags.   Dale is in the hospital in Pine Bluff He has been up there since Thursday He had kidney problems so now he have to have dieallas/ I guest that is the way to spell it or you know what i am talking bout When I get to work in the morning that is the first thing i am going to check is my e-mail Love you Mary
