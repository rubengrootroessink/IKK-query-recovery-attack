Dana:

Just wanted to send you a summary of the Nov SWAPS I sold for you last night.  

Sold 10,000 @ 2.45
Sold 15,000 @ 2.445
Sold 70,000 @ 2.44

for a total of 95,000 sold.

The bid stayed between 2.43 and 2.425 the rest of the night so I didn't sell the last 5,000.  
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work with EOL.  
Be sure to keep me in mind if you need a night time trader (ha).

Sincerely,
Andrew Greer
