Attached is the responsibility listing for the 1st Qtr 2001 E-Schedules.  Some changes have been made and new companies have been added, so please review the list to make sure we complete the appropriate schedules.  

Due to the time frame noted below, and the review period required to get the schedules out, please try and complete your schedules by mid afternoon on Monday.  

Please let Pam or I know if we are running into any problems.

Going forward,  we will only need one copy of the completed E-Schedules.  We will be submitting one consolidated E-Schedule to Corporate at the EGSVC4 level .  With this in mind, we have staggered the due dates for each E-Schedule to allow enough time for consolidation and give you as much time as possible.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for due dates, and submit each completed E-Schedule to Lynna Kacal at EB2356d by 4:00 pm on the given due date. 

 There are three main reasons to consolidate the E-schedules prior to submission to Corporate:

	Improve the general quality of information transmitted to Corporate
	Information is in a better format to assist in Balance Sheet Analysis (@ 270 entities with balances)
	Corporate has been doing this (they prefer to look at the information at the BU level), and we are better suited to consolidate the information  

Please be sure and distribute this information as appropriate within your group.  Should you have any questions or concerns please let me know. 

Thank you in advance for you cooperation.

Thanks!
