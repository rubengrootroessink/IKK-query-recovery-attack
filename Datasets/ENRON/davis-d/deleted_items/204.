We have all been to those meetings where someone wants "more than 100%."
>Well here's how you do that. Here's how you can achieve 103%. First of

>IF :

>A = 1
>B = 2
>C = 3
>D = 4
>E = 5
>F = 6
>G = 7
>H = 8
>I = 9
>J = 10
>K = 11
>L = 12
>M = 13
>N = 14
>O = 15
>P = 16
>Q = 17
>R = 18
>S = 19
>T = 20
>U = 21
>V = 22
>W = 23
>X = 24
>Y = 25
>Z = 26

>H A R D W O R K =

>A T T I T U D E =
