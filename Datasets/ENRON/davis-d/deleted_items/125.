A little blessing for my friends.....

 
  I HAD YOU ON MY HEART

  I asked the Lord to bless you
  As I prayed for you today
  To guide you and protect you
  As you go along your way....
  His love is always with you,
  His promises are true,
  And when we give Him all our cares
  You know He will see us through
  So when the road you're traveling on
  Seems difficult at best
  Just remember I'm here praying
  And God will do the rest.

  Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless and don't forget to
send it back to the one who ask God to bless you first.
