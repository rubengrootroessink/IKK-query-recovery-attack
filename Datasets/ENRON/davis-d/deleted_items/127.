THIS WAS FORWARDED FROM A FRIEND OF MINE ON THE POLICE FORCE!!!!!


FYI......................................

 I think you all know that I don't send out

 hoaxes and don't do the  reactionary thing and send out anything that

crosses my path.  This

one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility

in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it  out to all of you.

 My friend's friend was dating a guy from

 Afghanistan up until a month ago.

 She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was

understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.

On 9/10, she received a letter from her  boyfriend explaining that he wished

he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had

to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get

on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to

 go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she

called the FBI and has since turned over the letter.

This is not an email that I've received and

 decided to pass on.  This came from a phone conversation with a long-time

friend of mine last night.

 I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with

 one of his warnings being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take

the chance on the second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about

had the same information

 that I did.
