Hey Moma Bunny,
=20
You know that you don't have to thank me for talking to my Lil Brother.  Th=
at's something thats going to come automatically, not just TO SHOW other pe=
ople that I care, but it helps me stay in a relationship with him and God. =
 Even though they make me want to...sometimes, I still have much luv for th=
em and I can't give up on them.  If they see me give up on them, they can g=
ive up on themselves and I am not having that.  Matt and the rest of them a=
re a hand full and they don't always do everything they are suppose to. So =
they are not perfect and I like that because no-BODY'S, (body's of people, =
pastors, choirs, leaders, ministries, CHURCHES) are perfect, and if we were=
 perfect we wouldn't have any problems and if we didn't have any problems, =
we would not have nothing to pray about, and if we didn't have nothing to p=
ray about, we probably would not talk to God, and if we didn't talk to God =
we could not give him the Praise.  Well enough of me trying to get you to c=
ome back from your vacation from OUR church.  But know that Matt is always =
going to be my boy, and me not seeing him as often he going to make me call=
 him even more.=20
=20
So...C-Ya Sunday, I don't think yall have choir rehearsal this week because=
 this is going to be Young-Ault and Youth Sunday.
=20
Luv ya lots and miss ya (already),
=20
