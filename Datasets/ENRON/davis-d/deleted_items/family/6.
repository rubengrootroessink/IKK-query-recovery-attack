Yall I know yall are tired and need a brake.  But I'm going to let yall kno=
w, while yall are taking that brake, the devil is going to come in on that =
brake and do his work for you.  Hope when i talk to you last, I asked were =
you going to be at choir rehearsal and you said, "Why i ain't going to be t=
here Sunday." and you are right, but do you have to get all your blessing t=
hrough the week, and then give him the praise on sunday. You of all people =
know that you don't need to have a sunday moring experience on sunday, you =
can have it in a jail tank on tuesday and wendsday.  When you are in a rela=
tionship, you are going to do all you can to make it work, if you or quenti=
n didn't have ride, why didn't yall ask me, have i ever turned yall down. M=
ake it work.

Quentin, where have you been.  I am going to real with ya.  When you starte=
d coming to the church, You and I was thrilled. I was like finaly, i got so=
meone who is on my level who if in case didn't have a right spirit, I could=
 lift up and if i didn't have the right spirit, he could lift me up.  I fel=
t that now it's not only me who can get through to these other young men an=
d be there sort of mentor.  I have help now, i don't have to be the only on=
e checking on Matthew, Woyne, Damion, Anthony, Marcus, Mann, Kalid,  Howard=
, Devin, and not to mention the girls.  Now me and him can be there Account=
ers, especially for the first four.  Well now we don't have to worry about =
at least one of the the four, Matthew.  I'm  not sure, but he doesn't go to=
 the church anymore, nor his family.  And i am not saying it your fault, bu=
t you act like if they are not rapping, you don't need to be worried about =
them, i'm being real.  I always ask you,"Q, have you talk to the boys." =20
=20
I can't stress this enough, Your presence at the church is greatly missed. =
And you might say" well, everybody ain't able to have a nine to five,  you =
got to take what you can get." And that is exactly what the devil wants you=
 to feel...Notice I never said your presence on suday morning is greatly mi=
ssed, i said your presence at the church is.  Powertime, Choir Rehearsal, Y=
oung adult functions, Afternoon functions, 2nd services, Meetings...You mig=
ht not see it, but the only God that some of the people might see is throug=
h you. You might say, "Well, if they are going to church just to see me, th=
en they are going for the wrong reason." right. But everybody is not on the=
 same spiritual level as us.  They are following by example and if they nev=
er see you we may never see them. And Hope you already know how we feel abo=
ut you and the kind of spirit your presence bring.

Hope I told you in an email before i went to jail that i almost wanted to g=
ive up. And i was still considering it when i typed that. Be careful of wha=
t you asked because you just might get it. On that day, I was at work. My s=
upervisor asked me to take some checks down stairs about 4 floors down.  I =
waited for an elevator for a good three minutes, and i figured this was my =
chance to really talk to God.  And i asked hime to give me a renewed spirit=
, but not all of sudden. Let it be gradually.  I promise, when i said a man=
 the elevator opened. Well that evening i went to jail.  And it was in that=
 jail tank, God renewed my spirit. Now i can go to choir rehearsal again wi=
thout thinking about how much i don't like Andrew, I can still go to church=
 even though two vital families aren't there (Davis's and the Abrahams), i =
can type this letter to yall, and still not worry how yall might see me lat=
er. All i am saying is don't wait until you hit rock bottom to be about God=
's business again.  It's Real good that you Believe in God and you read you=
r Bible.  Keep in mind that The devil also belives in God and knows the Bib=
le back wards and forwards, He comes to Steal (Davis's and Abrahams) Kill (=
Our Spirit) and Destroy (Our Church).
=20
Please take heed to what I am saying and I am not saying this because I wan=
t to get under yalls skin, i am writing it because i am not holding nothing=
 in anymore, because thats what got my spirits down in the first place.=20
=20
And still much luv, You know how we do it.
