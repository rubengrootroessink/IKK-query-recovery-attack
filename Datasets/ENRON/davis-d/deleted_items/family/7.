I knew I loved you for some reason....hee...hee.   I know that God is at wo=
rk in both of our lives....I thank God for you.  Just as God gave us a "rel=
ease" from our work at VM, should He decide to "send" us back, we will do j=
ust that--come back.  For now, we are in transition.  God is growing us all=
 up for His purpose.  We both know of families (brothers, sisters, parents)=
 that have been separated because of some crisis or another....broken homes=
, right?  Many times in this type of situation, God has brought the "member=
s" of those families back together for the betterment of all because they "=
chose" to grow in His will; then, sometimes in His infinite wisdom, He sees=
 fit to allow the separation to continue because reuniting the family would=
 mean the destruction of all, because of the rebellion of at least one--bec=
ause he/she/they made the "choice" to remain how he/she/they were originall=
y--You ! know that God searches our hearts and He knows all truth.  None of=
 us will ever be perfect while we are on earth, but our "choice" is to stri=
ve to be in God's perfect will.  Continue to seek God's face.  Stay in your=
 Word!  Sometimes God will "send in order to mend!"  Just like the sacrific=
ial Lamb called Jesus was sent in order to heal the sins of this world--thi=
s mended our relationship with God, restored us to fellowship with Him.  Al=
l God things are good things, even if they hurt us a little!  REMEMBER: The=
 Lord is our Helper, we do not fear what man may do us.=20
