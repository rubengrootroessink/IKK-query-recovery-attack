Okay, the general consensus is to input ALL manual wires into MIDAS.  Again, this is imperative for RAC in order to calculate IRR on the individual assets.  If RAC does not get these cash items in their upload, they will be calling with questions.  I'm sure we all agree that the fewer questions they have, the better off we are. 

Each accountant is responsible for inputting their own wires into the MIDAS cash database.

Dana and Rufino, before filing copies of wires, please ensure that they have been input into the MIDAS cash database.  If they have not, please remind the accountants.  If this is a recurring problem, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marnie

Hi All,

I need your feedback on the new RAC system (PortRac) and manual wires. 

My understanding is that when we do manual wires, they do not always get input into the MIDAS cash database.  Currently, Rufino prepares a download for RAC from the MIDAS cash database for them to upload into their PortRac system.  If manual wires are not included in the MIDAS cash database, then that information is currently not getting to RAC, which is a problem because RAC uses this information to calculate IRR for each investment.

Would it be easier to always input all cash, including manual wires, into the MIDAS cash database or track manual wires on a separate spreadsheet that we send to RAC.  Or, does anyone have any other suggestions?

Keep in mind, the more information we give RAC up front, the fewer questions they'll have : )

Please respond to me with your suggestions.

Thanks,
Marnie
