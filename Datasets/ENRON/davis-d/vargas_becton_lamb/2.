Hi Dana,

Can you go make copies of these agreements for me?

Thanks,
Marnie

I have a copy of the original and the amendment in my office.  Stop by to pick them up and make a copy.  They are on the floor underneath my whiteboard.

Hi John,

Do we have copies of the merger agreements between IHI and T-3?  AA is asking to look at these.  With the unwind of Raptor, they are looking in detail at all of the Raptor assets.

Thanks,
Marnie
