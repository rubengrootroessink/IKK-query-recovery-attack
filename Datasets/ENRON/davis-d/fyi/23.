Effective March 1, 2001 Enron North America (CO 0413) employees will begin using XMS (Expense Management System) to process employee expense reimbursements.

XMS is a web based employee expense reimbursement system which will provide the following benefits;

?	More timely reimbursements to employees
?	User friendly Web access
?	Ability for employee or designated administrative assistant to submit expense reimbursement
?	Greater efficiency and lower cost
?	Efficiently integrated with the current SAP accounting system

This system will REPLACE our current manual expense reimbursement process.  All employee expense reimbursements for ENA employees submitted after March 1, 2001 should be done via XMS. 

Following are details regarding system access, training and support.



To access the system go to the Enron Home Page and type http://xms.enron.com in the address field.

Enter your personnel number (P number).   HR information is loaded automatically into XMS, but an incomplete load may mean that some people's IDs are not updated.  If your P number doesn't work, try using your first initial and last name (lower case).  If you can't log in to the system, go to the IT Central web page from the Enron home page and select Services>Security Requests>eRequest or call (713) 853-5536.

If you have forgotten your password, call the Resolution Center at (713) 853-1411.
