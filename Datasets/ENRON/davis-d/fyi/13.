This Information Applies ONLY to Organizations Supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable Processing Centers 

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement and payment tool, iBuyit eProcurement, is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  But there is still more to come! On May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of receipt and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issue resolution. 

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the way you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these changes will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit Payables system. 

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:   
*  Company Number or Legal Entity Name
*  Contact Name 
*  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order Number   
*  New P.O. Box  (See Below)

What is an EID? 
An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back to the purchaser electronically through iBuyit.  

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.  


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  You can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose "Personal Information" to pull up your personal profile.  On the left side of the "Personal Information" screen select "Other" and you will see your:
*  PID (SAP ID)
*  GIS ID
*  EID

What is our new mailing address (PO Box)?
Effective immediately, instruct the vendor to mail the invoices to the following address:
PO Box 4734  
Houston, TX  77210-4734

What do I do if an invoice comes directly to me?
HOUSTON LOCATIONS ONLY
If an invoice comes directly to you, mark the envelope "Attention Enron Accounts Payable," and place the envelope in an AP drop box at any Enron mail center.

FIELD LOCATIONS ONLY
If Houston currently processes your invoices, and an invoice comes directly to you, they will continue to be processed by the Accounts Payable department in Houston.  Please send invoices to the new PO Box above or the following physical address:  
3724 Dacoma
Houston, TX  77092
ATTENTION ENRON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Note:  ETS Field locations will continue to process non-purchase order invoices locally.

How will vendors learn about these changes?
This information will be shared directly with vendors in a separate communication.
