With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.
