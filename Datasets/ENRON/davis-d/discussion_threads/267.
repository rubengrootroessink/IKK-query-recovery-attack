=09=09How To Control Anger  =20
=09=09
=09=09Want to start living positively instead of angrily? If so, get to the=
 source=20
to your anger. For some, the roots of your anger may be hidden deep in your=
=20
childhood. Your anger may come from being exposed to lessons from a caregiv=
er=20
who was abusive ("You hurt the ones you love").
=09=09
=09=09People who have lots of anger from childhood may find themselves unab=
le to=20
control their anger, or feel the need to appear "tough." Sometimes they see=
k=20
out victims so that they can play the role of the abuser in an unconscious=
=20
attempt to understand why the earlier abuse occurred.=20
=09=09
=09=09Anger CAN be controlled. Get control of your anger by learning where =
it first=20
started. Then deal with your anger in a constructive way. Talk to loved=20
ones--or a professional--to understand why you feel the way you do and how =
to=20
get on the road to a happier, healthier life.
