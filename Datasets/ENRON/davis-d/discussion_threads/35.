Subject: FWD: Fw: cuckoo clock

The other night I was invited out for a night with the "boys".  I told my
wife that i would be home by midnight...promise!  Well, the hours passed and
the beer was going down way too easy.  At around 3 A.M., drunk as a skunk, I
headed home.  Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall
started up, and cuckooed 3 times.  Quickly, I realized she'd probably wake
up, so I cuckooed another 9 times.  I was really proud of myself, having a
quick, witty solution, even when smashed, to escape a possible conflict.
Next morning my wife asked me what time I got in and I told her 12 o'clock.
She didn't seem disturbed at all.  Whew!  Got away with that one!  She then
told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock.  When I asked her why she said
"Well, it cuckooed 3 times, then said "oh fuck", cuckooed 4 more times,
cleared it's throat, cuckooed another 3 times, giggled, cuckooed twice more,
and then farted.
