WHY JESUS IS BETTER THAN SANTA CLAUS

Santa lives at the North Pole...
JESUS is everywhere
Santa rides in a sleigh...
JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the water.
Santa fills your stockings with goodies...
JESUS supplies all your needs.
You have to wait in line to see Santa...
JESUS is as close as the mention of HIS name.
Santa lets you sit on his lap...
JESUS lets you rest in HIS arms.
Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly...
JESUS has a heart full of love.
All Santa can offer is ho,ho,ho...
JESUS offers HELP, HEALTH, AND HOPE.
Santa says, "You better not cry..."
JESUS says,"Cast all your cares on me for I care for you."
Santa's little helpers make toys...
JESUS makes new lives, mends wounded hearts, repairs broken homes, and
builds mansions.
Santa may make you chuckle but...
JESUS gives you joy that is your strength.
While Santa puts gifts under your tree...
JESUS became our gift and died on a tree.
Remember, to keep CHRIST in CHRISTmas...
JESUS is the reason for the season.
