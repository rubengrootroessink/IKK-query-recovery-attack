Lola -

You know that I wouldn't be asking you this but this is ONLY if  it's 
possible.  Some how I've gotten myself into a crunch and I need to know if I 
can get some money from you.  I'm not quite sure of what our balance is but 
is there any way I can get $40 or $50 from you?  My electric bill is $320 and 
it was due yesterday.  I called them and told them that I could pay half b/c 
my car note is due this pay period too.  Let me know if you can help.
