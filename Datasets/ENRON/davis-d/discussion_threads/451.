As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Jose Favela at (713)345-5878.
