-------I walked into the grocery store not ?particularly interested 
in  
buying 
groceries. ?I ?wasn't hungry. ?The pain of losing my husband of 37 years 
was 
still too raw. ?And this ?grocery store held so many sweet memories. 

?Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd ?pretend to go off 
and 

look ??for something special. ?I knew what he was up to. ?I'd always spot 
him ?walking down the aisle with ??the three yellow roses in his hands. 
Rudy 
knew I ?loved yellow roses. ?With ?a ??heart filled with grief, I ?only 
wanted to buy my ?few items and leave, but ?even grocery shopping 
was ?different since Rudy had passed on. ?Shopping for one took time, a 
little ?more thought than it had ?for two. 

Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and 
remembered 
how Rudy had loved his steak. 

Suddenly a woman came beside me. ?She was blond, slim and lovely in a 
soft 

green pantsuit. ?I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bones, 
dropped 
them in her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. ?She ?turned to go 
and ?once again reached for the pack of steaks. 

She saw me watching her and she smiled. ?"My husband loves T-bones, but 
honestly, at these prices, I don't know." 

I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her ?pale blue eyes. ?"My 
husband passed away eight days ago," I told her. ?Glancing at the package 
in 
her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice. ?"Buy him the 
steaks. ??And cherish every moment you have together." 

She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed the 
package in her basket and wheeled away. 

I turned and pushed my cart across the length of ?the store to the dairy 
products. ?There I stood, trying to decide which ?size milk I should buy. 
A 

quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near ?the 
front ?of the store. ?If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ?ice 
cream cone. 

I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down ?the aisle toward the 
front. 

I saw first the green suit, then recognized the ?pretty lady coming 
towards 
?me. ?In her arms she carried a package. ?On her ?face was the  
brightest 
smile ?I had ever seen. ?I would swear a soft halo encircled her ?blond 
hair 

as she ?kept walking toward me, her eyes holding mine. ?As she ?came 
closer, 

I saw ??what she held and tears began misting in my eyes. 

"These are for you," she said and placed three ?beautiful long stemmed 
yellow ?roses in my arms. ?"When you go through the line, ?they will know 
these are ??paid for." She leaned over and placed a gentle ?kiss on my 
cheek, then smiled ?again. 

I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the ?roses meant, but still 
unable ?to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded my 
vision. 
I 
looked ?down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green ?tissue  
wrapping 
and found ?it ??almost unreal. ?How did she know? ?Suddenly the ?answer 
seemed so clear. ?I ?wasn't alone. 

?"Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you? ?I ?whispered, with 
tears 
in ?my ??eyes. ?He was still with me, and she was his angel. 

?Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you ?are. ?Please read 
all 

of this, it is really nice. This is a simple request. ?If ?you appreciate 
life, send this to your friends, ?including the person that ?sent it to 
you. 
Even though I clutch my blanket and growl when the ?alarm ?rings,thank 
you, 

Lord, that I can hear. ?There are many who are deaf. ?Even though I keep 
my 

eyes closed against ?the ?morning light as long as ?possible, thank you, 
Lord, that I can see. ?Many are blind. 

?Even though I huddle in my bed and put off rising, ?thank you, Lord, 
that 

I ??have the strength to rise. ??There are many who are bedridden. 

?Even though the first hour of my day is hectic, when socks are lost, 
toast 
is ??burned and tempers are short, my children are so ?loud, thank ?you, 
Lord, for ?my family. ?There are many who are lonely. ?Even though our 
breakfast table never looks like ?the pictures in ?magazines ??and the 
menu 
is at times unbalanced, thank ?you,Lord, for the ?food we have. ??There 
are 
many who are hungry. ?Even though the routine of ?my job often is 
monotonous, thank you, Lord, for ?the opportunity to ?work. ?There are 
many 
who have no job. ??Even though I grumble and bemoan ?my fate from day ?to 
day 
and wish my ??circumstances were not so modest, ?thank you, Lord, ?for 
life. 

Pass this on to the friends you know, it ?might ?help a bit to make this 
world ?a better place to live, right? 

PASS IT ON....
