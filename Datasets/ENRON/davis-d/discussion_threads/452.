Subject: It's Kristi's Birthday Today!

Since, some of you may be working late today, I am going to go ahead and just 
order some breakfast tacos for tomorrow and everyone can pitch in 
approximately $2.30?  If anyone is opposed, please let me know as soon as 
possible. 

I apologize.... somehow, it slipped by us.  What about giving her a 
traditional Birthday Breakfast tomorrow in her honor?  Please let me know 
what you would like to bring.

Nicole
