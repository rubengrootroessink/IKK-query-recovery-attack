Good Morning,

      I have information on the shirts we talked about for the Seeds of
Praise conference.  Joe Stewart checked into both options we wanted.

For the polo style shirt it will be $18 to $19.50 per shirt.

For the long sleeve blue jean shirt it will be $25 - $28 per shirt.

This is based on that the Northwest Printing will provide the shirts.  Also
this will be the embroidered logo and not the iron on one.  We need to
decide quickly and get our money turned in quickly.  We only have about 2
weeks to get this done.  As we talked about, we would wear these on Sunday
for the closing worship service and then back to Veterans on Sunday.

Please either e-mail your preference or let me know at Power time tonight.
If you know of anyone who is not on line and you have a few minutes to
contact them today, please do so.  (Evelyn Jackson, Ethel Ford, Nina Nazir
Ud-Din, Pam Watts, Cheryl Sumbler, Cheryl Curry, Danise Johnson, and Evelyn
Morris)

We need to make a decision quickly and try to have the money by Sunday.
Also, if you have not finished paying your registration, it is due by
Friday, so please try and bring it tonight, otherwise you will have to catch
up with myself or Bonnie on Friday.

Thanks,
Denise
