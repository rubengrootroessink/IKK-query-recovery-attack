Please make your selection of reviewers in the PRC system by noon, Friday.  I 
will need to go in and approve your list before any forms are sent out.  If 
you have any questions or want to discuss your list with me, please feel free 
to stop by my office.  If you have already made your selections, please 
disregard this message.  Thanks.
