>   Here is a true story about a nine-year-old boy who lived in a rural town
>   in Tennessee.  His house was in a poor area of the community.  A church
>   had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday
afternoon.
>
>   The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus
pastor
>   asked if his parents were home and the small boy told him that his
parents
>   take off every weekend and leave him at home to take care of his little
>   brother.
>
>   The bus pastor couldn't believe what the kid said and asked him to
repeat
>  it.
>   The youngster gave the same answer and the bus pastor asked to come in
and
>   talk with him.   They went into the living room and sat down on an old
>  couch
>   with the foam and springs exposed.
>
>   The bus pastor asked the kid, "Where do you go to church?"
>
>   The young boy surprised the visitor by replying, "I've never been to
church
>
>   in my whole life."
>
>   The bus pastor thought to himself about the fact that his church was
less
>   than three miles from the child's house.  "Are you sure you have never
>   been to church?" he asked again.
>
>   "I sure haven't", came his answer.
>
>   Then the bus pastor said, "Well, son, more important than going to
>   church, have you ever heard the greatest love story ever told? "And then
he
>
>   proceeded to share the Gospel with this little nine-year-old boy.
>
>   The young lad's heart began to be tenderized and at the end of the bus
>  pastor's
>   story the bus pastor asked if the boy wanted to receive this free gift
from
>  God.
>   The youngster exclaimed, "You Bet!
>
>   The kid and the bus pastor got on their knees and the lad invited Jesus
>  into
>   his little heart and received the free gift of salvation.   They both
stood
>  up
>   and the bus pastor asked if he could pick the kid up for church the next
>  morning.
>
>   Sure," the nine year old replied.
>
>   The bus pastor got to the house early the next morning and found the
lights
>  off.
>   He let himself in and snaked his way through the house and found the
little
>  boy
>   asleep in his bed.  He woke up the little boy and his brother and helped
>  get them
>   dressed.  They got on the bus and ate a donut for breakfast on their way
to
>  church.
>   Keep in mind that this boy had never been to church before.   The church
>  was a real
>   big one.   The little kid just sat there, clueless of what was going on.

>
>   A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to
the
>  front
>   and picked up some wooden plates.  One of the men prayed and the kid
with
>  utter
>   fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn't
know
>  what
>   was going on.
>
>   All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking
>  place.
>   These people must be giving money to Jesus.  He then reflected on the
free
>  gift
>   of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier.  He immediately
>  searched
>   his pockets, front and back, and couldn't find a thing to give Jesus.
>
>   By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle and with
a
>  broken
>   heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it.   He finally let go
and
>  watched
>   it pass on down the aisle.  He turned around to see it passed down the
>  aisle
>   behind him.   And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was
>  passed
>   back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary.
>
>   Then he had an idea. This little nine-year-old boy, in front of God and
>  everybody,
>   got up out of his seat.  He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the
usher
>  by the
>   coat and asked to  hold the plate one more time.  Then he did the most
>  astounding
>   thing I have ever heard of.
>
>   He took the plate, sat it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into
the
>  center
>   of it.   As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said,
"Jesus,
>  I don't
>   have anything to give you today, but just me.  I give you me!"
>
