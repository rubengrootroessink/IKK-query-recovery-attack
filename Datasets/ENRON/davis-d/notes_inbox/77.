Hello Dana,

Yes.... I am still giving Edith her bridal shower on this upcoming weekend.
And I do believe your name was included in the invitations that were sent
out, which was this past Monday.  So you should be receiving directions as
well as the invitation sometime this week.  Thanks for inquiring, and hope
to have you join us on Saturday.....talk soon....

~Kathy.....
