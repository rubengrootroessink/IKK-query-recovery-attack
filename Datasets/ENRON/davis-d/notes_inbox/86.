> A middle aged woman had a heart attack and was taken to the
> hospital. While on the operating table, she had a near death experience.
>
> Seeing God, she asked "Is my time up?"
>
> God said, "No, you have another 43 years, 2 months and 8 days
> to live."
>
> Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and
> have a facelift, liposuction, and a tummy tuck. She even had someone
> come in and change her hair color. Since she had so much more time to
> live, she figured she might as well make the most of it.
>
> After her last operation, she was released from the hospital.
> While crossing the street on her way home, she was killed by an
> ambulance.
>
> Arriving in front of God, she demanded, "I thought you said I
> had another 40 years! Why didn't you pull me from out of the path
> of the ambulance?"
>
> God replied, "I didn't recognize you."
