=09=09Assert Yourself At Work =20
=09=09
=09=09Do you feel taken advantaged at your job? Are you being handed other =
people's=20
work? If so, it's time for you assert yourself and set boundaries to keep=
=20
your sanity.=20
=09=09
=09=09People who are considered the "saviors" on the job often have a fear =
of=20
rejection or are "people pleasers." To keep your sanity in check, you must =
be=20
willing to "rock the boat." Quitting is not the answer, because this scenar=
io=20
will probably occur again in your next job. It is you who is creating=20
problems for you--not other people.
=09=09
=09=09Assert yourself by talking to your supervisor about how you feel abou=
t the=20
situation and how you wish to resolve it. (Have a solution in mind BEFORE y=
ou=20
approach your boss.) You'll feel better once you take some control over a=
=20
situation. Do not let your emotions keep you from gaining some control in=
=20
your work. This is where stress comes from: "The lack of control."
