you have a moment to share with others please do so.
Your sister , Claudette

VERSE:
   Wicked men are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the
righteous stands firm.
    -- Proverbs 12:7


THOUGHT:
   This is eventually true in every culture.  An evil leader is
murdered by his even more evil successor.  Ruin comes to the one
who brings ruination on others.  But ultimately, this result will
only be fully true when Jesus comes and judges all people justly
and with nothing hidden.  Then, God's righteous will shine like the
sun, and reign with him in glory which will not spoil, perish, or
fade.  Justice with mercy, love with strength, and life without
death will find their way in the city God has prepared for those
who love him.

PRAYER:
   Dear Father in heaven.  May your Kingdom come with power in our
world and may your will be done here on earth just as it is done
heaven.  Overthrow the wicked, and let those you have made
righteous in Jesus stand in the presence of your glory and grace.
In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
