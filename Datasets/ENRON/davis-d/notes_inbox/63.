?? Right now, you're 3 for 5 on forgetting and always the same response.
Doing better next time.
I'm sitting here wondering at the age of 35 what makes ME happy. Do I really
know? What can I do to find out. What about those those things that do not
make me happy? The only thing to say in with you in mind. Is. You've managed
to be at both ends of the spectrum and not all by yourself. What I'm getting
at is. . . The only time(s) I've experienced periods of pain (with one
exception) with you is when you're involved with ANOTHER MAN. . . . . . . .
PREOCCUPIED on your part. That was someone more important to you, and was
that way for awhile. Now recent developments have occurred that's telling my
heart that history my be repeating itself. I know what you've told me, but
it seems all too familiar. Hey, this is me. Do what you want and who you
want to. I know that sounds familiar. You said, that things at Work and Home
have you mentally preoccupied. What's different from the first 2 times you
remembered and then with the last 3 times you forgot? Coincidence?  We both
know that Kevin will always be that Lazy/Self-Centered/Spoiled Brat of an
A##Hole, until he wants to do something for HIMSELF. As for work. You got it
good. I understand about that Childish-boy you call a Co-worker. And
everything associated with that mess. I could very easily use that same
excuse you did about forgetting anything. Have I ever forgotten you on
anything, regardless of what was going? ? ? Well. . . I'm waiting. ? ? ?
Sometimes I think I should be more of a Self-Centered/High Strung A##hole
and look out for myself. Maybe I wouldn't feel the I do about a lot of
things. But then again, Back to what's real. We're not Married, just
friends. At least, when I was reminded of that last week. Do whom that makes
you happy. You're a grown woman.
Well, I'll be here for you to tell me how wrong I am about everthing that
I've said. And I want you to do it with both barrels.

P.S.
I thought Birthdays other than Valentines Day and X-mas was a day that you
can show that special person how special they are to you. That must have
something I read in a Far Side cartoon clip or fiction novel somewhere.
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

I can't undo what didn't do or did but,  if you will allow me to apologize
for being preoccupied and self-centered I will make it my business never to
forget your birthday again.
