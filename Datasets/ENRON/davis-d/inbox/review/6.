Hi Nicole,

Can you set up a room for Dana and me on Monday at 9 am?

Thanks,

Hi Marnie -

Thanks,

Hi Dana,

We need to get together for your review.  When are you unavailable this week or early next week?  I think you have fire marshall training this afternoon.  When is the United Way thing you are participating in?

Thanks,
Marnie
