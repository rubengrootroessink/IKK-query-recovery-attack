Will sending these materials be charged to my cost center?

At this time, we are not having an Excel Intro class during the below week...if you would like to learn it on your own, I can send you the book and exercise files that are given in class.

Let me know if you would like that.

I was wondering if there would be an Intro Excel class anytime during the week of Oct. 8 - 12th.
