At this time, we are not having an Excel Intro class during the below week...if you would like to learn it on your own, I can send you the book and exercise files that are given in class.

Let me know if you would like that.

I was wondering if there would be an Intro Excel class anytime during the week of Oct. 8 - 12th.
