Dana,

Thanks for the update.  I did want to let you know that your transfer letter is ready.  You can stop by my desk at any time to pick it up.  I am located at EB 3685d.

Thanks,
Jamie

Good Morning Jamie -
To attempt to answer your question,  I can only assume that the transfer date will be November 5th.  I did speak to my supervisor yesterday evening and she spoke with our director; but I still have not been able to confirm this date.  My supervisor is out this morning but will be back in by noon.  I should have a definite answer for you after lunch.  If you have any questions please call me.

Thanks,

Dana

Dana,

I was wondering if you have set a transfer date yet?  Please let me know so I can relay the information to Bill Hare.

Thanks,
