I am delighted to let you all know that you made an acceptable score on the Programmer Aptitude Test.  You will be contacted within the next day or so to set up interview(s) with a hiring manager(s).

I invite you to keep this information to yourselves, as I have not yet had an opportunity to tell everyone whether they made an acceptable score or not.

Thank you for your interest.  If you know of others (preferably not on your same team, as that is too much to ask of a supervisor), we are actively seeking qualified candidates.

Call me or e-mail me with any questions or concerns.
