If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. 
    If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you 
flowers every spring. 
    He sends you a sunrise every morning. 
  Whenever you want to talk, He listens. 
    He can live anywhere in the universe, but He 
chose ... your heart. 
    Face it, friend -- He is crazy about you! 

 Send this to every "beautiful person" you wish  to bless, and return 
it to the person who sent it to you. 

    God didn't promise days without pain, 
    laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, but He did 
promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the 
way.
