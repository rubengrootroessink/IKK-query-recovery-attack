Dana,

I work for Fred Cohagan in EBS Asia Pac -- and I believe he's spoken to you about the fact that we're scaling back around the region.  

I had mentioned to him that I'd like to get involved with the Power Desk and he suggested that I give you a call.  If you're available, I'd be very interested in talking about any opportunities in your group.

I'll try to reach you on Tuesday afternoon, CST.

Regards,

Pat Leahy
