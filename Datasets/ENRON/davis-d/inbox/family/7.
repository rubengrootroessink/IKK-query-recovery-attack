>           Do You Love Him? 
>           This is a simple test:

>           THE POEM 
>           I knelt to pray but not for long, 
>           I had too much to do. 
>           I had to hurry and get to work 
>           For bills would soon be due. 
>           So I knelt and said a hurried prayer, 
>           And jumped up off my knees. 
>           My Christian duty was now done 
>           My soul could rest at ease. 
>           All day long I had no time 
>           To spread a word of cheer. 
>           No time to speak of Christ to friends, 
>           They'd laugh at me I'd fear. 
>           No time, no time, too much to do, 
>           That was my constant cry, 
>           No time to give to souls in need 
>           But at last the time, the time to die. 
>           I went before the Lord, 
>           I came, I stood with downcast eyes. 
>           For in his hands God held a book; 
>           It was the book of life. 
>           God looked into his book and said 
>           "Your name I cannot find. 
>           I once was going to write it down... 
>           But never found the time" 
>             
>           Now do you have the time to pass it on?
