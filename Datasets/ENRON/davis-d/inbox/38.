Please pass along to all who utilize SAP for reporting in your Business Unit.

SAP Users,

We are experiencing an inordinate strain on the SAP system due to the large volume of reports running.  The ISC has been working this issue since last Thursday, continuously monitoring the system and looking for any potential enhancements to performance or identifying technical issues hindering performance.  The most immediate culprit of system slowdown has been the continual submission of the same 10-15 reports repeatedly throughout the workday.

Please help us, you, and the rest of the Enron community by adhering to the following guidelines:

1) Only execute business critical reports during high traffic times such as financial close workdays 1-6. 
2) Utilize the Sunrise data warehouse where plausible and where up to the minute data (real-time) is not a requirement.
3) Enter as many selection parameters as you are able before executing a report.
4) Limit the amount of data being pulled by a report.  For example, run reports for only one reporting period and/or for one company code.
5) Do NOT run a report multiple times simultaneously.  
If a report is not returning any data in a quick timeframe, please do not resubmit the report without first canceling the original report.
Do not run multiple sessions of the report with different criteria simultaneously.  The report goes after the same table for the data each time.
6) Limit the number of line item reports run.  Run summary reports and then drilldown to the line items as needed.

We will keep you advised of any findings from the technical teams.

Please note that any duplicate reports running under the same ID will be subject to termination.

Thank you in advance for your assistance in report volume reduction.
