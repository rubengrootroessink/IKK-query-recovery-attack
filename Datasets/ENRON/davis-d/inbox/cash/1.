We have new procedures with Treasury concerning our Trutta accounts - 
Stacy and I use to manage these accounts, but now are having to go through Treasury to reserve funds.
They are managing our balances, but will need to know about any same day wires.  If you
have a same day wire going out on the 3044-9773 account please fax Treasury to reserve the funds.
This is for same day wires only, all other wires that go through AP and Treasury they are already aware of.
Feel free to ask me if you have any questions. Thanks for your help.  

Amy
