I would like to remind you of the days I need cash applications done early in the morning.

Every Monday
Every day during the last week of the month
Last day of February, May, August and November (Quarterly last day of the second month)
As requested by R/F users

I noticed that you have vacation on some of the days that I mentioned above.
Please let me know who can replace you while you are out or feel free to train each other to cover for each other.

Thanks,
Lisa
