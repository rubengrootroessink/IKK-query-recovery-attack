Subject:	New Midas FrontEnd

Please find enclosed the final component of the Midas security enhancements.  This frontend is a fully executable file, which means that you can save it to your hard drive or anywhere else and it will link over to the Midas databases.  You can also make a shortcut to place on your desktop or in your start menu.

The password to the old frontend will no longer function, this application will be the only way to access Midas.

Your password will be your first initial and last name (for example, mine is swolfe).  Your password is your 5 digit Enron extension (feel free to change it).  Let me know if you have any questions.
