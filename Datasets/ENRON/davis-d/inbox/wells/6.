FYI:  Progress reports will be distributed Monday, Oct. 15.  Our grades are due this Thursday at 4:00 pm.  As a result, you should expect to see the kids doing lots make-up work in all classes this week.  I told most of the kids their current grades today and told them what zeros they have.  I will talk to the rest of them tomorrow.  I have attached an assignment sheet so that you know what's up.  Please feel free to respond and ask me for current grade status.

I will be sending home detailed reports on Friday that will require your signature.  Thanks!

Hope you all had a great weekend!
