Open House is tonight!  6:15 - 9:00 pm, starting in the cafeteria.  It starts with a preview of clubs, then a general meeting, then classroom visitations, then another club preview.  There will be no time for individual conferencing, but you will at least have the opportunity to meet your child's teachers.

I'll give some kind of reward to my students if their parents come - haven't decided what yet, but they'll get something!

I look forward to meeting you!
