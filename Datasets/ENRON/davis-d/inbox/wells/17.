Hi, 

This is your child's English teacher - finally got your E-mail addresses into my address book.  Please reply so I know you got this message ...

In case you do, you should know that we have a quiz tomorrow in class over their homework tonight, which counts half their grade.  The assignment should be written down in their agendas.  It is to read p. 456-8 and answer the questions on p. 459, exercise 2, #1-10.

Thanks!

Wendy Koebernick
