Dear HighSchoolAlumni User: 

Do you remember the last time you visited HighSchoolAlumni.com? 

http://www.highschoolalumni.com 

Well, regardless of how long it's been, we'd like to invite you back to take 
a look at some great new features. 

In an ongoing effort to improve our service, we've made the following 
changes: 

*Size -- We've added more than 10,000 new high schools, bringing our total to 
over 33,000! 
*Design & Navigation -- The site not only looks better, but also provides 
easier navigation to assist you in reconnecting with alumni from your school

*My Start Page -- Your very own customized start page, which gives you easy, 
one-click access to all of our tools 
*Enhanced Search Capability -- To track down a friend from another school, 
even if you can't remember the name of the town

Don't worry...we still have the features and services that you've come to 
love and that have made HighSchoolAlumni.com the best site of its kind:

*Alumni Watch -- We'll notify you via email when someone registers to any 
school and any class year that you choose 
*Alumni Message -- You can send messages to your long lost friends without 
ever leaving the site 
*"Tell Your Friends" -- about HighSchoolAlumni.com! Just think: if you tell 
two friends, and they tell two friends...your class listing will be packed 
with profiles of alumni that you might not have spoken with in years!

Whether high school was last year or 30 years ago, your friends are 
waiting...Come back and help us celebrate our re-launch!
