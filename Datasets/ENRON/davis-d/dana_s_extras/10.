Sorry this is so late, but I'm sure we can all agree this is a word in due
      season!

Weary of Worry
"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and
maketh
manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."  (2 Corinthians
2:14)

     As you fight the good fight of faith today, remember this: Your mind is
where the battle will take
place.  Whatever you allow to captivate your mind will rule your life.  Will
it
be the Word of God or
the lies of Satan?  The decision is yours.

     If you want the Word to reign, make up your mind now to resist the
devil
when he comes to
plant doubts within you.  Refuse to surrender to the circumstantial pressure
he
brings your way.
Decide at the onset that you will not succumb to this trial.  Dig your heels
in
and stand immovable
upon the promises of God.

     When thoughts come that are contrary to God's will, cast them down.
And
above all, don't
worry.  Worrying is meditating the thoughts of Satan.  When you recognize
you
are worrying, stop
it immediately.  Replace worried, fearful, and doubtful thoughts with the
Word.

     Be assured, Satan will continually try to tell you that your situation
is
hopeless.  He will
persistently peddle doubt, defeat, and discouragement. But if you won't
allow
him to sell you his
goods, his commission will be zero.  If you don't buy his lies, he can't
cause
them to come to pass
in your life.

     God has promised that He will always cause you to triumph in Christ.
You
are guaranteed
victory over any adversity you face today.  Make up your mind right now to
be a
winner and
you'll spread the knowledge of victory in Christ everywhere you go.
SCRIPTURE
READING: Philippians 4:1-9
