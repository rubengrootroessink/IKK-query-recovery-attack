The response to eHRonline has been extremely positive, with over 1500 people 
using the system on the first day alone!  Though many of you have experienced 
success, some of you are logging on and encountering some "bumps" -- mainly 
questions relating to your system ID or issues related to your web browser 
settings.  Those with questions or issues have been calling the COE and some 
are having to wait due to the increased call volume.  

To increase our accessibility during this phase of implementation, we are . . 
.

increasing our call center staffing to decrease your wait time.
working with the Business Unit IT departments to resolve individual browser 
setting issues.

To help us help you, please . . .

Take a screen shot of any error message you receive and send it to the COE at 
SAP COE/Corp/Enron or SAP.COE@enron.com.
Be patient over the next few days when calling the COE -- remember that we 
are adding over 8500 new users.
Have the following information available when you call:
Your name, location, extension, and business unit
Your personnel number, if you know it
The exact text of any error message you receive

We appreciate your cooperation.
