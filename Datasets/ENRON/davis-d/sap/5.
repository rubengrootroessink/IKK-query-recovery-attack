eProcurement

With one week behind us and many Shopping Carts processed for IT hardware and office supplies, iBuyit wants to share what we've learned from your feedback and provide you specific information to help you maximize eProcurement.  This first update covers delivery addresses, IT standard hardware templates, and office supplies.  Over the next several weeks, iBuyit will continue to provide you updates on a regular basis.  

How to Make Sure You Receive Your Purchase Request!
Before you begin to shop, verify that your Delivery Address information is correct under Default Settings for Items.  Why?  If no delivery address is entered, you or the intended recipient will experience a delay in receiving your order.  
* Click on the ? button to search for street address information.  
* Use the c/o field to enter the name of the intended recipient.
* Update My Settings from the main eProcurement screen to set up Building, Room, and Extension information that will automatically default to your Default Address.
Locate additional details in Section II of the Requestor Quick Reference Card.

IT Standard Hardware Templates
* The iBuyit Catalog team is aggressively working to resolve the duplication of IT Standard Templates names appearing under the Table of Contents tab.  All of the template links are working.  Thank you for your patience.
* Use the standard templates to order common workstations (desktops and laptops), and click Select All.  Why?  Net Works has bundled all necessary components for each common workstation.  If you don't select all, you will receive only a partial setup.

Office Supplies
* Use the Catalog to select office supplies.  Why?  Purchasing will reject all office supply requests entered as non-catalog items.  If you are unable to locate an office supply item, contact the iBuyit Catalog team to add the item or use an alternative method to purchase the item.
* Create separate Shopping Carts for office supplies and IT hardware items.  Why?  The processing of office supply requests will be delayed if combined with IT hardware.  All carts containing IT hardware items are routed to Purchasing for final review before processing.
* Corporate Express and Lee are committed to next day delivery.  However, if you have questions about your order, contact the appropriate vendor and provide either the Company Number and Cost Assignment or the Purchase Order Number:
- Corporate Express at 713-853-6294
- David Yee or Faye Hopkins at Lee Stationery and Office Supply Co at 713-227-1201

Summer Tip:  Please remind your Approver to establish a Substitute before they are away from the office for an extended period.  You can locate instructions on the Approver Quick Reference Card.
