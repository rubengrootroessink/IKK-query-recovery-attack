The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) Technical Architecture Team is pleased to announce availability the SAP Office Connector!

The SAP Office Connector is a piece of software that seamlessly displays your SAP Office folders in Outlook.  If you are an SAP user, there are several reasons why you might receive an SAP Office message: 
?	You are the agent for an SAP workflow item
?	An error has occurred for which you are the person responsible
?	Someone (or some process) just sent you SAP mail

SAP Office messages can be viewed in Outlook, and you can launch any attached links to an SAP transaction directly from the Outlook mail.

Use of the SAP Office Connector is optional.  If you use SAP only to enter your timesheet information, you probably won't get much mail in your SAP Inbox - and so probably won't benefit from using this product.

NOTE: there are several SAP systems, including Apollo Production (FI) and HR Production.  You have a separate set of SAP Office folders in each system.  Repeat the setup steps that follow for EACH SAP system you want to be displayed as folders in Outlook.  There is no way to have multiple SAP systems consolidated and displayed in one set of folders.

You already have the SAP Office Connector if you have the new SAPGUI 4.6D installed.  Follow this link for instructions on how to set up the Connector in Outlook.
