eProcurement

The purpose of this e-mail is to explain a new feature of the eProcurement system.  Also, check out answers to some of the most commonly asked eProcurement questions below.

New Feature!
Many of you have asked, "Why can't eProcurement prompt me to enter the delivery address?"  Effective today, a delivery address is required before you are able to shop.  Click on the link to learn the ins and outs of inputting delivery address information.

Frequently Asked Questions
Help!  Where's my completed shopping cart?
If you do not see your shopping cart in Check Status, click the Completed Items check box.
Who's my approver? 
There are two types of approvers: monetary and technical.  
* Monetary approvers are determined by EWS-defined spend and approval limits and the reporting structure of EWS.  eProcurement does not automatically route to cost center owners.  
* IT purchase requests require technical purchasing review by IT Procurement prior to processing.  Hence, you are able to see the buyers' names in the approval routing (Donna Ruff, Andrew Sikes, and other approver), in addition to the monetary approver's name, if necessary.
