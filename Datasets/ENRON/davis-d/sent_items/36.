Oh God Carolyn, 
Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.

You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.

Love your sister,

Dana

Dana,

Just wanted to say that I really miss you.  It saddens me that you are not
sitting next to me anymore.  Although I know that we are still friends, you
have been so much more.  I have grown spiritually because of your teaching.

I'm not sure what to say, except:

I REALLY MISS YOU!!!!
