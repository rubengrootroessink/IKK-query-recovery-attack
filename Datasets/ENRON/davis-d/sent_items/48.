Dana,
Please make a copy of the Hanson deposit for Pat.

Pat, 
We are just depositing it today.  Sorry, I got the check during my budget blitz and forgot to tell you.    

Thanks,
Tammy

Hey, Tammy - 

Have you seen a check from Hanson this month?  If so, can I get a copy?  And if not, I'll give 'em a call.

Thanks!
