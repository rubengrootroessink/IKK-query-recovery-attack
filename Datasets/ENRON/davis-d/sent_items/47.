Hey, Dana - 

No rush at all.  You can send it interoffice if you like. (EB 3339E)
Early next week would even be okay - I just wanted to make sure we had gotten it this month (since it apparently got lost en route to us last month).

Thanks!

Dana,
Please make a copy of the Hanson deposit for Pat.

Pat, 
We are just depositing it today.  Sorry, I got the check during my budget blitz and forgot to tell you.    

Thanks,
Tammy

Hey, Tammy - 

Have you seen a check from Hanson this month?  If so, can I get a copy?  And if not, I'll give 'em a call.

Thanks!
