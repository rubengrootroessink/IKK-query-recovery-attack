Thanks Dana for the update, would you let Kevin know also thanking him, also
I will not be at the meeting tonight me and Curtis are going to Good Hope
Church to meet with Shaun.  Will you let them know about the DJ from KSBJ,
and also Curtis was able to also confirm the former radio announcer from
KTSU Dewayne B. Cook. We may want to use both of them, or just one, the
committee needs to decide.  Let Bonnie know about the letterhead
confirmation so she can get that out to KSBJ.  I thought is we really should
utilize the DJ from KSBJ!  Thanks Dana talk to you later!  Grace
