Willie -

Have I sent this to you before?

> Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked
> beans.  He loved them, but they always had  an embarrassing and somewhat
> lively reaction on him.
>
> One day he met a girl and fell in love.  When it became apparent that they
> would marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the
> marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme sacrifice
> and
> gave up beans.
>
> Shortly after that they were married.
>
> A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and
since
> they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would
be
> late because he had to walk.  On his way home, he passed a small cafe and
> the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him.
>
> Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any
> ill effects before he got home.  So he went in and ordered, and before
> leaving he had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.  All the way home he
> putt-putted.  By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.
>
> His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited.  She exclaimed,
> "Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"
.
> She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the
> table and made him promise not to peak.
>
> At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on.  Just as his
> wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang.  She again
made
> him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer
the
> phone.  While she was gone, he seized the opportunity.  He shifter his
> weight to one leg and let it go.  It was not only loud, but ripe as a
> rotten
> egg.  He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned
> the
> air about him.
>
> He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on.  He raised
> his leg and RRIIIPPPP! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and
smelled
> worse.  To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the
> smell would dissipate.  He got another urge, this was the real blue-ribbon
> winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute
> later the flowers on the table were dead.
>
> While keeping an ear turned in on the conversation in the hallway, and
> keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for
the
> next ten minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin.  When he
> heard the phone farewells, he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded
> his hands on top of it.  Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of
> innocence when his wife walked in.
>
> Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner
> table,  After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold
and
> yelled, " SURPRISE!!".
>
> To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the
> table for his surprise dinner party.
