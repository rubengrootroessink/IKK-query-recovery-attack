An application called AP Data Viewer.  Accounts payable uses it to retrieve 
status on document such as invoice payments, wires, payment requests, etc....

I've just spoken to Pam and I think I'm requesting the right thing but using 
the wrong form.  Will you please reject this so I can start all over?  

Thanks
Dana
