Good Morning Marnie -
 
I have received the information that I needed to officially submit my request

Thanks

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?
