> Choking-what to do?
>
> Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust
> from their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and
> talking
> quietly about cattle prices.
>
> Suddenly, a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a
> sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes apparent that
> she is in real distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.
>
> " Kin ya swaller?" asks one of the Texans. The woman shakes her head.
>
> " Kin ya breathe?" asks the other. The woman, beginning to turn a bit
>   blue shakes her head again.
>
> The first cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt,
> yanks down her panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her
> thigh,up her buttock, and up to the small of her back. This shocks the
> woman
> to the point that with a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her
> mouth, and she begins to breathe again.
>
> The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a pull on his beer.
>
> His partner says, " Ya know, I'd heard of that there 'hind lick'
> maneuver, but I never seen anybody do it."
