Dana,
If you complete the course by 3:00pm on any weekday, we will print mail out
your Certificate of Completion the same day.  All Certificates are mailed
out via US Mail unless the student selects to have their Certificate sent to
them via our express delivery option.  We use Federal Express and charge an
additional $20.00 for this service.  We ask all students to allow 7-10
business days if their Certificate is mailed via US Mail or if you select to
have it sent FedEx your Certificate will be delivered the following day by
3:00pm.

If you have any other questions, please contact me at 888-547-9272.

Sincerely,
Jyll Campbell
Office Administrator
