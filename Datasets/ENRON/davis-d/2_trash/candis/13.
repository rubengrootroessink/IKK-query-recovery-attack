Hi Denise,

I really appreciate your note - and yes, it will be great and a tremendous
BLESSING to see my sisters in Jesus... I will place that on my calendar; I
generally take some time off that time of the year, so I will be looking
forward to it.  What a wonderful celebration it will be... Since I live so
far; no one really has to help me; but if they want to, it would be greatly
appreciated; but mostly I hope that lots of ladies come... When you told me
that y'all eat anything, that's fine with me; just let me know a few days in
advance, how many people you think will be coming and I'll be ready...I love
to have people come together in my home... it will be a blessing...

There are several reasons that I'm not available lately - the main one being
of course, I'm working approximately 12-15 hours a day - it is a very trying
time for me right now and I need all the prayers that I can get; please
continue to do that; the other reason is; I'm physically tired; I'm 53 years
old and have been having lots of responsibility for most of my adult years!

I was been blessed to be able to come back to Houston 12 years ago and was
afforded an opportunity to buy a new home and was at that time within 15
minutes of my job (not anymore); hence I live "quite" a ways from church -
by distance approximately 38 mi.; by time depending on whose doing the
driving(smiles) and which way you come approximately 45 min. So after years
and years of having to drive so far at least 6 days a week, I'm tired...

God bless you and the Women's Ministry for thinking of me and my family at
such a special time in any Christian's life and I look forward to the
fellowship.  Keep me posted.

Love and God's grace to you,
Ruby

Good Morning Ruby,

     I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.

     Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.

     We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
see you soon.  We really have been missing you.

Be Blessed,
Denise
