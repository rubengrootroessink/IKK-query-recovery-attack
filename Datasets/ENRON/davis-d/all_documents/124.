 I got a page from Evelyn M.  She said that Jackie Stewarts mother is in the
hospital with a growth on her pancreas and her baby Jarred is in the hospital
with with pneumonia.

We are standing for full healing for Jarred and no sickness or pathology for 
her
mother -- and for the Spirit of God to lead and guide Jackie and her family.

We will all stand on the promise of 1 Peter 2: 24  "Whoe his own self bare our
sins in his own body on the tree , that we, being dead to sins, should live 
unto
righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."

Love,
J.
