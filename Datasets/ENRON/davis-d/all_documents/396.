		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.
