 Please have your list of reviewers selected by Wednesday, November 1st.  
Supervisors should approve the lists as soon as possible in order to allow 
plenty of time for people to respond.   The deadline to complete all feedback 
and your list of accomplishments is Friday, November 17th.   I am aware that 
this may be the first time some of you will be involved in the Performance 
Evaluation Process.  Please do not hesitate to contact me or your immediate 
supervisor with any questions or concerns you may have.
