I'll get those tickets and include with the card.  I'll give the card to him 
Monday morning.

Thanks,
Marnie

No, I don't hand them out at all.  I was just following up for Nicole.  If 
would you like to handle the request below please let me know and I will 
forward the message to Nicole.

Thanks,
Dana

Hi Dana,

Can you please follow-up and see where the BD card for Kevin is?  It should 
be going around for everyone to sign.  When you do catch up with it, can you 
please add the movie tickets to the card after everyone has signed it?  The 
tickets are at my desk in the back of top drawer of the drawers(where the 
supply closet key is kept) on the left as you enter my cube.  On Monday 
morning, either before or after the breakfast, please be sure to give it to 
him.  We will celebrate the rest of the October celebrants birthdays at the 
same time later.   Thanks for doing this for me Dana!

Nicole :)
