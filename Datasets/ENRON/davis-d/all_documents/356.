You've guessed it!  Mid Year PRC is around the corner and we must start 
preparing for it.  

In preparation for the upcoming Mid Year Review Process, we will need your 
assistance with the Communication to your groups!  Therefore, we, the Human 
Resources Team for ENA, are requesting your assistance in generating all the 
communication materials needed to your group to make sure we don't leave 
anyone uninformed.   The first two pieces of communication coming your way, 
besides  the e-mail announcements that have recently been distributed, is the 
ever so famous Quick Reference Guides & the new PEP cards.  This time around, 
the Global Performance Mgmt team has decided not to have so many hard copies 
distributed  of the Quick Reference Guides because you are receiving the 
e-mail version copy, as you will find attached below.  The reason behind this 
is that ENA has been through this process for the last few years and the 
Quick Reference Guides contain alot of the same information as in the past, 
and seem to come in much more handy for employees tha are new to the company 
and to the process.

Next, the Global Perf Mgmt team has created this nifty PEP Card that has very 
minimal highlighted information for everyone. 
Please anticipate the PEP Cards in your group this Friday afteroon.  We will 
also get out a few hard Copies of the Reference Guides, but again, it is 
attached below, so please don't anticipate a copy of the Quick Reference 
Guides for everyone in your group.  

We will be sending a follow up e-mail to you all to advise you of the 
schedule for any training classes that will be available before the 
Performance Mgmt system opens on May 15th. 

We ask that you assist us in this process by distributing detailed e-mails 
such as this (addressed to all the Admn Asst's) to your group.  Your 
assistance and cooperation is critical, but most importantly greatly 
appreciated.

Please feel free to contact your HR rep with any questions you may have, and 
also, the PEP Hotline is already currently available to provide all employees 
with Perf Mgmt Assistance.



Thanks again.
