Envision is DocView's replacement.  Below are a few tips I hope will make 
using Envision a easier for you.

The GO TO Function is located at the bottom of the page between the green 
directional arrows (Page where document is displayed).  When using the GO TO 
Function please type in the page number you would like to go to and press the 
TAB key.  If you press the Enter key it will temporarily lock your 
application and it will be necessary to end the task causing an illegal 
logoff meaning your password will need to be reset or your must wait 20 
minutes to log back in.
It is important to keep your temp directory clean.  Please try to check this 
before you open any applications.  To check your temp directory to go to My 
Computer, double click on C:Drive, Temp Folder, you will want to delete any ' 
.tmp' documents.
Text Search drop down box  (Flashlight on screen where image is displayed).  
Type in the information you want to search on.  When the information is 
found, the information will be displayed  on a separate Yellow Page and the 
text you searched for will be displayed in red.  You can not print this 
page.  At the top of the top of the Yellow Page the following information 
will be displayed:  
  Occurrences of '2320-310' found in 8651330:200

 You searched for account 2320-310, it was found in document number 8651330 
on page 200.

 To view or print this information you must first close the text search box 
as well as the  Yellow Page.

 Go to the page of desired information using the GO TO as described above.  
To print the pages 
 containing the information searched for  (To print selected pages, you must 
be on the beginning page of the desired range),  You can now click on the 
Print Icon

It is recommended you access Envision through the Envision Web Page located 
at http//:home.fan.enron.com/envision.  
 Click on the QueryWizard icon (This page should be bookmarked)
 Click on Logon (will go to logon screen to type your username and password; 
tab to the logon key and enter)
 You will return to the Panagon IDM Home Page
 Click on Search to get to the Envision Web QueryWizard
