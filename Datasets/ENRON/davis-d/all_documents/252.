Good My Love,

    It is always a pleasure hearing from you. It is ironic that you e-mailed
me, I was on the computer and Aunt Pat asked me am I talking to you, and just
as her words came out, the computer chimed in and said you got mail. I check
it and low and behold there you were, My grandma Klumps Renee Davis.
     I got your e-mail Saturday and I ironed out the error in my web site,
therefore you can e-mail me at CHARLES200064@aol.com.
    I am going to place you on my buddy list so we can chat online. Write me
back when you get this message.
