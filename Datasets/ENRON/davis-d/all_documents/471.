Dana - 

Thanks a bunch for those Vastar fundings!  Just what I needed!

And of course, there's always more that I need...Since it's year-end, 
everyone is asking for up-to-date reports.  That's the bad news.  The good 
news is, I'm only missing the following items for Cypress and they're very 
recent.  I don't need them today, but I just wanted to let you know I'll 
probably be hunting them later this week.

Thanks again!

Pat
