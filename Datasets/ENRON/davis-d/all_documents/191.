Marnie,

How do you want to handle the review of companies 28C and 46L since I'm not 
in the Houston office?  If you would like, I can get someone here to review 
them.

Laynie

Hi All,

Attached is the 3Q E-Schedule Responsibility List.  There have been a few 
changes from 2Q due to new companies and staffing changes, so please review 
the attached list carefully.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
let me know.

As a reminder, please have these completed schedules to me by Friday 
morning.  Obviously the earlier I get them, the better off I am, so if you 
can get them to me earlier than that, I would appreciate it.




Thanks,
Marnie
