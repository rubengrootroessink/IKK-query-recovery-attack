Hi Dana,

I am the tax accountant for co72R, ENA CLO I Holding Company I LP.  Could you 
please explain the deferred debits account 
25149100?  I noticed in SAP that the account was reclassed to 59099900 (tax 
expense).  I appreciate your help and please call
me at 30925 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Amy
