Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be 
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the 
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to 
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room 
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project 
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go 
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please 
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I 
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.
