-----Original Message----- 


" To all of my friends, I do not usually forward messages but this is 
from my 
good friend Sheila Coleman Bantz, (She is our Soiree Queen)." 

She received this message from her friend Pearlas Sanborn who is an 
attorney.....If she says that this will work - it WILL work. After all, 
what have you got to loose? 

Anna V 

SORRY EVERYBODY.....JUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! 

I'm an attorney, and I know the law. This thing is for real. 
Rest assured AOL and Intel will follow through with their promises for 
fear of facing a multimillion dollar class action suit similar to the 
one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric not too long ago. 

We're not going to help them out with their e-mail beta test without 
getting 
a little something for our time. 

My brother's girlfriend got in on this a few months ago. When I went to 
visit him for the Baylor!/UT game. She showed me her check. It was for 
the sum of $4,324.44 and was stamped "Paid In Full". Like I said before, 
I know the law, and this is for 
real. 

If you don't believe me you can email her at ( jpiltman@baylor.edu .) 
She's eager to answer any questions you guys might have. 

Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them 
the largest Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL 
remains the most widely used program, Intel and AOL are running an 
e-mail 
beta test. 

When you forward this e-mail to friends, Intel can and will 
track it(if you are a Microsoft Windows user) for a two week time 
period. 


For every person that you forward this e-mail to, 
Microsoft will pay you $203.15. 

For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on, 
Microsoft will pay you $156.29 

and for every third person that receives it, 
you will be paid $17.65. 

Within two weeks, Intel will contact you for your address and then 
send you a check. I thought this was a scam myself, but a 
friend of my good friend's Aunt Patricia, who works at Intel actually 
got 
a check of 
$4,543.23 by forwarding this e-mail. 


Try it, what have you got to lose????
