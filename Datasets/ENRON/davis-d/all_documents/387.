No, it's not a behind!  I have obtained a copy of Two Dimensions
Preparatory Academy school application and I wanted to fax you a copy.  I
called them about 5 minutes ago asking the receptionist  about sixth grade
availability and as of this morning she was just beginning to separate the
applications by grade.  She informed me that  the children would be granted
admission on a first come, first serve basis.  This prompted me to ask her
if I could fax her a copy of the application; then she said that she could
only take the original.

I have made copies of the original and I will bring you one home this
afternoon.  The two don't look any different.  I told the receptionist
that I was off Friday morning and asked would it be too late if I brought
her the application then.  She assured me that this would be fine but, of
course, the sooner the better.  They won't start going through the
applications until around April or May.

If you have any questions call me later; but, in the mean time send me your
fax # if you would like to review the application before filling it out.
