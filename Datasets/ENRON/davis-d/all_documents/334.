I have some wires that need to be routed this morning so in between I can 
print these GLs for you. I will get them to you as soon as I can.

Thanks,

Dana,

Do you have time today or Monday to print some g/ls for me from Envision?  I 
seem to be having some troubles.  I need a 110, 210 and 211 for the following 
companies for May 2000:

446
596
949
51
58
479
21D

Please let me know as soon as possible if you don't have time to do this, or 
if you run into any problems.

THANK YOU!!!
Pam
