Good Morning Miss Dana!

You are so fresssssssssssssssssh!  It does feel good to be in a perfect
relationship.  You know there is a Scripture which talks about returning to 
your
first love -Jesus.   I stand on it  often but can't remember it's location in
the Gospel.  There is another which speaks to the smell and aroma of Jesus
Christ.  That's awesome too.

Have a blessed day.  Your joy gives me a boost.  Receive God's special 
goodness
for your life.

Love Ya'
Jacqueline Gayle
