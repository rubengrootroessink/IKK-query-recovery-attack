awww mannnn!!!!!
It seemed like a lot of stuff hit the fan on Friday. Not only there, but
here also.  It didn't hit me initially, but I got caught in some of the
backlash. I hope that your job is NOT in jeopardy. As for the changes. I can
go along with one of them. Guess which. The 8 - 5pm. I'll definitely be
changing to get off at 5pm or earlier. Oh watch your ego.  Its not all you.
I got a letter from Brian's Football team.  They have an equipment check
Saturday July 29 and practice starts that Monday at 6pm.  Being an Assistant
Coach, you know the drill.
As for this other nonsense about phone call/e-mail. If it ain't bad enough
that things.............Oh well. Do you feel me? #@$%*&*# Anyway, not
knowing the full extent what and why it happened (Your Blow Up) and my ever
evolving situation with a new twist.

I think I've said enough for now.

Yes you told me that you saw us.  I blew up on someone (my boss).  I'm not
ready to talk about it  yet because it causes me to vividly relive the
whole thing and I'm just not ready to revisit that situation yet.  Although
I can say this....2 changes will be taking place because of this.
1. I'm changing my hours for 8:30 to 5:30   TO  8:00 to 5:00
2. I'm only going to communicate with you through e-mail

If you need something that's urgent,  you can leave me a message and I will
respond via email or go to another phone and call you.  (Yes , it's that
serious)
Anyway - not the end of the world just FYI.

Good morning to you also. My weekend was very quiet. You would have been
proud of me. ??????? I would have preferred it a different way. Oh well.
The
explosion in question, is that the one at the refinery? Or is it another
one
regarding you blowing up on somebody.  Oh yes did I say that I saw you and
Kandace on Friday nite around 6:30pm. Sorry I didn't drive today. Funny I
checked my voice mail most of the weekend, the moment I didn't check I get
a
call.

C'ya
