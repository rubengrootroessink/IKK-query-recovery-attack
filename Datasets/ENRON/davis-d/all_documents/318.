Hey waz up. How is your day going so far? Lunch?
This new way is weighing heavily on my mind. You wrote "2. I'm only going to
communicate with you (Bobby) through e-mail" What's really going on here?
Did it have anything to do with me. I guess what I'm really trying to say
is, ............. You know what I'm thinking.

Yes you told me that you saw us.  I blew up on someone (my boss).  I'm not
ready to talk about it  yet because it causes me to vividly relive the
whole thing and I'm just not ready to revisit that situation yet.  Although
I can say this....2 changes will be taking place because of this.
1. I'm changing my hours for 8:30 to 5:30   TO  8:00 to 5:00
2. I'm only going to communicate with you through e-mail

If you need something that's urgent,  you can leave me a message and I will
respond via email or go to another phone and call you.  (Yes , it's that
serious)
Anyway - not the end of the world just FYI.

Good morning to you also. My weekend was very quiet. You would have been
proud of me. ??????? I would have preferred it a different way. Oh well.
The
explosion in question, is that the one at the refinery? Or is it another
one
regarding you blowing up on somebody.  Oh yes did I say that I saw you and
Kandace on Friday nite around 6:30pm. Sorry I didn't drive today. Funny I
checked my voice mail most of the weekend, the moment I didn't check I get
a
call.

C'ya
