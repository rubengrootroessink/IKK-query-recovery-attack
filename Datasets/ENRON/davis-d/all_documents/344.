Good morning Duck, I especially liked this prayer this morning and wanted
to share it with you. Please don't forget to put money aside for Candis on
tomorrow.  I wouldn't ask for it if  I hadn't been spending money left &
right
for additional things like extra food and toiletries for company. She will
also
need spending money. The 1-day pass is $13.00 .

: FW: Today's Verse -- Matthew 6:15


Always be willing to forgive....Jesus forgives you!





Thursday, June 15, 2000

VERSE:
   But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not
forgive your sins.
    -- Matthew 6:15


THOUGHT:
   Can you think of a more frightening thought than God not
forgiving our sins?  We know how much he paid so our sins could be
forgiven!  We know how much he loves us!  We know how much he wants
us to be in relationship with him!  So why would he withhold his
forgiveness?  Because we demonstrate that we have not received it
or do not understand it!  God is gracious and he will not accept
those who are not gracious!

PRAYER:
   Holy God, there are those that I do find it difficult to
forgive.  Please, right now while I'm praying, soften my heart by
your Spirit, cleanse my soul of any bitterness or resentment, and
please empower me to let go of the pain of the past and forgive.  I
thank you for this grace to not only be forgiven, but to also
forgive.  In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
