A few hints on usernames & passwords:
Passwords are case sensitive and must be entered exactly as entered when 
created.   You can cut and paste your USERID and/or password from the 
confirmation email (Welcome) to the authentification dialogbox.

Please save the confirmation email (Welcome).  It gives you the username  and 
password you will need to use each time you register online.  Use a password 
that is easy for you to remember.

To register for a Technology Training class online, you must first give 
yourself a password. Click the "Specify Password" button below and you will 
be prompted to enter a password.  Then click the "Tech Train Setup" button 
and  you will be set up to login to the Technology Training intranet site. 
You will receive an eMail confirmation containing your login name and 
confirming your password.
