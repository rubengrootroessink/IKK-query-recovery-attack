> IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR SAFETY FROM THE DIRECTOR OF
> TRAINING AT THE US ARMYMILITARY POLICE SCHOOL
> PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ AND PASS ALONG !
>
> A friend stopped at a pay-at-the-pump gas station to get gas.
> Once she filled her gas tank after paying at the pump and started
> to leave the attendant inside came over the speaker. He told her that
> something happened with her card and that she needed to come inside to
> pay.
>
> The lady was confused because the transaction showed complete and
> approved.
> She told him that and was getting ready to leave but the attendant once
> again
> urged her to come in to pay or else. She proceeded to go inside and
> started arguing with the
> attendant about his threat.
>
> He told her to calm down and listen carefully:
> He told her that while she was pumping gas, a guy
> slipped into the back seat of her car on the other side and he had called
> the
> police. She immediately became scared and looked out there in time to see
> her car door open and the guy slip out.
>
> The report is that the new gang initiation thing is to bring back a
> woman's body part.
> One way they are doing this is crawling under girls/women's cars  while
> they're
> pumping gas or at grocery stores in the night time. Then they are cutting
> the lady's
> ankles to disable them in  order to kidnap them, kill and dismember them.
> The other way is slipping into unattended cars and kidnapping the women to
> kill and
> dismember them.
>
> Please pass this on to other women, young and old alike. BE extra careful
> going to and from your car at night. If at all possible, don't go alone!
> This is real!!
>
> The message:
> 1. ALWAYS lock your car doors, even if you're gone
> for just second.
> 2. Check underneath your car when approaching it
> for reentry, and check in the back before getting in.
> 3. Always be aware of your surroundings and other
> individuals in your  general vicinity, particularly at night!
>
> Send this to your friends so as many females as possible can be made
> aware of this new threat, and so your friend will not be the next victim.
>
> Thanks,
> Barbara Baker, Secretary
> Directorate of Training
