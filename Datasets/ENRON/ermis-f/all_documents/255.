Mark,

We have been aware of this project for some time and have watched it with 
interest.

Questar just (within the last month) bought the development rights fully from 
Beta Energy.  They have drilled one salt test well and have extensively 
tested the salt.  They HAVE NOT tested the disposal zones as yet and that is 
a critical component.

They are planning on developing four caverns for a total of 14 Bcf working 
gas. First caverns should be available in about 2 years.  At that time they 
will abandon the three small reservoirs on their system and replace the 
deliverability and services with the Yellow Creek Facility.

We have initiated conversations with them regarding providing base gas as 
well as horsepower.

Storage Project Open Season



Questar Pipeline Company is holding an open season to determine the 
feasibility of constructing a salt cavern storage facility near Evanston, 
Wyoming to provide firm natural gas storage service.  This facility will 
provide multiple cycle, high deliverability storage service that will be 
connected to several interstate pipelines.

All interested parties are invited to submit requests during the open season, 
which will begin on Wednesday, May 2, 2001 and close on Friday, June 1, 
2001.  Depending on customer interest and the scope of the project, the firm 
storage is anticipated to be in service by June 1, 2004.

A description of the open season, including application requirements, is 
attached to this message in Microsoft Word format.  The Precedent Agreement 
form is also attached as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file.  The Precedent Agreement 
must be completed and e-mailed or faxed to Questar Pipeline by 5 p.m. on 
Friday, June 1, 2001.   Questar Pipeline's fax number is (801) 324-2980.  
Precedent Agreements for the storage service should be faxed to Attention:  
Tom Myrberg.

If you are unable to open the PDF file containing the Precedent Agreement and 
would like us to fax you a copy, please call Derbie Flygare at 801-324-2041 
or Mary Kay Olson at 801-324-5873.
