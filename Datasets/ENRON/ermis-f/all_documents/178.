On-Line Natural Gas Reverse Auction

? ? 
The East Coast  Natural Gas Cooperative has secured over 25 Bcf of natural 
gas for  several Northeast distributors in an auction that worked in 
reverse.  For the first time, the ECNGC staged a reverse auction where it is  
the potential sellers who bid - downward - to win a sale to a buyer.  Nearly 
50 packages of natural gas demand were on the procurement  block at various 
times during the 4-day auction period, conducted  last week.
