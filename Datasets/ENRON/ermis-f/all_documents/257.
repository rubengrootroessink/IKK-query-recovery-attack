		 Subject: Questar Pipeline's Southwest Wyoming Storage Project Open Season


Questar Pipeline Company is holding an open season to determine the 
feasibility of constructing a salt cavern storage facility near Evanston, 
Wyoming to provide firm natural gas storage service.  This facility will 
provide multiple cycle, high deliverability storage service that will be 
connected to several interstate pipelines.

All interested parties are invited to submit requests during the open season, 
which will begin on Wednesday, May 2, 2001 and close on Friday, June 1, 
2001.  Depending on customer interest and the scope of the project, the firm 
storage is anticipated to be in service by June 1, 2004.

A description of the open season, including application requirements, is 
attached to this message in Microsoft Word format.  The Precedent Agreement 
form is also attached as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file.  The Precedent Agreement 
must be completed and e-mailed or faxed to Questar Pipeline by 5 p.m. on 
Friday, June 1, 2001.   Questar Pipeline's fax number is (801) 324-2980.  
Precedent Agreements for the storage service should be faxed to Attention:  
Tom Myrberg.

If you are unable to open the PDF file containing the Precedent Agreement and
