Please refrain from running reports on the EnronOnline databases between 7 am 
- 2 pm CST / 1pm - 8pm GMT, which is our peak usage period.

These reports slow down EnronOnline trading.

We will have a solution to this problem within the next few weeks, but in the 
meantime, we appreciate your cooperation with the above.

Thanks,

Dave
