																						agreed governments will promote more trade and investment,  70% agreed that 
globally consistent accounting principles will be  established by 2010, and 
over 80% believed the companies dominating  the utility business in 2010 will 
be multi-national. Those results  validate the strategies of companies using 
mergers and acquisitions  to create global giants. However, events such as 
the IMF protests in  Prague and WTO protests in Seattle this year highlight 
what could be  growing opposition to globalization. Politics can veer off in  
unexpected directions, so it is unwise to be so committed to any one  view of 
where voters and government policy are moving that you lack  contingency 
plans. Utilities can minimize their risk in this  uncertain era, while at the 
same time moving forward decisively.  They can use management tools such as 
scenario-based planning, real  options valuation, and computer modeling - 
these approaches provide  the means 
																						
																						
																						
																						
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			for understanding the array of strategies available and for  defining the 
significance of choosing one or the other.  Additionally, the studies show 
that utilities need systems,  processes, and a culture that make them 
versatile - that permit them  to nurture 'just-in-case' technologies, 
products, and businesses,  spot leading indicators of change, and switch 
strategies without  confusion and delay. The two reports are segments of The 
Utility  Executive's Field Guide to the Future. Part 1 summarizes the 
results  of a global survey of 185 decision makers in utilities,  
corporations, and engineering firms in 15 countries, while Part 2  focuses on 
the outlook for regulatory policy and globalization. Part  2 is based not 
only on the survey results but also on 75 subsequent  interviews with utility 
CEOs, power managers in large corporations,  government officials, and others 
around the world. The research also  included an intensive review of economic 
studies, government  reports, opinion surveys, and other sources. For more

																																			?  ? CMS Energy and Saudi Arabia's al-Zamil Group plan to jointly  construct 
power and water desalination plants in Saudi Arabia. The  two companies have 
agreed to work together to finance, construct and  manage new power and water 
plants on a 50/50 basis, with CMS serving  as operator of the facility. Saudi
