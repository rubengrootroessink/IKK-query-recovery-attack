Dear Clients,
Due to unpredictable hardware failure, last night's migrations to Outlook had 
to be postponed. You ability to use email via your Lotus Notes client remains 
100% available at this time. The Outlook Migration Team will contact you to 
inform you of your re-scheduled date of migration. We apologize for the 
inconvenience this has caused you and thank you for your patience and 
understanding.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Emmanuel
Emmanuel Mangin
