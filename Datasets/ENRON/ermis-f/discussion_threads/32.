Subject: Evaluation of Skilling Floor Meeting

Thanks for your help in turning out a great crowd for the Skilling floor 
meeting today.  We really appreciate your support.

If I could impose upon each of you one final time, I would like to ask for 
your help in distributing the attached evaluation form for the Skilling floor 
meeting.  Please pass them on to your fellow employees and encourage everyone 
who attended to fill it out and return it.  The name and address of where to 
send the completed form is included on the evaluation. 

Thanks in advance for your support.

Eric
