On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team
