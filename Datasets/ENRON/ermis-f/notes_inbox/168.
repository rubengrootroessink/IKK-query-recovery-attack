Frank,
Robyn thinks you don't check your email, but we'll see....Harvard wants to 
buy 1/2 day of the PGE/Malin (buy PGE/sell Malin) at 50 cents. We would like 
to make at least 1/2 cent on the deal. They haven't even seen the historical 
data yet, but they trust your explanation, which is why they're anxious to 
start building a position.
Thanks,
Russ
