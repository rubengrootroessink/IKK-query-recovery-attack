Frank - I'm forwarding the email I received from Enserco regarding the 
penalty for our failure to take the full volume on days 1 and 18 on deal 
#423705.  As I explained to Suzanne, I would not have paid this had they 
invoiced me for it but Enserco is a Netout customer and we were in a net 
receivable position this month so they deducted this amount out of what they 
paid me.  As the penalty seems to be legitimate, can I get you to set up a 
new deal in Sitara to offset the receivable?  If you agree with their 
calculations, can you set up a positive Demand charge of $2,405.03 with Enron 
as the Purchaser and Enserco as the Seller?

Please reply to this email with your approval (or disapproval) of their 
calculation and let me know when you have the demand charge set up (or not).

Call me if you have any questions.
...Chuck
