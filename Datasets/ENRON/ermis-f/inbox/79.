Latest NFL Player News

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://footba! ll! 299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 106 yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&ran! do! m=718&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.! 2&! random=718&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.




Shaun Alexander! , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team. <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187382&>Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1204&>, ! WR! SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
Conway caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01! 
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Banks had a mediocre game, throwing for 216 yards with one score and an interception against Dallas. He is no better than a reserve on your Fantasy team. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ismail had a big game for Dallas, catching three passes for 93 ya! rd! s and a touchdown against Washington. Ismail has easily been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but he's still a gamble for Fantasy owners. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Smith had his best game of the season, rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries vs. Washington. If coach Dave Campo gives him enough carries, Smith still has the talent and experience to be a productive Fantasy player.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
The Kansas City Chiefs are reportedly interested in Kennison. The team is expected to bring the wideout in for an interview and a physical as early as Monday, with the intent of signing him. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Hardy suffered an apparent knee injury during Sunday's game against Oakland. He did not return to the contest. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Chandler suffered a sprained left ankle in the second quarter of Sunday's game against St. Louis. He was replaced by Michael Vick.! 

Troy Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Brown caught eight passes for 59 yards at New York. The flashy New England wideout has not reached the 100-yard receiving mark in his last six games.

David Patten <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Patten caught six passes for 60 yards at New York. He will be an occasionally spectacular, yet inconsistent wideout during the final weeks of the Fantasy season.

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=2352! 34! &>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Moss caught two passes for 40 yards against New England. The rookie receiver has already injected new life into the New York passing game, but he won't do enough statistically to help Fantasy owners.

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Coles caught three passes for 63 yards and a TD against New England. The New York wideout has quickly emerged as his team's top receiver.

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Alexander left Sunday's game against Dallas in the second quarter due to an ankle injury. His return to the game is questionable. 

Obafemi Ayanbadejo <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1869&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Ayanbadejo caught a five-yard TD pass and scored on a nine-yard run against the Colts. He will be a regular goal-line threat for the RB-starved Ravens during the final weeks of the NFL regular season.

Moe Williams <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Williams rushed for 111 yards and caught three passes for 27 yards against the Colts. Williams, who also lost a fumble, took advantage of a leaky Colts defense, and he still has to prove he can perform well on a regular basis.

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Pollard caught four passes for 80 yards and a TD at Baltimore. Right now, he is arguably the most reliable TE in Fantasy Football.

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Rhodes rushed for 42 yards and caught six passes for 25 yards, but he fumble! d ! twice. The physical Ravens' defense kept him off balance, yet Rhodes should still be a dependable Fantasy RB during the next few weeks.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/02/01
The Vikings held Ward to three catches for 37 yards. Expect him to rebound quickly from his quiet performance.

Plaxico Burress <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=718&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Burress caught six passes for 86 yards against Minnesota. The second-year man is looking better as a route runner and mid-range receiver.
