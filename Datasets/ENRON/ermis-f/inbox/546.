Workable strategies for monitoring and assessing risk-management operations. 
To corporate energy managers, risk management may mean understanding the risks and variable value of different commodities. Power market players need to run their plants and structure contracts to ensure that they'll be able to service debt and achieve a solid return. As new entrants join the power market, bringing risk-management experience from other sectors, existing players need to get up to speed quickly. The Survival Guide supplies exactly what information these professionals need to get started.
"Power Market Risk Management: A Survival Guide" focuses exclusively on risk management for power markets.
Risk management isn't gambling-it's business sense!
