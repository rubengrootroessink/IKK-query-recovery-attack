Latest NFL Player News

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Christian, who is dealing with an elbow injury, practiced with the team on Wednesday. He's listed as probable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis, but he's a risky play for Fantasy owners. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/13/01
Smith underwent an MRI on his ailing knee this week, which revealed some cartilage damage. He practiced on Wednesday, however, and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against In! di! anapolis. He'll likely split carries with both Rodney Thomas and Bob Christian, so starting Smith is a real gamble. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/13/01
Davis missed practice on Wednesday due to a case of the flu. However, the big tailback is expected to return to practice this week and will start in Sunday's game against Philadelphia. 

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , Finneran could emerge as a starter in the next few weeks. Finneran has impressed Head Coach Dan Reeves, who has rewarded the receiver with more looks in the offense recently. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
According to the New York Post, Jurevicius will likely miss Saturday's game against Arizona. Jurevicius did not practice on Wednesday, and hasn't seen much improvement in his injured hamstring. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Morgan missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questi! on! able for Sunday's game. He is recovering from a shoulder injury. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Shea missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a shoulder injury and will be re-evaluated on a daily basis. 

Shannon Sharpe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Mike Riley has now altered his stance on using Brees anytime soon. "For the sake of this team, for what we've tried to accomplish and what we're still trying to accomplish this year, I want to show them in every way that we're trying to win," Riley said. "I think Doug is our best chance to win. There are arguments to (play Brees), for sure. But I think you just get into a whole lot of stuff." 

Keith Poole <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Poole's bruised ribs have! i! mproved, and he is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He is expected to start against the Chiefs.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/13/01
Smith missed practice on Wednesday because of his two sprained ankles. He will be a gametime decision again this week.

Roland Williams <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12829&>, TE OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Williams is day to day with knee and ankle injuries. He is expected to play on Saturday.

Marvin Minnis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random! =4! 599&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Minnis is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to start on Sunday.

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/13/01
Griese (concussion) was held out of practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game with the Chiefs. If Griese practices on Friday, he may be able to play. If Griese can't play, Gus Frerotte will start in his place.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
! Smith might start at QB Sunday, replacing the injured Jon Kitna. Coach Dick LeBeau will wait until Friday to make a decision, but he assumed that Kitna's sprained middle finger on his passing hand won't improve enough to let him play against the New York Jets. Avoid using Smith. He is an erratic passer and is too risky a selection at this point in the season. 

Rob Johnson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
The Buffalo News says there is a possibility Johnson might return for the season's final game. "The healing has gone very well," Gregg Williams said. "He's probably got another couple of weeks of the bone healing. We hope that he'll be able to get back into the practice situation within a couple of weeks and start to work on the field and be able to do some non-contact things. We'll continue to evaluate how it moves from that point forward." 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Kitna couldn't make a fist or throw a football Wednesday, so the Cincinnati Bengals are getting Akili Smith ready to start at quarterback for the first time this season. Coach Dick LeBeau will wait until Friday to make a decision, but he assumed that Kitna's sprained middle finger on h! is! passing hand won't improve enough to let him play against the New York Jets. Avoid using Kitna. He didn't play well when he has been healthy. 

Dominic Rhodes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=236986&>, RB IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Rhodes is day to day with back and wrist injuries. He is expected to play on Sunday.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Wilkins missed Thursday's practice with a hamstring injury. He is not expected to play on Sunday.

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/13/01
Brunell did not practice Wednesday but will play Sunday, according to the Florida Times-Union. He is expected to practice on Thursday. Brunell is recovering from a lingering quadriceps injury and an injured finger.

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/13/01
Warrick missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He is suffering from a hip injury. 

Curtis Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.! 2&! random=4599&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 12/13/01
Martin was rested by Herman Edwards on Wednesday. "His whole body hurts," Edwards told the New York Post. Martin is expected to start on Sunday.

Richie Anderson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1141&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/13/01
Anderson is day to day to with a wrist injury. He is expected to play on Sunday.

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Seattle coach Mike Holmgren has confirmed he will start Watters over Shaun Alexander this week against Dallas. The move makes things very difficult for Fantasy owners who have depended on Alexander for most of the season. If Watters becomes the featured back once again, which has been suggested, Alexander may be rendered virtually worthless to Fantasy owners. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/12/01
Now that Ricky Watters has been named the starting tailback in Seattle, Alexander's role in the offense will likely be diminished. As a result, starting Alexander on your Fantasy team becomes a serious gamble during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Steve Christie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1378&>, K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Richey, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.

Drew Brees <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=235197&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
The San Diego Union-Tribune says Mike Riley has left the door open for Brees to possibly play in San Diego's final three games. "There's no denying that the question will come up about Drew and we just haven't gone through it. I don't have to make that decision on this Monday, so I haven't really decided how to do that yet." Brees lacks the experience to be a useful player during the Fantasy playoffs. ! 

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/12/01
Ward is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable because of a thigh injury. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/12/01
Bettis expects to play Sunday, despite being listed as questionable for Sunday's game. "I plan to play," Bettis told The Baltimore Sun. When the paper asked how he could be so certain, Bettis said, "Because I'm going to play. That's very clear." 

Marco Battaglia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=146! 96! .2&random=4599&key=1324&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/01
Battaglia was claimed off waivers by the Washington Redskins on Tuesday. The former Cincinnati Bengal will replace the injured Stephen Alexander as the team's third tight end.

Frank Player News

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/13/01
Smith underwent an MRI on his ailing knee this week, which revealed some cartilage damage. He practiced on Wednesday, however, and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. He'll likely split carries with both Rodney Thomas and Bob Christian, so starting Smith is a real gamble. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Smith caught nine passes for 119 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. The veteran continues to be a reliable Fantasy player, and is a must-start every week. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/09/01
Dillon had 86 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Jacksonville. His rushing totals have been down in recent weeks, but Dillon's potential to post solid Fantasy numbers in any given week is hard to ignore. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/09/01
Thrash caught five passes for 74 yards against San Diego. Thrash has not been a dependable receiver in recent weeks, and he may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season.

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/07/01
Plummer is playing better of late, but his production hasn't been worthy of starting consideration on your Fantasy team. He's a backup at best, and his poor history vs. Washington is enough to avoid using him in Week 13. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/07/01
Favre had a solid game against Jacksonville on Monday night, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. He'll have some success in Week 13 against Chicago, whose pass defense is ranked 30th in the league this season. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/07/01
Hearst (foot) practiced without incident on Thursday, and will start on Sunday against San Francisco. He's been one of the hottest tailbacks in the league in recent weeks, so be sure to put him into your starting lineup. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/07/01
Schroeder had a solid game vs. Jacksonville on Monday night, and seems to be out of Brett Favre's doghouse. He's a must-start against Chicago, whose secondary is questionable at best. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4599&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
