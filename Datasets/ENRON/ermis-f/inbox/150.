Thank You For Playing! 

This is the final Fantasy Football newsletter of the 2001 season. It was our pleasure to host your league and we hope you'll allow us the pleasure again in 2002. Best of luck in the playoffs, if your team was fortunate enough to make it. If you're in a Football Commissioner league, you'll have access to your league throughout the offseason. Rosters, standings and other important data will be saved. Check your site often for offseason player news and articles. If you're in a Fantasy 2001 league, we'll post this season's prize winners in a few weeks on our Fantasy Home Page <http://fantasy.sportsline.com>. Click "Fantasy Winners" in the left navigation panel.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Aaron Giersdorf, Mankato, MN 

Should I take a chance and bench Emmitt Smith and/or Keyshawn Johnson? I need to start two running backs among Emmitt, Tyrone Wheatley, Zack Crockett and Mike Alstott; and two receivers among Keyshawn, Chris Chambers, Qadry Ismail and Antonio Freeman. 

Answer - GG 

There's no doubt that you should start both Smith and Johnson. Both players have produced solid numbers in recent weeks, and will be prominent parts of their respective offenses in the weeks to come. Wheatley and Crockett are far too risky to start at this stage of the Fantasy season, so we'd advise going with Alstott, who has seen his role in Tampa Bay's offense increase over the past few weeks. Go with Freeman at WR; he's facing a shaky Titans secondary. 


Question - Kenik Hassel, Seattle, WA 

Which quarterback should I start this week: Daunte Culpepper or Steve McNair? 

Answer - GG 

Culpepper is expected to start against Detroit in week 14, but you never know what will happen with Dennis Green calling the shots. Reports last Sunday stated that Culpepper would start vs. Tennessee, but then Green decided to play Todd Bouman at the last second. We like the matchup against a porous Lions unit, but if there's any question at all about Culpepper's status, we'd side with McNair, who has been one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football over the past six weeks. 


Question - David Sant, Cincinnati, OH 

Who should I start as my second RB alongside Marshall Faulk: Shaun Alexander or Lamar Smith? 

Answer - GG 

Now that Ricky Watters has been named the starting running back in Seattle, Alexander is a gamble. He'll likely get a few carries in the game, but whether or not he gets enough looks to be productive is uncertain. As a result, we suggest either signing Watters off waivers (if available), or simply going with Smith against San Francisco.

Tip of the Week 

Michael Phillips, Fort Lauderdale, FL: Is there any question that Jay Fiedler is a good Fantasy quarterback? He's put up nine touchdowns in his last three games, including four against Indianapolis on Monday night. Unless you have a QB like Kurt Warner, Jeff Garcia or Donovan McNabb, starting Fiedler should always be a consideration.
