Glenn should be able to play Sund! ay! if he practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald. He has not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patriots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Brian Natkin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=236970&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Natkin started Monday's game. He was used to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entire game but had only one catch for 18 yards. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01

Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kelly suffered both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over ! Da! llas. He will have an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time.

Grbac started in Monday's game despite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchdown, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have overcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week.

Warner admitted to STLtoday.com that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelphia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun extensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. "I don't anticipate this being a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured," Martz said. "He has played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine." 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/13/01

Dyson played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears he has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touchdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains healthy.

Defensive end Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (ankle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely return to action this weekend against San Francisco. 
! Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/13/01

According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's game against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandler missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chandler will be a! va! ilable for the game. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3309&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/12/01

Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this week, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis. Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bledsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, who is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarterback.
