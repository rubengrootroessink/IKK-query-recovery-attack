Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01

George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though. 

Elvis Joseph <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=236843&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/17/01

Todd Pinkston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 12/17/01

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters will undergo an MRI on his sprained ankle. The injury is not believed to be serious enough to keep him out of action on Dec. 23. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/17/01
McNabb injured his wrist on Sunday. He should be able to play in Week 15.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free! A! gent Updated 12/17/01
Bouman's injured right thumb will be re-examined on Monday. His status for the upcoming game against Jacksonville is uncertain. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/17/01
X-rays on Garcia's ribs following Sunday's game revealed no damage. He is expected to start on Saturday. 

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Frerotte is expected to miss the rest of the season with a separated shoulder. Jarious Jackson will likely back up Brian Griese for the r! es! t of the year. 

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/17/01
Dillon suffered a finger injury on Sunday. He is listed as probable for Week 15.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Smith will definitely sit out Cincinnati's Week 15 game. He injured his hamstring against the Jets Sunday and might miss the rest of the season.

Peerless Price <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Price injured his right ankle on Sunday. He will be evaluated on Monday. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/17/01
The Buffalo News says Henry will undergo X-rays to determine the severity of his injured right knee. "It's pretty sore right now, so I'm not sure what's going to happen," Henry said. "It's a part of football. It was an awkward play. I got caught in the turf and the knee just went. Hopefully, it's not too serious." 

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Gramatica may have a torn ACL. He was scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and might miss the season's final three games. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Mason caught eight passes for 107 yards and a TD against Green Bay. Right now, he is one of Fantasy Football's best wideouts in terms of consistency. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Hicks rushed for 142 yards and a TD as the Titans used him often to give a banged-up Eddie George some breathers. Expect to see more of Hicks from the Titans in the final weeks of the year, although George will remain the team's top RB option.

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
The Titans limited Freeman to 42 yards on two catches. If your team is moving on in the playoffs, however, you can expect better numbers from Freeman in the weeks ahead. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Green had an awful outing at Te! nn! essee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Banks' numbers were subpar against Philadelphia. He threw for 186 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in the game, and isn't reliable enough to be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 12/16/01
Jackson caught four passes for 85 yards against Dallas. He continues to be one of the most underrated and reliable receivers in the AFC. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 12/16/01
McNabb had a decent outing against Washington, throwing for 235 yards and two touchdowns. He ! di! d throw three interceptions as well, but McNabb will be a solid starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/16/01
Alexander carried seven times for 27 yards and a TD in relief of an injured Ricky Watters on Sunday. He saw limited action until Watters went down in the second half, and his playing time may continue to be sparse when Watters is healthy.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/16/01
Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he's a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.

Quincy Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/16/01
Carter had a horrible game on Sunday, going 14-of-33 for 135 yards with an interception against Seattle. He has no value as a Fantasy player in any league. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2117&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/16/01
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this wee! k ! on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. "It's a small scope, not a big deal at all," Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. "Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know." Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive.
