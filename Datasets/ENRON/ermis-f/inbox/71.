Don't Miss the Playoffs Because You Missed a Player Update

How Does Your Team Stack Up? 

In head-to-head leagues, the Standings, Breakdown page shows your team's record versus each team in your league. If your league uses head-to-head record to break ties in the standings, this is the place to see how you stack up with your close competitors. The All column shows what your record would be against each team if you had played that team every week this season.

Question - Dennis Taylor, Columbus, OH 

I have both Brian Griese and Tim Couch. Who should I start in Week 12? 

Answer - GG 

It's tough to bench Griese, but this is one week where you should consider it. Griese will likely be without wide receivers Rod Smith and Keith Poole, which leaves him to throw to Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole, two very inexperienced players. Denver will likely run the ball quite a bit against Miami as a result, which will limit Griese's productivity. Couch may not be the most reliable QB, but he does face a porous Tennessee secondary. Unless Smith is able to go for Denver, we'd have to side with Couch this week. 


Question - Rev. Mark A. Young 

Who would you recommend starting this week: Tom Brady, Brian Griese or Doug Flutie? Or should I pick up Kordell Stewart, Mark Brunell or Alex Van Pelt and start one of them? 

Answer - GG 

Considering the quarterback depth that your league obviously has, we'd suggest picking up Van Pelt this week. Griese may be without his starting receivers and Brady faces a tough Jets secondary. Flutie has a good matchup against Seattle, but he's been inconsistent. Van Pelt has an excellent grasp of Buffalo's West Coast offense, and he's facing a San Francisco unit that has been vulnerable to the pass all year. We'd hold onto both Griese and Brady, and suggest dropping Flutie for Van Pelt. 


Question - Paul Hershey, Corning, NY 

I've got a big showdown for first place in my league this week. I need to start three WRs out of these four: Cris Carter, Joe Horn, Marty Booker and Curtis Conway. Which three would you choose? 

Answer - GG 

When you're in a must-win situation, you've got to stick with your big guns. Carter always has the potential to find the end zone. Booker faces a pathetic Detroit secondary, and Horn has a great matchup vs. Carolina's league-worst defense. Despite the fact that Conway has a great matchup against Seattle CB Willie Williams, you've got to go with Carter, Booker and Horn.

Tip of the Week 

Benjamin Collins, Brooklyn, N.Y.: Tiki Barber may have started the season slowly, but he's been one of the most reliable running backs in the league over the last three weeks. It seems Jim Fassel is losing more and more faith in Ron Dayne, which means more carries and consistent Fantasy production for Barber.
