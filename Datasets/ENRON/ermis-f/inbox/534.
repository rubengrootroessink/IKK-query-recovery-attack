FOOTNOTES 

1)  This notification supersedes all previous Notices of Available and Potentially Available Capacity and is subject to change at any time.

2) Other receipt and delivery points utilizing the described 
    transportation corridor may be available. 

3)  Potential Availability date for the Capacity. 

4)  Contracts shall include the following subordinate scheduling 
    provision if the requested term extends into a critical operational 
    period: 

To the extent Shipper's nominated volumes are not scheduled solely 
due to Shipper's subordinate scheduling priorities set forth below, 
the monthly base reservation charge will be discounted to $0.00 per 
Dth for that quantity only. 

Section 14.1(c)(i) of Northwest's tariff is modified to condition 
Shipper's primary corridor rights through any mainline constraint 
from the Sand Springs receipt point to the Ignacio Bondad (or 
LaPlata-TW) delivery point(s) to have a scheduling priority which 
will be subordinate to the scheduling priority for any firm shipper 
with primary corridor rights that encompass and extend beyond the 
Sand Springs to Ignacio Bondad (or LaPlata-TW) corridor.
