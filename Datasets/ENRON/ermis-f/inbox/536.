PROS Energy Profit Optimization Workshop 
Showcase of Best Practice Presentations

November 1, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced that its Energy Profit Optimization Workshop, being held November 5, at PROS' offices in Houston, TX, will showcase  informative presentations from industry leaders in the energy industry with focus on best practice and implementation experiences.

The following are a sampling of synopses of presentations to be offered at next week's event:

* Albert Viscio of Accenture will be answering the question, "What is revenue management and why do I need it?"  Albert will discuss how Revenue Pricing Optimization (RPO) is the next leading edge business practice.  With the potential to have broad and deep business impact within the Energy Industry, revenue management focuses on profitability and creation of shareholder value.

* Soli Forouzan of MindSpan, Inc., and former VP at PG&E, will pose the question, "What kind of strategy are you using to manage your trades?"  Soli will examine how trader profits are generated, common mistakes, how to optimize assets, and then managing and exercising options.  

* Kurt King of Duke Energy North America wishes us to contemplate, "What makes a successful software implementation?"  Kurt reviews the objectives, team assembly, communication, challenges, benefits, and future initiatives.  

* Glen Schrank from @TheMoment, Inc. asks, "Why do I need a revenue management-enabled auction and how can optimized dynamic commerce help me?"  With FERC strongly encouraging pipelines to file auction proposals, companies can create new web-based supplier-friendly markets while supplementing current revenues in the process.  

"At PROS, we are seeing an increasing demand for pricing and revenue management across the energy industry.  PROS is uniquely positioned to deliver the revenue management tools that have proven to be a strong competitive device, giving our clients a distinctive competitive advantage." says Matt Johnson, senior vice president of PROS' energy group.
