Latest NFL Player News

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Anderson carried four times for 23 yards against San Diego. He won't play much now that Terrell Davis is healthy. Anderson was a disappointment when Davis was out as well, as he failed to match his 2000 form.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Davis rushed for 83 yards on 33 carries and caught five passes for 36 yards against the Chargers. He is definitely healthy enough to start for most Fantasy teams, but ! Da! vis doesn't run with the same burst that once made him an elite back.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Flutie threw for 165 yards, one TD and was intercepted four times by Denver. Right now, Flutie is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Conway caught three passes for 111 yards and a TD at Denver. He continues to be a reliable,a nd sometimes explosive Fantasy player.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/11/01
Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 11/11/01
Garcia, who is dealing with a sprained knee, had another big game against New Orleans. The Niners quarterback threw for 252 yards and four touchdowns, further establishing himself as a top-notch Fantasy quarterback. 

! Joe Horn, WR NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Horn had a big game against San Francisco, catching six passes for 99 yards and two scores. Horn now has six touchdowns in his last three games against the Niners, and is putting up some big numbers after a slow start to the season. 

Aaron Brooks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133233&>, QB NO - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Brooks had a huge game on Sunday, throwing for 347 yards and two scores against San Francisco. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him.

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Buckhalter rushed for 66 yards and a TD against the Vikings. But he will see his numbers and playing time dwindle now that Duce Staley is healthy and capable of being a dependable RB again.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/11/01
Staley rushed for 146 yards and a TD, and caught six passes for 85 yards against the Vikings. There should be little doubt about his health or current value after his stellar outing.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Moss caught seven passes for 95 yards and a TD at Philadelphia. He padded his numbers well after the outcome of the game was decided, and he still does not have a 100-yard receiving game this year.

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Bennett did not play at Philadelphia. Doug Chapman started in his place and finished with 19 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards.

Byron Chamberlain <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1496&>, TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chamberlain left Sunday's game after injuring his leg. He finished with two catches for 23 yards.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/11/01
Boston had another huge game on Sunday, catching nine passes for 137 yards and a touchdown against the N.Y. Giants. He's become one of the best Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/11/01
Pittman was unimpressive on Sunday, rushing for only 54 ! ya! rds in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pittman is best used when the matchup is to his advantage, and not as a weekly Fantasy starter. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Hilliard had only 43 yards receiving against Arizona, but he did score a touchdown in New York's 17-10 win. The score was Hilliard's third in his last three games. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
Barber had a solid game against Arizona, compiling 118 yards rushing in the Giants' 17-10 win. Barber hasn't been very reliable as a Fantasy player this season, but he is useful when the matchup is right. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Wayne caught only two passes for 18 yards against the Dolphins. The rookie receiver is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 11/11/01
Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and three TDs. N! o ! defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.

Chris Chambers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Chambers had the best game of his rookie year, catching three passes for 113 yards and two TDs. He has certainly become a great asset to Fantasy teams that are thin at WR or need help because of injuries or bye weeks. 

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/11/01
McCardell caught five passes for 61 yards and a TD against he Bengals. The veteran wideout has been unreliable for much of the year, and he may follow his good performance with a quiet week.

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/11/01
Mack rushed for 71 yards and two TDs agains! t ! the Bengals. He may have restored Jacksonville's faith in him after some questionable outings, but Mack is anything but reliable.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 11/11/01
The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.

T.J. Houshmandzadeh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=235086&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Houshmandzadeh was Cincinnati's leading receiver at Jacksonville, catching six passes for 62 yards. Don't add him to your roster until he proves he can be a consistent contributor to the Bengals' passing game. Houshmandzadeh is a rookie, and he may fade away very quickly.

O.J. Santiago <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=1633&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Santiago caught a 12-yard TD pass against the Steelers, and finished with two catches for 14 yards. Don't pick him up unless you are desperate for TE help, because Santiago has always been a Fantasy disappointment.

Kevin Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133324&>, WR CLE - Hunter Updated 11/11/01! Johnson caught a respectable eight passes for 62 yards against Pittsburgh's tough defense. Opposing secondaries are having trouble containing the third-year wideout, and he remains a must-start player every week.

Kris Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133236&>, K PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Brown made five of six field goal attempts at Cleveland, including the game-winner from 32 yards. Despite his troubles in Week Eight, Brown has been a reliable kicker for most of his three-year career in Pittsburgh.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Burress caught four passes for 44 yards at Cleveland. The second-year wideout has yet to produce respectable Fantasy numbers on a consistent basis,

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=88&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01
Price caught three passes for 59 yards and a TD at New England. He continues to play well as defenses pay extra attention to Eric Moulds.
