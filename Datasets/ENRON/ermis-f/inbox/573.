Latest NFL Player News

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Bennett is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. The Vikings will observe him in practice before deciding how much he will play. He may share carries with Doug Chapman.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/07/01
Taylor has been upgraded to questionable for this week's game. His condition will be assessed at practice before the Jaguars make a decision. He still appears to be a very risky start for Week Nine.

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/07/01
Alexander (ribs) is listed as questionable for this week's game. Larry Parker would likely start in his place if he can't play.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Burress is suffering from a shoulder injury but will start Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agen! t ! Updated 11/07/01
Zereoue, still recovering from a shoulder injury is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He missed last week's game because of the injury. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/07/01
Bettis is listed as probable for Sunday's game but will start. He is suffering from a sore wrist. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Dwight will miss Sunday's game with a collapsed lung. Reggie Jones will be the No. 3 receiver against Denver.
! Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/07/01
According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, Flutie (concussion) is expected to start against the Broncos. The veteran QB said he is feeling fine. "I thought I felt great after the game, and I felt better this morning and I feel even better this afternoon; so, as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine," he said. He will be re-evaluated on Thursday, but the results are not expected to be of any consequence.

Freddie Mitchell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
According to published reports, Mitchell has moved past Na Brown and is now Philadelphia's No. 3 receiver. He will see an increase in playing time as a result, and might be worth picking up in deeper leagues. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/07/01
According to the Charlotte Observer, the MRI performed on Weinke's injured shoulder showed no serious damage. Carolina's medical staff has indicated that Weinke should be able to play on Sunday against St. Louis, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.

Jim Harbaugh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1030&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Harbaugh was signed by the Carolina Panthers on Tuesday. He'll serve as a backup to Chris Weinke, and won't have much value as a Fantasy player this season. 

Bill Gramatica <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Gramatica suffered a dislocated shoulder last weekend against Philadelphia, but he isn't expected to miss any playing time. He'll kick wearing a shoulder harness to protect the injury, which shouldn't get in the way of his kicking duties. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Brunell is dealing with a strained quadriceps and may miss practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati is uncertain at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
According to Head Coach Jim Mora, there has been no new medical news on James' injured knee. He is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami at this point. 

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/06/01
Pathon (foot) hopes to be ready for Sunday's NFC East battle against Miami. The Colts' wideout has missed four games and is ! li! sted as questionable for the contest. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Moss (knee) will have his workload increased in practice this week. The rookie wideout will be listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Kansas City, but don't expect him to post big numbers even if he does play. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, DT TEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Dwight suffered a collapsed lung during Sunday's loss to Kansas City. He's expected to be released from the hospital on Tuesday, but there is no defintive timetable for his return to the filed. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Faulk participated in p! ra! ctice on Monday and looked as though his knee was holding up very well. "He's obviously been keeping in pretty good cardiovascular shape while he has rested the knee," coach Mike Martz told STLtoday.com. "He looked fine out there today. We probably could have played him (Oct. 28 against New Orleans) but this is the best thing to do. He's in good shape." If Faulk is on your Fantasy roster, be sure to get him into your starting lineup this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/06/01
According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Hasselbeck will start this weekend's game against Oakland. However, coach Mike Holmgren wouldn't dismiss the possibility of Trent Dilfer playing if Hasselbeck struggles in the game. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Buckhalter suffered a shoulder sprain during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is expected to participate in practice on Wednesday, however, and will be available for this weekend's game against Minnesota. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/06/01
Wheatley was inactive for Monday night's game against Denver due to a knee injury. The big tailback is day-to-day. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m=! 1591&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Glenn has told the league that he is suffering from chronic depression, which is the reason for his recent problems with the New England Patriots. As for his status for this weekend's game against Buffalo, coach Bill Belichick told the Boston Globe that "he (Glenn) will be questionable this week. He's making progress." 

Travis Henry <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Henry suffered a hip injury Sunday but is expected to play this week. He was able to practice. 

Dedr! ic! Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1711&> , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Ward (foot) has been cleared to practice this week. Ward said that his foot was improving, but didn't seem too confident that he would be available for this weekend's game against Indianapolis. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Taylor, who missed his fifth consecutive game this weekend, looks as though he'll miss Sunday's game against Cincinnati. Taylor will go through some individual drills this week, but coach Tom Coughlin doesn't seem optimistic that he will be ready in time to play against the Bengals, saying that he expects Taylor to return "at some point." 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Despite splitting a few snaps with Mike McMahon in the first half of Sunday's game against San Francisco, Batch is still Detroit's No. 1 quarterback. "Charlie is the quarterback of this football team," Mornhinweg told the Detroit Free Press. "I want to make that clear, and I made that clear to Charlie as well as Mike. But it is important in developing a quarterback to get him some time in a league game when the game is still on the line." 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Davis started Monday night's game against Oakland, and was impressive in his return from injury. T.D. rushed for 70 yards on 17 carries in the game, and will likely remain Denver's featured back for the remainder of the season barring another injury. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Leaf will get his first start! a! s a member of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday against Atlanta. He'll replace Clint Storner, who will now serve as Dallas No. 2 quarterback. Leaf looked decent in his short outing against the Giants, but he's not worth a roster spot on your Fantasy team at this point.

Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/05/01
Hearst bruised his knee in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable for this week's game against the Saints. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/05/01
Schroeder missed his second consecutive game Sunday because of an ankle injury. However, he continues to make progress and should play this week, according to published reports. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=188183&>, Active RB Updated 11/05/01
Smith suffered a bruised shin Sunday. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/04/01
Mathis caught one pass for minus-two yards against the Patriots. He is definitely not performing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy reserve.

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Smith had a huge game against Tennessee, catching seven passes for 120 yards. He is one of the top receivers in Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Thrash caught four passes for 80 yards and two TDs at Arizona. Don't expect good numbers from Thrash every week, because he tends to disappear against more established defenses.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/02/01
Plummer has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him as a Fantasy player is always a gamble. He had a solid game against the Eagles on October 7, but we'd avoid using him this time around as Philly looks to avenge an early-season loss to the Cards. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/02/01
Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneers this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 10/28/01
Bruce left Sunday's game in the second quarter with a reported broken left pinky tip, but was able to return in the second half wearing a splint.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 10/28/01
Dillon rushed 27 times for 184 yards and two TDs, and also caught three passes for 18 yards and a score. While he has been an inconsistent back for much of the season, Dillon can tear apart poor run defenses like Detroit's. He's still a reliable weekly Fantasy starter.

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
