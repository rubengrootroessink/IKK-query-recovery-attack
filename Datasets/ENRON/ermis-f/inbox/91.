Latest NFL Player News

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McMahon, being groomed as Detroit's quarterback of the future, will make his first start for the winless Lions at Tampa Bay this week. He will replace Charlie Batch, who likely is out for the season after separating his right shoulder in Sunday's 13-10 loss at Chicago. Ty Detmer will back up McMahon, and a third quarterback will be added later in the week. McMahon does throw downfield with some success, and he is worth consideration as a Fantasy backup. 

Jets <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=20&>, DT NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
CB Aaron Glenn may miss up to four weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. His loss may mean the defense will blitz more often to protect the secondary, but the unit may also allow more passing yards in the next few games.

Jay Riemersma <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Riemersma suffered a concussion in Sunday night's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/03/01
George aggravated an ankle injury on Sunday. He should be able to play at Minnesota next week.

Desmond Clark <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Clark suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game. His current status is day to day.

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Kennison was signed by the Chiefs. Chris Thomas was released to make room for him on the roster. It is doubtful that Kennison will make much of an impact in Kansas City, even if he can work his way into the starting lineup.

Dave Moore <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/h! tt! p://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Moore suffered a hip pointer injury Sunday and might miss Tampa's upcoming game. The Tampa Tribune reports that he is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday. Steve Yoder will start if Moore is unable to play. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
The Tennessean says X-rays were negative on McNair's left elbow. He is expected to play against the Vikings next week.

Fred Beasley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=15! 43! &key=12207&>, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Beasley suffered a stinger in Sunday's game. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that he is listed as probable for the upcoming game against the Rams. 

Mike Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/03/01
Vanderjagt suffered a pulled muscle in his back on Sunday. His statsu for the Dec. 10 game against the Dolphins is unclear.

Tony McGee <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1325&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
McGee will miss the rest of the sea! so! n with a sprained knee ligament. He may be replaced by Nick Williams or Brad St. Louis. Neither player has any apparent Fantasy potential.

Kevan Barlow <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 12/03/01
Barlow missed Sunday's game because of an injured shoulder. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Shawn Bryson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133240&>, RB BUF - Neal/McKay Updated 12/03/01
Bryson (ankle) was inactive for Sunday's game at San Francisco. His status for the team's next game is unclear.

Tywan Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=146523&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Mitchell will be the starting tight end now that Terry Hardy is out for the rest of the season. However, don't expect Mitchell to catch too many passes. He only has 14 receptions in 20 NFL games. 

Terry Hardy <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Hardy suffered a torn knee ligament Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. The Arizona Republic reports that Tywan Mitchell will be the starting tight end in his absence. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp! /e! link?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/03/01
Thomason, suffering from a hyperextended knee, is not expected to practice Monday, according to The Philadelphia Daily Times. Thomason will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/03/01
Owens overcame a foot injury and played in Sunday's game. He caught six passes for 72 yards and touchdown. 

Tim Brown <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Brown had a solid game, catching five passes for 63 yards and two scores against Arizona. With Jerry Rice on the other side of the field, Brown is having one of the best season of his illustrious career. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/02/01
Gannon threw for 302 yards and three scores against Arizona. He did throw two picks as well, but he's still an elite Fantasy quarterback. 

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Boston had another great game, catching six passes for 1! 06! yards and a touchdown against Oakland. Boston continues to be one if the best wide receivers in Fantasy Football. 

Michael Pittman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 12/02/01
Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.

Tony Martin <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Martin caught six passes for 97 yards against the Rams. The veteran wideout has seen better days, though, and he is not a reliable Fantasy wideout. He will occasionally post respectable numbers, but he will also have many quiet weeks.

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/01
Christian rushed one time for five yards against St. Louis and caught four passes for 16 yards. He became a minor factor in the game as the Falcons fell behind early. Christian is still worth a reserve spot on any Fantasy roster.

Marshall Faulk <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 12/02/01
In addition to 70 rushing yards, Faulk caught six passes for 128 yards and three TDs. There seems to be no way of containing the best back in Fantasy Football. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 12/02/01
Warner bounced back from a forgettable Week 11 performance by tearing up the Falcons for 342 yards, four TDs and no interceptions. There should be little doubt that he is still capable of taking any Fantasy team to a championship this year.

Shaun Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 12/02/01
Alexander rushed for 87 yards and a TD against the Chargers. Defenses are stacking their fronts against Alexander, but he is still managing to score enough to be a must-start player for any Fantasy team.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Hasselbeck threw for 202 yards, no TDs and no interceptions against the Chargers. While he has certainly cut down on his mistakes, Hasselbeck doesn't challenge defenses downfield and he doesn't deserve a spot on most Fantasy rosters.

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/02/01
C! on! way caught three passes for just 34 yards at Seattle. Still, he has remained healthy this year and should be a solid Fantasy wideout during these important final weeks.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/02/01
The Seahawks held Flutie to 195 passing yards, no TD passes and intercepted him twice. The veteran QB has been a disappointment for most of the year and he will not be a dependable Fantasy player in the final weeks of the season.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1543&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/02/01
Davis had only 53 yards rushing on 17 carries against Dallas on Sunday. He continues to have a mediocre season, which makes it tough for Fantasy owners to start him every week.
