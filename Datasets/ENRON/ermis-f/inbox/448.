Frank,

Let me know if this looks OK.

The transaction is for delivery into Kern Pipeline, South of the Kern Muddy Creek Compressor station.  The Seller must communicate its election of the metered delivery point to Buyer by 10:30 Central Prevailing Time on the business day prior to the Effective Date (the "Election Deadline").
