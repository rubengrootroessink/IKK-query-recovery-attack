Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.

Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01
Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.

Mark Bruener <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1360&>, TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1140&>, RB OAK - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01
Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.

Steve McNair <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01 
Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01
Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.! sp! ortsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup. 

Jay Fiedler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12363&> , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01
Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01
Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in." 

Benjamin Gay <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in some of the games," Davis said. "We'll see." 

Kevin Lockett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins. 

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis. 

Cecil Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133349&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Giants <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=19&>, DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01
According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=133276&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

Ravens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=3&>, DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. 

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&r! an! dom=4658&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01
Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. "I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job," Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible. 

Donald Hayes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12431&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.! 

Terry Hardy <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=12423&>, TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4658&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01
Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.
