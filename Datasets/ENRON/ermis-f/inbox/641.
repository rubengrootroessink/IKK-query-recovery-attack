NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Michael Vick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235253&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Vick will return to his backup role this weekend against Green Bay. He may see some playing time in certain situations, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/16/01
Mathis has done nothing this season in Atlanta, making him virtaully worthless to Fantasy owners. If you've still got him in a deeper league, continue to sit Mathis until he shows he's worth a starting n! od! . 

Reggie Kelly <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Kelly is doubtful for Sunday'a game against Green Bay due to a knee injury. He'll be replaced by Alge Crumpler, who may take over the starting job from Kelly from this point on. 

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player this season, and things won't change this weekend against Green Bay. The Packers sport a very tough pass defense, so starting Martin isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Gary may get consideration for a starting spor this week. The Broncos have apparently lost some faith in Mike Anderson. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, Smith returned to practice on Thursday. There is still no offical word on hsi status for Sunday's game.

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1116&>, RB! D! ET - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Stewart (ankle) did not practice again on Thursday. He may miss Sunday's game against the Cardinals. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/15/01
According to published reports, it has been confirmed that James will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. He will need surgery to repair a torn ACL. Dominic Rhodes will start at RB for the rest of the year, and Kevin McDougal should be his backup.

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Graham may post good numbers at Oakland. San Diego will look to the air often if the Raiders concentrate on stopping the run.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Tomlinson may have a disappointing outing this week. Oakland's defense will be fired up to stuff the run after a very poor performance at Seattle.

Jerry Rice <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/15/01
Rice has not helped his Fantasy owners much in recent weeks. But he is still worth a start against the inconsistent San Diego secondary.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01
Brown should have another good game this week. He always seems to play his best in intradivisional matchups.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/15/01
Don't expect good numbers from Garner this week. A returning Tyrone Wheatley will steal some of his carries against the tough San Diego run defense.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/15! /0! 1
Wheatley is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against San Diego. He is a risky start because of his recent inactivity and the strength of the San Diego defense.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/15/01
Gannon should rebound from a quiet week. Expect good numbers in an important home game with San Diego.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/15/01
Gary was inactive for the last two games, but he will now see carries again because Terrell Davis is injured. He still may not play e! no! ugh to help most Fantasy teams.

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Clark will continue to get regular looks from Brian Griese. The Denver QB will now lean heavily on his TEs, because injuries and other factors have crippled the Broncos at wideout.

Dwayne Carswell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Expect Carswell to be a regular target for Brian Griese this week. Injuries at WR will make the Denver TEs more important in the passing game.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/15/01
McNabb had a huge game against Minnesota last weekend, and should have more success on Sunday at Dallas. He's a top-notch Fantasy quarterback worthy of a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Freddie Mitchell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Mitchell sprained his ankle last Sunday, but is expected to play this weekend against Dallas. He may emerge as Philadelphia's No. 2 receiver with a few more good outings, and is worth stashing away on your roster. 

Keith Poole <http://football2! 22! .fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Poole may see a lot of action at wideout for the Broncos this week. Injuries have hit Denver hard, possibly pressing Poole into extra playing time. He has never been a reliable Fantasy wideout in the past, so don't use Poole until he proves he can be a factor in Denver's passing game.

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Pinkston has fallen out of favor with Fantasy owners after a strong start to the season. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Pinkston isn't even worth a roster spot at this point. 
Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Lewis had a subpar game against Minnesota last week, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He had two touchdowns against Dallas earlier in the year, and is worth starting in Week 10. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/15/01
Thrash has caught four touchdown passes in his last two games, and is worth starting this week against Dallas. He may be inconsistent at times, but when Thrash is good, he is capable of putting up solid Fantasy numbers. 

Brian Griese <http://foot! ba! ll222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 11/15/01
Griese's stats may be mediocre this week. The Broncos have been hurt by injuries at wideout, and Griese may have trouble finding open receivers downfield.

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Galloway was terrible last week against Atlanta, mostly because of Ryan Leaf's inability to get the ball downfield effectively. Unless you play in a deeper league, Galloway isn't worth starting in Week 10. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Harris had two catches for eight yards and a touchdown last weekend, but he's been unreliable overall. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Harris isn't worth a roster spot. 

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/15/01
Jackson has performed well this season, and he is a good start again this week. Expect him to challenge the Buffalo secondary throughout the day.

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random! =2! 950&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most reliable reciever this season, which isn't saying much. Unless you play in a very deep league, the "Rocket" is better left on the waiver wire. 

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2950&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/15/01
Alexander should have another standout game at Buffalo. It is doubtful the Bills' defense will be able to handle him, and he should be good for 100-plus yards and at least one TD.
