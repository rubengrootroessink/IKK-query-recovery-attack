NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Boston caught six passes for 132 yards against Washington. Right now, because of his consistently high production, Boston is arguably the most valuable receiver in Fantasy Football.

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Jenkins caught three passes for 33 yards and a TD against Washington. He has become a surprisingly reliable receiver for the Cardinals in recent weeks.

Jerry Rice <http://f! oo! tball299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 12/09/01
Rice had five catches for 57 yards and a touchdown against Kansas City. The future Hall-of-Famer is having a solid season, and could be a valuable player during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Gannon had a decent outing against Kansas City, posting 195 yards passing, two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) and an interception. Gannon is one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football, and is a solid start during your league's playoffs.

Zeron Flemister <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=192169&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Flemister caught a two-yard TD pass at Arizona. He has become a regular target for Washington in goal-line packages.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don't depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league! =b! ige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Holmes had a monster game against Oakland, posting 277 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. He's become one of the most feared tailbacks in the league, and has been one of Fantasy Football's most pleasant surprises. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Davis rushed for 110 yards and a TD at Arizona. He will give Fantasy players good yardage numbers during the playoffs, but touchdowns will continue to be a rarity for Davis.

La! ve! ranues Coles  <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
The Steelers limited Coles to 20 receiving yards on three catches. Coles remains a good receiver for the Fantasy postseason, though, because he has been a regular TD threat all year long.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Chrebet caught five passes for 63 yards at Pittsburgh, including his first TD (18 yards). The Jets wideout has been unreliable for most of the year, and he remains a risky start during the Fantasy playoffs.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/09/01
Ward had a huge game against the N.Y. Jets on Sunday. The talented wide receiver had 10 catches for 124 yards, and has become a pretty reliable Fantasy player this season. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Fuamatu-Ma'afala started in place of the injured Jerome Bettis on Sunday against the N.Y. Jets. He posted 50 yards rushing and a touchdown, which are respectable Fantasy numbers for a reserve tailback. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Louis. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly useless for most of the season.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Garcia threw for only 146 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice at St. Louis. Expect Garcia to quickly put such a forgettable outing behind him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsisten! cy! , but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Ricky Proehl <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1208&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Proehl caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Don't expect such numbers from Proehl on a regular basis. He rarely becomes a featured target for Kurt Warner.

Duce Staley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 12/09/01
The Chargers held Staley to 21 rushing yards on 15 carries, but he caught five passes for 88 yards and a TD. The Eagles will find many ways to utilize Staley as the NFL regular season wi! nd! s down. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Thrash caught five passes for 74 yards against San Diego. Thrash has not been a dependable receiver in recent weeks, and he may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season.

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Flutie threw for 307 yards, two TDs and was intercepted twice at Philadelphia. He has been too inconsistent to take most Fantasy teams deep into the playoffs.

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Graham caught five passes for 110 yards and two TDs at Philadelphia, but he did not catch a ball in the second half. The veteran wideout has been inconsistent all year long, yet he is still capable of having some big games. 

Tom Brady <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=187741&>, QB NE - Martin Updated 12/09/01
The Browns made Brady look bad. He threw for 218 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice. Still, Brady has played too well this year not to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs,

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Glenn caught four passes for 67 yards against Cleveland. If you desperately need receiving help right now, Glenn won't disappoint you if he stays on the active roster.

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Smith rushed for 76 yards and two TDs on 21 carries against Cleveland. He has always been a great red-zone runner, so expect a lot of scores from Smith during the Fantasy playoffs even if his yardage totals disappoint you at times.

Tim Couch <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Couch threw for 244 yards, no TDs and three interceptions at New England. Right now, Couch is not playing well enough to start for any Fantasy team, and he is a very shaky backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/09/01
Jackson rushed for 34 yards on 16 carries at New England. The rookie running back hasn't been very reliable this year, and he is a risky start during the Fantasy postseason.

Richard ! Hu! ntley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1456&> , RB CAR - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Huntley rushed for 67 yards and a TD on 23 carries at Buffalo. The Carolina RB won't visit the end zone often during the Fantasy playoffs, and his yardage numbers will always be mediocre.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Finneran had six catches for 92 yards against New Orleans on Sunday. If you play in a very deep league, you may want to give Finneran a reserve spot on your roster. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Muhammad started at Buffalo and caught eight passes for 104 yards. He also lost a fumble. Despite the turnover, Muhammad remains a good Fantasy wideout when healthy. 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Chandler started Sunday's game against Atlanta despite a slight ankle injury. He posted 233 yards passing, but was held without a touchdown. He's been very inconsistent in recent weeks, so avoid depending on him too heavily in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1894&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Van Pelt threw for 277 yards, one TD and one interception against Carolina. His erratic play makes him a risk during the Fantasy playoffs.
