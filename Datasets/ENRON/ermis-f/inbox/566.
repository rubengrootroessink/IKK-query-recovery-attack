ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS: 


Due to the continuing warm weather and other operational considerations, Public Service Company (PSCo) cannot accept either:

Imbalance payback gas from Shippers/Nominating Agents, or 
More gas than what is currently confirmed from each plant into PSCo's system. 



Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days November 3 - 4; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas days November 3 - 4.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.


Sincerely, 


Monica Nedbalski 
Senior Transportation specialist
