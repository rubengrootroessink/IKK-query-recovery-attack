Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1203&> , WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/26/01
Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is still unclear. 

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/26/01
Gadsden (hamstring) might miss his second consecutive game this week. Chris Chambers may start in his place again. 

Fred Taylor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs. 

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/26/01

Raghib Ismail <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this week. 

Joey Galloway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming week is unclear right now. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/26/01
Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't play. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/26/01
Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/25/01
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season. 

Ahman Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=12404&>, RB GB - Hunter Updated 12/23/01
Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.

Frank Player News

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff run. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but The Cincinnati Post reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3696&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.
