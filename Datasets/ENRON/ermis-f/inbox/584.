Latest NFL Player News

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/08/01
Garner rushed for only 36 yards on seven carries in his first meeting with Seattle this year. Expect much better numbers this time against a shaky Seattle run defense.

Jerry Rice <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 11/08/01
Rice caught five passes for 91 yards and two TDs against the Seahawks earlier this year. Seattle may focus more closely on him this time, but he should still be good for at least one TD catch.! 
Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Brown caught three passes for 47 yards against the Seahawks in the teams' first meeting this year. He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice (two TDs in first meeting) in this week's matchup. 

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Gannon passed for three TDs and no interceptions in his first meeting with the Seahawks this year. He will still post good numbers in their second meeting, but his performance may be less sepctacular now that Shawn Springs is healthy.! 
Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 11/08/01
Staley has been a major disappointment this season, rushing for only 111 yards and one touchdown. He's losing carries to rookie Correll Buckhalter as well, and has become a very risky Fantasy player. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/08/01
McNabb has been impressive for the Eagles this season, compiling 13 total touchdowns with only four interceptions. He'll be primed for his matchup against Daunte Culpepper this week, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Darrell Jackson <http://f! oo! tball222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/08/01
Jackson is performing in a pivotal AFC West game for the Seahawks this week, but he remains a risk. Matt Hasselbeck hasn't been able to get him the ball on a consistent basis, and the Raiders' secondary is formidable. Only start Jackson if one of your top receivers is injured or has a bye week.

Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Lewis had four receptions for 57 yards last weekend against Arizona, breaking a streak of three subpar games. He remains one of the nest Fantasy tight ends in the league, and is worth starting this week against Minnesota. 

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Galloway had a big game against the N.Y. Giants last weekend, and he's worth starting this week against Atlanta. The Falcons have the worst defense in the league against the pass, so Galloway has a chance to put up some solid numbers. 

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Clark has been a respectable Fantasy TE this year, because Brian Griese has made good use of two tight end sets. He is definitely worth starting in an important AFC West game against the Chargers.

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Harris had 49 yards receiving against the N.Y. Giants last weekend, but he's done nothing for Fantasy owners for the most part. Unless Dallas begins to incorporate him into the offense more, Harris isn't worth holding onto. 

Raghib Ismail <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Ismail has been inconsistent this season, but he may actually be worth starting this week. He'll face an Atlanta secondary ranked last in the league against the pass, so taking a gamble on him in deeper leagues is advisable. 

Dwayne Carswell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1328&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Carswell has been a regular target for Brian Griese this year. he will definitely get some important looks in a divisional matchup with the Chargers.

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Jones has only 14 carries in his last three games, and isn'! t ! getting enough playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration. Unless Michael Pittman gets hurt, Jones is worthless to Fantasy owners at this point. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/08/01
Smith has three 100-yard games in his last six meetings with the Chargers. Expect another big game from Denver's marquee receiver this week.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/08/01
Plummer continues to be a mediocre Fantasy quarterback, but you may actually want to consider starting him this week against the Giants. He threw for 318 yards and two TDs in his last game against the G-Men, and has five TDs in his last three games against New York overall. 

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Minnis is a risky start at New York. He has the size to challenge the Jets' defense, but lacks the experience needed to test their cornerbacks on a consistent basis.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Sanders has put up some decent numbers over the last two weeks, but he's an unreliable Fantasy player overall. You may want to consider using him in deeper leagues that start three wideouts, however, but he's not worth the gamble outside of those formats. 

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Green should post respectable numbers on the road against the Jets. Successful running from Priest Holmes should set him up for regular downfield passes.

Anthony Becht <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Becht has not been a consistent pass-catching threat this year. Still, he may be open for some TD opportunities against the Chiefs.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/08/01
Chrebet has been a big disappointment this season. He is a risky Fantasy start, even against the vulnerable Chiefs defense.

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1164&>, RB SF - Frank Updated 11/08/01
Hearst bruised his knee during last Sunday's game against Detroit, but he is listed as probable for this weekend's game against New Orleans. Hearst may struggle against the Saints' tough r! un! defense, so consider placing him on reserve if your roster allows it. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/08/01
Coles has become a regular scoring threat for the Jets. He is definitely worth a start against the mediocre Kansas City secondary.

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/08/01
Owens continues to be one of the top wideouts in the league, catching nine passes for 125 yards and two scores against Detroit last week. Owens has had some big games in the past against this week's opponent, New Orleans, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners. 

Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 11/08/01
Expect another big day from Martin. The Chiefs' defense will have great difficulty stopping the centerpiece of the New York offense.

Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 11/08/01
The Kansas City defense is definitely vulner! ab! le to the pass, but the Jets haven't been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers. Don't start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB.

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/08/01
Price has been an up-and-down performer this year. Don't start him unless one of your regulars is on a bye or is injured.

Eric Moulds <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Moulds will engage in a another classic war with CB Ty Law this week. Look for mediocre yardage numbers, but Moulds may catch a TD pass.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/08/01
Johnson won't put up great numbers at New England. The Bills may start to lean on the run more often this week.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4994&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/08/01
Brown should have a good game this week. The Patriots should have little problem throwing the ball at home against Buffalo.
