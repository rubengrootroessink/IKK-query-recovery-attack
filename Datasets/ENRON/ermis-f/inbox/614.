Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.

Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is "unretiring," according to the Denver Post . While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.! c! om/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/13/01! 
Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Jones re-injured his shoulder in Sunday's game. He had an MRI done on the shoulder Monday. His status for this week's game is uncertain. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Brunell is expected to play this week, despite suffering from a sore leg. However, he is not expected to practice. Nevertheless, look for Bru! ne! ll to be a productive No. 1 QB this week. 

Chad Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Johnson might play on a limited basis in Sunday's game against Tennessee. He will be re-evalauted on Tuesday, according to The Cincinnati Post. Johnson has been sidelined for a month because of a fractured collarbone.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Glenn should be able to play Sunday if he practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald . He has not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patriots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Brian Natkin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=236970&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Natkin started Monday's game. He was used to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entire game but had only one catch for 18 yards. 

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/13/01
Wycheck left Monday's game briefly because of an ankle injury but returned. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Wycheck had two catches f! o! r 18 yards Monday. 

Jeff Garcia <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 11/13/01
Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Kelly suffered both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over Dallas. He will have an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Grbac started in Monday's game despite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchdown, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have overcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/13/01
Warner admitted to STLtoday.com that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelphia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun extensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. "I don't anticipate this being a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured," Martz said. "He has played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine." 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/13/01
Allen played in Monday's game against Tennessee but suffered a fractured left hand in his first and only carry of the game, during the second quarter. His status for Sunday's game is uncertain. ! 
Kevin Dyson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 11/13/01
Dyson played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears he has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touchdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains healthy.

Panthers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=5&>, DT CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
Defensive end Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (ankle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely return t! o ! action this weekend against San Francisco. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/13/01
Weinke (shoulder), who missed Sunday's 48-14 loss to St. Louis, has been cleared to practice. His status for this weekend's game against San Francisco is still unclear, however, but coach George Seifert expects him to play. 

Chris Chandler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01
According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's game against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandler missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chandler will be available for the game. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/12/01
Davis has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and will be out 10 to 12 days, Mike Shanahan said. He will undergo surgery, and is not expected to play in the next two games. Mike Anderson will start in his place.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 11/12/01
Schroeder may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/12/01
Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this week, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis. Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bledsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, who is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarterback. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 11/12/01
Warner says his thumb is affecting the way he throws the ball. X-rays revealed a sprained ligament, and he will be limited in practice this week.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 11/12/01
According to published reports, Johnson will miss at least four weeks with a broken clavicle. Alex Van Pelt will start while he is out.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/12/01
Moss felt soreness in his ankle on Sunday, but he is fine and there is no apparent reason to ex! pe! ct him to miss any playing time.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/12/01
Wheatley did not play at Seattle. His return date is still unclear.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2840&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/12/01
