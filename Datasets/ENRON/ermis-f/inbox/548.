Statistics Changes 

Statistics for our Fantasy Football games are provided by the same service that keeps official stats for the NFL, and your league is scored according to these official stats. Occasionally we receive changes to the stats we initially post after the games on Sunday or Monday nights. This happens when a stat was incorrectly reported during a game. Please note that you will rarely, if ever, see these changes reflected in published box scores, whether on-line or in print. However, we include all stat changes that we receive by Tuesday at midnight ET each week.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Jonathan Stark, St. Paul, Minnesota 

I have to bench either Tim Brown, Troy Brown, Marty Booker or Laveranues Coles. Who would you bench this week? 

Answer - GG 

Tim Brown always seems to save his best for AFC West matchups, and should have a big game against the Broncos. A Monday Night audience only adds to his motivation. Coles has become New York's No. 1 WR, and will be facing an erratic New Orleans secondary. The Jets may also have to play catch-up, and throw the ball at New Orleans. Troy Brown is facing one of the most porous secondaries in the NFC (Atlanta). We must recommend sitting Booker, who is facing the fundamentally superior Cleveland defense. 


Question - John Olsen, Rockaway, New Jersey 

This week I was able to pick up Dominic Rhodes, the backup to Edgerrin James. I also have Ahman Green vs. Tampa Bay and Anthony Thomas vs. Cleveland, along with Mike Alstott and Maurice Smith. Which two running backs should I start this week? 

Answer - GG 

Rhodes is still an unproven player, despite his excellent game against the Chiefs. Alstott has hurt the Packers before, and ran a decisive 37-yard TD in the teams' first meeting this year. The inconsistent Smith is a risky start against the Patriots. You simply have to go with your two best players here. Green is playing in a pivotal NFC Central matchup, and no one has been able to stop Thomas yet. 


Question - Jason Yearot, Williamsburg, Virginia 

Daunte Culpepper is off this week, and Vinny Testaverde is my backup. Should I use Vinny vs. New Orleans, or grab Rob Johnson off waivers? Also, would you start the Miami defense vs. Carolina or the Bears defense vs. Cleveland? 

Answer - GG 

Johnson showed a lot of grit in last week's game against the Chargers, and is facing a vulnerable Colts defense. But he is banged up, and Testaverde might test an inconsistent New Orleans secondary at times. Neither is a great start, but Testaverde is healthy, and Johnson could hurt your numbers if he takes another big hit and leaves the game. The Bears won't be tested by Cleveland's running game, but Tim Couch and Kevin Johnson may hurt them. Carolina doesn't have the running game or receiving talent (besides Muhsin Muhammad) to challenge the Dolphins, who are the better pick.

Tip of the Week 

Shawn Abel, Midlothian, Virginia: It is time to stop recommending Fantasy teams bench their quarterback when facing the Baltimore Ravens. I benched Mark Brunell last week in favor of Vinny Testaverde and it cost me dearly. Brett Favre, Tim Couch and Brunell have proven the past three weeks that a quality quarterback can torch Baltimore's defense.
