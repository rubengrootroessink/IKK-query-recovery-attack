Latest NFL Player News

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/27/01
Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/27/01
The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133462&> , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/27/01
McCardell is listed as probable with a thigh injury. He should be able to start this week. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Chambers is listed as questionable with an ankle injury. He practiced on Wednesday and should be able to play this week. 

James McKnight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
McKnight is listed as questionable with an ankle injury. He practiced and is hopeful of playing this week. 

Travis Minor <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 12/27/01
The Miami Herald reports Minor will get more work on offense this week. Lamar Smith will remain the starter, but the Dolphins are hoping Minor can inject some life into the offense. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says Stewart is not expected to play this week because of a sprained ankle. Lamont Warren and Cory Schlesinger will assume most of the workload in his place. 

Mike McMahon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235119&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
The Detroit Free Press says McMahon is not expected to practice or play this week. Ty Detmer will start in his place. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/27/01
Griese told the Denver Post he is ready to take on the Broncos, although Mike Shanahan questioned how effective he would be in his return. "How do you know with a concussion?" Shanahan said. "There should be no side effects. Hopefully there's not. But we have learned a lot through the years about concussions and how serious the! y ! can be, and hopefully that's something in the past and they won't reoccur." 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Shea is expected to miss the season's final two games with a shoulder injury. O.J. Santiago should remain in the starting lineup in Shea's place. 

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Smith underwent surgery on his left hamstring. He is expected to be ready for training camp next season and will compete for the starting job. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Walls is listed as questionable with a knee injury. He was expected to be evaluated again on Thursday. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Muhammad (turf toe) is not expected to play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/27/01
Henry will sit out again this week with a sprained knee. Shawn Bryson will start for the second consecutive week. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain. "I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as I had today," McNair said. "I'm not going to go out and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue." The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/27/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular season's final two games. "You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing," Bettis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely." 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01
Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play. Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday. "There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore," Holmgren said. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/26/01
Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear. 

Jeff Graham <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again. 

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=12436&> , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/26/01
Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Peter Warrick <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 12/26/01
Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=3837&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01
Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.
