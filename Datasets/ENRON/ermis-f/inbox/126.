Latest NFL Player News

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Morgan suffered a shoulder injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Mason suffered a hip injury in Sunday's loss at Minnesota. His current status is day to day.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori U! pdated 12/10/01
Allen (hand) was able to practice on Sunday. Still, the Ravens are expected to start Moe Williams against the Steelers next Sunday while easing Allen back into action slowly.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Culpepper (knee) says he should be ready for next week's game against the Lions. The Vikings, however, may be prompted to sit him again because the game is on turf. Once again, Culpepper may be a gameday decision.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/01
Smith (ankles) was able to play on Sunday, but he was far from 100 percent. He finished with eight receptions for 66 yards. He should continue to be a reliable player during the Fantasy postseason.

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Bettis' status for Sunday night's game at Baltimore is unclear as of now. Bill Cowher told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he would monitor the RB throughout the week. "He won't need to lobby me," Cowher said. "If he's ready to play, he'll be playing."

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/10/01
Owens suffered a hip pointer during Sunday's loss at St. Louis, but he was able to finish the game. 

Albert Connell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Connell has been demoted behind Robert Wilson and Wane McGarity on the Saints' depth chart. Connell, who was inactive Sunday, is now New Orleans' No. 5 receiver.

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Dick LeBeau said there is no QB controversy right now. It appears he will stick with Jon Kitna for now. "I think I tried that a couple of weeks ago," he said of switching QBs.

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Walls started Sunday's game, but had to leave when his ankle injury flared up in the first half. He finished with one catch for nine yards.

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=188183! &>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/10/01
Smith sprained his right knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes Finneran replaced Shawn Jefferson as the No. 3 receiver in two-back sets on Sunday. Jefferson remained the No. 3 receiver in single-back sets. Finneran's added responsibilities in the passing game resulted in a career-best six catches for 92 yards.

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/! 01! 
Griese suffered a concussion in Sunday night's win over Seattle. He left the game in the third quarter and was replaced by Gus Frerotte. Griese said he expects to play next Sunday against the Chiefs.

David Boston <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Boston caught six passes for 132 yards against Washington. Right now, because of his consistently high production, Boston is arguably the most valuable receiver in Fantasy Football.

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Jenkins caugh! t ! three passes for 33 yards and a TD against Washington. He has become a surprisingly reliable receiver for the Cardinals in recent weeks.

Jerry Rice <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Neal/McKay Updated 12/09/01
Rice had five catches for 57 yards and a touchdown against Kansas City. The future Hall of Famer is having a solid season, and could be a valuable player during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Rich Gannon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 12/09/01
Gannon had a decent outing against Kansas City, posting 195 yards passing, two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing) and an interception. Gannon is one of the best quarterbacks in Fantasy Football, and is a solid start during your league's playoffs.

Zeron Flemister <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=192169&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Flemister caught a two-yard TD pass at Arizona. He has become a regular target for Washington in goal-line packages.

Trent Green <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, tw! o ! touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don't depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/09/01
Holmes had a monster game against Oakland, posting 277 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns. He's become one of the most feared tailbacks in the league, and has been one of Fantasy Football's most pleasant surprises. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/09/01
Davis rushed for 110 yards and a TD at Arizona. He will give Fantasy players good yardage numbers during the playoffs, but touchdowns will continue to be a rarity for Davis.

Laveranues Coles <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
The Steelers limited Coles to 20 receiving yards on three catches. Coles remains a good receiver for the Fantasy postseason, though, because he has been a regular TD threat all year long.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Chrebet caught five passes for 63 yards at Pittsburgh, including his first T! D ! (18 yards). The Jets wideout has been unreliable for most of the year, and he remains a risky start during the Fantasy playoffs.

Hines Ward <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 12/09/01
Ward had a huge game against the N.Y. Jets on Sunday. The talented wide receiver had 10 catches for 124 yards, and has become a pretty reliable Fantasy player this season. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Fuamatu-Ma'afala started in place of the injured Jerome Bettis on Sunday against the N.Y. Jets. He posted 50 yards rushing and a touchdown, which are respectable Fantasy numbers for a reserve tailback. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 12/09/01
Stokes caught one pass for 15 yards at St. Louis. Don't start Stokes during the Fantasy playoffs. He has been nearly useless for most of the season.

Jeff Garcia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=146325&>, QB SF - JWillie Updated 12/09/01
Garcia threw for only 146 yards, no TDs and was intercepted twice at St. Louis. Expect Garcia to ! qu! ickly put such a forgettable outing behind him. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Ricky Proehl <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2684&key=1208&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 12/09/01
Proehl caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Don't expect such numbers from Proehl on a regular basis. He rarely becomes a featured target for! K! urt Warner.
