 	 Someone will win a millions dollars!

Do you know football? Would you pay $5 to enter an office pool with a $1 Million grand prize? There are 3 weeks left in the pro football season and someone is GUARANTEED to win $1 Million in the Office Pool Challenge. There's still plenty of time left for you to win, so sign up today! <http://poolchallenge.fantasy.sportsline.com/?r=esfb1228_html>

If someone picks every game right in a week, that person is entered into a random drawing with everyone else who made "perfect picks" during the season. If no one makes "perfect picks" then the 17 weekly high-scorers are entered into a drawing for the $1 Million prize. With 3 weeks left, you still have 3 chances to make perfect picks or to be one of the weekly high scorers... maybe you'll win all weeks!

Someone is guaranteed to win $1 Million...why can't it be you? SIGN UP TODAY! <http://poolchallenge.fantasy.sportsline.com/?r=esfb1228_html>
