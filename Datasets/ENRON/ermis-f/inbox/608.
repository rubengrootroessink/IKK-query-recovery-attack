SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the capacity 
and shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is for a volumetric reservation contract demand. A 
monthly base reservation charge per unit of transportation contact demand 
shall be the awarded rate/dth multiplied by the dth's delivered during the 
month, divided by the total monthly Transportation contract Demand.  In 
addition to the Volumetric Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the 
volumetric charge, the applicable surcharges and fuel. 



PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of available 
transportation capacity.  Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.  If the same Shipper submits multiple bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.  If bid rate is 
        less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:  Bid Rate x 
        FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
        maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:  Bid Rate x FERC Interest 
        Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied shipper 
        will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 24 
        hours of the bid close time.  Such improved bid shall be faxed to (801) 584-7076 
        to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.  If a tie still exists, such capacity shall 
        be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer than 
        indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.
