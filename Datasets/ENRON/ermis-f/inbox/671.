November 20, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced that third quarter, although impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001, was a record revenue quarter for the company, and the company achieved low double digit operating income levels.  PROS posted revenue in the first nine months of the year of $27.7 million, which is a 36% increase over the previous year.  Record profits, along with positive cash flow, enhanced PROS' strong balance sheet.  PROS also posted record annual revenues and profits for 2000.
