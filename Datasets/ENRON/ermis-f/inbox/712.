Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.

Marcus Pollard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script! =p! layers&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1335&> , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of ! th! e injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.

Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owne! r=! 14696.2&random=892&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/18/01 
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if ! th! e Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.

Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

S! te! phen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.

Walter Rasby <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige! 01! &owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will ! li! kely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive o! f ! the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp! /e! link?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1140&> , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=892&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.
