NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/28/01
The Packers took Davis off the physically unable to play list Tuesday and added him to the active roster. He is likely to challenge David Martin for the second tight end job, as Green Bay should use more two-tight end formations with Davis back in action. Don't add him to your roster, though, as he won't provide consistent Fantasy stats.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
San Diego Head Coach Mike Riley sa! id! Monday that he is optimistic Jones will be able to play Sunday. He has been sidelined by an ankle injury.

Wade Richey <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12647&>, K SD - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Richey is likely to lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if they sign Steve Christie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-30 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.

Steve Christie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1378&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Chargers are expected to sign Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a physical, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. He would handle the field-goal chores for the remainder of the season, with Wade Richey shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey owner and need a kicker, Christie might be worth a pickup based on past history, but don't expect him to be one of the better kickers in the league even if he does get the starting job.

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 ! in! your league.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game against Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1779&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Jack! so! n's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.

Akili Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. "If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me," Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, coul! d ! return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

Moe Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1481&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Upd! at! ed 11/27/01 
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game. 

Jake Arians <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=192220&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01! Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well," Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injur! ed! reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer." 

Shayne Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=196720&>, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow <http://! fo! otball222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235019&>, RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. "I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1333&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=133276&>, WR GB ! - ! Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewa! rt!  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
According to the Detroit Free Press, Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "This is Charlie's offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesda! y.! " He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2345&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.!
