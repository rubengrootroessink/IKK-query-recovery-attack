Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Kyle Buhler 

My three running backs are: Corey Dillon, Warrick Dunn and Garrison Hearst. Which two should I start in week nine? 

Answer - GG 

Dillon is far too valuable to bench. That leaves Dunn and Hearst, and neither has been very reliable for Fantasy owners. We'd recommend Dunn based on the matchup. Hearst is facing a tough New Orleans defense that gave up only 66 yards rushing to Curtis Martin a week ago, while Dunn faces a Detroit unit that is allowing an astounding 146.9 rushing yards per game. 


Question - Charlie Oddo 

Who should I start this week: Charlie Batch or Brian Griese? 

Answer - GG 

Batch had three straight solid games before stumbling badly this past weekend against San Francisco, and facing Tampa Bay doesn't bode well for his chances in week nine. He may also lose snaps to rookie Mike McMahon over the next few weeks, which is even more reason to avoid him. Griese hasn't been great, but he's still averaging close to two touchdown passes per game and is facing a San Diego secondary that has been very mediocre lately. The choice here is Griese, who is a much more reliable Fantasy QB than Batch, despite the fact that he's thrown nine interceptions in his last four games. 


Question - Matt MacLachlan 

I need to pick one starter for a "flex" position (meaning any player on my roster can be used at this position.) Should I start Kevan Barlow, Kevin Johnson or Peerless Price? 

Answer - GG 

Barlow isn't getting enough carries (8.7 per game) to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this time. Price has been unreliable for the most part, and facing a good New England secondary won't help his chances this week. Johnson has been the most consistent player of the three, especially over his last four games. Johnson has averaged 84.2 yards receiving and has four touchdowns over that span, and seems to be your best option.

Tip of the Week 

Pete Richards, Reading, PA: After a disappointing rookie campaign, Plaxico Burress is finally showing flashes of the talent he displayed at Michigan State. The emergence of Burress not only raises his own value as a Fantasy player, but it raises the stock of Jerome Bettis, Hines Ward and Kordell Stewart as well. Outside of Bettis, it's quite possible that Burress, Ward and Stewart are still available in many Fantasy leagues, and I feel that all three would make great midseason acquisitions.
