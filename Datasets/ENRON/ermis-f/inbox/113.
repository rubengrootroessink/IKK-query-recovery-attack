Frank,

I have two questions for you.   First, I know you and I have had very little profession interaction, but I would like to ask for a letter of recommendation from you.  I have asked Mike, but as of now I've had no response.  I assume he is very busy.  I know Patti will put one together, but Steve South is truly the only other senior level trader I can ask, and I haven't seen him for a few days.  If you are not comfortable with this, I'd understand.  However, I would really appreciate it.

Finally, I am getting a few cold calls, and hearing of jobs within other organizations.  If you are available, I would like to bounce a few of the companies I hear from off you?  I know I won't find another Enron, but I don't want to work for company that is not well respected among the top traders.  For example, I've had interest from/with; Aquilla, Dominion Resources, Amerada HES, Goldman Sachs, Duke and Reliant.

I appreciate any assistance you can offer.

Thank you

Daniel D. Lisk
