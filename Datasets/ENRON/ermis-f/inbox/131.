Latest NFL Player News

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, the Falcons will rest Smith in practice this week. Smith, who is dealing with an assortment of leg and ankle injuries, could see less carries in Sunday's game against Indianapolis as a result of his ailments, which makes starting him a real gamble on Week 14. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Bettis was feeling good following treatment on his groin and hip Monday. He hasn't r! ec! eived medical clearance, but the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Bettis will probably play Sunday. 

Santana Moss <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Moss could miss Sunday's game. He is suffering from a strained quadriceps and is listed as questionable. 

Mark Brunell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 12/11/01
Brunell suffered a badly cut finger in Sunday's game. He is also suffering from a sore quadriceps. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Danny Farmer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187533&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Farmer is listed as probable for Sunday's game. He is recovering from an ankle injury. 

Jaret Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12447&>, K - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released Holmes off their practice squad Monday. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Neil Rackers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=187627&>, K CIN -! F! ree Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals released kicker Jaret Holmes off their practice squad Monday, an indication that Rackers' job is safe for the rest of the season. The Bengals signed Holmes to the practice squad on Nov. 1 after Rackers went through a stretch of missing six of nine attempts. 

Marco Battaglia <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The Bengals have waived Battaglia, freeing him to sign with another team. Battaglia had an appendectomy Nov. 17 and was put on the reserve-nonfootball illness list the next day, leaving him ineligible to play for the Bengals the rest of the season. Battaglia has been working out and hopes to play for another team this season. 
Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133415&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
The New York Jets might get to see Smith instead of Jon Kitna as the Cincinnati Bengals' starting quarterback next Sunday. Kitna, suffering from a finger injury, might be inactive this week. The Bengals were considering giving Smith a chance to start once they were eliminated. They want to find out whether the first-round draft pick from 1999 still fits in their long-term plans. Kitna's injury opens the way for Smith to get that audition. 

Jon Kitna <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1847&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Kitna hurt the ! mi! ddle finger on his passing hand during Sunday's game. He didn't miss a play, but the finger swelled overnight and was so painful on Monday that he couldn't grip a ball. "I either sprained or tore ligaments on the inside of it," Kitna said. Kitna has started each of the Bengals' 12 games. Akili Smith could possibly start in his absence. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/11/01
Griese remained woozy on Monday after suffering a concussion against Seattle, and his availability for next Sunday's game at Kansas City is uncertain. Griese was hit by Seattle linebacker Levon Kirkland at the end of a 9-yard scramble early in the third quarter. He had to be helped to the sideline and didn't return. Griese will be evalauted on a daily basis. 
Chad Lewis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's win over San Diego. He might miss practice on Wednesday, but he's expected to play in this weekend's game at Washington. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Wayne played Monday and had one catch for 11 yards. He shook off an injury but is still a risky start because of his inexperience. 

Mik! e ! Vanderjagt <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12783&>, K IND - Hunter Updated 12/11/01
Vanderjagt shook off a back injury and played in Monday's game. He connected on both of his field goal attempts.

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Chambers played Monday despite suffering from a rib injury. He caught three passes, two for touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver. He doesn't catch a lot of passes but has a knack for scoring toudchdowns and making big plays. 

Terrence Wilkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01 Wilkins strained his right hamstring in the first half of Monday's game and did not return. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/11/01
Owens, who is already dealing with both foot and ankle injuries, suffered a slight hip pointer on Sunday vs. St. Louis. However, the star wideout is expected to start in Week 14 vs, Miami, so be sure to include him in your lineup. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) was declared! i! nactive for Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll likely be listed as questionable for Saturday's game vs. Arizona, so use caution before starting him in Week 14. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/11/01
According to published reports, Culpepper (knee) will be listed as probable for Sunday's game against Detroit. "We anticipate him making a lot of progress this week," coach Dennis Green told the Detroit News. If you have Culpepper on your roster, he'd be a good start against a porous Lions defense in Week 14, barring any setbacks. 

Panthers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=5&>, DT CAR - Free Agent Updat! ed! 12/11/01 
Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert will miss the remainder of the year due to an elbow injury that will require surgery. Gilbert is just one of a number of injured Carolina players that has made the Panthers' defense virtually worthless to Fantasy owners. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/01
Jefferson is dealing with a back injury that could keep him out of this weekend's game against Indianapolis. Jefferson is questionable at this point, according to Head Coach Dan Reeves. 

Quincy Morgan <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=235232&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Morgan suffered a shoulder injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Mason suffered a hip injury in Sunday's loss at Minnesota. His current status is day to day.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/10/01
Allen (hand) was able to practice on Sunday. Still, the Ravens are expected to start Moe Williams against the Steelers next Sunday while easing Allen back into action slowly.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Culpepper (knee) says he should be ready for next week's game against the Lions. The Vikings, however, may be prompted to sit him again because the game is on turf. Once again, Culpepper may be a gameday decision.

Rod Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 12/10/01
Smith (ankles) was able to play on Sunday, but he was far from 100 percent. He finished with eight receptions for 66 yards. He should continue to be a reliable player during the Fantasy postseason.

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fant! as! y.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/10/01
Bettis' status for Sunday night's game at Baltimore is unclear as of now. Bill Cowher told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he would monitor the RB throughout the week. "He won't need to lobby me," Cowher said. "If he's ready to play, he'll be playing."

Terrell Owens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 12/10/01
Owens suffered a hip pointer during Sunday's loss at St. Louis, but he was able to finish the game. 

Albert Connell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&ke! y=! 1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Connell has been demoted behind Robert Wilson and Wane McGarity on the Saints' depth chart. Connell, who was inactive Sunday, is now New Orleans' No. 5 receiver.

Larry Parker <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2669&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/10/01
Parker suffered a bruised right shoulder in Sunday's game against Oakland. His current status is day to day.
