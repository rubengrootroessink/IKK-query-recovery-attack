Hi Jean,

Is this order because Lorraine's desk top has been slow and she has not been able to keep the Dashboard and other applications open at the same time?

Also, I would like to inquire with you about ordering two flat screens for Paul.  He would like to still keep his laptop computer.  Can we accomodate two flat screens with his laptop?

Have you settled down from all the moves?  Where did you and Donna end up?  Will you be with us on 13?  

As always, many, many thanks!  Kim.

P.S.  The printers all got worked out?  Everybody happy?  :>)
