Hi Debbie,

Can you tell me who you have talked to?  Michelle is the Oneok rep and is out of town until Monday.  I will ask Michelle to assist you in this collection.  

Michelle, would you please coordinate with Deb and see if you can find the right person a Oneok for us to talk to regarding the AR issue. 

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, 

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.

Debbie
