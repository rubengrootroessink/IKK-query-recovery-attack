Subject:	El Paso Maintenance on Lines 1300 and 1301 on San Juan Crossover

In its preliminary notice of November maintenance, El Paso had scheduled Lines 1300 and 1301 on the San Juan Crossover for total shutdown Nov. 29-30. It said Wednesday the shutdown has been delayed to coincide with the Dec. 1-2 weekend, when all 650 MMcf/d of the crossover's capacity will be cut to zero. Portions of Line 1300 will be shutting down Dec. 11-12 and Dec. 18-19; capacity cuts then will be 60 MMcf/d.
