Rick (FYI),

	Elizabeth informed me about a report she's been administering regarding all TW deliveries to California.  This is a new report that was created per an FERC order.  After discussion with the TW Admin team, it would seem appropriate that the Deal Capture team administer the FERC report at this time.  Elizabeth will begin the transition of this report to Deal Capture as soon as her schedule permits.  This report, along with some other TW Demand Rate admin pieces and the Firmbook, would be a significant part of the duties for the 3rd member of our Deal Capture team.
