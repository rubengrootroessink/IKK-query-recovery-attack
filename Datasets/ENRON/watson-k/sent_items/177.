Audrey, I added one more bullet from the earlier version I sent you.  Please work from this one.  

Michelle, please fill in the appropriate volume amount for the volume affected on the Gallup compressor outtage.  Also, per my voicemail to you, please check with Palu on the highlighted blue bullets to confirm that your two bullets are not already included in the numbers that Jan gave me on her bullet.  

Thanks, Kim.
