Audrey,

Would you please set up a meeting for me on Wednesday (tomorrow) to discuss the Griffith plant and some of the problems we have been having lately with respect to TW's responsibilities, EAMR's responsibilities and Trigon's responsibilities.  (Please share this meeting purpose in the email notice of this meeting.)  We would like to meet from 3:00 to 4:00 pm, we need a conference room in Houston with the ability to conference in several other locations.  In addition to the names below, please include Don Hawkins, Sarabeth Smith, Donna Scott, Dennis Alters, Darrell Schoolcraft and me.  

Many thanks,

Kim :>)
