Janell, FYI, 

John and I emailed the Hotel Mozart in Rome for availability.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  

Have a great day!  K.

Hello!

We have three couples that will be in Rome September 29, departing
September 30.  Do you have three rooms available?  If so, may we reserve
on a credit card and what are the prices?

Thank you,
