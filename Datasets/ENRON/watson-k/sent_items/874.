Kim

It would cost approximately $515,000 to build all the necessary interconnect facilities to deliver gas to Questar at this location( please see attached "B" release from Engineering-Roswell). Since TW is constructing this project for Questar we need to add 31.16 % tax gross-up and that will make a total  cost of $ 675,427 for the project.

Again your previous cost of $702,000 , mentioned in the agreement with Questar, is fine because even "B" release cost estimates are approximately 15% ?.

If you any questions please call me at anytime.

Regards,
Mansoor
