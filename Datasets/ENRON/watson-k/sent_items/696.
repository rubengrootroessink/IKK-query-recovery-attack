Bruce and Dave,

Here are some of our comments to amend the KMI/TW letter agreement for dates listed in the agreement.  Please review and lets discuss tomorrow morning.  We are putting together a timeline for all of the various things that need to happen which will help us both determine the new dates to put in the letter.  We'll send this to you as soon as we are finish.  

Do you have any comments on the Pemex letter agreement?

Thanks, 

Kim and Mark.
