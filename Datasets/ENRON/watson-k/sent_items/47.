John, 
I've been out of town this week, but I did want you to know that I received your message.  Fran Fegan is our HR rep and she can help you and Karen coordinate the paperwork.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim -

I am in a crisis simulation meeting this morning but wanted to make sure you got my message Friday that I would like to post for the position in your group.  I need to contact Robin Treadwell, my HR rep, to get the paperwork started from here in Santa Cruz.

Thanks,
John
