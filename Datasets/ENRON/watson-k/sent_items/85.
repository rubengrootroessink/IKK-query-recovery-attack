In preparation of the new reporting requirements mandated by FERC, there are a couple of items under Question 1 that we need to decide on regarding the method of data retrieval.  These are:

	b.  the terms and effective date of the contract
	h.  the rate charged in $$/MMbtu

Rick - Currently, the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere.  I will need someone (on of the Alma's or Josh) to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed.  Prospectively, this info will also need to be captured with each new contract.  

Kim - With regard to the rate charged, I am concerned with how the information will be captured and stored.  It's virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month, there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated, blended rate (due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage).  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK, we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly.

Don - After your initial review of the data request, did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process?  I will need to do some investigation regarding what it might take to add some additional fields/identifiers.

Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Per the Commission's order yesterday, Transwestern will be required to submit daily transportation activity (nominated, scheduled & delivered), capacity release activity and capacity beginning August 1, 2001.  The information will be submitted 30 days after the close of a month -- meaning that our first report will be due September 30.  The order does not specify when the historical capacity information for May 1999 and May 2000 needs to be submitted -- so at this point I'm assuming that it will submitted with the first report.

I would like to have a brief get-together tomorrow at 10:30 AM (Ricki will follow with details) just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant.  In particular, now that we will have to report nominated vs. scheduled to the Cal. border each day -- I have an even heightened concern that we head into the month making sure that we capture the SoCal Window number each day.

Attached is the Commission's "Order Imposing Reporting Requirement on Natural Gas Sales to California Market," which was issued late yesterday.

In the order, the Commission finds that if does have the authority to request the information as set out in the May 18 order proposing the requirements.   

	The information is to cover August 1, 2001 through Sept. 30, 2002 (the end date coincides with the end of the Commission's mitigation plan re: wholesal prices in California and the West).
	Specific info gas sellers and LDCs file concernign purchase and sales transactions is exempt from FOIA disclosure
	Also, respondents may request privileged treatment of "other portions of their responses subject to the.....Commission's regulations"
	Some of the questions have been modified based on comments received based on comments received on the May 18th proposal
	Transaction by transaction data is required; FERC will aggregate the information
	The information request will NOT be expanded beyond California
	FERC is providing the reporting format as a data template to be available on RIMS.

The order is attached here, and the appendix listing specific questions is below.      <<RM01-9.00A.doc>>
