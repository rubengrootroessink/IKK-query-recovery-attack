Steve,

Yes, we are already putting a list together and inviting customers.  We are primarily concentrating on the Houston and Dallas customers.  We'll get the RSVP list together in the next day or two.  Let us know if you have an invite, we do not have all the tickets spoken for at this time.  Michelle has organized dinner for us at Farrago (corner of West Gray and Brazos) after the show.  They are setting up a large table in the back of the restaurant for us.

Kim.
