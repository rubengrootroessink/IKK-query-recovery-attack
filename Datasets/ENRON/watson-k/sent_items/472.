Lee,

Well, I'm not crazy, just dumb not to think about looking at all the emails Denise has sent to me.  This is the original language you drafted for me for the Questar amendment.  By the way, I did send them the most recent version you send me which in not as verbose as this version.  Are we still OK? 

Thanks, Kim.

This is a draft.  I don't think Enron Pipeline Company exists now.  I will check.  Also, what is the correct reference to Kinder Morgan.  Corp?  Company?  LLP?
