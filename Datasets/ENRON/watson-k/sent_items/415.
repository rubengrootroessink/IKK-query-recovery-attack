Kirk,

Would you be available on Tuesday morning for breakfast?  Otherwise, both Ron and I are available anytime in the morning.  If you had only afternoon available, I can meet with you.  Let me know what works for you.  

FYI, I am sending the revised agreement to you today so that you have a chance to review it before we meet.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
I am planning to be in Houston Monday night/Tuesday day.
Not sure of exact schedule yet...if I can break free, I would love to see
you both personally.
If not, perhaps I can at least catch up with you via phone.
I will call you either way on Monday to set something up.
Hope that I can get a revised contract today to review.
Thanks for your efforts.
Kirk

Hi Kirk, 

I hope to have the revised contract for you late tonight.  Would you
like to set up a time that Ron and I can go over it with you by
telephone?  How about Monday or Tuesday?


Thanks, 
Kim.

Hi Kim-
Just wanted to check the status of the TW interconnect bids for Big
Sandy (w
and w/o meter set, etc.).
Hope that you are doing well.
Best regards,
Kirk
