Mark and Paul, 

It would be good to set up a time to demo this model.  In fact, I would like to attend with you, since I havn't seen it for almost a year.  

Thanks, Kim.

If anyone is interested in my demonstrating the model I can do this individually at your convenience, just let me know when and where.  Also please forward this to all appropriate personnel within your groups.
Thanks
