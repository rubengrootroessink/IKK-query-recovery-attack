Theresa,

I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?  

Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Have you thought about buying a call on the spread instead of unwinding the spread outright?  (Just a thought)

Thanks,
Theresa
