Morgan and Kim,

This e-mail is to inform you that the meeting to discuss the TW hedge of
transport deals will be 9:00-10:00 AM on Thursday morning (August 30th) in
Morgan's office (EB 3942).  We do not have access to Enron e-mail, and
therefore, I cannot access your calendars.  Would you please confirm with
me through reply to this e-mail that the scheduling will still work for
you?  Thanks.

Tony - AALLP
