FYI, here is an update from our meeting today,	

I did some checking to follow up on the Socal Window issue discussed in the meeting  today with our TMS IT team and Mary Draemer to find out the exact date when we implemented the EDI Socal Capacity Window. It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.

Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.

Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks Ramona
