Definitely not me.  I would have charged a lot more than this!  Ha!  Thanks, Kim.

Kim, it was around $5 or $6.  It was definitely a personal charge.

Given that the first week of Dec was the bankruptcy filing, I don't show any lunches out during this week.  I don't believe it was me.  Can you tell by the price how many people may have been at lunch?

Kim and Linda, would either you know if someone charged a lunch meal on Steve's Account at the Met?  Linda, would you check with your guys?  The charge was made during the first week of December.

Thanks in advance,
