Jo, 

Here is a copy of the open season that is being posted late today for a TW expansion from San Juan to Phoenix and California.  Please mention it in the morning meeting tomorrow since we are off campus in a strategy meeting, and we will walk through it with everyone in the Friday morning meeting.  

Thanks, Kim.
