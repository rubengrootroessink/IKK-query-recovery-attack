Kim, Kevin would like to have a 1 hour meeting either Tuesday or Wednesday and have all the Sun Devil Commercial people attend.  I'm not sure who all that involves, but would you either forward this to them with a request for availability or tell me who to poll.  Thanks for your assistance with this.
