Please proceed to issue a  Work Order to construct the facility requirements ( tap, valve, measurement and  DAS facilities as previously described) to tie Questar to TW at San Juan. Please see attachment where Questar explains that you have to acquire a small R.O.W from Elpaso and that will connect TW property to the site where eventually will be Questar's R.O.W.
TW will be reimbursed by Quesatr for the total costs at no tax-gross up is added for this particular project. TW will own and operate the interconnect facilities.

The in-service date that Marketing is recommending is May-1 and I know that you might have a problem with that but according to Kim Watson Questar is willing  to support us in purchasing materials a little quicker than us. 

Your engineering contact with Questar is Jerry Mouser at 801-324-5744.

Call me if you any concerns/ questions on this project.

Mansoor, 

Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar.  We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1.  The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week.  I will let you know when it is officially signed.  If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like .  Please let me know if you need additional information.
Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
Thank you for all your help.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Gaylen
