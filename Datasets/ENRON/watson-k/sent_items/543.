Kim - I forgot this one, please add it to my list:

New TW receipt point with NGPL in Eddy Cty., NM.  In service date week of 12/24/01.  Increment supply to TW of 60,500 MMBtu/d.





Kim - Apparently I can't add.  The revenues under the BP Red Rock deal are $20,805,000 which brings my total deal dollars to $45,016,762.00.
