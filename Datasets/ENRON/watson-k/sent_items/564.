John/Kim, 
Here's the UH link.  Looks like Italian 101 is 15/24 Feb weekends.  You can read details. 

I don't have McCoppins E-mail at home but you might want to pass it along.   

On an unrelated subject.  When we went to bed it was Power 96, Dad 98 on Tork game.  Power claims an unconfirmed 106 this morning. 

Merry Christmas 

Marydith slep with Liberty last night and was playing with it this morning.  The real test will be what they play with after the big delivery on Xmas
