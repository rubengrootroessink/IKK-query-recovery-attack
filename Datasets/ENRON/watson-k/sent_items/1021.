Dear Gaylen and Jodi,

Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San Juan area.  The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.  This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.  Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range. 

Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  

Thanks, 

Kim.


      

P.S.   I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.  I will send it under separate cover.
