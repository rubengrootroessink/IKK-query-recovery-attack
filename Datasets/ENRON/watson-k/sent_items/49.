Craig,

Can we get together and talk about this?  I was out of town several days last week, and as I look at it now, I want to make sure I understand the questions that Rita is asking and I'm wondering if we need to do something different with the way that we fill out the deal sheet.  

Can you help me comb through this?

I'm in the office all next week.  Just let me know when it is convenient for you.  

Thanks, Kim.

I'm looking at Quickplace Business Requrement BUSRQ13.doc "Setup & Maintenance of Contract Level Discounts"
I have a question about a couple of discount data elements defined for TW.

#1
On p. 11, the requirements define values for Item (31) Discount Type:
TW 
M - Negotiated
D - Discounted

? In CBS, "M" flags "priority" rates which are like NNG's Tariff Exceptions.  
Does TW plan to use the Deal Sheet to enter both discounts & all priority/exception rates?  for discounts and for 
priority rates associated with FERC-defined Negotiated Rates?  Do you plan to differentiate between FERC Negotiated Rate exceptions  and other exceptions like surcharges, low-load GRI Reservation contracts, or points where normal tariff rates are not applicable?

NNG
C-Competitive
S-Settlement (I dont' think "S" has been used for anything except a few Gathering deals stemming from the Global Settlement).  

------
#2
Item (27) Tier Indicator
How do different types of Tiered TW rates work?
A=Range Average
C=Daily Range
D=Daily Tier  (Tier volume applies to flow per day?)
R=Range
T=Tier
Z=None (does this just signify a non-tiered discount?)

NNG Tiered discounts can be 
D=Based on levels of daily flow
M=Based on monthly volume levels - used mainly with tiered-reservation rates. 
    For example, if a contract has MDQ of 10,000, Monthly Tiered discount could be for
$4 on first 5000
$3 on next 2500
max rate on remaining 2500
