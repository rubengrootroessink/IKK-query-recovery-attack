I have not set up a kickoff meeting yet.  By this email, is everyone OK with meeting via conference call on Monday, 10/15 at 2:00PM?  I'll get a room in Houston and will need to get a number to call you in Omaha.  

Also, I believe Jo told me there was a Jeff Voydyne (sp?) that should be included.  Can someone please forward me the correct spelling of his name so I can invite him?

Thanks!

Jo indicated you both were working to update our 1998 Map.  What is your timeline for completion as we are desparate for maps and need to get some printed.
