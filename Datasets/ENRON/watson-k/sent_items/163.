DD -

Well, perhaps your poor Texas cousins need to make another trip up there to 
see their rich Arkansas relations, their mountain hideaway and that fabulous 
object d'art that you're rumored to have on loan from the Tate (not to be 
confused with O. L. "Spud" McLanahan's "Tater" Museum, with its current 
exhibition titled "Homage to the Yam").

Once we return from Bella Italia (perhaps even planning while climbing steps 
up to or down from an Amalfi aerie, assuming we can spare enough breath to 
speak), we could look at a November or December date for a long weekend.

I can't tell you how much Kim and I are looking forward to another trip across 
the pond with the A team.  Six weeks and counting, I'm thinking, and I can 
already taste the first glass of vino rosso at Alla Rampa.  It's been too 
long.

Tonight, we're hosting a flood-delayed Father's Day (Tom) and an early 
birthday (Wanda) combo-dinner at Pappas Bros Steakhouse.  Tomorrow evening the 
Donnellys are arranging a sitter so that the grown-ups can meet for dinner and 
a movie that doesn't have a single purple dinosaur or juice box or singing 
cowboy (although there may be other music in a movie titled "Captain Corelli's 
Mandolin," I suspect -- just to get us in the mood for the trip).

Hope golf is treating you well, and that you're abusing the hell out of those 
little dimpled aerospheres.

Looking forward to seeing you guys in six weeks for la dolce vita in Roma.

JW
