Lynn,

I would like for you to review a draft of the proposed TW/Questar OBA in the Blanco Hub (the Interconnect Agreement is in the process of being signed and it is not built yet).  Sorry about all the "red-lines", but I think it makes it easier to see where we have made all of our changes.  FYI, the red changes are changes proposed by Questar, the blue changes are proposed by TW.  Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this agreement.

Thanks, Kim.
