Below is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.  Of the $569,434.56 invoiced, $213,603.58 was through our capacity release program as the acquiring shipper for two Citizens Communications Company contracts.  Another $226,350.00 was for ENA acting as agent for Eastern New Mexico Gas Association, Enervest San Juan Operating, LLC, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  The remaining $129,480.98 is for their own contracts with TW.  Please see the attached schedule for the details.

Citizens is aware of their accountability for ultimate payment of the demand portion of the contracts in which they released capacity.
