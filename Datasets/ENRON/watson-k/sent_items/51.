Perry - We lost you on the original e-mail but definitely need your involvement.

Kim - Would you or someone in the TW commercial group be interesting in attending this meeting?
It's Monday, 1-2 PM.  Location to be determined.

Other Invitees include: Glen Hass, Mary Draemer (Ramona isn't available), Toby Kuehl, Darrel Schoolcraft (out of office), Maria Pavlou,
Ranelle Paladino & Rita Bianchi, 


From original meeting notice:
Are all of you available to discuss the changes to the Operationally Available Capacity report that the Commission is requiring of TW?  In case you haven't heard, FERC has specifically stated that TW needs to add a column to its Operationally Available Capacity report to capture day to day available sustainable capacity .  We would like to discuss how to get this changed within the 15 day timeframe that we were given.  This is a separate issue from the new California report that all pipelines serving California have to do by Sept. 30th.

Ramona, can you locate a room for this discussion?  Omaha will be in 7C1 extension 7017.  If anyone else needs to be included in this discussion, please invite them.  Thanks.

Ranelle & Rita
