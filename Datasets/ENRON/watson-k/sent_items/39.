I believe that John and I will have to pass on this one.  John (and I must admit that I, too) cannot afford to partake in any kind of all you can eat anything.  Our buttons are popping now.....

Have fun on this one.  Eat a tail or two for me.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hey - Is anyone interested in going to the Plaza Club on Thursday, Aug. 16 for an All You Can Eat Lobster Night from 6:30 - 9:30?  Jules and Hugh and I are thinking of going.  Let me know.
