When this invoice was input, it was paid to Lea County Courthouse (5000042878) instead of Leaco Rural Telephone (5000019852).  I have a call into Micah to explain the situation and have her return the check.  Who takes care of voiding checks in Houston?  Please let me know, and I'll have her send it in.

Thanks
Amy

Tracey,

I received a phone call yesterday from  Mika Aswell (spelling?) from Lea County, NM.  Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.  Here is what we know:

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0
	Voucher:	0100001479
	Purchase Order:	A60KD13882

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Many thanks, 
Kim X33098
