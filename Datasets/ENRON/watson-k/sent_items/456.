Paul,
 
Thanks for the update.  I'm glad that he is off the activity diet and allowed the wheels both big and small.  I'm glad your trip to the big city doc was a pleasant one.  Pediatric docs are truly a special breed.  
 
Thanks, 
Kim.

We saw the Pediatric Orthopedist today.  First I must say it was one of the most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain English.   

Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain medication if he wants. 

The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.   

Further updates next January
