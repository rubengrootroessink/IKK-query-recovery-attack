Katie,

When I talked to Kyle last week I didn't realize that you are still driving into downtown everyday.  I have my trunk loaded with some contributions for MANNA and would like to pass them off to you when it is convenient.  What is your schedule during this week?  I could meet you during lunch or at the end of your day any day this week, whatever you prefer.

Many thanks,

Kim

P.S.  How was Mickey's birthday parties this weekend?
