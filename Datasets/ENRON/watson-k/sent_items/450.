Sorry, believe it or not, I do know better.  I was even talking with Lee as it was being faxed so that she could grab it....she was too slow...

I will mend my ways...sorry to make you crazy!

I have a request on behalf of all the secretaries around the world:

Pretty please put fax cover sheets on your stuff!  That Conf. Agr. has been floating around up here all afternoon with no takers until Lee just asked me if she received a fax.  Thanks very much!  :-)
