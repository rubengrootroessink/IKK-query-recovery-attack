Steve,

Here is the final spreadsheet that does tie back to the right dollar amount of $757,885.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

The attached will provide you with dollars that have been allocated to TW from NNG Commercial in the 2002 Plan.  Please disregard the previous version sent as far as any dollars or percentages.  The tasks/projects list is still applicable however.  

 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dana
