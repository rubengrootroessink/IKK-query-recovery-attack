Hey Tiny,

Thanks for your voice mail regarding Griffith.  I will scout it out on Monday and let you know if I hear any confirmation of the water supply.  Gee, I hope it's not true.  

We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing.  I believe that HR will be sending out the invite.  I thought it would go out this past week, but I'm sure you'll see something early next week.  We will start at 8:00am on the 8th and go until about 7:00 or 8:00pm.  We will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston.

Thanks, Kim.
