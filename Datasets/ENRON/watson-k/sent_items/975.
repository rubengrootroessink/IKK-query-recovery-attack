Paula, 
I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!

Don had the highest vote (4th place.)

The board does not have to pick Don. As you recall, the board elected Kim to 
replace Muffin, and Kim had not even run for the board. 

Lew told me this morning that Jim is waiting to know who his replacement is 
before he resigns.

What time are we meeting? Where? Who?
