Hi TK,

We are still on target for a shipper meeting on Nov. 8 with the Market Services Goup, I would like to have our map updated so that we can hand it out at the meeting.  Let's visit about this sometime today or tomorrw.  I also want to get the NNG people involved to update their portion as well.

Thanks, Kim.
