Jodi and Gaylen,

Please see the list below.  Would you please look at what timeframe you could get the equipment listed below.  Our preliminary investigation suggests that we may not be able to obtain the equipment quick enough to meet a May in-service date.  If your engineering department has any questions about this list, please feel free to have them call Earl Chanley at the number below.  And, of course, if you have any questions of me, please feel free to call me at (713) 853-3098.

Thanks, Kim.
