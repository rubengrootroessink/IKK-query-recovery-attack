Hey guys,

We got our first response to a Florence Hotel.  Please read this message and take a look at the attached links to their hotel website to get a feel for the location.  Janell and I think that it is close enough to the city center, but we are open to fresh eyes.  Let me know your thoughts.  I sent about 12 faxes this morning, this is the first to respond.  Janell has personally called about 8 hotels in Florence and they have all been fully booked.  

Let me know what you think.  

Thanks, Kim.
