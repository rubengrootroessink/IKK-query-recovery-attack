Lorraine, 

When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.  I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.  We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.

Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.

Thanks, Kim.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has contacted TW with interest in tying in the Blanco and Chaco Plants on the San Juan Lateral.  A tentative meeting has been scheduled for 8/10 to meet with EPFS to discuss locations and cost estimates.  (I need Ron to go with me).

Amoco Florida - BP has requested TW consider increasing the meter at the Amoco Florida Plant.  Currently, it is sized for receipts of 165,000 MMBtu/d and BP is interested in doubling the size of the interconnect.  I am waiting on a Facility Planner.

Red Rock filing - a filing was made on 7/31 to FERC requesting approval to utilize an incremental 5 acres at each station for construction purposes.  A Director's Letter must be received because of this change in our construction procedures and is expected to be issued by FERC within 2 to 3 weeks.

NGPL Eddy - I have received Facility Planning's preliminary comments on the Interconnect Agreement and am still awaiting Legal's comments in order to return TW's comments to NGPL.  

Energy Development Group - I have attempted to continue to try to work with EDG to locate TW's pipe in specific locations in AZ and NM in order for them to better site power plants off TW.  This week there have been no Facility Planners to help me with this and I have a call into Tiny for assistance.
