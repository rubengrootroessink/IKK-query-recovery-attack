TK,

John and I had such a big time at your house Saturday evening!  It was so kind of you to open your incredibly spectacular home to us.  I just love everything that you have done....it is truly lovely.  It was so nice to meet your sisters.  I can imagine that your family reunions are just a hoot!  And the food.....well it was awesome.

Thanks again.  Hope you are feeling better.

Kim and John
