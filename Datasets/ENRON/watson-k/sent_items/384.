Kevin,

Sorry, I did not see this message until after Steve's staff meeting which is from 2:30 to 3:30 every Monday.  Do you have some time tomorrow --- I'll catch you up on Caithness.

Thanks, Kim.

3pm in 42c1.  

Has anyone talked with Caithness lately?  I heard their water rights got shot down at the local town council.  Is there a possibility they may want to move their project a little further east so that it sits on the Sun Devil expansion?

We expect the cost estimate to be completed 10/2 and will likely begin the weekly meeting Monday 10/8.
