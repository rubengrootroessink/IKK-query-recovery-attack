FYI

Pursuant to our conversation earlier today on the marketing strategy for incremental delivery capacity at SoCal Needles, Michelle and I researched the contracts with primary deliveries at PG&E Topock.  Following is a list of the discounted rate shippers to Topock:

PG&E Trading
40,000 MMBtu/d
$0.10.75


SMUD
10,000 MMBtu/d
$0.17

(There are no shippers with EOC delivery points who would move their delivery point to Topock on a primary basis.)

Attached is the contracted volume data for PG&E Topock from Pipeline Profile.
