Rudy,

I am so glad that you have landed!  Thank you so much for the phone mail message you left me.  I would love to schedule lunch with you in the next couple of weeks to see how you are doing.  We'll grab Martha, too.

Congratulations!!

Kim.

Subject:	I've landed

I wanted to send out a quick note to let people know that I've started a new job with Delinea.  The division I'll be working with  focuses on energy & energy trading companies and is located in Greenway Plaza (if you're in the neighborhood).  My new work phone # is 713-544-5305.  Also, while I have a new e-mail address here, you can always reach me at rudy@alumni.rice.edu.

Thank you everyone for your help, referrals, and support.

- Rudy
