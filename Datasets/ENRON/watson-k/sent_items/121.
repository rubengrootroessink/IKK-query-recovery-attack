Can we meet downstairs at 11:30 & walk over to the Met.  That will ensure that we are all back at 1:00

You bet!  Can we meet at 11:20 or 11:30?  I would like to be back for a 1:00 pm meeting.  Have you been to Daily Review Cafe lately?  It is just outside of Downtown off of Dallas St.  I would be happy to drive.

Thanks, Kim.
