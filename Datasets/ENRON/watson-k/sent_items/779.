We have encountered a conflict with our proposed tagline: Beyond Banking.  There is bank in Georgia who has that slogan federally trademarked.  We have slightly revised our tagline to: Going Beyond Banking.  We believe this actually strengthens the tagline and makes it more active.  

Please let me know as soon as possible if you strongly object to using this new tagline, otherwise we will proceed with production.

Thanks,
Stephanie
