Thanks, we'll make room for the three of you.  We are looking at moving either to 39 or 44.  We have tentative floor plans for both.  When the floor decision has been made, we'll come to you for your consensus on the placement of your three slots.

We'll be back with you soon, I hope.  :>)

Thanks, Kim.

Response number 2 - it would be for myself, Davis and my assistant Terri Bachand.

Kevin,

Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?

Please advise.

Thanks,
Kim.
