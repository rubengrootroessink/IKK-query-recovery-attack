Hi Dot,

Well, we've been talking about Italy again.  We are looking at leaving late May, like Friday, May 24 (so we can scoop in Memorial Day) and returning to Houston on Sunday, June 9.  We are pricing fares now.  Continental has them posted on their website at $1,100-$1,200.  I will also check with Alliance Travel Agency (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) to see what they may be able to do for us.

Can you and Tom swing these dates?

Let me know.

 Thanks, Kim.
