Well, I spoke too soon.  I just got word of another meeting that I need to attend Wed at 1:30.  My preference now is Tuesday from 9:00-10:30.

Thanks, Kim.

Mansoor, I can make either time work, my preference would probably be Wed 1:30-3:00 if given a choice.  

Would you like for all of Marketing to be there or would you prefer to keep it small with just Michelle and me?

Thanks, Kim.
