Larry,

Please take a look at this spreadsheet.  I welcome and encourage any and all comments you may have on this.  Please feel free to make changes my wording as well as the spreadsheet itself.  As we move this forward, I will want to attach a current version of your NYMEX Technical Update.  

Many, many thanks for all of your help and support on this matter! 

Kim.
