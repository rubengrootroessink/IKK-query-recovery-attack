Ho-ho-ho!!!  Lunch on Thursday (that is tomorrow) will be at 2:30 (new time) at Little Pappasito's.  The new 2:30 time will allow us to leisurely enjoy lunch and perhaps indulge in some adult beverages.  
The Little Pappasito's is located at Kirby and Richmond, 2536 Richmond, 713-520-5066.  The reservation is under Armstrong and we will be on the patio.  
Please call me if you have any questions at x33597.
