Great, would you reply that we may need up to six chairs, but we will know the exact count within the next week.  Also, ask her about a table cloth to see if we can borrow it.  

Thanks, Kim.

Mrs. Watson -

There is a 6ft portable table you can use for your event.  Let me know if
you need any chairs, we have 12 available.

Lizette.
