TK,

When we get together on Wed for our staff meeting, would you please speak to this to our group.  Please let us know if we need to change our behavior on anything.  Thanks, Kim.

TK - What happened to the Posted IT Rates that were on TW's website?  If no longer posted, then why?  And if this is the case, then I will need to modify the Transactional Report which is supposed to link to this website.  Please let me know.

Also, because of the new FERC reporting requirements for California deliveries, we need to ensure that all rates (discounted or negotiated) are promptly updated daily in CBS rates (prior to 10:30am for next gas day) so that we don't have any discrepancies between the FERC monthly report and the Transactional Report.

Give me a call if you have any questions.


Thanks,
Elizabeth
