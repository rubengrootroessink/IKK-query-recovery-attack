I was really thinking about the prep work needed for Sat evening.  Can we talk tonight?  What watering hole?  Where?

Sounds great!  I've always wanted to know a bar owner (but I'll bite my
tongue to limit the "bar" jokes that come to mind)...

Let me pose the question to my lovely wife and I'll get back to you
shortly...

Greetings and salutations!  I have an interest in a watering hole that just
opened up and Gwen and I have plans to spend a couple of hours there Friday
(9-11) after dinner and the kids are down.  Are available to join us for
post dinner aperitifs?
