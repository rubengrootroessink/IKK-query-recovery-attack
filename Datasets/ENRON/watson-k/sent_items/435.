Gary said no problem.  He just needs to know what time to pick us up at
home.  Think you can be downstairs at the Spires by 1 p.m.?

I agree with you on the Lexus.  I'm not sure we should take it out long
distance.  If Gary doesn't mind, that would be great.

ILY, K.

Are you comfortable with us taking the Lexus?  Gary has offered to let
us
take his car out and then I'll drive it back on Thursday (he, Lora Lee,
Ivy
and an aunt are heading off to a B & B in the hill country after the
meeting).  I'd almost rather do that than chance the Lexus'
transmission,
given how jumpy it was when I drove it over the weekend.

Besides, I don't think we could fit three persons' luggage in the trunk
of
the Volvo.

No problem, it will be nice to visit with him.

K.

PS.  Does this mean that I will be in the back seat of the convertable?
If so, I'm afraid we will have to ride with the top up.

Kim -

Gary Heaton is going to ride with us to SA on Friday.  I'll pick him up
at
noon and then we'll head down to you or to the Spires and leave from
there.

SYT,
John
