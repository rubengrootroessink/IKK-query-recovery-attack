J,

Do you think that if P & J and the kids went to Guam they would consider leaving Jo Lynn with the kids and come on to Hong Kong and join up with us?  

FYI, I still have small reservations about travelling abroad still close to our international situation.  Perhaps fear of the unknown.  Sitting on the fence.  Undecided.
