Kim

In a effort to expedite the materials for Questar I/C, can Questar look at what their time frame for getting the following material is to see if it would assist in getting the interconnect in service sooner.
If they have any questions on material, have them call me. 

1) 10" UltraSonic meter with Gallagher flow conditioner, tubes and calibrated. flow one direction.
2) Denials single stream chromatograph, Model 2350, with test gas, Heater box for test gas, and controls.
3) Bristol 3330 EFM with panel box std. 
4) MECO H20 Monitor
5) Building with heat/ac, general gas monitor, breaker with shunt, prewired. 10X10 Explosion proof
6) 12" full opening W X W hot tap valve 600# - Cooper valves are preferred vendor by material management on all valves.
7) 3 - 8" full opening ball valves 600#
8) 2 - 10" full opening ball valves with operators 600#
9) Rosemont's smart transmitters for pressure, diff and temp.
10) 8" Becker flow control valve 600#
