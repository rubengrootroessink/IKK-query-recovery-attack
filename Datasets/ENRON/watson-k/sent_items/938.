Cameron,
 
I'm glad you found the bulletin board.  The units are in MMBtu/d, the month should be specified by the column.  
 
Thanks, 
 
Kim Watson

Kimberly, 

As per our conversation this afternoon, I was able to find the information on the unsubscribed capacity portion of your website but I am unsure of the units.  For instance at the Loc Name "PNM RIO PUERCO BI-DEL" there appears to 70000 available for delivery.  Is this MMBtu/d, MMBtu/month, Mcf?? Any help would be appreciated.

Thank-you,
