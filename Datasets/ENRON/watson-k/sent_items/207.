Kim, I have some information on the Laguna Festival being faxed to me today. I will forward to you, if you get me your fax number. 
 Here are some contact numbers: Tribal Building --- 505-552-6654, Information on setting up a booth, Mike Silva @ 505-552-5429, To enter the parade, Ron Ray @ 505-552-6651. 
     We are planning to participate in the parade using the Enron go- carts and yes we are looking for some drivers (like you).            Look forward to hearing from you,    Rick
