Richard,

These summaries are great!  Our desk is starting to get more of a commercial focus on these imbalances.  May I ask you to put a date on the actual spreadsheet?  As I keep them from week to week, I find that I can't always tell which one is the most current summary.  

Many thanks and see you in the next Tues. meeting,
Kim.
