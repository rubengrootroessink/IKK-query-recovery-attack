The project C.014724 - Gray County Pipeline - was ready fro service on 12-1=
4-01. The Interconnect C.014798 - Gray County Interconnect - has not gone i=
nto service because of the bankruptcy filing by Enron. Vendors, will not sh=
ip us some transmitters and other start up materials unless we can pay for =
them up front. We have tried to work with them on payments and no luck to d=
ate. We are trying another option where a local contractor will purchase th=
e material and we will pay them for the service. As soon as we can get thes=
e issues settled, we can place the I/C into service.

Thanks

I don't see an update to C104724. Did this go into service in December?
