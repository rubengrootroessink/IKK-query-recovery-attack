Tiny,

Thanks for the note.  I'll let TK and Mark know that you got the money for the four wheeler.  Along with many, we will miss Rich a lot.  

Thanks, Kim.

Good to hear from you Kim.  First, I did get the check.. I've been out of the office for over two weeks so it will be cashed this week sometime. Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  

We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.  

Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....  My wife is making a card and we will have your names included...

Tiny, 

I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.

Good luck on Bisti!

Thanks, Kim.
