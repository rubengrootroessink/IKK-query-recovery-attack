Thank you, Audrey.

By the way, the marketing team is off campus tomorrow in a strategy session with Facility Planning.  Call me on the cell phone if you need me or anyone else on the team. (713 416 5059). 

Thanks, Kim.

Pam, please see the simple request I have for you attached (smile).  Kim Watson is now in my group and I need to make sure that her phone is supported.  Would you please handle this request?
