Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.     

Best Regards,  Rae
