All Team Members:  Please try to get your bullet items to Kim for her review no later than 10:00a on Friday mornings.  Kim has an awesome responsibility of getting the bullets to Steve by 11:00a on Friday mornings.

We will need your assistance in obtaining these objectives.  Let's try our best to get items in on time, even if means updating a few items after lunch.

Can you assist me in this effort?  Yes, you can!!!! (smile)

Have a great weekend....
