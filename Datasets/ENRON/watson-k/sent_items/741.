Steve,

FYI, I just talked with Jo and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term.  She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us.  She (and probably Vernon) will get back to us.  I'll keep you posted on our conversations.  

Kim.
