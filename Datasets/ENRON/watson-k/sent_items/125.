Thank you, Randy.  Lee did find someone to translate the last few lines.  Thank your for your assistance.  

Thanks, Kim.

Randy,

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.

CD Language Solutions, 713-661-9553, email: languagesolutions@prodigy.net

mellis.sanford@enron.com (can't find her number); she teaches Spanish at Enron

interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040

Carlos Varela #281-646-9754 (phone and fax), email is:  cvarela7@yahoo.com

If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.

Jeff
