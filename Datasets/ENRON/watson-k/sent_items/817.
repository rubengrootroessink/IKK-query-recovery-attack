Gaylen and Jodi,

Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet.  

Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending.  I've got a draft that I will update for the spending.  I'll send it to you soon.  

By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?  I am scheduled for the second session.

Thanks, Kim.
