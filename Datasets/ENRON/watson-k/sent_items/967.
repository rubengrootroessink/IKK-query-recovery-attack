TK,

What are your thoughts on resolving this?  Would it help for you to talk to Pauline?  How can we assist Darrell in this?

Thanks, Kim.

FYI

As of 11/11/01 SoCal's oba is a receivable of 358,416 mmbtus.  I know that we do not control the Needles point; however ????

SoCal's oba remains volumetric and a drop in index prices would cause a large dollar hit.
