Hi Robert,
 
Yes, I am still here!  However, the Research and Development department is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted. 
 
Kim.

Hi Kim,

Just a note to see if you are still there at Enron.

I have gotten many e-mails back, mostly the tech guys, including Vince.

But I don't remember having got e-mails back from you, so maybe you are still there.

If so, I certainly wish you the best in whatever direction you ultimately take.

Obviously, Transwestern is an important pipeline and will continue to operate.

If we can be of help at any time in the future after the dust finally settles, please let me know.

Stay in touch!

Thanks,

Bob Brooks
