Paula,

Thanks for your note.  I'll give you guys a call around 6:00.  I only need the critical one or two loads and actually, we only need the washing machine since our dryer still works.  Thanks for the kind offer of Chinese, but we've got several gifts to wrap for the office tomorrow so we'd better stay focused.  We truly appreciate your kindness!

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Please feel free to call us when you are ready to do some washing and
drying tonight. Ren will be home by 5:30-6:00 PM, and I should be there
shortly after. We are going to have Chinese delivered for dinner. If you
and John want to join us for Chinese while you the washing machine does
it's work, please let us know. We'll call in something for you as well.

Paula
