Michelle,

Did everything get paid?  Is all resolved?  Thanks, Kim.

Terrific news that the meeting with EOG went well last Friday.  I will speak to Mark Kraus (EOG Commercial) to recap, in case he was not aware of the results.  An invoice needs to be sent to them for the equipment we have already ordered.  My preference is for them to pay prior to any installation.  And, of course we want to inspect everything before we pull our equipment out on September 1.  You also had a question about the Interconnect and Operating Agreement... one had already been executed last August stating Enron will operate and EOG will own.  Thanks.
