Dang...  What do I say?  I heard the news last night.  I hate it, but I gotta say I'm excited for all of you!  

When I think of some of the folks who exemplify what Transwestern Pipeline is..... who's character Transwestern Pipeline was built on..... I just have a hard time  imagining Transwestern Pipeline without Kim Watson and Steve Harris.  

I am also so envious of you all.... (I'm turning green..Ha!)  I had serious hopes that KMI (Mrs. McDonald) would make a serious run at TW, but now, well we shall have to see.  If you all ever need a hard working, simple minded, trouble making, but dedicated field ops manager .... give me a call.   

I'm going to miss your enthusiasm.
