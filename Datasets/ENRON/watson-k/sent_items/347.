Hi Kim, I was referred to you by Audrey Robertson. 

I work for Morris Brassfield in his Contracts Administration dept. He has asked me to pull and make copies of all the O&M agreements for TW  that are being billed monthly so that we can review. 

The following is a list of O&M agreements that I am looking for. 

ECT/Bisti
ECT/Bloomfield
PNM Gas Services/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/La Plata

Would you have or know who would have the original executed agreements so that I can make copies for the Contracts department.  If you do have them I would be glad to go and make the copies myself.


Thanks,
Carmen (x56269)
ETS Contract Administration
