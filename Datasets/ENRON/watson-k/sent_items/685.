If you need assistance, please let me know.  I know Ruth, she actually worked in our group a couple of years ago.  Do you think we'll get an answer so we can sell before bid week ends for Feb business?

Kim.

Kim,

The responsibility for this has gone over to Ruth Concannon. I spoke with her yesterday and gave her some background information. I will talk with her again today.

Any luck connecting up with the ENA folks on the capacity release for February?
