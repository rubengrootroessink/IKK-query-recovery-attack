Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.  

The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.

In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.

Let us know your comments.

Here is an estimate for the upgrade to the Ivanhoe ESD system.   Please keep in mind that the HP at the location has not been in operation for several years and If it is ever required, we may be looking a major expense for that, too.  ($200,000+or-)

Here is what I came up with on the Ivanhoe Station.
