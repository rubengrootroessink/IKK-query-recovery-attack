Earl
The line number is NMBM154A1 . Please also consider the attached information from Ron and include this in your engineering scope if it makes a technical/ operational sense.

Mansoor,

The line north of the Blanco Hub Questar is tieing into is 30".  The line number is NMBM154A1 with an MAOP of 1009 psig.  There is 1368' of pipe.  Only thing we don't know is exactly wher on the line Questar will tie into.  Other issue came up was the installation of a blowoff near the valve on the north end.  Currently can't blow the line down properly on that end.  North end of the line is up a hill and the team is afraid they can't get the gas out blowing down hill.  Kim is aware about the blowoff and the team will look into the cost.  They claim the team can't install with help from the region welders at a cheap costs.  Hope this is enough info.
