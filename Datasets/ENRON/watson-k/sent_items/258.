twist....Lee Ferrell just left Enron last week.  He now works for Reliant.  I still want to invite him, it may take a day or two to track down his new phone number or email.  I will keep you posted.   

ILY, K.

Kim - we really need to get Lee Farrell locked down for either 11/3 or
11/17, so I can release Jane and Barry the other weekend.

John,
Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
and say hello to Kim.

Thanks again,
Jane
