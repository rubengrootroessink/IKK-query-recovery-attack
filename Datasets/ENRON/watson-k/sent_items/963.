I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I
might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does
it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K.

...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just
talked to Bob Corrigan and scheduled to meet him for lunch and we could
both
see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...
