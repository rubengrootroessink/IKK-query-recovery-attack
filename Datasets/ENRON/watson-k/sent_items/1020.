Blair, per my voice mail message.  If you can, would you please review and let me know if you have any comments.  It is a very standard, fully reimusable I/C.  

Thanks, Kim.

Steve and Teb, 

Please find attached the agreement for Questar Southern Trails I/C with TW in the San Juan Hub.  It is very standard, just like the Agave agreement.  Fully reimbuseable.  

Please let me know if you have any comments. 

Thanks, Kim.
