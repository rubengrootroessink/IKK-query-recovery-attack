Audrey,  would you send an invite to Brad Holmes and Teb Lokey?  Thanks, Kim.  

Sorry, I tried hard to make sure we didn't leave anyone off.

I would include Brad Holmes who is Ramona's Director (If you do not know him, I would take the time to chat with him.) and what about Teb Lokey.

Donna, would you please check this distribution list and let me know if you think we might have accidentally omitted someone that should have received an invite?  I don't want to leave anyone out that should come.  Thanks, Kim.
