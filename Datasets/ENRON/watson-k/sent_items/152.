Lorraine,

Do we need to put this in the 2002 Capital Budget?

Kim.

Eric - Duke wants to begin working on logistics for a power plant off TW in Curry County NM.  Can you assign a Facility Planner to work with me in determining exact location and cost estimates for tie-in.  The approximate location is the southern 1/2 of Sec 17, T1N, R36E.  Duke is quite anxious to get moving on a cost estimate.  Thanks in advance.

Lorraine
