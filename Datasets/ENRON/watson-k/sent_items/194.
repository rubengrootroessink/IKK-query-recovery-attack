Mary,
I got your voicemail last week.  I am so glad you guys had a great time.  John and I leave for Italy at the end of the month for two weeks.  I am very ready........Will you be coming to Houston this fall?

Thanks, Kim.

Howdy Miss Kim,

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

Hugs,

M
