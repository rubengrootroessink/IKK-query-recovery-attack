Hattie, 
 
Yes, I will fax it to you when I get home tonight.  In fact, when you get it, why don't you call me and we can talk about it.  This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school.  They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.  I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.  
 
My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.
 
Thanks, Kim.   :>)

Kim:
       Would you please fax the Red Pepper Soup recipe to me at (281) 334-2466?  The (409) fax number is Jim's office -- and he is in New Orleans all week.  
       Thank you, Kim.
