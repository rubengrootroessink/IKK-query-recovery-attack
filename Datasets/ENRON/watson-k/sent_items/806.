Yes, however, I thought I saw an earlier message from you booking this meeting at 9:00.  Either time works for me.  Please confirm. 

Thanks, Kim.

Audrey, 
Could you please check Steve's and Kim's calendars to see if I can visit with them for about 30 mins
on Wed - Fri this week or some time next week. It will essentially be a Feedback/Update meeting on Facility planning and optimization support to marketing.
Thank you
Ben
