Steve or Drew, 

Please advise on what to do with the Mavrix phone since we will be moving to the 13th floor on Friday.  

Thanks, Kim.

Eric will not be taking that phone when we move.  Before I advise Pam Daily of this do you want input  as to where it should go or how this should be handled.

Thanks!
