Paul, 

I'm am sorry that I will not be able to meet you for lunch today.  I have been on the road travelling for the past two weeks and have over 250 emails to catch up on.  I do look forward to catching up with you guys on Sunday.  Good luck at the dentist.

Thanks, Kim.

I've got a dentist appointment at 11:00 on Friday.  Same place on Shepherd I
have been going.

Are either one of you available for lunch after that?

PS:  Power is doing fine with his cast.  Penny, if you haven't heard, he
broke his arm last week in a bike wreck.
