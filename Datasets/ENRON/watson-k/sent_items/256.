Hey guys,

Since I am out of the office tomorrow, here is the beginning of the bullets.  I need to you add your weekly bullets to this list.  Please coordinate with each other before you send them to Audrey (by 10:00am, please).  Please file save the final version on the shared drive under my folder.  All of the previous weeks bullets are in the folder by date order.
