Vince, I would like to visit with you about this training.  Also, I noticed that you had some of the folks in our shop on the invite list, but not all of them?  Are you available on Monday by phone to visit with me about this training?  I would be available at 2:00pm for half an hour.  Let me know if this works for you. 

Thanks, Kim.
