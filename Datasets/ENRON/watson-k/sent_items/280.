Susan,

I just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in Eric's group (plus Steve Dowd) have a place to land when we move.  I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack.  Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?  

Thanks, Kim.
