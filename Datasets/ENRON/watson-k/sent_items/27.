Mary,

You are going to have such a great time!  Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.  You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.  A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.  Is your jacket water wary?  Tennis shoes are definitely OK!

You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.  Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.  Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).  Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.  Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!

Call me when you get back.  I'd love to hear all about your trip!

Hugs back at you, Kim.

P.S.  Stay away from Haggus(spelling?).

Howdy Miss Kim,

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

Hugs,

M
