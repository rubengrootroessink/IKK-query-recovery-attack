Jean,  all is correct except that Steve Harris should get two flat screens instead of Michelle and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for Michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  
 
Many thanks, 
Kim

2 to Palu G.
2 to Jan Moore
2 to Lorainne Lindberg
2 to TK Lohman
2 to Lindy Donoho
2 to Jeff Fawcett's desk (he's gone.. right next to Lorainne)
14
 
Kim -- is this distribution correct?
 
Thanks.  Jean
