All three weekends were available, but Jim & Hattie (our hosts) can't do it
the 10th.  Let me go back to Jane with the 10th, since we know that won't be
GG.  OK?  JW

What were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?  Didn't we offer all
three weekends?  I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we
might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel
during the week of Thanksgiving.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim - Any reason I can't tell Jane 11/3?  That's one of the Gourmet
Group
dates, but we can steer that to the 17th, I think.  Or should I offer
Jane
the 10th?  Did you have a conflict then?  JW

Pencil in the 3d and the 17th.  We'll narrow it down to one or the other
shortly.

Looking forward to it!

John
