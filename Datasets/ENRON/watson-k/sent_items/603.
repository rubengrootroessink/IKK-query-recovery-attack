Kim,  The O&M dollars allocated by the NNG commercial group to TW for the 2002 plan are as follows:

	Storage 				$128,246
	South Power				$ 37,230
	Business Services			$ 61,437
	Executive				$ 96,089
	Pricing					$ 80,255
	Rents & Facilities			$146,109
	Reg Affairs				$208,519
						$757,885

I sent you an email earlier today with some info on the dollars allocated from the Marketing cost centers.  Gary Sova will provide us with a brief explanation for the Business Services and Rents and Facilities allocation.  The Reg Affairs dollars are for mostly related to Glen Hass.  	

Please let me know if you have questions.  I will be out tomorrow, Friday, but back in the office on Monday.
