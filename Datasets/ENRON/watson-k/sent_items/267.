TK,

Are you referring to the Dynegy deal in December being the "I to I" deal that we have already hedged?  Have you already included the previous "I to I" deals that you have done earlier in the year?  Outside of these deals, I am not aware of any others.  

Thanks, Kim

Mary Davrveaux is asking the question is there any other negotiated rates in 2001 other than USGT in November and Dynegy in December.  This is all I remember.  Please let me know if you have any additions.
