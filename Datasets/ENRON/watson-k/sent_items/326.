I've got an 8:30 meeting at the office.  I can do later in the morning or afternoon.  Can you take him alone? K.

We have an 8 a.m. appointment tomorrow (Tuesday) morning with Tracey McAdoo.
Can you and I both go?  I had the option of leaving him there tonight for a
tomorrow exam, but I didn't want to stress him out any more than
necessary....  JW
