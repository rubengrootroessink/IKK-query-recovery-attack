Jean,

This does not look cool.  Who should I report this to?  How did these people get my email address?  

Thanks, Kim.

for a reliable and trust worthy individual that can
handle this confidential business.

I am Dr. Benneth C. Micheal, the manager of United
bank for Africaplc (U.B.A)Agege/Ijaye-Ogba Branch,
Lagos-Nigeria. I am writng in respect of a foreign
customer in my branch, who was working with one of the
government parastatal as a contractor, he was the
owner of the No 0140351577400
ID No470089 swift code No:23TUBA, he has in this
account in my branch the sum of US$ 65 Million 
(sixty five millionU.S Dollars) before he died in a
plane crash {ETHIOPIAN AIRLINE 961) four years ago
with the hole passengers aboard perished.

Since, the demise of this on customer, i have been
wateling with keen interest to see the next of kin but
all has proved abortive, for no one has ever come to
claim his fund. Having noticed this, immediatly i
covered up the account, now want you (being a
foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next kin and
forward your account and other relevant document to be
advised to you by the bank to attest to the claim, as
the banking ethies here does not allow such money to
stay more than four years after which the money will
be recalled to the bank treasury asd unclaimed nafter
this year 1/3 quater auditing.

So, I decided to contact you to seek for your help and
assistance to use your name as the next of kin to the
deceased. I am wiling to give to you a hole total of
40% of the total sum, upon the reciept of your
personal response, I will than send to you via fax or
email to you the application, which you will fill and
send back to the bank applying as the next of kin, for
the immediate realasing of the fund to you. Along with
the bank fax No and the next step to take.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
business is hitch free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all modalites for the realise of
this fund wil be finalized with in ten working days to
get the fund retrieved successfully from the day you
apply to the bank as a reletion to the deceased.

Please you are required to corresponde only via e-mail
till the end of this transaction for the security and
confidenciality reasons of this business please. Also
signify your decission including your e-mail address.
