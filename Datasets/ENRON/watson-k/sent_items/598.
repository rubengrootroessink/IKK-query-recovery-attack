We have and we like it, too...

Why don't we plan to meet there at 6:30 or 7 p.m. (whatever works for you)?
Will that give you guys enough time to settle the home front before coming
back to town?

John

Have you all been to Crostini's on Shepherd between Westheimer and Fairview?
We had a department lunch there before Christmas and it was wonderful.  The
lobster bisque in a bread bowl was fabulous!  What time should we shoot for?
