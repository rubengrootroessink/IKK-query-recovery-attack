Please keep me posted.  I am off next week, but I would like to book lunch =
with you in the next couple of weeks just to catch up.  Twenty-six floors i=
s too far away from you guys.  What does your calendar look like.  Throw me=
 a couple of dates that may work for you.

Thanks,
K.=20

Michelle

=09How about a meeting?  I'm not sure how long I've known you but I know I'=
ve liked you since the first day.  You're a smart, capable Account Manager =
but we seem to be developing friction.  I know we both want the same thing;=
 deals to go out as quickly and smoothly as possible... so where's our prob=
lem? It seems from my side (which could very well be WRONG) that we're cons=
tantly going over procedures, how the process works and what information I =
need... stuff everyone should know.  Maybe I'm wrong but it's very frustrat=
ing.  Maybe it's because NNG's system is automated and it's just harder to =
do TW deals.  Maybe it's because procedures weren't followed after Christin=
e left and we've had to do lots of work to try and catch back up.  The Deal=
 Capture team was also suppose to get a 3rd team member so it's VERY diffic=
ult to process all the NNG deals and TW deals at the end of each month... I=
 think we did 75 deals in the last 4 days of October.  Let me know if you'r=
e available to talk this week... afternoons are best for me.
