Tiny,

I wanted you to know that I am putting a "check in the mail" to you (and made out to you) in the amount of $50 to be used toward the gift for Rich.  The money is from:
	TK Lohman - $20
	Mark McConnell - $10
	Kim Watson - $20

I apologize I didn't get it in the mail earlier this week, but everyday seemed to be a Monday for me this week.  If you have Rich's home address, I would love to send him a note.

Thanks for coordinating this!

Kim
