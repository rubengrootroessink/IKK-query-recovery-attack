Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated =
flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux =
Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/=
01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It sho=
wed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the fie=
ld into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let=
 me know.

Jerry
