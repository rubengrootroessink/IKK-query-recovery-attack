James,

Would you please send Kevin Howard the email version of the economics for Trans Pecos and copy me.  Kevin is working with ArcLight as a potential equity investor for our portion of Trans Pecos.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim and Eric:
Could we send to ArcLight the models for TransPecos and Sun Devil that reflect what we had in today's presentation? You can either send directly to him (and cc me) or send to me and I will forward on to them.  Everyone did a great job today.  Thanks again.
Kevin
