Hi Sherri,
 
Well, your ears must have been burning.  I have been thinking about you this week.  Gee, a lot has happened since we last spoke.  I'm still here.  We are very busy on Transwestern.  I would love to catch up with you, are you available by phone sometime next week?  My calendar looks pretty open next Tues, Wed or Fri.  
 
I look forward to visiting with you soon.
 
Kim
 
P.S.  Martha is still here, also.  She is with the Northern Natural side, I'm with Transwestern.
