Presidential Task Force on Oil
spillage,DepartmentofPetroleum Resources,
Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL
WORTH$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS
STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir/Madam,
This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief
that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out
of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner
whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping.
This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am
Dr.Igho Richard, the secretary to the
PresidentialTaskforce on
Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest
producer of crude oil in the world and more often than
not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger
Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a
lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence
contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to
clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas
affected. The spillage sometimes cover several
kilometres and the value of contract also runs into
millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some
contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign
firms by  my committee. While awarding these
contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over
invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty
one million, eight hundred thousand dollars)
What we did was to in addition to the original
contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount
separately and it is presently lying idle in a
suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria.
This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we
cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in
the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What
we desire at this moment is to have this funds
transferred into a foreign account but being civil
servants who are still in active government service,
we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas.
Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a
view to going into a joint partnership to get this
fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you
to provide us with a bank account where this fund can
be transferred into first and thereafter, we would
come over to your country to take possession of our
share where we hope to invest part in profitable
ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to
inform you that the nature of your business or
profession at this point is immaterial  because in all
over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and
winning some contract especially in a third world
economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the
contract to other firms for execution. It could also
be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So,
you or your organization, having the status of a
subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an
application for the payment of this fund in your name
and into your bank account. We have agreed in
principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5%
will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to
you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to
take care of any expenses during the course of this
transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of
this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal
and administrative requirement in Nigeria as
applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.
If your response is in the affirmative, within a
period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund
would have been confirmed and transferred into your
account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into
consideration and I want to assure you that it is
actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded
in your name before the application will be made. We
will follow the procedures systematically with
flawless documentation. This is authentic.
If you feel you will be of assistance and a
beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to
this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with
more information as to the smooth take off and
conclusion of this once in a
lifetimeopportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely,
Dr.Igho Richard.
