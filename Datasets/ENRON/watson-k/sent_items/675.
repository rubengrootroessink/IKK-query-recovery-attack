Bruce and Dave,

For your review and input, here is the latest version of the LOI for Pemex.  Mark and I will come over this afternoon and spend just 15-20 minutes with you and walk you through some of our thoughts.  

Thanks, 

Kim and Mark

Attached for your review and comments is a revised version of the TransPecos LOI, which I believe reflects our discussions this morning.
