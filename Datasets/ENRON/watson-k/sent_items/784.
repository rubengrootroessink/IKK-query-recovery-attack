Great, I'll see you at 2:00.  I am coming back in town on Wed, so if I can get back to the office by 1:30, do you want me to call you to come over early?
 
Thanks, Kim.

Yes, I am available after 2:00.  I think our plane leaves around 4:00 or after, so right at 2:00 p.m. would probably be best.  Can you do that?  IF so, I will walk over to the enron building and meet you in the lobby at 2:00 p.m.
