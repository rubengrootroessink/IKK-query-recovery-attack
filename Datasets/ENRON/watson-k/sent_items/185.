What do I need to do with this?  Should we be talking to our customers?  Are we all in agreement as to our position?   I just want to make sure that I'm not letting anything slip through the crack. 

Thanks, Kim.

Do either of you have info concerning the intervenors/protestors and their issues that could be distributed electronically before next Tuesday?  Glen, maybe you could also distribute you summary of TW's filing with that info.

Lindy - Is there a way for someone to compile a list of shippers who protested and intervened in our compliance filing and what the issues are prior to this meeting?

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.
