Subject:	Station #4 Overhaul Outage

Planning and System Optimization have agreed that the effected throughput during the Station #4 overhaul outage should be 150 MMcf/d.  This should be posted and the firm transports can be adjusted up or down depending on the ability of the system after the first day.  Past 2001 outages related to Station #4 show effected throughput ranging from 120 - 190 MMcf/d.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call.
