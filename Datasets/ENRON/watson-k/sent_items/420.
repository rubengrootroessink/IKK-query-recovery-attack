Hi Kyle!

I must not have your current office telephone number.  Please send it to me.  I would like to connect up with you this weekend if you are available.  I cleaned all of our closets last week and have the "big load" that I would like to pass on to you for your MANNA collection.  

How on earth are you?  I am still sad and overwhelmed from the Sept. 11 tragedy.  I cannot believe we watched that event unfold like that!  These are certainly interesting times....

Call me or email me, I'd like to visist!

 Many thanks,

Kim.
