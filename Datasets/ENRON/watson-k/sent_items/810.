Steve,

Are you available on Wednesday to discuss the Ivanhoe station?  We want to describe to you what the situation is and get your advice on what our regulatory options are.  I'm available anytime except 9:00-10:00 and 2:00-3:00.  

Mansoor, how about you?

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, regarding the question below pertaining to the abandonment of units at Ivanhoe, what do we need to do next?  We are currently out of compliance on the ESD system and would like to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.
Randy
