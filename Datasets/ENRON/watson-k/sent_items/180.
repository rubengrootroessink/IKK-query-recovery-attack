I have a tentative Spires Board meeting.  I should know in the next week or so if that is a firm date.  If it is not, then I would love to be at Perry's with you.  

ILY, K.

Darlin' -

Another dinner at Perry's Grille in the Woodlands, Wednesday, September 26,
6:30 p.m.  I'll be attending, but I'd love to have you there, too.

Can you make it?
