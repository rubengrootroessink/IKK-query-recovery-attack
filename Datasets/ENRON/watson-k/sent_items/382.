Kimberly,

I'm sorry, I was out of the office last week and did not see this email in time.  I think it looks fine.  I saw the final version in the ebiz today.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim:

I work with Gina Taylor in Communications, and I was wondering if you would review this to see if it makes sense. It is for this Friday's Layman's Terms in eBiz.

Also, after reading this, do you think we need to put in the story the % of firm and interruptible service on Enron's pipelines? What is the advantage of firm? Would you please also verify the analogy?

Thanks!

Kimberly
