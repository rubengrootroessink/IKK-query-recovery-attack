Received a call today from Russ Boone with Duke out of Salt Lake City.  He was inquiring as to the cost of an interconnect and approximately 2 miles of pipe for Phase 1 - 105 mmbtu, and Phase 2 - 210 mmbtu.  He said he felt confident that 10" pipe could be used and asked if I could provide him with a ball park number on cost for Phase 1.  If I understood him correctly the location of the interconnect will be somewhere between West Texas and Roswell...   I didn't really get to much detail as I informed him that I would get in contact with someone that could provide him with the info requested.  He asked that if at all possible someone get back with him today.  (Tuesday)  

He can be reached at 801-531-4423.
