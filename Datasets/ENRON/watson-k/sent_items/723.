Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated this afternoon on the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
Citizens K #20822 Res - flowed alternate deliveries to Socal Needles of 32,145 dth and should be billed incremental fees [I have prepared a spreadsheet to calculate at the max applicable tariff rate for the alternate path]
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
