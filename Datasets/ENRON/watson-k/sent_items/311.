Dave, as you can see I mis-typed your email address on the original sent to Jorge.  This letter has a typo in the last para.  Please use the revised letter sent as the one to go by.  Call if you have questions. 

Thanks, Kim.

Dear Jorge, 

Per our conversation on this past Monday, here is the letter we talked about.  We have an original that will be placed in the mail today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.  

Sincerely,

Kim.
