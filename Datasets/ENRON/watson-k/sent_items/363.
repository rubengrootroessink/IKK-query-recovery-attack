Actually, Audrey might know of some place.  If not her, check with Linda Wehring, she knows absolutely everything!

Thanks for all of your help today!  We really appreciate it!

Kim.

	Kim--

	I think we finished all the letters.  It was fun helping you guys out!

	By the way, do you have any books in your dept. for ordering supplies with logos/names etc. on them?  I was trying to 
	find a place from which I could order some napkins, plastic glasses, etc. with a name on it, as a B-day gift for someone.
