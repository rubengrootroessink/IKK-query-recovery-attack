Earl,

Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?  [Chanley, Earl]  Will call Agave and make request  Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?  [Chanley, Earl]  No  FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week.  If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files.   [Chanley, Earl]  Have not received your copy to date, will send to Mansoor when received.  

Let me know if I need to talk to Agave.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim

Received an as-built package for the interconnect on West Texas Lateral. Material matches up but there is not a hydro test and test log for the installation. This is needed to set MAOP and PHD of the facility.
