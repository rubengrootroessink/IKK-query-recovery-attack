Great draft Maria.  I couldn't resist adding some stuff.  Remember Kathy's transcript correction?  Barry's testimony originally read exactly like Kathy's protest--they both demanded that released capacity and our own capacity be posted "on the same platform" whatever that means.  The correction added "on the same page" to the "same platform" concept.  I inserted a paragraph that suggested that the Indicated Shippers aren't sure what the hell they want and keep changing their story so should be ignored.  Cut it if you like but it was amusing.
