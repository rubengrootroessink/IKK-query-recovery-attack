John is for sure out of town, I think I will travel out with him for the weekend, but I have not confirmed it just yet.  If I find that I will be in town, I'll let you know.  Don't hold anything up for me. 

Thanks, Kim.

Lorraine:

Lets poll the group and see about ...... ....clap the hands together and say, "Champagne",  Champagne Tasting.

When:		Saturday, October 20th
Time:		12:00 - 2:00
Where:		Brennan's
Class Size:	Minimum of 12 people
Cost:		$65.00/pp

The $65.00 will entail tasting of 6 varieties of champagne and a tasting plate (which was like a full meal).

Cheers!
