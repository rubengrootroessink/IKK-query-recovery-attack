Thanks, Sue.
 
Actually, today is my last day in the office.  I will start with KMI (doing Business Development)  in a couple of weeks.  I've got your phone number, I'll call you when I know mine and we'll set something up for later this month.
 
I hope all is well with Dynegy.
 
Thanks again,
 
Kim.
