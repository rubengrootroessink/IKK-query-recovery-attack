Audrey,  No Steve Harris's cost center is not currently charged for use of the video conference.  We are however currently assessing allocating some portion of the cost to the various users.

Dana, would you be able to tell me if Steve's Cost Center is being charged for the use of the Video Conference Room - EB-4102.  If it is, what percentage.
 
Thanks in advance,

Audrey, as far as I know, TW is not presently being charged for the Marketing Video Conference room.  Dana could probably tell you more but we were under the impression that it was all being charged to NNG.  If you do not get this resolved with Dana, let me know and I will do some additional research on it.
 
Talk to you tomorrow.
