Stuart,

Your ears, or maybe mine, must have been burning lately.  I have been thinking about you over the past couple of days and wanted to call you and schedule lunch.  Is your new office in the Greenway Plaza area?  Gosh, we have lots to catch up on from both your side and mine.

Congratulations!  I know you must be excited and I can't wait to hear about your new opportunities with WHES!

What is you schedule the week of March 18?  Are you available for lunch anytime the week of 3/18?

Thanks, 

Kim.
