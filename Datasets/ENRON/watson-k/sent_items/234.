Robbin,

Please forgive me for not sending this in by Aug. 15.  I've been caught up in several heavy projects and forgot to put it all together.  I have all my info in a big envelope and I will get it sorted in an organized fashion and get it to you in the next few days.  If this is a problem, please let me know.  I would be happy to discuss this with you.  

Again, I apologize for the delay.

Many thanks, Kim.
