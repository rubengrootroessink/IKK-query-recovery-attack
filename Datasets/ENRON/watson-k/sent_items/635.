Kevin,

In following up with the Chief Credit Officer ( who is out today ) another person ( Steven Tilley in Credit ) returned my call. He advised they were not impressed with the letter and that Bankruptcy was a possibility. I replied that this is the best that we could offer short of a guarantee and that no one can predict one/two years down the road. I offered our financials which they will send a CA. I believe it would help it you could discuss their issues. I explained that improving their status was not possible, but Tilley continued to pursue. 

I have set a time on Monday at 8:30 CST for us to call Michael Sessa, Chief Credit Officer and Tilley.

Please advise if that will work for your schedule.

Regards.

Sorry for this omission. Sempra inquired could they obtain a more superior creditor status than normal? 

Thanks.

Kevin,

I wanted to provide an update. The conversation went well. I am faxing the " letter " , have offered the CA for financials, and walked Sempra through TW. Upon the review of the letter they will get back with me if there are further questions. Also I offered your participation if needed. With your permission may I have your proxy to sign the letter?
As an FYI the people on the call were the counterpart of Paul Y and the Chief Credit Officer.

Will keep you posted.

Regards.
