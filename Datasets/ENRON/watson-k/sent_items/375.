Richard, thanks for this message.  John and I will also be attending.  the Cirque du Soleil is on the TUTS tour and we have season tickets.  I will find out when our date is (usually a Saturday mat.) and let you know in on the chance that the date may also work for you guys.

Thanks, Kim.

Four years ago we went to a performance of Cirque du Soleil in tent on the
Astrodome parking lot.  Cirque du Soleil is coming back to Houston early
next year.  See the message below to get advance tickets.  We're going!
