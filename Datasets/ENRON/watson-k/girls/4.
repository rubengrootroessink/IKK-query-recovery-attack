Mark your calendars!  Pack your bags!  Gas up the car!  The next Girls' 
Weekend is scheduled.

When:  April 12 - 14
Place:  Marble Falls, Texas

Let me know by return e-mail if you think you can come.  I'll get back with 
you on all the specifics (driving directions, what to bring, and that ever 
important topic - FOOD and WINE).  If you'd like to spend a bit longer in 
Marble Falls, Phyllis can accommodate Thursday arrivals and Monday 
departures.  Just let me know so we can reserve your bed.

Some members of the group have been having a difficult time lately, so let's 
all get together and be supportive of each other.  For all mobile members of 
the group, some shopping in Fredricksburg is available on Saturday.

Looking forward to seeing all of the you,
Janell

P.S.  Should your e-mail address suddenly change (for whatever reason!), be 
sure to keep in contact with me (phone 501-922-4133).
