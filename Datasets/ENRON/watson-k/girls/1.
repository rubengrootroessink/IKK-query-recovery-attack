Sounds like almost everyone can make the weekend.  It will be fun.
Ready for your food assignments?  Well, here they are:

Friday Dinner:  If you get there by 7pm, we will be going out to eat. (We
might leave a note on the door telling you where we are.) If you get there
later, you are on your own for dinner, but Lisa promises to leave the door
unlocked and the light on for you.  (The dog doesn't bite too hard.)

Saturday Breakfast:  Sam and Lee

Saturday Lunch:  We'll be going down to Kemah for lunch, drinks by the bay
and shopping.  If you're not up for it, you can stay at home by the pool and
relax, while we gossip about you.

Saturday Dinner:  Cynthia, Paula, and Phyllis  (make it lite, please)

Sunday Breakfast:  Kim and Janell

Snacks:  Judy, Lisa and Oni

As usual, everyone should bring drinks enough for one.  A few wine bottles
would be delightful, also.  Lisa says she has plenty of "paper products",
but I'm not sure she has enough toilet paper for all of us for the weekend,
so throw some of that in your bag too if you have extra at home.  Call me if
you have questions.

The next Girls' Weekend will be:

November 10th (7 pm) through November 12th
At Lisa Polk's house:  14023 Bay Oaks Blvd, Houston Texas  77059
