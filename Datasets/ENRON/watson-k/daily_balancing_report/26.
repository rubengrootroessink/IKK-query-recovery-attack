Please see attached SUMMARY-ONLY version of TW Daily Balance Report.

 

I wanted to let you know that I have consulted the leading experts in the field, and all of my son Matthew's textbooks (he's seven), and arranged the letters of the alphabet in their proper order. Whew! The formula notations have been corrected to reflect this new-world-order. I will forward to all of you explanations of the formulas this week.

Remember, the far-right columns R,S and T are still being worked on! Don't bet your house on them.

As always, call me if you have any questions.

Thanks!
