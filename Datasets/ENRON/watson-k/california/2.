Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that marketers have market power at the border.

By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the California border.

Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?

Best,
Jeff
