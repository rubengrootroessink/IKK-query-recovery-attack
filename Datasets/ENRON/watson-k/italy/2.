Dear Ms Watson,

thank you for your kind fax of yesterday and for your interest in our hotel.

I am afraid, but we do not have enough double rooms left available for the dates you require. If at all suitable for you, over the same dates we can offer you one of the following accomodations:
       - either TWO triple rooms     - OR one double room and one large room for four people
all our rooms have private shower/WC, color TV/radio, air conditioning and telephone.

The daily rate for such rooms in that period (extremely busy) is Lit. 320000 for each triple room OR Lit. 240000 for the double room and Lit. 400000 for the quadruple one, which at the moment works out to be around US$ 150+150 or 113+187 per night, including buffet breakfast and all taxes and service charges.

Should you wish to book (and I really hope so), we would need a confirmation e-mail or fax from you together with your Visa, Master, Amex or Diners' Club credit card number and expiration date, which will only prove as a guarantee of your arrival. Otherwise, you can e-mail or fax us the confirmation and then send us a cheque for the first night's amount, but this takes longer and is more expensive both on your and on our side. Please note that cancellations or amendments should be made in writing up to one week before arrival at the latest, otherwise the amount of the first cancelled night will be charged.

Our hotel is very centrally located only 150 yards away from Florence Cathedral and very close to all monuments and museum. In order to reach it from the Railway Station, there is a choice of three options:
- a taxi will cost around Lit. 12000 and is readily available from the main exit in front of tracks no. 8-9-10);
- by bus lines 11 or 17 from the side exit by track no. 5: get off at the stop after the Cathedral and walk another 50 yards on the other side of the street;
- walk all the way (8-10 minutes): leave the Station by the side exit by track no. 16, take the underpass to the right until the end of it and then keep going straight ahead for about 400 yards, until reaching the Cathedral (a massive white church): at that stage turn left into Via Martelli, which becomes Via Cavour after 50 yards.

I hope that we shall be able to warmly welcome you all to our small and family managed hotel and I can assure you that we shall endeavour to make your stay in Florence as pleasant as possible. 

Yours sincerely,
