If it was okay before its okay now.  My opinion has changed since I was 20
but not that much since last year.

Using our same logic for Hotel Firenza I vote for the cheaper room but if
its one of each we can flip a coin or eat a pizza. If you find room at the
other place (Hotel Marincanto) in Positano, decide where you want to stay
and put us in the same hotel.  I don't see that we'll be in the hotel that
much.

We'll let John (the stair master) lead the way up the hill.


Let me know how Sunday looks.  I have a tentative invite to the airport if
we don't hook up at the vert. village

I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do
have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least
one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD)
and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately
$192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their
fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in
the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I
read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use
the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking
at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way)
steps to it.

Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and
two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know
what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our
preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall
we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?

Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before
finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look
them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.


P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed
for June 7 & 8!
