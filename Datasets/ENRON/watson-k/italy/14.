Ms. Vespoli -

Thanks for the name correction.  One confirming question:  do you have TWO
of the standard double rooms, instead of one standard and one superior, for
the same dates?  We'd like to have the same class of room instead of having
to "flip a coin" to decide who gets which room.

Thanks,
John Watson
