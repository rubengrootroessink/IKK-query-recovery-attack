Thanks Kim.

After school makes the logistics easier for us.  Katy lets out 5/23/02.

A thought.  I'm not sure what's happening next week let alone next year, but
with current events we might want to consider a Western i.e. Pacific Island,
Australia, Alaska trip?  Either way this sounds like an excuse to have
dinner and a bottle of wine in the near future.  Of course the advantage of
Italy is we already have it mapped out.

FYI, we are considering CA or HI with the kids over Thanksgiving.  I've
about talked myself out of Guam if we only have a week and I don't want to
take Power off the plane one day and into school the next with the time zone
challenge associated with Guam.
