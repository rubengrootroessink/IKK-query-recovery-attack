Thanks for verifying the flow conditions out of WT-1, it appears we might have 35 mmcfd extra capacity above the 550 mmcfd WT-1 discharge capacity, using your assumptions.  Can you please check the following flow scenario using the stated FT conditions:

	1.	EPFS flowing 85 mmcfd into the high discharge of WT-1.
	2.	Crawford, Atoka, Maljamar , Zia and WT-2 bypassed gas which totals 500 mmcfd.

Can Sta 9 still handle the pressure, and what is the breakdown of volumes at each of the points on the suction side of WT-1?
I show FT volumes of about 500 mmcf on the discharge of WT-1 in Nov & Dec of 02.  I need to know if the 85 mmcfd at EPFS Eddy can be dedicated to the expansion receipts.  I think that there is some Crawford gas available in excess of their 40 mmcfd of current firm, that can be dedicated to the expansion receipts, but I need to know that volume.  I will get with you to figure out the point volumes this morning sometime.

Morgan would like to have a brief meeting to discuss these options sometime this afternoon.  Let me know what I can do to assist in your analysis.

Thanks PT  3-0667

Thanks Mansoor.

Perry - How much Central Pool gas accounts for the 550 MMBtu/d that we already have sold through WT-1?

	The  questioins were:

1)	What volume of gas can be received from Elapso-Field-Services ( on discharge side of WT-1) and NGPL-  Eddy assuming that 550 mmcf/d is the 		capacity of WT-1 flowing north to Sta-9 :
	
			Elpaso	NGPL-Eddy	Total at Sta-9
	Option-1 	10		25		585 mmcf/d
	Option-2	15		20		585 mmcf/d
	Option-3	0		35		585 mmcf/d
	
	In this scenario the pipe can handle up to 585 mmcf/d.


2)	What is the pipeline capacity from WT-2 flowing north to WT-1:
	
	WT-1 discharge pressure 	WT-2 discharge pressure	Line capacity
	
	970 psig			1040 psig			250 mmcf/d
	980				1040				244
	985				1040				215

	The maximum capacity of this line is 250 mmcf/d and it is depend on the operating pressure of WT-1 on a every day basis..
