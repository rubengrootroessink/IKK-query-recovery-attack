As discussed earlier, the tap size for the above mentioned project is 16" and both main and loop lines would be tapped.  The milepost for the tie in is MP116.5 right close to mainline valve 1008.  The attached cost estimate was the latest one prepared which was August 13, 2001.  This is still a Level A cost.  Good guess is about $10,000 or less to do a Level B scope and cost estimate.  Let me know what Caithness wants in the way of an estimate.
