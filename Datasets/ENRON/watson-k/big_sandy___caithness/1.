Hi Kim.
Well, I am back from Houston, and would love to visit with you regarding the
agreements/estimates.
How does tomorrow look on your calendar?
I am also available Monday bright and early.
Thanks,
Kirk

Kirk,

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point
Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will
have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let
me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday,
Thursday or Friday.  

Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!

Thanks, 

Kim
