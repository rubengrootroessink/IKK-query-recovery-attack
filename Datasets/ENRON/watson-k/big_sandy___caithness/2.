Thanks Kim.
To the extent that my schedule frees a bit, I will check in with you to see
if you have some time.
If not, then I will give you a buzz Wednesday or Thursday to discuss.
Kirk

Kirk,

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point
Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will
have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let
me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday,
Thursday or Friday.  

Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!

Thanks, 

Kim
