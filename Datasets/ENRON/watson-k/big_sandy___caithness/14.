Kim,
 
The attached file contains a recap of the Timberline program results with a few mods.  Basic information covers what Earl and I talked about today.  Caithness engineer and Earl have discussed the use of an Ultrasonic with all of the accessories.  All of the estimates provided in the past year have been Level A's.  If we wnat a contract quality number, we need to get Engineering involved in the cost estimate.  
 
Caithness Big Sandy was not willing to spend money on an estimate when Jeff, Earl, and I met with them early in the project.  Maybe they will change their minds since the project is progressing.  Kim, let's talk with them tomorrow to feel them out.  Let me know what you think.  
 
THIS IS A +30% COST ESTIMATE.
