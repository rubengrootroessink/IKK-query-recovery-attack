Hi Kim,

Please send directions to me, as I'm the designated driver.  I'm not at all
familiar with Houston, and we may be going to Judy's, and coming to your
house with her.  Haven't ironed out all the details yet, but directions
would
probably be a good idea.  My e-mail address is yank@trip.net.

Look forward to meeting everyone!!

Bonnie
