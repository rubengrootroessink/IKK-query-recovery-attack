Please respond to Carey Hi Kim!
  Thanks for the information. Bonnie's e-mail is yank@trip.net and her phone
# is (361) 758-8058. Renee' phone # is (361) 790-8784 & she is in the
process of getting an e-mail address. I believe that after work some day
might be better for us for the get-together; but of course whatever is
easier for you is most important.
  Talk to you later. Carey

Hi Carey!

The name of our hotel is SRS Hotel Du Rond Point De Longchamp, 86 Rue Del
Longchamp, Paris 75116.                Telephone:  33-1 45051363, fax: 33-1
47551280.
I am in the process of putting together several sheets of information about
our Paris trip for all the girls for distribution at our meet and greet
social hour.  I need to know if you,  Bonnie or Renee have any constraints
in coming to Houston on a weekday vs. a weekend.  If we get together on a
weekend, January 20 or 21 works for me.  If we get together after work on a
weekday, my calendar is pretty much open for the rest of the month.  Do you
guys have a preference?  I hope to nail down a date with everyone and
communicate the date soon.

By the way, I just picked your voice mail.  Your email message did come
through to me.  My email address is kimberly.watson@enron.com.  I got your
message on "no" to the cooking school for you, Bonnie and Renee.  Also, do
you have Bonnie's and Renee's phone number and email address?  I have not
been able to get in touch with Judy or Janell today to get this
information.  It will help speed up the communication of our social
gathering date.

Thanks and I look forward to meeting you!  Kim.

Hello Kim,
I wanted to let you know that I would  not be interested in the cooking
class, as cooking is a chore for me...I also am  interested in knowing the
name of our hotel. We (Bonnie, Renee & I) are  looking forward to meeting
everyone and we were wondering if you have come up  with a date yet?
Thanks, Carey Lipscomb
