Hi Cynthia!

I just wanted to let you know that I have been investigating various
"different" activities in Paris and I have found a French cooking school
that is willing to put together a private class for us which would include
a demonstration of cooking a couple of French dishes and a tasting
afterwards.  The class would be given in English and has a minimum size of
10 girls.  It would be held on Monday Feb. 19 from 3:00-5:00pm.  The cost
is 300FF each which is about $40.  I am trying to take a head count to see
if we have 10 girls that are interested because if we are, I need to make
our reservation soon.  Would you please let me know if you are interested
in this "different" activity?  Thanks, Kim.
