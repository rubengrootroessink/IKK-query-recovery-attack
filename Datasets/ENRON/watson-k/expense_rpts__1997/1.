Please read the following instructions, to add me as your assistant, so I can prepare your expense reports.  Also, there is an option to add Lee so he can approve your expense reports.  



Thanks, Pilar

Subject:	XMS - Expense Management System Availability

Concur Technologies' Expense Management System (XMS) is now available to all ETS employees.  You can prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it for payment using the intranet.  It is more "user-friendly" than the previous Excel-based form and efficiently integrates with the SAP accounting system.  We request and encourage you to start using it.

System access on the Enron intranet:

To access the system, go to the Enron Transportation Services Home Page and type "http://xms.enron.com" in the "Location"  field.  This will access XMS software.

Using the system, once accessed:

LOGON ID 
Enter your personnel number (P number).   If you don't know your "P" number, your "HR rep." has it!

PASSWORD
The first time you log in, the password is upper case ENRON.  The system will guide you through confirming your personal information and changing your password.  The Enron Code of Ethics prohibits the sharing of passwords and logging on as another person.  Please observe Enron's policy.  

If you can't log in to the system, go to the IT Central web page from the Enron intranet home page and select "Services"
click "Security Requests" click "eRequest"  (or call 713-853-5536).

OTHER
Once "in", the XMS system will help you get set up, including designating those who will be approving your expense report, and, if applicable, those who have been designated to prepare your expense report. Additionally, there is a "tour" that you can take to get acquainted with system features.

User Guide!!
Hard copy step-by-step documentation is also available from "IT Central" web page on the Enron intranet.
After getting to "IT Central" on the Enron intranet, click through the following and you should be there:
"Services", "Training", "Documentation", "XMS User's Guide" (which will come up through Adobe Acrobat).

Application Support Services
Call the ISC help desk at 713-345-4SAP (4727). 

Accounting Coding 
No changes in coding are being implemented as a result of the transition from the Excel template to XMS, in fact much of the coding will be "suggested" by the XMS software. You will need a FAR #, cost center, or WBS elements as applicable.


GOOD LUCK!!
