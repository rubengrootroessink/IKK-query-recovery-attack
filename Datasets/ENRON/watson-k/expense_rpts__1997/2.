My earlier email regarding printing a receipt report has brought a few questions about how to obtain a receipt report.  If you have not been into the new system yet, it would be best if you saved this note and pull it out when you are ready to complete your first report.

If you have completed a report, you will recall when you had completed your expense report, there were four buttons towards the top right side of your screen.  They are labeled Submit, Print, Report Remarks, and Itinerary.  Select the Print button, and it will give you the option to print two reports - a receipt report and a detailed report.  The receipt report will print only items on your expense report that are over $75 or a hotel bill.  It has a bar code on the top of the printout.  THIS IS THE REPORT THAT NEEDS TO GO WITH YOUR RECEIPTS IN THE WHITE ENVELOPE TO HOUSTON.  The detailed report will contain all of your expenses.  

I am attaching a tip sheet I had prepared for the NPNG employees.  This system is fairly easy to learn; most of our employees have figured it out without any training classes.  The memo attached will walk you through obtaining on-line training through the LEAP system, where to find step-by-step documentation, and help desk phone numbers.  There are a few NNG employees who have had some informal training - Carol Woerlen, Deb Cappiello, Andrea Woody, Carol Armstrong, Steph Bertch, and Mike Zabawa.  I was the NPNG representative on the task force, and I believe Bob Chandler was the ETS representative.  My tips were prepared with NPNG employees in mind; however, most of them should work for NNG, also.
