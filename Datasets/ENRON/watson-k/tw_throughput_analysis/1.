The attached file contains a list of the variables we identified in our Aug=
ust 18th meeting.  I tried to break them down into smaller group just for o=
rganizational purposes.  The items under Prices and Temperatures should be =
easy to gather using the LIM database.  The items in the Other category may=
 require more research.  What we have done in the past if we could not find=
 the exact variable try and fine a proxy for it.  For example it may be dif=
ficult to find irrigation usage, but less difficult to find precipitation i=
n a region.  Since these two items would intuitively seem to have an invers=
e relationship it may be possible to use precipitation as a proxy for irrig=
ation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have to =
come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We adde=
d a column for use to keep track of the statues on each variable this is ju=
st for us to keep track of where we found the variable or why we did not pu=
rsue it.  Let me know if we have missed anything or you have subsequently t=
hought of anything not on the list.
