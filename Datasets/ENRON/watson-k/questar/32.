	This looks good. I have only two changes. 

	First, I suggest changing the second sentence of Section 2.1 to read as follows: "After the primary term, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect from year to year, provided that either Party may terminate this Agreement as of the end of the primary term or any year thereafter by providing to other party at least 30 days prior written notice of such termination."

	Second, I suggest changing the word "with" in the second line of Section 8.8 to "within". 

	Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

Bill,

Please review this agreement.  It has both the red-lines from Questar's office (which you and I have already discussed) and it has my red-lined comments.  Please review and we can discuss tomorrow.  

Thanks, Kim.
