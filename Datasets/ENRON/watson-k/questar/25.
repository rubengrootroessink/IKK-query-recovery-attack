Kim,

Talked to Earl Chanley and he stated that we(TW) would have to get a lease agreement with Questar to install TW facilities on their land.  Earl said R-O-W team would handle.  I'm coping Mansoor to keep him informed.  He is the project manager over this project.  I assume this project has not been released for construction or a restricted release to obtain materials (ie; long-lead items) or right of way.
