Kim,

	This looks fine. The only change I have is to Section 2.8. I think a word got left out. It should read "by providing to THE other party". Other than that, it looks fine. I think our right of way department should have a standard lease or easement agreement that they like to use. If not, let me know and I'll search around here for one. We really should have a separate document for the lease/easement and not fold it into the interconnect agreement.

Hi Bill,

Sorry for the confusion.  If you don't mind, please take a look at this contract.  I have not heard back from facility planning yet, but I do think that we are leaning towards leasing the ROW from Questar for this interconnect.  If this is true, do we have standard language that we can add to this agreement to reflect such arrangement?  

Thanks for your help.

Did you see the change in para 3.2 and 4.4?

Kim.
