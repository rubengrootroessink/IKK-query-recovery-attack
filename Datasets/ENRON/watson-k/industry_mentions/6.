Could you please verify if the rate for K #26436 should be increasing from $0.05 to $0.06 effective from 11/1/01 - 10/31/03?  The CBS rates system has the the entire term at the lower rate as does Jan's forecast.

If corrections are required, please update so that invoices for November are correctly reflected.


Thanks,
Elizabeth
