Lee and Vernon,
Kim recommended Mike Reynolds a while back, but I'm bringing him in Friday morning at 8:30 to interview for the Richard Harmond backfill.  He has a lot of business background.  I don't know about how strong his project management and technical skills are, but the business knowledge looks very strong and maybe this is what we need in that position.  We should be finished about 9:30.  I'll let you know when we finish if you all would like to talk with him and give me some feedback.
