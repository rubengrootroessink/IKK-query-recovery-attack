Thanks Arnie.  I'll pass this on to Lorraine Lindberg (Duke's TW rep).  If we hear anything additional we'll pass it on.  Please do the same.

Subject:	Duke's Proposed Power Plant At Clovis

Kim and Mark,
Butch Bentley, who is on the Panhandle Team, called me this morning and said he had heard on a local radio station that Duke had paid the city of Clovis, NM $50,000 for water rights for a 6 month period.  This sounds like Duke is again interested in building a power plant near Clovis.  About a year ago they were proposing a power plant South of Clovis about 2 miles from our Panhandle lateral.  The proposed plant would be gas fired with a fuel need of up to 100mmcfd.   Later I was told that the project was a dead issue because of problems getting water.
Butch will get a newspaper today and see if there's any more information.  This could be a good opportunity for us.  If you contact Duke, please let us know the results.
Thanks,
Arnie Bailey
