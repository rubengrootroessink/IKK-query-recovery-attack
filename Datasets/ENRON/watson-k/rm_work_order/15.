Virginia,

In effort to complete the close-out the original work order for Revenue Management, JN8485, please take the additional late charge of $12,600 from third party contract-Sheryl Kimes and move it from the JN8485 Work Order and charge it to Work Order c.000979 (RM Science).  As we discussed, this transfer needs to be effective for December 2000 business.  

If you need anything else regarding this charge, please don't hesitate to call me.  

Thanks, 

Kim
