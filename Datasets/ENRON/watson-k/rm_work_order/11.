Murphy's Law has hit us the past few days. Since migrating to production we have had the following issues on Capacity Books:

Monday the Capacity Books were not available until 9:45am.
		Problem: This was because the Group table was created on the production server and not populated with the initial data.
		Solution:   Populated table and reran cycle.

Tuesday the Capacity Books were not available until 8:20am.
Problem: This was due to an RTI improvement that triggered a duplicate record on the contracted table.
Solution:   Corrected the stored procedure and reran cycle.

Wednesday the Capacity Books were not available until 2:00pm. Due to training we held off on publishing the views on Wired.
Problem:  The database server temp log file filled up  and triggered an abend to the Capacity Books batch cycle.  A notification was triggered to Steve 	       Plant's pager at 2:00am but he never received the page. Craig Buehler  had a problem with the Price Curve Manager spreadsheet, so if 	       	       Steve would have completed the batch cycle the pricing would have been calculated incorrectly. 
Solution:    We are automating the Price Curve Manager process, which will eliminate manual intervention. We are also looking into a better scheduling 	       and notification system.

Thursday the Capacity Books were available at 4:43am with no known problems.

If you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me at 3-3186.

Thanks,

Mark
