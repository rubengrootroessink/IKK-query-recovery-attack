Could you please tell us what cost centers or FAR orders we should code the revenue management project cost amortization to. I apologize if you provided this info previously.

Bob,

Ann Carethers is going to set up the systematic amortization of the above project in PS.  The last discussion we had regarding this project is that Dan McCarty's cost center would be absorbing the expense.  Should we code the amortization to:  O&M: 52504500 (hardware & software expense not capitalized), or DD&A: 57004000 (misc. amortization)?  

Elaine, can you verify that Dan should still receive the expense?

Thanks,

Allison
