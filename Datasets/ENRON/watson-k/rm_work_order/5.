We will need to add/assign this cost to NNG and TW Marketing cost centers under Dave Neubauer (probably Kim's??).  It needs to be included in the Gross O&M and in Project Specific Capital if it is not already (no effect on net O&M).  Then we will assign the amortization expense to the same cost center when we complete the functional earnings statements for Dan's Commercial Group.

It looks like we have a winner.  This will need to be in McCarty' O&M budget.  Who should we advise?  Tracy?

We need to finalize our tactics for amortizing this software development project for inclusion in the 2001-2003 Plan.  

Some options:

1.   Capitalize as software development cost and amortize at FERC approved rate of 4.4% to DD&A. (The implied amortization period is substantially longer than the expected useful life of the software).

2.  Capitalize as software development cost and amortize using Corporate Standard rate of 20% to DD&A.  (Would not want to have this rate applied to all of our other unamortized software development costs).

3.  Hold balance in deferred debits (as deferred O&M) and amortize to Marketing O&M expense over the 5 year useful life of the project (per project economics).  This approach is similar to the way we handled the deferred costs (mainly AA charges) associated with the Operation Information project about 4 1/2 years ago.
