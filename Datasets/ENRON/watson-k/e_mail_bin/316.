Total January 2002 transportation invoiced for Transwestern(including PGE prepayment) was $12,603,727.  As of 2/11, TW has received $9,783,336 related to January transportation - 78%.

Attached are the customers who did not pay on the 11th.

 

I will also distribute this report tomorrow morning.  Shippers who have not paid by today should be called tomorrow morning to determine the status of their payment.

thanks
richard
