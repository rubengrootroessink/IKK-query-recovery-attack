Hey Guys - A couple of follow up items from yesterday's meeting to update you on.

Affiliates - Transwestern still has the same affiliates as we did prior to Enron's declaration of bankruptcy.  No changes.

Pooling - I spoke with Perry Frazier today to consider whether TW would gain any capacity if it were to do away with pooling.  This is really a moving target because we don't know the exact receipt point of all the gas with a receipt pool on its contract, but Perry will discuss this with his team and let us know.
