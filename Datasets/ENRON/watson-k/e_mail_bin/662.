This is the 3rd time the FERC has stricken the EPNG full requirements issue from its agenda.

El Paso's proceeding relating to capacity allocation/constraints was stricken from the agenda today at the last minute - wasn't on any information even just prior to the meeting. (RP00-336). 
A draft order was released in the PUC v. El Paso proceeding in which FERC remanded to the ALJ for a limited supplemental hearing on the issue of whether El Paso made all of its capacity available to shippers at its California delivery points in the period of Nov. 2000 - March 2001. (RP00-241). We will probably have this later today.
There has been an order issued in San Diego Gas v. Sellers of Energy which we will have later today - will also send to you.
