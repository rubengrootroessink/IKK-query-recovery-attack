Not sure exactly what you said there, pardner, but it sounds delicious!  If
I wasn't on a diet, I'd ask for a double serving!

Weekend is fairly open, as far as I know, but will defer to mi espousa's
social calendar.  We'll be in touch.

Buon colonoscopy, paesano!

Dodeci la settiamana adamiano Italia.

What's your weekend like?  I maybe bike riding Saturday AM depending on
weather and my feelings after C'stopy exam on Friday AM.  Other than that I
think we're open.
