BP executed the firm deal Blanco - Needles, Cal. '03 and '04 at the $0.26 plus fuel rate.

NGPL has notified TW that The NGPL/Eddy point is in service to flow both IT and FT.

Red Rock - System Ops and Planning have determined that if Red Rock capacity is staged in, Sta. 1/2 in-service 6/1 and Sta. 3 late, the capacity available is 70,000/d which indicates we would have to allocate into the contracted amount that should begin 6/1.  Should we think about setting aside the 1,700/d for Oneok's contract so they don't get allocated?

NGPL OBA - Updated Steve this am after his conversation with Deb.  Bill Rapp is confirming what rights NGPL has in its tariff and then he, Steve and I will discuss prior to Bill and I meeting with NGPL.

Cirque du Soleil - Dynegy (Phil Richardson) and BP (Russell and Penny) have agreed to join us on the 24th.

Duke - I continue to work with DETM/DFS on netting the imbalances and with DFS about the reconciliation of the Mobil/Pyote fuel situation.
