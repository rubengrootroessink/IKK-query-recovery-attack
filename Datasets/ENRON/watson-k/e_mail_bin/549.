Reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, Lorenz testimony in the System Adequacy proceeding and the Dec. 11th Unbundling Decision as to the treatment of receipt point capacity especially as related to the 50MM/d increase at Needles.

New Mexico:

Legislative - As promised, Republican Gov. Gary Johnson vetoed this week the Legislatures latest budget proposal and vowed to keep the state running by using the previous year budget.  Democratic leaders of the Senate and House have proposed appointing a bipartisan group of lawmakers to explore whether a budget compromise can be reached with Gov. Johnson.  Johnson's Chief of Staff, David McCumber didn't reject the idea for the governor, but did raise some concerns about the approach.

Renewable sources are defined to include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and biomass.
