I have talked with Jennifer McQuade at UBS and she had stated that UBS will not allow TW to continue the Data Feed that we had before on EnronOnline.  She also said that TW will not be allowed view only status.  At this time TW must fill out an application and must be creditworthy before access to their online system will be allowed.  

I have let Bobby and Martha know this and asked them to approach UBS from the technical side.
