Dear Transwestern Staff:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct this request, so I hope you will route same to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991) Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your earliest.
 
    Please do not hesitate to call me should you wish to discuss this or if there is a charge.
My mailing address & phone (for charges for the maps or questions) are as follows:
 
Best regards,
