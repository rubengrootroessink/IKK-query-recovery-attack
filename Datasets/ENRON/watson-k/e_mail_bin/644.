John:
       I'm writing you from Lakeway, Austin, Tx where I am 'retreating' for
spring break!  Came up here to play, to play with my grandchildren --
Christina and Reid.  Jim will join me midweek -- he'll play too.  Only his
favorite play activity is clearing the fields at our country place -
Trestleview.  Does that sound like fun, or what?
       The assignment from Kim sounds great -- we'll see you all then.
Much love,
Hattie and Jim
