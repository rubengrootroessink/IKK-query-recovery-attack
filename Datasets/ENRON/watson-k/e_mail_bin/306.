It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
