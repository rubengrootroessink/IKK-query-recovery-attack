James:
Can we scale this down a bit?  As I mentioned to Kevin Hyatt yesterday, we just need a slimmed down version for them to get started with.  If this is not possible, we can send them this.  They are needing to review a model and run sensitivities for the returns.  Things like the MLP should be deleted.
