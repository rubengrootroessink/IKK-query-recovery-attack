Mark and Mark,

We approve the costs to get real-time DTN feeds.  We would like to sign up for a 3 year agreement so that the $1,000 fee is waived.  We will have seven primary users right now:

Harris, Steven 
Lohman, TK
Lindberg, Lorraine
Lokay, Michelle
McConnell, Mark
Y'barbo, Paul
Watson, Kimberly

Thanks for all of your help on this.  Please let me know when real-time pricing can be installed.

Thanks, Kim.
