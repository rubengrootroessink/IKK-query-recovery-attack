Well, Rick has made me enough assurances that I have agreed to stay with Enron; I'm calling Conoco this afternoon to advise them of my decision.  Rick and I have a few more items to finalize as far as company assignment (NNG vs. TW).  You and I should have more to discuss on this topic by next week.  I'll keep you updated.  Thanks for you help.

Craig
