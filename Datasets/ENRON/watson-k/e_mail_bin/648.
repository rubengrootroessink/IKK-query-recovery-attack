Kim, The attached reflects NNG Marketing's allocation %'s for capital and allocations to TW.  The only thing I know of that will change is the Pricing desk.  Jo has ask me to get with you and Sean/Richard to determine what a fair allocation would be.  I am out for the rest of the year after today.  Can we review and determine any changes after the 1st?  I also had a summary of the kinds of things each of the teams were doing for TW but I can't seem to get my hands on it right now.  I'll look some more and maybe I'll have it for our discussion.
