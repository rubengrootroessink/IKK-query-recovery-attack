Kim-

As I had mentioned, I'd like to find a time we could meet with your group to discuss Marketing's 2002 needs, wants, priorities, etc..  I just want to be sure that Planning doesn't waste any of the next few months going in a direction opposite to the commercial group.

I would plan on having Dennis, Mansoor, Perry and Ron attend, and could have Optimization represented as well if you'd like.  Obviously I'll be there, and Keller will come if he can.

Let me know what you think.  I'll be in Omaha next Mon-Wed, but am available other than that.

Thanks,

Morgan
