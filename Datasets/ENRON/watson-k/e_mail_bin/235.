Howdy Kimbo!  Hope all is well.

I did not receive the job announcement we spoke about.  I thought maybe the e-mail address I gave you did not get relayed accurately, so I thought I would send you a note.  Maybe you could attach the announcement to this and respond.

You were so very right in what you said the other night.  There definitely is a new day each day with the Enrongate.  Hang in there.  The callous few will not ruin everything for everyone else.  It seems bad now, but I have faith that something good will come from all of this.  

Thanks for thinking of me with the job.  I'll let you know what I do.

Kyle
