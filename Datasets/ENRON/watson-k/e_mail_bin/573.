As long as Earl receives a copy I am fine. Earl is our E&C rep.

Earl and Mansoor,

I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.  Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed. 

Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.  Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?  Does anyone else need to see it?  Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.
