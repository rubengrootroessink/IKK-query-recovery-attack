Kim - I have my annual gyno appt. tomorrow, Thursday, 8:30 am.  I'll be in shortly thereafter.  Also, remember I'm taking Friday, 12-21 as a vacation day (I get my catheter out!!!).  I've checked with Michelle and Mark and they'll both be in the office on Monday, 12-30.  Is it alright if I take that as a vacation day and then just role the rest (about 20 hours) to next year?  Merci.

Lorraine
