Kim, 

Lisa and I are certainly up for it.  I haven't given much thought to location yet, so put on your thinking cap and let's come up with place/time.  We're looking forward to getting together with you guys.  By the way, I'm in the office the rest of today and tomorrow if you want to give me a ring.

Jeff
