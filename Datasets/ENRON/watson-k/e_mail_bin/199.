Signed agreement w Citizens covering our costs and providing indemnification for work we will do converting their system to  a pressure control system with flow over-ride capability.  They were experiencing vibration problems that threatened the gas flow to the Griffith plant.  The work is being performed on 2/1 and there should be no flow interruption.
