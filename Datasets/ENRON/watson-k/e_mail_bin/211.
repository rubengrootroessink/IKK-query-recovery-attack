Kim, I do save these on the shared drive under TW-NNG/TW Desk/Weekly Bullets or better 

Why not let me save a copy to your drive under Weekly Bullets.  I'll create a folder for you if you don't have one.

Okay?  Okay....

Audrey,

As a matter of practice, would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves?  I will then save it in my word file and use it to start the next weeks bullets.

Thanks, Kim.  :>)
