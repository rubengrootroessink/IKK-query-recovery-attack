Bert - I will be out of the office this Friday, 3/1.  In my absence, will you please check the 2 Duke contracts with the primary points East to East with alternate deliveries to CA at the incremental rates?  If there is any flow to CA, would you please work up the blended rate and make sure the invoice goes out correctly?  Thanks.
