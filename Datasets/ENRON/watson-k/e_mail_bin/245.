XENERGY Press Release:

DENVER, Co. (02/21/2002) - Leading experts on U.S. green
energy development today expressed confidence that, with
improved marketing techniques, a dramatic growth in
participation in U.S. green energy programs is likely to
occur over the next several years, resulting in penetration
levels viewed highly improbable just one year ago.  The
remarks were made today at The Growing Green Power Demand
Conference, the first green power conference devoted to the
tools, tactics and metrics of selling green power sponsored
by XENERGY in cooperation with the Center for Resource
Solutions.

Green energy programs, which typically involve customers
paying a premium to cover the incremental cost of the
additional renewable resources, have shown steady growth
over the last 5 years, with programs now in existence in 31
states.  However, some believed that the demand for such
services had begun to level off, with participation rates of
most programs in the range of 1 to 5 percent.

A 10% participation rate in a green energy program was until
recently viewed as the industry's three-minute mile, a goal
considered virtually unachievable, said  Julie Blunden, vice
president at XENERGY.  However, tools, tactics and metrics
shared at today's conference indicate that this rate could
be achieved within the next five years.

Surveys consistently reveal customer preference for green
power, said Blair Swezey, Principal Policy Director at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  There are important
marketing lessons to be gleaned from these utilities that
are having the most success with their green power programs.

Leading organizations around the country - including Fortune
500 companies, major cities and universities are starting to
buy green power, recognizing it as the next step in
environmental responsibility, said Kurt Johnson, Director of
EPA's Green Power Partnership.

We believe today's forum is a microcosm of what is occurring
industry wide, said Keri Bolding, Communications Director at
the Center for Resource Solutions.  Green marketers are
improving their ability to identify likely buyers of green
energy and creating targeted marketing efforts to translate
consumers' desire for green energy into sales.  This is an
exciting time for providers of green energy with substantial
growth likely in the next several years.
