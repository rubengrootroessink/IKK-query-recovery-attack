Kim,
The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email. The new Hotline phone number is 713-853-3044. I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation, TK was also made aware.

John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  

Kim.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan
