No problem; its 1927 Woodbury St.,77030.  (Woodbury comes from the address
of the house that was torn down to build several townhouses on that lot.)

Lets get together soon and go out to dinner.
Jane

This is so embarrassing...is your address 1924 Holcombe Blvd., or 1924
Staffordshire?  And I'm assuming your zip is 77030, right?

Thanks (head hung low),
John
