	For those shippers paying late, I want to be sure we are billing late charges and collecting
	the late charges.  Please let John, Richard or I know if that is not happening.  Thanks. Lynn

Attached are the shippers who have not paid their Jan transportation invoices.


MS reps
Call your shippers ASAP and provide an explanation as to why they are paying late.  There seems to be a few shippers who always pay late - North Star Steele, CMS, KN.  If you feel that we need a marketer to get involved with your late payers, please contact them.


thanks
