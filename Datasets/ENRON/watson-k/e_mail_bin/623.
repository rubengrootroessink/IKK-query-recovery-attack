Most of you already know but to update the rest.  

Disasembly took place today in IRS's Farmington shop.  Brian Dils was on location as the company representative.  The stator has failed and taken the laminations out.  The rotor has one pole that has failed as well.  

Looking at approximately 6 to 8 weeks to turn around, from the time a purchase order is issued.  Cost for rebuild only is approximately $470K.  This was (according to IRS) a major failure.  Does not include cost already incurred for removal and cost that will be required for reinstallation.  

A recommended scope of work and a detailed cost estimate will be provided by IRS within the next day or so.  Hopefully in time for the next conf. call.

Conf. call 3/19/02 Tuesday 3:00 pm CST (2:00 MST) will be held to update.  877-795-3687  pin 552068

The motor is on a trailer and will be on the road before nightfall.  Disassembly will begin either Sunday or Monday morning.  (Brandy Jones, shop foreman for IRS, indicated it would be more like Monday.)  The team will have a rep on site for disassembly and Todd Ingalls along with Brian Dills will be in discussions with IRS so that an update is available for Monday afternoons conf. call.  

The San Juan Team has done an excellant job in expediting this removal.  

Questions up to this point?  Please let me know.  Thanks

Contractors are on location and making good progress this morning.  The heavy iron used to skid the motor in position for a lift through the ceiling is being transported from the San Juan Station.  Motor wiring disconnects have been completed.   The roof is being removed and the crane should be on location this evening.  IRS has sub-ed Foutz and Bursham for necessary welding, support personnel and some heavy equipment.    The compressor coupling has not yet been disconnected as one final runout will be taken per IRS's request.  Exhaust ducting has been removed and will have to be shipped in for repairs.  (the foam material sprayed in the duct has burned and will need to be replaced)  

Now anticipating a lift sometime tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow evening, if all continues to move along as well as it has to this point.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)
