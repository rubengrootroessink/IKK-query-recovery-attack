Does anyone know what the timing of the expenditures would look like? Demonstrating financial ability to fund would be difficult at the current time! I thought we wanted KMI to do the construction? I don't have any real issues with the LOI.

Stan/ Rod, here is the most recent red-lined version of the TransPecos agreement. We have substanially changed numerous items from the prior
red-line and feel this more accurately represents TW's interests. Please review the  document and let me know if you are comfortable with it. In particular, we have softened the language requiring us to demonstrate our financial ability to provide services under the agreement. 

At this point, we are just trying to agree on the basics of the K/M LOI so that we can get the transport rate proposal in front of Pemex.    

Steve
