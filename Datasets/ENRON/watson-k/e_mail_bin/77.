	FYI.  Is everyone comfortable that we are NOT creating an imbalance with Sid
	Richardson due to fuel?  Just want to be sure we should not check out any
	additional information.  Terry, thanks for your prompt reply.  Thanks. Lynn

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.
