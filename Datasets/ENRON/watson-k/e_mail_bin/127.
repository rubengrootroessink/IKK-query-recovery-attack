The TW team is running blind as far as pricing information is concerned.  NNG leaves today for Dynegy and we have been relying on Preston and Vernon for our princing information.

We need your help!  Kim has asked me to email you guys and ask if there are any updates on TW getting pricing information.

Please!  I'm begging.
