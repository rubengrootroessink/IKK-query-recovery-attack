Glad to hear you guys are surviving Taylor's treks.  Perhaps some sort of reverse proximity alarm should be invented...you know, one that 
would go off when she strays more than 10 feet from one of you.  The patent might pay for a few dive trips!  

No news is good news on the Enron front.  Transwestern still not in bankruptcy, is making money, business as usual for Kim.  Our 
remaining "strategic investment" in several thousand shares of the big E remains speculative, but at this point, who cares?

How do you guys look for dinner Saturday night?  We could bring something over to grill at your place (our community grill is still out of 
commission from the flood, and is not high on the replacement list), or we could meet somewhere, whatever is best for you parent-types. 

See you soon...

John
