JOHN AND KIM--

I WAS JUST GETTING READY TO LEAVE FOR AN OVERNIGHT TRIP TO CHECK ON MY
PARENTS IN THE DALLAS AREA . A LITTLE AFTER 8 AM I CAME UP TO THE COMPUTER,
BEFORE RUSHING OUT THE DOOR, TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN EMAIL REGARDING DINNER
CLUB! AS I WAS CHECKING SOME OTHER CORRESPONDENCE, YOUR EMAIL POPPED UP !!
CARL JUNG WOULD CALL IT "SYNCHRONICITY" (SP?)!!

EVERYTHING LOOKS WONDERFUL !! TOM AND I ARE SO  EXCITED!!

WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH -- WE'LL HOPEFULLY SEE YOU BOTH ON SUNDAY !! (PS
KEEP ME IN YOUR THOUGHTS-- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS HAS BEEN A
DIFFICULT ONE THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND I'M COMING TO SOME "TERMS OF
ENDEARMENT" FOR THE "WHAT IS" WITH THEM!)

TAKE CARE!
JERILYNN

> Preparation Time: 5 min.
> Comments:
> This a really simple appetizer to make. If you haven't had roasted garlic

> buttery, mellow spread. I like it best spread on fresh bread with goat
> cheese on top. Its also a great butter and mayonnaise substitute for
> sandwiches, that's low in calories. (Ignore the 83% fat percentage in the
> nutritional information below, its counting all of the olive oil, most of
> which slips off) The whole head of garlic has only 24 calories!!

> Ingredients:
> 1 head garlic
> 1/2 teaspoon olive oil
> Instructions:
> Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the
pointy
> tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place
> garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on
top
> of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake
in
> oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily
removed
> from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let
cool.
