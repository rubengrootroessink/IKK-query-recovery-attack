Why don't we try Farrago?  Kim and I love it and it has an outside 
patio for those warm Houston winters.  Farrago is at the corner of Gray 
and Bagby (or is it Brazos? whichever one runs one way to the south).  
Phone number is 713-523-6404. 

Why don't we meet there at noon or 1 p.m.?  Tell us what fits your 
schedule better and we'll be there!
