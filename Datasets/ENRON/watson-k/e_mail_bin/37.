Thanks for the kind words, Jerilynn.

Regarding "toque blanche," I knew that a toque was the traditional brimless
chef's hat, but was unsure of the spelling.  Looking at my on-line
dictionary (www.m-w.com), I got the right spelling and found out that the
adjective "blanche" (white) was commonly appended.  So I added it, too.

I'll pass along your appreciation to Kim.

John
