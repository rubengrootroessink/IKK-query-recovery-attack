</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    Natural gas futures for April delivery on the NYMEX continued higher yesterday, gaining $0.038 to $2.427 per MMBtu, despite a lower than expected AGA withdrawal. The May contract rose $0.03 to $2.479 per MMBtu. The AGA reported only 64 Bcf was withdrawn from storage last week. However, as has been the case for the last several weeks, technicals have trumped storage data as the market driver. But the bearishness has been canned, to be drug out in a couple days as a reason for the market to fall. The fundamentals are known and the AGA doesnt really matter now because it does not materially affect the fundamentals on a short term basis. Storage inventories now stands at 1.88 Tcf, compared with the 5-year average of 1.25 Tcf. Estimated volume was about 50,000 contracts, most of which were spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or minus $0.05. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.48 per M!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
  <BR>
Canadian Natural Resources has reported that 4th quarter profit fell 76% because of lower oil and natural gas prices and a C$19 million after tax loss on the sale of Gulf of Mexico properties it acquired in its takeover of Ranger Oil. Canadian Natural earned C$52 million, or C$0.43 per share, compared to C$223 million, or C$1.77 per share in the 4th quarter of 2000. Analysts average estimate was C$0.65. Cash flow dropped 41% to C$328 million, or C$2.63 per share, from C$555 million, or C$4.39. Sales fell from C$838 million to C$578 million. In the 4th quarter, Canadian Natural received an average of C$21.28 per barrel for its oil, down 16% from the year before. In December, it shut down some heavy crude production and delayed drilling until the spread between heavy and light oil prices narrowed. Its average natural gas price was C$2.94 per Mcf for the quarter, 60% lower than the previous year. Oil production averaged 198,000 bpd, slightly below the 4th quarter of 2000. Natur!
al gas production climbed 22% to over 1 Bcf per day partially due to drilling success at Ladyfern in northeastern British Columbia. Canadian Natural expects to produce 379,000 to 393,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2002, up 7% from 2001. That would include 1.08 to 1.1 Bcf of natural gas and up to 210,000 barrels of oil and gas liquids per day. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Wall Street analysts, whose firms sold most of the $25 billion in stock and bonds issued by Enron, testified before Congress yesterday that they were not influenced by their companies dealings with Enron, and were misled about Enron's financial condition. As late as November 8th, 11 of the 16 analysts whose job it was to follow Enron still rated the company as buy or strong buy. Enron has been involved in 69 acquisitions, valued about $40 billion and held 62 bond and note sales since 1985. Salomon Smith Barney was the biggest adviser on Enron mergers, with about $5 billion in transactions, followed by Credit Suisse with $4.45 billion. Credit Suisse served as the sole lead manager for $1.75 billion in secondary stock sales by Enron over the last 10 years, generating about $52.5 million in fees. Chase Manhattan arranged more than $7 billion in financing for Enron. Even though the analysts may not have directly benefited from their stock recommendations, senators pointed to!
 a potential conflict of interest because their firms have business ties with companies the analysts follow. And, analysts can receive bonuses based on overall profits of their firms, which in turn can depend on the companies the analysts follow. The 4 analysts testifying at the hearing said they get bonuses on that basis. Some have proposed new regulations to increase barriers between investment bankers and analysts within a security firm. Analysts would have to disclose whether they personally hold any stock of a company they recommend and if their firm has business ties to that company. The analysts that testified yesterday represent Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman and Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    The FERC has approved Duke Energys $8.5 billion acquisition of Westcoast Energy. The action cleared the way for Duke to take over ownership of Engage America and a power generation project operated by Frederickson Power, both subsidiaries of Westcoast. The new company will have natural gas related assets, including about 18,900 miles of transmission pipeline, 241 Bcf of natural gas storage, 58,700 miles of gathering pipeline, 84 processing facilities and 16,500 miles of distribution pipeline. The acquisition has already been approved by Canadian regulators but must still be reviewed by the Investment Canada board. The deal must also be approved by the FTC and the SEC, which is not expected to be a problem. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></B><BR>
     Wholesale day-ahead power prices are down 85% from year-ago levels, according to Platts. The average of benchmark prices across the nation fell $121.75 to $22.01 per MWh from mid-February 2001. The national average slipped only $0.16 from January to February. The greatest year-on-year declines remain in the West, where the region's power crisis sent prices to record levels last year. However, prices east of the continental divide also saw a significant drop. Day-ahead prices for Mid-Columbia fell 95% from $452.89 per MWh in mid-February 2001. In the last month, prices rose 6% to an average of $21.43 per MWh. At Palo Verde, the most active Western hub, day-ahead prices slipped 94% to $23.82 per MWh from $397.63 per MWh in mid-February 2001. Palo Verde spot prices have gained $0.67 in the last month. Northern and Southern California spot prices were each down 94% year-on-year from an average of $433.11 per MWh and $452 per MWh, respectively. NP15, which corresponds to the!
 California ISOs congestion zone for the Northern portion of the state, saw prices rise 7% to $25.67 per MWh from January to February. Prices for SP15, which corresponds to the Southern portion of the state, climbed 7% to $25.66 per MWh during the month. Spot power prices in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states saw declines both year-on-year and month-on-month. New England day-ahead prices fell 43% to $27.42 per MWh from $47.77 per MWh in mid-February 2001 when strong natural gas prices buoyed prices. PJM West saw prices drop 24% to $21.98 per MWh from $28.99 per MWh February 2001. Prices in PJM are down $1.54 from last month. Into Cinergy day-ahead prices fell 51% to $18.58 per MWh from $38.64 per MWh year-on-year. Prices have moved up $1.54 since last month. Price for delivery to ERCOT, the grid operator for Texas, were $18.47 per MWh in mid-February, a 58% drop from the same time last year. The day-ahead prices have climbed $1.07. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#fff!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
Since late January, natural gas futures have made an impressive advance of over 30 cents under fundamental conditions that appear to be unsupportive of increasing prices. Although students of the laws of supply and demand would require a shift in production, consumption, or other economic variables to revise their assessments of natural gas prices, market technicians see the situation from the standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from price movements.  "I look at a number of different tools, but there is a beautiful (down) trend-line (that projects lower prices)," says an Oklahoma City analyst.  "The big debate as prices move up is that although there are overlapping technical patterns, the current rise may be the fourth (wave higher) of a five wave pattern down and there is one more new price low coming. The counter to that argument is that if prices reach and hold above $2.50, prices will not make that final (fifth wave) down, and that there is !
a bigger rally coming. A close over $2.50 per MMBtu, not just a trade over $2.50 is one issue that we are studying carefully," he said.  Prices maybe at a pivotal point.  "It will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the mid $2.40's. There's a very good chance that prices will retreat to the low $2.20's  I am in a negative mode on this market. But if we close above the trend-line at $2.50 then I will take a neutral to positive stance on this market. <BR>
