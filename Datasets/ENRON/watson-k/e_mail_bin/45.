Would you please send me your bullets by the end of today (before we leave for the Cirque show).  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, Steve has a doctor's appt on tomorrow at noon.  I would like to have him review the bullets before he leaves at 11:00a.  Would you be able to forward the bullet items to me by 10:00a?

Thanks in advance,
