Ah yes, my favorite topic [fast losing favor to the tales of Enron's
monarchy, I fear].  Here is an expansion of the "cow economics" tale that
includes ENE:

>Cow Economics, with Enron addendum:

>A JAPANESE CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You redesign them so they

>A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You reengineer them so they >live

>A BRITISH CORPORATION: You have two cows. Both are mad.

>AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't know where >they

>A SWISS CORPORATION:  You have 5000 cows, none of which belong to you.
>You charge others for storing them.

>AN INDIAN CORPORATION:  You have two cows. You worship them.

>AN ARKANSAS CORPORATION:  You have two cows. That one on the left is

Thanx,
Dennis


PS - I am now zipping all of this info around on my new >1 mbaud link that I
finally shamed the cable company into getting hooked up [only took two
separate visits and plenty of customer "motivation"]  In tandem with my new
1.5ghz CPU, 80gb disk and CD burner, I believe I have moved us into the 20th
century [Alas, I know that everyone now agrees that you are in the 21st in
Houston].

Got the settlement on my old red buddy, but am still grieving and in a
quandry about what to do [no enthusiasm by either partner up here for
spending $$$ after the first year of Prince George's economic slide and the
Enron debacle].

Janell is now improving rapidly and we actually have a small jaunt planned
to Austin that looks very unlikely to be cancelled.  I have a new "look"
that I have been dying to spring on "the group" since before the Italia trip
was scrubbed.  It may be an old look [or gone] before we meet again.

I hope you get to see King Kong in hong Kong...isn't that where he lives??
