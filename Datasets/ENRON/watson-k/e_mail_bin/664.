No bullets just an FYI for you.

El Paso Field Services called this week to inquire whether TW?Enron would consider selling off any of its assets.  I spoke with Gina Tylor about who to refer this question to and she said Eric's group.  Kevin and I called EPFS back and they are interested specifically in buying the Atoka and Crawford laterals.  While such a sale of assests would have a big impact on TW, it's alittle too early to tell if EPFS is serious.  I'll keep you posted.
