I'll make a note that they prefer not to bring dessert.

John:
       Yes, Jim and I will come.  That's two of us for the dinner club on
Saturday, March 23 at the Daugherty's home in Pearland.
       Course preference?  Ask Kim to assign us any course except dessert.
Thank you.
Best Regards,

Hattie Thurlow-McKinley
