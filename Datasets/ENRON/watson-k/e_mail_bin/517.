Donna, there's one more request.  Kim would like to have cable connections in the area where we will be moving.  Do you know whether there is an existing cable line in that area?

Audrey,
Timing is everything, I hope we have accommodated your needs.  I just want to make sure you do not need anything from me and that Ruthann and Pam are taking care of you and your group.
Donna
