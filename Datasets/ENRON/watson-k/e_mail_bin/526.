ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================
PREVIEW for March 10, 2002
======================================================

Dear Folks -

   A tradition in our marriage is taking some time off and away when one of
us has a birthday. Sherry's is coming up and we're going to go celebrate.
I've asked one of the most popular guest speakers to return to spend time
with you.

   Marsha Davis-Riley has spoken often to Ordinary Life and always with good
response. This Sunday the title of his presentation is:

                       "Homecoming"

   This is what she has to say about her topic:

   "No matter how high the stakes, it is tempting to remain in a limited
life role, languishing in its safety, borne of  familiar patterns and
rituals. The freedom to improvise rarely occurs to us. It just happens one
day on our way home."

   I'm not sure exactly how she will amplify on that but it sounds very
compatible with what we've been talking about. Certainly it sounds as if it
fits "Journey into Wholeness."

   I'll see you on the 17th to talk about SIN.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

PS ? Up for bringing refreshments this week are:
Jim and Jeanne Smith &
Denise Salet
