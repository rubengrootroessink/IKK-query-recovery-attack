Okay, I know someone is working on assigning us "not completely affiliated"=
 employees between NNG and TW at this time but I wanted to give you a littl=
e feedback.  Is there any way I could return to TW Marketing (your group) l=
ike my position was originally set up?  I assume they have me pegged to rem=
ain in Gas Logistics for NNG but there are numerous items that need attenti=
on and urgency that I cannot properly perform while on this team (nothing a=
gainst these people, just a poor team design).  You have always given me th=
e tools and latitude to make things work and I believe I thrive under that =
type of management.  I realize no one knows what will happen to TW/Enron bu=
t I would be happy to take my chances with you.  It may be too late and ass=
ignments set but I just wanted you to know how I felt.  Working TW while re=
maining in Gas Logistics would be okay but it would still lack the sense of=
 urgency and importance that I came to expect while in Marketing.  Of cours=
e I'll do my best wherever assigned.
