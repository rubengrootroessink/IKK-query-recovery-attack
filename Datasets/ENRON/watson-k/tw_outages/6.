Correction, the line in question is between Station 7 and Station 6. Sorry, for the error.

Thanks

FYI,

I received a call from Arnie Bailey. They have received the results of the smart pig on the mainline pipe between Station 8 and Station 7. The results have shown that we have some bad pipe between valves 7008 and 7009. They are going to take that segment of line out of service. It will be blown to zero pressure. It's about a 20 mile segment. The repair completion date has not been set in stone yet, but they are estimating up to 60 days or more. (11/01/01 to 01/02/01). There is no flow impact. We should still be able to move what ever flows are required through the Loop line.
