Kim, I did this last week after we talked.  Ken and I discussed that the best place for this report is with Richard Hanagriff.  I met with Richard and he agreed., The report has imbalance information on it that he can use.  Ken's "to do" was to get with Rick Dietz and make sure Rick was agreeable to the change.

Richard has access to run the report and if he ran into any problems, Ken is making himself available this week.  Richard will run and distribute the report daily.
