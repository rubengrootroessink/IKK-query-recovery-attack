GPCM Customer Base Expands Again at PowerMart
 
Last week at the GPCM workshop at PowerMart, we were able to announce El
Paso Field Services as our 16th active GPCM licensee.  We also met with
another Houston energy company which has committed to its GPCM license
before the end of the year.  The icing on the cake occurred when we
returned home to Los Angeles to be greeted with another commitment to
license GPCM before the end of this year.  We are looking forward to
working with these new companies and to providing all of our licensees
with continuing excellence in GPCM training and support.
 
RBAC Returning to Houston Next Week
 
Bob Brooks will be in Houston next week for GPCM training and
demonstration.  There are time slots available on Thursday, November
1st.  If you would like to meet with Bob, please let him know by
replying to this mail or by calling him at 323-663-4831.

FERC Seeks Natural Gas Capacity Nomination Reform
 
Natural gas pipelines and customers have until November 19th to offer
comments on a plan by the FERC that would allow shippers to recall
released capacity and renominate the capacity. The FERC has stated in a
Federal Register notice that it seeks to change the natural gas business
rule to synchronize the its regulation of recalled capacity with its
standards for intra-day nominations. The changes are related to FERC's
open access regulation, and would also give transporters more
flexibility in transactions to release capacity. The proposed change
would rescind Gas Industry Standards Board provisions which require
notice of capacity release recalls by 8 a.m. central time and which ban
partial day recalls of capacity. The board developed its rules based on
a consensus of its gas pipeline members. Last February, the GISB asked
the FERC to clarify the rules because of confusion over whether partial
day recalls of capacity were a valid practice. The proposal would allow
releasing shippers to coordinate recalls of capacity release
transactions and renominations with the current intra-day nomination
cycle and recall rights would operate according to the same timelines
that now apply to interruptible transportation. The proposal also seeks
to create more competition for pipeline capacity with parity between
scheduling release transactions and scheduling of pipeline interruptible
service. Allowing shippers to recall capacity quickly means more
capacity would be released.
