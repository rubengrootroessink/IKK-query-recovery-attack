Kim,

I wanted to update you on the status of the filing of the TW/NNG Gray storage point.  Anticipated approval is expected October 31st.  We do not anticipate any delays in the approval because this filing is identical to the last 4 filings we have done.  If you have questions please give me a call.

Thanks,

Preston
