Crude Oil Futures Tumble on API Data

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 
$1.07 to $20.18 per barrel yesterday after the API reported an 
unexpectedlarge jump of 930,000 barrels in heating oil supplies by 
last week. Analysts had expected a drop in inventories after last 
weeks cold snap increased demand. Heating oil inventories now stand 
at 62 million barrels, about 30% higher than a year ago and 10% over 
levels at the start of the heating season. Total distillate stocks 
climbed by 5.68 million barrels according the API report. Demand for 
jet fuel plunged after the September 11th attacks, so refiners began 
to produce more heating oil to make up for the shortage, but an 
unseasonably mild autumn coupled with a recession that eroded demand 
has sent inventory levels soaring. In addition, traders are skeptical 
about the level of resolve by OPEC and non-member producers to stick, 
or even come close, to their pledge to remove almost 2 million bpd 
from the market. Heating oil futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX fell $0.0303 to $0.5379 per gallon. Prices for heating oil are 
down 8.2% for the week and 33% below a year ago. February gasoline 
futures on the NYMEX lost $0.0293 to $0.5806 per gallon. In London, 
Brent crude oil futures on the IPE were down $1.13 to $20.89 per 
barrel.

Williams Completes Cryogenic Upgrade 

  Williams has completed the addition of a 3rd cryogenic gas 
processing unit at its Echo Springs natural gas plant near Wamsutter, 
Wyoming. The project boosts processing capacity from 250 MMcf per day 
to 390 MMcf per day and liquids extraction from 18,000 bpd to 28,000 
bpd. Williams also expanded the pipeline gathering system that brings 
natural gas into the plant for processing.  Capacity on the gathering 
system was increased from 330 MMcf per day to 400 MMcf per 
day.  Total cost for the entire upgrade at the Echo Springs complex 
is $45 million. Installation of the new cryogenic unit began in April 
2001 and was mechanically completed in early November by Pro-Quip 
Corporation of Tulsa. Williams concluded startup operations in late 
December and is already utilizing in excess of 80% of the new 
processing capacity.

Lower Refining Margins Cut Into Sunoco Earnings

    Sunoco has said its operating income last year was about the same 
as in 2000 at $5.00 per share, below forecasts of $5.21 because of 
lower refining margins and a loss from its chemical business. 
Analysts expect the company to post earnings of $0.41 per share for 
the 4th quarter. Sunoco said that last quarter was the most difficult 
market environment experienced in several years because of the 
weakening economy and record warm temperatures. Northeast refining 
margins fell last quarter and its chemicals unit probably had a small 
loss because of cyclically low margins, the company said. A sharp 
drop in demand for heating oil during the 4th quarter, a time when 
refineries usually switch to producing more heating oil, has eaten 
away at profits. Last quarter, the average price of NYMEX heating oil 
fell 41% to $0.5807 per gallon from a year earlier. The company's jet 
fuel sales also likely fell victim to flight cutbacks by airlines 
following the September 11th attacks. The average price of jet fuel 
on the East Coast dropped by 44% last quarter from a year earlier. 
Sunoco said its capital spending will be about $517 million this 
year, compared to 2001s capital expenditures of about $350 million, 
excluding some acquisitions. The company plans to open about 50 new 
gasoline stations at Wal-Mart stores this year. Wal-Mart also has 
service station agreements with Murphy Oil and Tesoro Petroleum. 
Sunoco repurchased about 3.2 million shares last quarter for $120 
million. It spent a total of $393 million to buy back about 10.7 
million shares in 2001.

Shell Discovers New Gabon Oil Field


    Royal-Dutch Shell's unit in Gabon has found an onshore oilfield 
at a time the central African nation is trying to step up efforts to 
reverse a long term decline in production. Gabon's energy minister 
says the production capacity of the new field is estimated to be 
between 15,000 ? 20,000 bpd, and to hold 20 - 50 million barrels of 
crude oil. The field was discovered through the Toucan-1 exploration 
well at a depth of 5,170 feet, 6 miles from the Shell's Rabi-Kounga 
field, which is Gabon's largest. Gabon is sub-Saharan Africa's 3rd 
largest producer after Nigeria and Angola. The government relies on 
oil exports for more than 60% of its revenue.

TEPPCO Buys Chaparral and Quanah Pipelines
  
    TEPPCO has signed an agreement to acquire the Chaparral and 
Quanah pipelines from Diamond-Koch for about $130 million and is 
expects to close the deal next month. TEPPCO projects 1st year 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from 
the pipeline systems of about $16 million. All of the pipelines 
revenue is either tariff or fee-based. TEPPCO says the acquisition 
will be immediately accretive to income and cash flow. Over the last 
2 years TEPPCO has announced more than $900 million in acquisitions, 
and plans acquisitions of $300 million to $400 million in 2002. The 
800-mile Chaparral pipeline extends from New Mexico to Mont Belvieu, 
TX. The pipeline delivers natural gas liquids to fractionators and 
existing TEPPCO storage in Mont Belvieu. The 170-mile Quanah Pipeline 
is a NGL gathering system in West Texas. The Quanah Pipeline begins 
in Sutton County, TX, and connects to the Chaparral Pipeline near 
Midland. The pipelines are connected to 27 gas plants in West Texas 
and have about 28,000 HP of pumping capacity at 14 stations. The sale 
also includes 2 underground NGL storage wells with a total capacity 
of 220,000 barrels. The pipelines and facilities will be operated and 
managed by Duke Energy Field Services. The acquisition will initially 
be funded under TEPPCO's bank credit facilities. TEPPCO is evaluating 
permanent financing alternatives.

NCNG to Participate in EPA Methane-Reduction Program
  
    NCNG has said that it will participate in the EPA's Natural Gas 
STAR Program, aimed at reducing emissions of methane. Natural Gas 
STAR, a voluntary program between the EPA and the industry, seeks to 
reduce methane emissions by promoting cost-effective technologies and 
practices. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is 
considered to be a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. 
Although less than 2% of natural gas in the US is lost through 
emissions, Natural Gas STAR partners have eliminated more than 120 
Bcf of methane emissions since the program began, equal to removing 
9.5 million cars from the road for one year or planting 14.5 million 
acres of trees. In addition, companies have saved $360 million 
because of the smaller amounts of lost natural gas. Launched in 1993 
as part of the Climate Change Action Plan, Natural Gas STAR has more 
than 80 partner companies and is endorsed by 11 major industry trade 
associations. For more information about the EPA's Natural Gas STAR 
program, visit www.epa.gov/gasstar .

Duke Begins Operations at New Natural Gas Processing Plant 


    Duke Energy Field Services has completed start-up testing 
operations at its new Platteville natural gas processing plant, and 
placed it into commercial operation. The Platteville processing plant 
is located northeast of Denver and will have an initial capacity of 
33 MMcf per day of natural gas, and is expandable to 50 MMcf per day 
with additional inlet compression. The plant will facilitate 
additional oil and gas production growth in the Denver-Julesburg  
Basin. This expansion of processing capacity represents the 3rd major 
expansion of capacity in the last three years and increases Dukes's 
processing capacity in the area to more than 240 MMcf per day.
