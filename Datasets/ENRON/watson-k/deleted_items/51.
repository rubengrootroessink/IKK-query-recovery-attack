Just a reminder, our 2001 United Way campaign ends this Friday, August 17th.  Please consider contributing to the United Way.  If you've already contributed, Thank you & please ignore this message.  (Except the part below about the prize drawings!)

You can submit your donation electronically by going to Enron's home page and clicking on the "Building Houston's Future" icon.

If you're like me, I had to use the handy-dandy "Forgot ID/Password" link which appears on the left side under the Login ID & Password blanks.  The system will prompt you for information that will allow an e:mail to be sent to you with your ID.  If this is the first time you've accessed the system, your password will be your birthday.

To sweeten things up, everyone who participates in this year's ETS United Way campaign will be entered in a drawing for 2 sets of 4 Astro's tickets, 2 sets of 4 Rockets tickets & 2 roundtrip airline tickets on Continental Airlines.

Thank you for your time & consideration of United Way.

Sincerely,
Lindy
