Steve,

Well, TK celebrated 20 years with Enron on January 11.  I did talk with Fran about the status of service awards, and of course, they were suspended in December.  Fran said that they are having discussions about what to do in the future.  It may be a while before this program gets reinstated (if at all).  Until it does, may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK?

Kim
