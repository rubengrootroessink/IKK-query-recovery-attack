Jeanne, Perry,

Is the data current? If Perry is comfortable that the data is ready to go, I would like to place this into production today 10/19/01 if at all possible.

Mary Kay, Mary,

The requested changes have been made to the "TW Unsubscribed Capacity". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.  Patty is looking into when the table changes will be made so we can place into production.

Toby

Here is the report in Model office. Please review for completeness and sequence of the new groups that were added. Do not verify the content of the data , this is Model Office data that has not been refreshed from Production. Please let me know your approval to proceed with this move to Production. Please forward to anyone else that needs to review prior to production. Also attached is the updated Groups document.
