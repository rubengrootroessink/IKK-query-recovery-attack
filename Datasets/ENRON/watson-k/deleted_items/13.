We saw the Pediatric Orthopedist today.  First I must say it was one of the 
most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and 
low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very 
nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain 
English.  

Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on 
their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish 
a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed 
to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top 
speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the 
agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better 
then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and 
braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down 
than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  
Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain 
medication if he wants.

The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized 
keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the 
wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up 
for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.  

Further updates next January
