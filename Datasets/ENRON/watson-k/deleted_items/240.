Hi Kim:

I will forward your response to Lorna Brennan to ensure that Kay and Sean continue to have access to LIM.

Thank you.

Julie, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing Kay Treat and Sean Bolks for LIM information.

Should we coordinate with you?

Please advise.

Kim.
