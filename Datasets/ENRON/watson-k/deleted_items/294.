Effective Trading and Risk Strategies for
the Online Energy Market

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market!

UBS Warburg estimates that profits from European power trading alone will top $2.4 billion in 2002.	 
Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market.	 

Speakers at this event will include:

Dynegy, Altra Energy, OM Group, Powergen, Bergen-Energie, Amsterdam Power Exchange, RWE Trading, ENDESA, Utility Exchange, El Paso, SchlumbergerSema, TXU, and more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45a317>...	 

Recent efforts at deregulating the energy market in the European Union, combined with the rise of online energy exchanges, is set to make the next few months one of the most challenging and opportunity-filled period the energy sector has seen. And with the American energy companies getting involved in the European energy trading scene, it is set to become a whole new ball game.

Do you know where you stand?

DEREGULATION? Hear about the latest developments in European energy deregulation and what opportunities they open up for your company.

RISK MANAGEMENT? Multiple commodities, counter-party, delivery logistics, multiple platforms... the risks are almost endless. Learn the latest strategies that will help you navigate through the online trading minefield.

LIQUIDITY AND TRUST? Where can you find the energy products you need, and who can you trust to deliver them?

SOFTWARE AND SECURITY? As more and more trading is done online, do you have the right software systems in place and are you sure they're secure?
