At the Regulatory Staff meeting this morning, MKM inquired about the referenced firm trans. agreement being provided to Pemex.  Are we using the tariff proforma agreement without modifications or are we revising it by amendment to reflect any special aspects of the offer?  If the later, has it been routed for review?  Thanks in advance.  gh
