The only change I have suggested is on Sun Devil will file with FERC to expect to file.  I also asked Danny if we should not update Stan on the latest and greatest numbers.  I will let him make that call.

Attached pls find drafts of the ETS slides for the 3Q Investor Presentation.  I would like to get your comments prior to giving to Stan.  Pls let me know if you would like to discuss.  Also is there anything of significance that I have left out?  Anything incorrect or needs revision?  Pls let me have your comments as soon as possible.  Thanks!
