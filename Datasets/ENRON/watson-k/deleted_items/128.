WCom used the same number wherever possible but sometimes had to change it by using one or two different numbers.   Your new card is correct.

Caroly,

I am confirming that I have received my new WorldCom calling card.  The account number on the WorldCom card is two digits off of my ATT Calling card.  Are they supposed to be the same?

Last four digits ATT card:  9827
Last four digits WorldCom card:  9829

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.
