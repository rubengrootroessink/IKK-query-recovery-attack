3pm in 42c1.  

Has anyone talked with Caithness lately?  I heard their water rights got shot down at the local town council.  Is there a possibility they may want to move their project a little further east so that it sits on the Sun Devil expansion?

We expect the cost estimate to be completed 10/2 and will likely begin the weekly meeting Monday 10/8.
