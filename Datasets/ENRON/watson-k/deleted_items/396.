ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for November 11, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   The spiritual practice I am attempting to teach about isn't about 
believing anything - at least not at first.

   It isn't about attempting to get someplace - like to security.

   These matters, and others, are by-products of our willingness to 
give up trying to transcend ordinary life and simply to be with life as 
it is.

   When we gather this week, I want to talk with you - in light of what 
we have been discussing - about the principle of "sacred unity."

   Think about this: In his ministry Jesus was constantly inviting all 
sorts and conditions of people to him. He ate and drank with all kinds 
of people. He excluded no one. He was enacting the principle of sacred 
unity. In fact, this got him into far more trouble than any claim he 
ever made about himself.

   What might it mean for us to practice the principle of sacred unity 
in both the outer world and in our inner life?

   Whoever you are, whatever your condition I invite you to include 
yourself when the Ordinary Life gathering meets this week.

   I look forward to seeing you and being with you.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
