Dear Licensee,

 

We have just completed and uploaded new versions of the GPCM User
Interface, the PowerPoint "Automaps" and the GDS Graphical Display
System.

 

Version 9.0.8.4 of the User Interface has changes that work in
conjunction with the new GDS.  In addition, a few bugs were found and
cleaned up.

 

The automaps are totally updated to match RDI / Platt's recent Jan02base
release.

 

The new GDS has two major new features:

 

1.	You can now select all pipelines by state
2.	You can now display results by month, by year, and by average of
several years

 

Our next release is planned to have two new features as well:

 

1.	Display results for any season (summer, winter)
2.	Display receipt and delivery clearing prices for each pipeline
zone (month, year, average of several years, season)

 

We have one design issue which we would like your input on:

 

When displaying by season, we can define the winter as a continguous
5-month period, Nov-2001 through Mar-2002, for example, or we can define
winter for a year as Jan through Mar and Nov through Dec of the same
calendar year.

 

Our question is do you have a preference for one of these approaches?

 

Please let me know right away.

 

You can download the new user interface and GDS in the usual manner
through the GPCM or RBAC websites.
