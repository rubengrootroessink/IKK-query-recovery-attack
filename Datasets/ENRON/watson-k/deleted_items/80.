Dear IPANM Members:

The new July/August issue of "The Independent" is available on the IPANM
website. While you are there, please take a look around at the redesigned
website! We would appreciate your input on the content and any suggestions
for improvement.

If you would prefer to receive a hard copy of the newsletter in the mail
rather than viewing it on the internet, please let us know. We are glad to
accommodate you.

Pam Garlinger
