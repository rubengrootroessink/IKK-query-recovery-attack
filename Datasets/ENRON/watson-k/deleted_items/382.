Summary of November 18, 2001

Dear Folks -

   I understand that Marsha Davis-Riley did an outstanding job in
Ordinary Life yesterday. I am grateful to and for her.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

        Speaking of gratitude ?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   I know that many of you will be away from your computers later this
week so you might not receive the preview that will go out this coming
Friday until the weekend is over. That's why I wanted to let you know
that this coming Sunday at the Ordinary Life gathering we'll be talking
about gratitude.

   !!!Please bring your favorite stories, remembrances and/or readings.
Let's give thanks together!!!

   Be aware that I am so grateful to and for each and every one of you
whether you attend Ordinary Life in person or by this newsletter.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
