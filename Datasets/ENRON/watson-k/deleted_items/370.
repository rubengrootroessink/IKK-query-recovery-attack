EIA Says Long Term Energy Prices to Fall, even with Growth in Demand
 
Oil and gas prices will ease over the long term, even with substantial
energy demand growth to 2020.  So says the EIA in its recent Annual
Energy Report 2002.  Prices of natural gas will rise above $4.00 in
2002, but will settle down to $3.25 per mmbtu by 2020, even with demand
growth of 50% over the next 20 years.

Tennessee Gas to Expand in Massachusetts
 
TGPL announced an expansion of a 12 mile segment of its pipe from Dracut
to Burlington in Massachusetts, increasing capacity by 200 mmcfd.  Most
of the additional capacity is expected to be used to supply gas-fired
power plants.
 
FERC Won't Cede Authority over LNG Import Facilities
 
The FERC yesterday rejected a request by Dynegy LNG Production Terminal
to be exempt from FERC oversight of its proposed facility at Hackberry,
Louisiana.  The plant is planned to have a vaporization capacity of 750
mmcfd expandable to 1 bcfd and to be operational by 4th quarter 2003.
Hackberry is situated on the west side of Calcasieu Lake in southwest
Louisiana.  The closest interstate pipelines are Columbia Gulf and Gulf
South (formerly Koch Gateway).
