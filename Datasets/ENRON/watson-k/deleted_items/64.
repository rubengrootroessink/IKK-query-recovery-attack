Kim-

Following is the course information for Becoming an Exceptional Leader; As I thought, it begins the day after you come back from vacation.  There are (2) other offerings of this same course, same teacher.  You can log onto http:/elm.enron.com, and sign up for the one that suits your schedule.  One is offered October 31-November 2, and the other is November 19-21.  When you register, it will say there is a wait list.  However, they are in the process of adding a few more seats, so you would probably get in.

Thanks,

Fran

ETS HR is pleased to inform that the "Becoming an Exceptional Leader" program is returning this fall.  Arrangements have been made to offer this popular 3-day development program October 15-17 in Houston and we have once again secured Peter Maw to instruct the class.  Peter is considered the premiere instructor for this program and he is in very high demand.  The description of the program is provided below for your reference.  

The cost of the program, approximately $2,000 per person, will be charged back to each participant's cost center. 

Description: Becoming an Exceptional Leader
This program targets analytical and interpersonal problems that block productive managerial performance and is built around personal and confidential feedback provided from direct reports.  The course is based on research done over the last two decades on what differentiates high performers from their peers.  The program is practical, personal, conceptual, tactical, and focused on skill building.  Participants leave with knowledge of: (1) present style/strengths, (2) areas for improvement, (3) specific tactics or "how-to's," and (4) a plan for future development.  
Target Audience: line managers/directors, team advisors, functional managers/directors, vice presidents - preferably, anyone who has at least three employees reporting to them.
