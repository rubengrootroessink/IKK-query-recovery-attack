The CRC  group from the Liberal Region would like to offer the use of the parade cars and equipment for the purpose of promoting the Enron name  and the involvement that we as a company have in the community. If you know of a team that would be interested in helping with a parade, the requirements are, it takes 6 people to handle the equipment and if you pass out candy, you might need more people.  Please feel free to contact us if you need more information.
   The persons to contact are as follow Steve Showers, Sublette Team 620-675-8861, Alex Brechbuhler, Hugoton Plant Team,620-544-5068.
