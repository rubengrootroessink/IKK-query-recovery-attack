Thanks, Ann!  You and Matthew have a great holiday, too...

On 12/16, Kim and I have an obligation with the Spires, our annual holiday
party with a twist:  we are honoring the Spires' staff for their dedication
during and after last summer's flood.  Since I'm chairing (and somehow got
talked into emceeing) the event, I think I need to be there.  That event
starts at 5:30 and should be over by 8:30 or 9, so if your party is still in
progress, we'll be there!

John

Matt and I are planning to have another giving party this Christmas.
Please save Sunday, Dec 16th if you haven't already made plans.  I'll
likely send out invitations the first week of December.

Hope we see you there and have a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving!

Ann
