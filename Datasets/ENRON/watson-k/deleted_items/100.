	Kim -- 

	I came back last Thursday -- lots going on.  I am doing fairly well -- still have some swelling and cramping in my 
	left foot and ankle but Dr. says by the middle of next month, that should all go away.

	How are you?  Are you still going to Italy?  If so, hope that all goes well.  Let me know your schedule -- if you have 
	time for a lunch before you go.

	--Dot
