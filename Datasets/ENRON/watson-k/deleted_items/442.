Henry Hub, Rockies Flip 
 
Over the past few days, I've noticed that Henry Hub physical gas price
has been lower than prices in the Rocky Mountains.  A spot check of data
from Gas Daily shows this to have occurred only about 40 times over the
past five years, or about 3% of the time.
 
Here is a list of physical prices from November 27, 2001 from
