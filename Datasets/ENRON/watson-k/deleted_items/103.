Kim the Festival begins with a Mass (maby Catholic maby not) the Parade on Tuesday followed with Indian Dances,  and  carnival rides. The booths will be open both days. Festivities begin at 08:00 AM each day and last until midnight on Tuesday and until 10:00 PM on Wednesday. This sounds like a larger event that I anticipated.
