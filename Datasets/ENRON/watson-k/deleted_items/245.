ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 13, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I mentioned to you a few weeks ago that nothing divides the 
Christian church in the Western world any more than views on how to 
interpret the Bible. On the one hand there is either the natural or 
conscious literal approach and, on the other, the mytho-poetic 
approach. The topics over which various groups within the Christian 
tradition have the most controversy are views about creation, 
homosexuality and the historic Jesus.

   We will have a first-hand opportunity to explore one of these - the 
issue of homosexuality - this Sunday as a mother and daughter share 
with us their story.

   Jennifer Feather grew up in the St. Paul's community. Her mother, 
SuZanne Feather, has been very active at St. Paul's.

   The Ordinary Life Gathering will combine with the Point of View 
Class this Sunday to hear these two women share their experience. About 
what they will be doing, Jennifer writes this:

   "Religion is a fundamentally communal experience. Shared beliefs and 
rituals form its foundations. However, the practice of our faith is 
also inextricably bound to our own personal experience. Our individual 
relationship to God is as important as our communal experience of 
religion. Our differences from one another make the competing demands 
of individuality and community evident.

   "Sexuality has become a divisive issue in the Church precisely 
because it brings to light these difficulties.

   "Having grown-up at St. Paul's, the interplay between individual 
difference and this community has shaped my experience of my faith.

   "Join me and my mother, SuZanne, as we share with you our story and 
explore the implications of sexuality for our understanding of 
religious community and the place of difference within that community."

               * * *

   We will skip having refreshments at the beginning of our time 
together this week only.

   DON'T FORGET - this Sunday only we'll be meeting in the Activities 
Center.

   I look forward to seeing you this Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
