Kevin/Michelle,
I would like to meet with you to discuss  the TW Deal Analysis/Deal Profitability Tool - i.e.-- Are you using it?, Is it useful?, Does it need improving? also is there a need on your part for additional support in helping analyze deals?--i.e.--can we help you analyze deals?
Please let me know when would be a convenient date and time to meet.
Thanks
Kim Kouri
