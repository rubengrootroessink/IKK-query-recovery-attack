Updated GDS and Documentation Now Available

 

You can now download the latest, corrected version of the GDS Graphical
Display System in either Access 97 or Access 2000 format plus the
updated documentation file from the GPCM website.

 

If you have not licensed GDS yet, but would like to see what its
capabilities are, please contact me and I'll send you the documentation
file in Word.  It gives you screen shots of each of the different
functions plus a full description of how it is used.
