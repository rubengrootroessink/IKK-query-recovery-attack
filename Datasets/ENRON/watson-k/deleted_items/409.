Power enjoyed fishing and boating all week with Grandpa and Renee while Judy, 
Paul and Marydith flew to Atlanta.  Marydith's first flight.  The good news 
is there's nothing much to say about her flying.  Also not much of any delays 
due to extra security.  Not to be unpatriotic but I think a few of the new 
rules are the same ones the airlines have been trying to pass for a while but 
couldn't until they could claim security.  

Savannah was nice.  Kind of like our weekend last Oct in Arkansas.  Lots of 
old buildings and tourist type shops.  

Judy is gearing up for the big bash on Bolivar next weekend.  The kids and I 
have not made any definite plans.

In a no where else but TX story.  I rode my bike tonight out through the 
flood plain.  I came across a small herd of cows.  The half on the left got 
startled and ran across the bike path and the group on the right crossed the 
other way so I ended up looking like the slot man on the Blue Angels as I 
emerged from the crossing cows.  Having had fun on the way South I realized 
the only way home at night is back North on the same path so about 10 minutes 
later I come back to find the bull standing across the path.  Remembering the 
old adage normally said about dogs "Speed is Life" I played chicken with him 
keeping the option open to cut behind him.  He blinked and moved off the 
path.  

John, any plans for next weekend?
