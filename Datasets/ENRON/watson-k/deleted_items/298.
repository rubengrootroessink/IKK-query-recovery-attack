ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 13, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   "What is it that you want to do with the one, wild, precious thing
called your life?" That is the magnificently disturbing question asked
by poet Mary Oliver.

   Questions - that is my starting point for our gathering this week.

   Questions can be dangerous - they can take us right to the edge of
all we know, of what is comfortable to us.

   Every morning of your life, whether you are conscious of it or not,
you begin your day with questions. We keep them going throughout the
day.

   Last year you filled out a questionnaire for me which I want to talk
about this Sunday. And, I want to tell you a story about the most
important question of all.

   I'm wondering - will you be there? I hope so.

Much love,


Bill Kerley
