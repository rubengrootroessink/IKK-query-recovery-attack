Vince,

According to the attached schedule, we should begin allocating costs in July to the ETS Revenue Management group for Capital Project Work.  In addition, no allocations have been made in 2001 to Dan McCarty's group.  Have any agreements been reached as to the amount of these allocations and where they will be charged?  

Also, no allocations have been made for John Goodpasture's group, pending the creation of a new cost center.  Kim, can you tell me where this should be charged yet?

Thanks,
Diane Fellers
