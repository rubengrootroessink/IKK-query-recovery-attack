9 a.m. Saturday is fine with me....

Couple of sites you might find interesting:

http://selectsmart.com/beta_cat/ - lets you enter your preferences and it
suggests breeds that match

http://www.cfainc.org/breeds.html - a listing of all (or seemingly all) cat
breeds

I've sent them both home so we can view them tonight or later this week...

ILY,
J

If I can't swing Friday, how about planning on being there at 9:00am?

I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I
might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does
it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K.

...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just
talked to Bob Corrigan and scheduled to meet him for lunch and we could
both
see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...
