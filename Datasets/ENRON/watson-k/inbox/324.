Thanks, Kim.  Even with the letter, calls and specific conversation with on=
eof  NNG's large customer's Treasury group, Duke STILL send the wire to the=
 Bank of America in error.  Go figure...  That's why we are taking the extr=
a precautionary step of including marketing.  Thanks for your help.

Steve,

I would like your assistance to ensure the timely collection of our transpo=
rtation accounts receivables.  There is something your group can do to help=
 assure the successful collection of Transwestern's $12,000,000 next week. =
 Please forward this email to the TW marketers and ask them to assist Gas L=
ogistics in this process by having a conversation (similar to what is descr=
ibed below) with their marketing counterpart if they are the marketer for a=
ny of the customers listed below:
Please call your marketing counterpart and (after making some small talk ab=
out Enron) reassure them that Transwestern is fine and ongoing business wil=
l continue uninterrupted.  Then slip in that you understand that this is a =
busy time of the year and marketing normally doesn't get involved in paymen=
t issues unless there is some type of major problem, BUT, you have a differ=
ent type of request/favor to ask of them.  You can tell them that with all =
of the changes at Enron lately, Transwestern moved the bank account that re=
ceives our wire transfer payments for our reservation, commodity and imbala=
nce cash accounts.  Tell them that Gas Logistics posted the notice and the =
new account information on the web as well as included letters in with the =
reservation and commodity invoices mailed on December 3rd notifying them of=
 this bank account change.  HOWEVER, you don't really know whether you can =
trust the "accounting geeks" or others who handle the details to have actua=
lly made the changes in their system to revise the bank information and tha=
t you are asking them to call internally within their company to follow up.=
  Please ask them specifically to pass along the new wiring instruction inf=
ormation as follows:
Bank Name:=09Citibank, NA
Address:=09=09New York, NY
ABA #:=09=09021000089
Account #:=09=0930454716
Beneficiary:=09Transwestern Pipeline=09=09

I almost feel like I need to apologize for asking you to place this redunda=
nt call, but we all understand the criticalness of receiving Transwestern's=
 cash in our own bank account.  Thank you for the help and we will forward =
control reports to you next week.
