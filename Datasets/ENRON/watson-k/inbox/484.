Hi, Kim...been thinking about you with all the "stuff" about Enron that is in 
the Chronicle.  I usually cut what the paper writes down alot b/c I don't 
trust those journalisticwords to be "the truth"...but I have been aware of 
wondering how this is affecting you...so I'm just writing now to
say I'm thinking about you.  bye and hugs. SAM
