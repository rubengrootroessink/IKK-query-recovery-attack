The Teams intent as commissioned by John Keller and Jerry Martin was to outline roles and responsibilities as they relate 
to the ETS Project Processes. The Team has worked fervently over the last several months with the intent of improving
our current process.  Please review the attached document with your respective Team members and provide  
comments by December 5th. Please direct your responses or questions to Dennis Alters (713) 853 6586.  Dennis will 
coordinate with the appropriate Team members for response.  


					    	Thanks, 

				      "The ETS Project Process Team"
