FERC Proposes New Rules On Energy Co Affiliate Dealings

09/26/2001=20
Dow Jones Energy Service=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Commission proposed Wednes=
day new restrictions governing natural gas pipeline and electric utility af=
filiate dealings.=20
The commission unanimously agreed to initiate a rulemaking to tighten regul=
ations prohibiting pipelines and utilities from providing market-sensitive =
information to their marketing affiliates.=20
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline and utility companies to sell natural ga=
s and electricity at market rates, providing they adopt codes of conduct th=
at prevent the passage of information giving a competitive advantage to the=
ir marketing affiliates.=20
The proposed changes reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural g=
as and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline indus=
try in the 1980s.=20
FERC's "code-of-conduct" rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensi=
tive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't a=
ddress the pipeline's power marketing affiliates.=20
The commission's proposed rules would expand the code-of-conduct rules to a=
ddress all marketing affiliates, including those involved in financial tran=
sactions that don't entail the physical delivery of energy.=20
The template for the proposed changes can be found in the conditions FERC i=
mposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Cons=
olidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). The commission approved the=
 electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreein=
g to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing=
 affiliates.=20
FERC's rule changes would apply to other electric utilities with pipeline i=
nvestments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electr=
ic Power Co. (AEP).=20
It wasn't immediately clear how the changes would affect joint operating ag=
reements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Ko=
ch Industries.=20
The largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive powe=
r marketing operations and investments in power plants.=20
For example, El Paso Corp. (EPG), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE)=
, represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry, and are among th=
e nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers.=20
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of=
 El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s controversial contract with a marketing affiliat=
e for pipeline capacity into California.=20
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup i=
n natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's u=
nprecedented high electricity cost last year.=20

FERC Grants PD for Tuscarora Lateral, Approves Northern Abandonment=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a favorable prel=
iminary determination on non-environmental grounds to Tuscarora Gas Transmi=
ssion's Wadsworth Lateral, a 14.2-mile pipeline extension and associated fa=
cilities that would increase Tuscarora's transportation capacity by 95,912 =
Dth/d. The lateral would extend from Tuscarora's mainline in northern Washo=
e County, NV, to an interconnect with Paiute Pipeline in Nevada.=20
The expansion of the 229-mile pipeline system, which extends from Malin, OR=
, to a growing Nevada market, would serve two new power generation faciliti=
es in Nevada near Tracy and Wadsworth. Duke Energy plans to construct a 540=
 MW plant near Wadsworth, and Morgan Stanley is now constructing the 360 MW=
 Naniwa Energy facility near Tracy.=20
The added capacity also would supplement the growing gas distribution needs=
 of Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., which collectively di=
stribute natural gas to all of northern Nevada and portions of Northern Cal=
ifornia.=20
If FERC approves the application, Tuscarora said it would begin constructio=
n in April 2002 and begin service by the end of that year. The $60 million =
expansion is supported by long-term, firm transportation contracts ranging =
from 10-to-15 years that are contingent upon completion.=20
FERC also gave Northern Natural Gas the authority to abandon by sale its fa=
r east leg to Wisconsin Gas for use by affiliate Guardian Pipeline. The Nor=
thern line runs from Boone County, IA, to an interconnect with ANR in Rock =
County, WI. It extends to a delivery point near Eagle, WI. This nine mile, =
24-inch diameter line is located primarily in Walworth and Waukesha, WI.=20
FERC has given Guardian Pipeline authorization to eliminate construction of=
 its Eagle lateral, which would have run parallel to the Northern line. The=
 8.5 mile, 16-inch diameter Eagle Lateral would have run from a connection =
with Guardian to Eagle, WI, at a delivery point with nonjurisdictional faci=
lities of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric.=20

Enron Corp.'s subsidiary Transwestern Pipeline Co. says it received request=
s for more than 1.3 Bcf/d of capacity for its proposed Sun Devil Pipeline e=
xpansion project that would transport San Juan Basin natural gas production=
 to market areas in Phoenix and California by January 2004.=20
Transwestern's Sun Devil Pipeline was announced as another of several new w=
estern states' gas transportation options. A Transwestern official said the=
 gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona is the second largest grow=
th market in the U.S. The company is working with shippers to finalize tran=
sportation agreements and expects to file its Sun Devil application with th=
e FERC early next year. Shippers needing additional information can contact=
 Project Director Kevin Hyatt at 713-853-5559 or email at Kevin.hyatt@enron=
.com.=20
Transwestern announced its plans on August 8. The proposed project will inc=
lude new compression and pipeline looping plus a new lateral, the Flagstaff=
 - Phoenix, Arizona lateral, which would add approximately 175 miles to Tra=
nswestern's existing system. The project's estimated in-service date is Jan=
uary 2004. The proposed facility modifications will enable Transwestern to =
deliver an incremental 780,000 dth/d from the Blanco Hub located in San Jua=
n County, New Mexico to the Thoreau area, an incremental 90,000 dth/d from =
Thoreau to the California border, and an incremental 450,000 dth/d from Tho=
reau to Phoenix. Potential supply receipt points from the San Juan Basin at=
 the Blanco Hub are BRT/Val Verde Plant, WFS/Milagro Plant, WFS/Kutz Plant,=
 and TransColorado/Blanco. Transwestern will consider interconnecting with =
other upstream and downstream pipelines, subject to the mutual agreement of=
 the pipelines. The estimated maximum one-part reservation rates, exclusive=
 of fuel and all surcharges, for firm service through the capacity describe=
d in this open season are as follows: San Juan to Thoreau -$.0985 dth/d; Th=
oreau to California -- $.240 dth/d; and Thoreau to Phoenix -- $0.454 dth/d.=
 (See REPORT NO. 2348, pp6-7.)=20
Transwestern's Red Rock Project (CP01-115), approved by FERC earlier this s=
ummer and under construction, will add 150 MMcf/d of new capacity for deliv=
eries to the California border in mid-2002.

FERC Proposes Rulemaking, Plans Meetings=20
In the same way your teacher loaded you down with books and assignments on =
the first day of the school year, new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission =
Chairman Pat Wood, presiding over his first meeting Wednesday. He put a who=
le slew of initiatives in motion, setting meetings, rulemakings, and callin=
g for comments.=20
Sorting it out:=20
The Commission voted out a proposed rulemaking that which would extend the =
standards of conduct to fence off federally regulated transmission monopoli=
es, both gas pipelines and electric transmission lines, from any other affi=
liate, including financial affiliates (see related story). For gas pipeline=
s, which have been unbundled for a number of years and subject to affiliate=
 codes of conduct for an equal number of years, the proposed rule will not =
be as onerous as it will for electric utilities, many of which are still bu=
ndled. This will mean, however, that gas transmission utilities must mainta=
in firewalls between themselves and power affiliates, as well as gas market=
ing affiliates. Turn in your comments, please.=20
By its second meeting in October, FERC will have a detailed business plan, =
including priorities and completion dates for its Oct. 1, 2001 to Oct. 1, 2=
002 fiscal year. Wood directed a panel of senior staff members and another =
of junior staff members and union representatives to come up with the plan.=
 The commissioners voted Wednesday to amend their existing five-year plan t=
o emphasize their major new emphasis on market monitoring and mitigation.=
=20
FERC will be holding regional meetings on gas and electric infrastructure. =
It will start with a meeting on the western infrastructure following the No=
v. 1-2 Western Governors Association meeting in Seattle. Wood said he expec=
ted federal and state regulators, and others to participate. A meeting for =
the Northeast may be scheduled in December, with sessions for the South and=
 Midwest to come later. Attendance is not mandatory.=20
FERC will cooperate with the Department of Energy in two technology-oriente=
d sessions, one to explore technology solutions such as remote metering to =
capturing retail and wholesale consumer demand response in mid-February and=
 another to investigate new transmission technology in mid-January.=20
Don't be surprised to see a lot of topics debated at FERC's regular open me=
etings. The sunshine laws which prohibit more than two commissioners from d=
iscussing FERC business except in an open meeting, is confining, Wood said.=
 (Usually commission staff runs back and forth among commissioners to estab=
lish positions before the meetings). Wood would like to have more discussio=
ns out in the open to work things out, and also to let the public know "not=
 just what we are doing, but why we are doing it."=20
And also, be prepared to pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States=
 of America from now on at any FERC meeting presided over by Chairman Wood.=
 The chairman also asked for a moment of silence Wednesday for the victims =
of the Sept. 11 attack.=20


NGI's Daily Gas Price Index=20

Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice =
of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct f=
or transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power l=
ines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other comp=
any affiliate.=20
Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including sep=
arate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, betwe=
en gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wa=
ll off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affilia=
te, gas or electric, including financial affiliates.=20
The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of =
the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many =
cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation=
, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchas=
es of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Mas=
sey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personne=
l, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission oper=
ations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to.=20
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel deali=
ng solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported =
the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing=
. "I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints a=
nd no evidence." She said she thought state commissions might consider the =
move an infringement on their jurisdiction. "I agree with concept philosoph=
ically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do=
 a little more bridge-building with state commissions."=20
Wood said he understood "the political issue here with respect to federal-s=
tate relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that =
ought to be eliminated." Staff pointed out that if there were any problems =
with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waiv=
ers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how m=
uch information was available to affiliate personnel. "If I am an affiliate=
 employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control=
 room and get all the information I want," one staffer responded.=20
Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exce=
ptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may rev=
erse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of=
 native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefi=
t analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invite=
d to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to al=
l sales employees, "but make it clear that if we don't hear from people tha=
t they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it."=20

STATESMAN NEWS SERVICE & AGENCIES NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept. 26. An inter-mini=
sterial committee of Union secretaries is monitoring the Enron crisis regul=
arly, to facilitate some kind of early solution to the Enron imbroglio invo=
lving the Dabhol power project, the power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said =
here today, while refusing to divulge the options being explored.=20
An institutional framework committee, made up of the finance secretary Mr A=
jit Kumar, power secretary Mr Ashok K Basu, law secretary Mr R L Meena and =
the petroleum secretary Mr V N Kaul, has been monitoring the developments o=
n the project front, and regularly interacting with the parties Mr Prabhu s=
aid at a briefing.
We want an early solution to the problem, but the Centre has a very restric=
ted role, limited only to facilitate an amicable solution, he said.=20
Mr Prabhu refused comment on Enron chairman, Mr Kenneth Lays reported lette=
r to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, seeking $5 billion in dam=
ages for terminating the contract, but said if by writing letters problems =
can be solved, we can also write letters. He said the government and the Ca=
binet have been kept informed of the status of the negotiations but it woul=
d be premature to speak at this stage on the problem which has its genesis =
in the contract signed in 1992.=20
DPC AGM: Notwithstanding its depleting financial conditions, Dabhol Power C=
ompany has recorded a higher net profit of Rs 208 crore for the year ended =
2000-01, compared with Rs 198 crore in the previous year.=20
Disclosing this at the annual general meeting here today, the Enron India c=
hief, Mr Wade Cline, said that the promoters of DPC would be making efforts=
 to fetch additional finances from the institutions to complete the remaini=
ng 10 per cent construction work of the 2,184-MW power project at Guhaghar =
in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.=20
Godbole report: The recommendations of the Godbole Committee, that held ren=
egotiations with Enron on the future of DPC, are likely to remain on paper.=
=20
This was clear from the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukhs p=
ost-Cabinet-meeting statement today when he said the government noted certa=
in recommendations of the Godbole panel following several round of talks wi=
th officials of Enron-DPC over the past five months.=20
Mr Deshmukh said these recommendations would guide the government in future=
 while negotiating fresh projects.=20
The fate of DPC will thus remain undecided. In the last Cabinet meeting, th=
e Maharashtra government announced terms of reference for an inquiry commis=
sion, which would be set up to probe the entire Enron-MSEB deal ab initio. =
However, the government is still to name a retired Supreme Court Judge to h=
ead the commission.=20
Mr Madhav Godbole, a former bureaucrat, had clearly suggested that the pane=
l should call off renegotiations, since Enron had announced its desire to w=
alk out of the DPC. He said other states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,=
 Delhi and Rajasthan were ready to purchase Enron power, provided the rate =
per unit ranged between Rs 2.25 and Rs 2.40. This was rejected by Enron.=20
Other recommendations noted by the State include: The Union Government whic=
h has given counter guarantee of Rs 2,500 crore, should raise bonds of the =
same amount and give them to Maharashtra as interest-free loan.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Wednesday on li=
ght demand, as traders hoped to take advantage of cash-outs on pipelines, m=
arketers said.=20
"Not much is getting done for next month," one veteran trader said. "It's (=
Tuesday) all over again."=20
He said traders are hoping they can "get away with as much as possible on t=
hose cash-outs and pray they don't get a call from pipelines" asking them t=
o ante up on the $2.15/MMBtu and above prices from earlier in the week.=20
As for next-month bidding, "everyone was asking," but not much was getting =
accomplished on baseload trading for October physical gas, a trader said.=
=20
Wednesday, prices were at a premium to the New York Mercantile Exchange to =
start the session, but ended up either in convergence or slightly in contan=
go, he said.=20
Looking ahead, some incremental demand may be seen next month, as some util=
ities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy si=
tes go off-line for maintenance, one veteran trader said.=20
October, a shoulder month, tends to be a major price discount month, he sai=
d. On the Nymex there's presently a 42-cent difference between the outgoing=
 October contract and the November contract. The November-November 2002 spr=
ead is more than 80 cents.=20
Wednesday, traders again saw tight ranges as the Nymex October contract tra=
ded under the spot cash bid-ask price, which are both at 30-month lows.=20
Traders are in the midst of a three-day monthly bid week as they set baselo=
ad pricing for October.=20
The Nymex Oct natural gas futures contract expired at $1.83 a million Briti=
sh thermal units, down 9.5 cents. November settled at $2.253/MMBtu, down 4.=
7 cents.=20
The American Gas Association said 91 billion cubic feet of gas was added to=
 storage, and the bearish report sparked a selldown in October to $1.76/MMB=
tu.=20
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, the delivery point for Nymex=
 gas, prices fell 5 cents-8 cents to a $1.85-$1.92/MMBtu closing range.=20
First-of-month index for the Henry Hub is around $2.34/MMBtu.=20
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.03-$=
2.15/MMBtu, up 5 cents-6 cents.=20
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins =
delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $1.72-$1.81/MMBtu, down 4 cent=
s-5 cents. Index for September is at $2.66/MMBtu.=20
At PG&E Citygate, traders paid $1.85-$2.05/MMBtu, down 3 cents on the bid, =
up 8 cents on the ask. September first-of-month index is at $2.71/MMBtu.=20
At the Katy hub in East Texas, prices were in a $1.81-$1.87/MMBtu range, do=
wn 6 cents. First-of-month September index is $2.37/MMBtu.=20
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.65-$1.78/MMBtu, down 3 cents-9 cents.=

REVEALED Finding natural gas was once a matter of luck -- surface seeps pro=
vided the only real clue. Eventually, though, people realized that seeps of=
ten occurred on anticlinal or dome-like slopes, indicating the presence of =
an underground trap. In the early 1900s, oil companies began relying on geo=
logists to help them read what the rocks had to say, but it was many years =
before seismic technology could give a picture of rock formations hidden de=
ep in the Earth. These days, specialized vibroseis trucks use mechanical vi=
brations to create seismic waves. Costing US$350,000 each, the trucks weigh=
 from 18,000 to 30,000 kg and travel in groups of four or five. They are of=
ten called "dancing elephants," operating in unison at 100-metre intervals.=
 An on-board hydraulic system presses a central plate against the ground, l=
ifting the truck into the air and vibrating it over a controlled frequency =
band. The resulting waves are reflected from rock layers in the Earth -- di=
fferent types of rock reflect waves differently, much as a ball bounced on =
pavement will bounce higher than a ball bounced on sand. The returning wave=
s are then measured by sensitive geophones, or jugs, strung out every 25 me=
tres along the ground. Supercomputers process the data to generate a 2-D or=
 3-D picture of the underground structures. In the end, the only sure way t=
o know if gas exists is to drill, but these days the final decision is base=
d on much more than a hunch and a prayer, since so much is at stake: about =
$900,000, the average cost to complete a gas well in western Canada.=20
SNIFFED Natural gas at the wellhead contains a potentially poisonous contam=
inant called hydrogen sulphide, or H2S. Natural gas that contains more than=
 1% of it is called "sour" gas. It has a strong odour, similar to rotten eg=
gs. About 30% of Canada's total natural gas production is sour, most of it =
found in Alberta and B.C. By contrast, discoveries in the Arctic and off th=
e East Coast contain less than 1% H2S and are called "sweet." If the gas is=
 sour, it is "sweetened" by converting up to 99% of the H2S into elemental =
sulphur for use in fertilizers and for export. The remaining H2S is flared,=
 a controversial incineration process that results in the conversion of H2S=
 to sulphur dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere. (An excellent a=
ccount of the controversy can by found in Andrew Nikiforuk's book Saboteurs=
: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil, to be published this month.) Whether =
sweet or sour, the natural gas used to heat our homes must be processed bef=
ore it is pipeline-ready for shipment. Processing occurs at plants close to=
 the production areas or at straddle extraction plants on major pipeline ro=
utes. In Canada, there are 837 processing plants, 756 of them in Alberta. T=
he four largest processors are: Husky Energy Inc. (51 plants), Anderson Exp=
loration Ltd. (49), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (47) and Conoco Canada =
Ltd. (35).=20
SQUEALED "Smart pigs" aren't actually pigs. They're sophisticated tools tha=
t travel inside pipelines checking for corrosion and evidence of stress or =
cracking in the pipe. Early versions were called pigs because they squealed=
 as they moved inside the pipe. Propelled by the gas, they travel at speeds=
 from 0.8 to 16 km per hour. Only about six companies in the world build an=
d inspect pipelines with pigs, which have cost up to US$1 million for resea=
rchand development. Pigs range in size from 89 mm to 1.4 m in diameter and =
can be as long as 6 metres. Special pig "launch and trap facilities" are bu=
ilt along the length of the pipeline to allow for insertion and removal at =
various intervals.=20
TRAPPED In nature, natural gas, made predominantly of methane -- four hydro=
gen atoms attached to one carbon atom -- is found mixed with other hydrocar=
bons such as ethane, propane and butane, as well as hydrogen sulphide and c=
arbon dioxide. Most experts believe the carbon and hydrogen came from micro=
scopic plants and animals deposited with mud and silt at the bottom of anci=
ent oceans. Over millions of years, the intense pressure and heat caused by=
 growing layers of sediment transformed this organic material into crude oi=
l and natural gas. The sediment itself eventually became porous sedimentary=
 rock. Oil and gas migrate upwards through this rock because they are less =
dense than the seawater in its pores. You would see the same result if you =
put a mixture of gas, oil and water in a glass: they would separate accordi=
ng to their different densities. If the gas manages to reach the surface, i=
t is released into the atmosphere. But often it will be stopped in its upwa=
rd journey by impermeable rock formations, or cap rocks, that trap it in un=
derground reservoirs.=20
SHIPPED Hidden a metre or more underground, a vast subterranean network of =
steel pipes and plastic tubes delivers natural gas from the wellhead to the=
 consumer. Almost 80,000 km of gas pipelines link producers in the west to =
the populated regions of eastern Canada and the U.S. Efficient movement thr=
ough the pipeline requires transmission at high pressure along the way. Pro=
pelled at speeds of up to 40 km per hour, it takes about three days for nat=
ural gas from Alberta to reach markets in southwestern Ontario. A voracious=
 U.S. appetite for natural gas has sparked recent additions to the system, =
such as the $1.8-billion, 1,051-km Maritimes and Northeast pipeline that mo=
ves Sable Island gas from Nova Scotia to Dracut, Mass., and the $4.5-billio=
n, 2,988-km Alliance pipeline that links B.C. and Alberta to the Chicago ma=
rket.=20
MEASURED In the metric system, joules measure energy content. The joule was=
 named after James Joule, an English physicist who co-discovered the law of=
 conservation of energy: "Energy used up in one form reappears in another a=
nd is never lost." One joule is the amount of energy required to heat one g=
ram of water by 1/4 degree Celsius. Since joules are so small, people norma=
lly speak in terms of gigajoules, or one billion joules. An average Canadia=
n home would use about 150 GJ in a year, and one gigajoule on a particularl=
y cold winter day. Producers and pipeline operators measure natural gas by =
volume using cubic metres (or cubic feet, just to confuse the issue). One c=
ubic metre is the size of an average dishwasher. Canada is the third-larges=
t producer of natural gas in the world, producing 162 billion cubic metres =
in 1999. No. 1 is the Russian Federation (551 billion), No. 2 is the U.S. (=
540 billion) and No. 4 is the U.K. (100 billion). According to Oilweek maga=
zine, the top three Canadian producers in 2000 were: Alberta Energy Company=
 Ltd. (gas revenues of $2.3 billion), PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. ($1.6 bill=
ion) and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. ($1.3 billion).=20
DISCOVERED The first natural gas discovery in Canada was at Stoney Creek, N=
.B., in 1859. The first commercial development came 30 years later, when en=
trepreneur Eugene Coste drilled a well that supplied communities in Essex C=
ounty, Ont., near Windsor. By 1904, he had moved west, making history in 19=
09 with "Old Glory," so-called for the size of its flare, near Bow Island, =
Alta. This discovery was large enough to justify a 270-km-long, 40-cm-wide =
pipeline to Calgary, the longest of its kind at the time.=20
PRICED If Canada has so much natural gas, why did prices hit an all-time hi=
gh of $16.90 per gigajoule in December 2000, up from $2.63 in January 2000?=
 Simple supply and demand, combined with a cold winter and fears of low sto=
rage levels. Since then, prices have fallen to the $4.50 range, partly due =
to the economic slowdown. Matthew Foss, an economist with the Canadian Ener=
gy Research Institute in Calgary, predicts an average price of $3.50 per gi=
gajoule this winter, since storage facilities are at near capacity and new =
drilling is proceeding: about 13,000 gas wells by year's end.

Heating Bills This Winter to Ease Sharply Utilities: Lower natural gas pric=
es are reducing costs for Californians, but reliance on imports could be a =
problem in the long run, studies say.

Winter heating bills in California will be substantially smaller than the s=
wollen tabs of last year because of sharply lower natural gas prices and pl=
entiful supplies, utilities said Wednesday.=20
But the longer-term picture for consumers is not as rosy, despite the recen=
t decline in wholesale natural gas prices.=20
Two reports released this week warn that California's heavy reliance on imp=
orted natural gas, which fuels most of the state's power plants in addition=
 to fulfilling most of its heating needs, could be setting the state up for=
 future energy crises.=20
For now, the wholesale price of natural gas is dropping along with most fos=
sil fuels, and supplies are plentiful. Natural gas futures slumped to a 2 1=
/2-year low Wednesday after an industry report showed a bigger-than-expecte=
d jump in U.S. inventories.=20
The American Gas Assn. said supplies in storage rose 3.3% last week to 2.84=
8 trillion cubic feet, continuing a steady build made possible by reduced d=
emand from manufacturers.=20
In response, natural gas for October delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 4.9%, to $=
1.83 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=
 Prices have dropped 82% from a Dec. 27 record of $10.10 per million BTU, c=
aused by scant supplies.=20
Prices in California, which imports 85% of its natural gas from other U.S. =
states and Canada, peaked much higher in December at about $60 per million =
BTU. California wholesale prices now are hovering close to the Nymex price.=
=20
California was clobbered harder last winter than the rest of the country fo=
r several reasons: colder-than-usual weather, heavy use by in-state power p=
lants and reduced pipeline capacity caused by a deadly explosion. In additi=
on, state regulators accused a major pipeline operator, the El Paso Natural=
 Gas unit of El Paso Corp., of manipulating the market; federal regulators =
have not yet ruled on that case.=20
"The message this year is much better than it was at this time last year," =
said Anne Smith, vice president for customer service at Southern California=
 Gas, a subsidiary of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Southern California Ga=
s' more than 5 million customers paid record prices last year, as did the c=
ustomers of Sempra's San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas =
& Electric.=20
Unlike with electricity, the price of natural gas is not fixed for resident=
ial and small-business customers. The gas utilities pass along the commodit=
y price to customers with no markup.=20
Last winter, which runs from November to March in the utility world, the av=
erage residential customer of Southern California Gas got a monthly bill of=
 $80. This winter, the average bill is expected to be about $60, Smith said=
.=20
The basic commodity cost for natural gas sold to its residential customers =
for this October, for example, will be 15.9 cents per therm, compared with =
57.04 cents last October. (A therm is one-tenth the standard wholesale meas=
ure of 1 million BTUs, or about 100 cubic feet of gas.)=20
Transmission costs, which remain fairly constant year to year, average abou=
t 40 cents per therm for the company's residential customers. (The average =
single-family home uses about 75 therms a month.)=20
PG&E projects similar cost declines, and both utilities say they have plent=
y of gas in storage to meet the needs of their core residential and small-b=
usiness customers.=20
But problems loom with California's natural gas supply system, according to=
 studies released this week by the California Energy Commission and the Cal=
ifornia Public Interest Research Group.=20
The two studies agree that heavy demand has strained the state's delivery a=
nd storage systems, but otherwise they had little in common.=20
The final draft of the Energy Commission staff report, released Monday, not=
ed that utilities already are moving to expand or build new pipelines, and =
recommended that the state encourage the drilling of more natural gas wells=
 and expansion of pipeline systems within California, among other things.=
=20
The CalPIRG report, released Wednesday, advocates that the state deny licen=
ses to any new power plants fueled by natural gas and to encourage renewabl=
e energy production through favorable taxation and by requiring that a mini=
mum of 20% of the state's electricity come from wind, solar and geothermal =
sources by 2010.=20
"Natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels," said CalPIRG's Brad Heavn=
er, the report's author. "But it's not a magic bullet, and by relying on it=
 we are setting ourselves up."
