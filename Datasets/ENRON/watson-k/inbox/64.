The ferry companies were not receiving requests yesterday or today due to a
bank holiday. I need your home address
and phone number for the request. You are not committed until I get a reply
from them and then fax your credit cards.
Can you also get me the credit card numbers? I will not use them until I
check back with you about final costs.
Thanks.
