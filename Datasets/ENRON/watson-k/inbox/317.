ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of October 28, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   Already I have heard from a number of folks what an outstanding job
Michael Butera did yesterday in the Ordinary Life gathering. He always
does. It is impossible to provide a summary of what he did. Though he
speaks from deep preparation, little of what he says is on paper. There
will be a tape available of his presentation.

   His topic was fear and how to deal with it. These are certainly
fearful times.

   This seems to be true on both personal and global levels.

   On my own personal level, the eye surgeon discovered scar tissue
growing on my retina last week. This is a possible side-effect of the
surgeries I've had. If this scar tissue can't be dealt with by
medication, I'll have to have more eye surgery.

   On our national and global levels, things are out of control.

   Let me recommend to you a couple of resources to draw on for these
troubling times.

   One is a book that you might want to be reading as we continue to
speak about our spiritual journey in light of our present national and
global context. The book is "When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for
Difficult Times" by Pema Chodron. One of her points is that the very
effort to find a safe and secure place is what causes us so much
suffering. This book will both challenge and comfort you.

   The other resource is to visit a web site where you can find two
talks by Thich Nhat Hanh. One is a sermon he gave at Riverside Church
right after the 9/11 attacks. The other is an interview he gave
entitled "If I Could Talk With Osama Bin Laden." You can find all of
this at

   I look forward to seeing you this coming Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley
