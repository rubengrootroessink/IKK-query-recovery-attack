This is what I have for Kim.  The numbers have worked for me in the past.

I talked to Lisa and we are going to meet at her house at 2:00 PM instead of
1:00 PM on Friday.  Do you need directions?

Cynthia,

I have been having trouble finding Kim.  Do you have her phone numbers?  and
her e-mail address?

We are putting together the Saturday dinner and I have been out of town, so
somehow we lost each other last week.  Any help would be great.

Thanks, Phyllis
