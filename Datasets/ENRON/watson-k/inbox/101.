Lorna,

Thanks for the information you provided!

Here is an outline for reporting format purposes. 

I have added some additional points that should have impact to TW and or NNG (interconnect and delivery points).  Some of the other points are constraint points on the system. Do you have an idea as to how to break them out by category differently from how they are?

Also, I was wondering what points the Keystone West and Waha Del include in the ENA format?

Some additional types of information to potentially include are highlighted in yellow.

Any suggestions on additional points or further information you would like to see would be appreciated.  This will be a work in progress!!  

Thanks for your help and call me if you have any questions.

Theresa
