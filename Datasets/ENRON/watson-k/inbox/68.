Effective August 16th, 2001, the ETS Deal Capture Team will help process all firm agreements on TW.  All requests for firm service should continue to go to Michelle or Dennis for the base agreement processing; however, the Marketer should complete and forward a deal sheet (attached) for completion of the discount amendment and for us to obtain the appropriate approvals.  Deal Capture will also tender the agreements and hand partially executed deals to Contracts for activation.  As time permits, we will reconstruct the TW Firmbook listing of all active agreements by production month.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks!

Craig
