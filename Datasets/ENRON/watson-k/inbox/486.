DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.


Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and "J.S. Polk" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!
