Kim, as per Gaylen's phone message, I have attached the Confidentiality Agreement for the third party's signature.  Please have them sign if you're planning to bring them to the Data Room or if you plan on divulging confidential information to them.
Thank you for your help in this matter.  Please call Gaylen or myself if you have any questions.
