As part of the 2002 Plan process, we have been looking at the total costs for Revenue Management in order to verify the amounts that have been and will be amortized.  I have attached a spreadsheet in which I have summarized all the costs that I know about.  It looks like the total expenditures have exceeded the total budget by over a million dollars.

Could you please review my numbers, and see if I've missed anything.

Thanks.
