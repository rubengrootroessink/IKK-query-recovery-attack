Morgan,

=09I have to disagree with the "they were available by phone."  Being out o=
f the office for "Team Building" on the last day of the month is inexcusabl=
e.  I tried calling Perry and there was no answer; he said he forgot and le=
ft his phone on vibrate.  The Omaha capacity people now carry text pagers t=
hat I can email info to; they have really improved their response.  The Hou=
ston staff needs these pagers too.  Capacity approval on TW is probably our=
 weakest link in the process.  We really need your help to improve this or =
drastic action will be needed.  When I called at 3 pm to get a last second =
deal, I didn't get called back until 3:30 pm.  I was told they could be bac=
k in the office to approve the deal around 6 pm.  Well, even though I was h=
ere until 7 pm, Reliant wasn't going to be.  Perry said he could do it Satu=
rday, once again, Reliant (or someone who can sign contracts) wasn't.  The =
TW Marketers, all of them, were also out of the office making EVERYTHING fa=
ll onto Contracts.  Why are we the only one's that need to be in the office=
?  I'm going to give this one more month and then, if everyone isn't workin=
g together on this, I'm going to Danny and tell him the Deal Capture team i=
s off of TW since no one appears to give a rats ass (and this is after I've=
 calmed down over the weekend).  Speaking to the Contract Group, this is fa=
r from the first time these guys weren't available.

Rick-

Obviously we need to be available at all times.  We cannot guarantee one of=
 those people will be in the office at all times, but we will be available =
via cell phones or pagers.  Actually, when you guys got hold of me on Frida=
y, I had no problem contacting both Perry and Eric, nor did I have any prob=
lem contacting the NNG guys at their off-site last week.  Do be sure when y=
our guys call the office extensions, they listen to (rather than by-passing=
)  the entire greeting, as contact information may be available on that gre=
eting.

I will be sure that the process is evaluated on this end.

Morgan,=20

What's going on?  Earlier this week, the NNG capacity approvers were both o=
ut of the office and today, both of the TW capacity approvers are out of th=
e office.  We are trying to get two TW "rush" contracts through this aftern=
oon and their unavailability is making it very difficult.

We need you to work on an emergency back up coverage plan for bid-week acti=
vity.  At a minimum, your team needs to start carrying pagers.

Doug Aschwege & Bob Johnson will be out of the office tomorrow (9/26/01) fo=
r training and will not be available for any capacity approvals (except eme=
rgencies) until Thursday.  Good (facility) planning guys... did Morgan plan=
 this?
