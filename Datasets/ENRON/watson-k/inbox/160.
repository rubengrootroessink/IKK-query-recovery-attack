Michael,

In reference to our conversation of today, Perfomance Bond language will be forwarded for our review as a possible alternative in support of the subject project. Also it is our understanding that Kemper Insurance would be the proposed issuer of the bond.

My telephone number is 713-853-6409 and Fax number is 713-646-3368.

Thanks.
