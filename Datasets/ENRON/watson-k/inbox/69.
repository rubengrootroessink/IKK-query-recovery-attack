Auto forwarded by a Rule

Test Schedule as follows:
1) Stable Operation at Minimum load:     HE 7:00 to HE 10:00
2) Stable Operation at Base Load:  HE 13:00 to HE 15:00
3) Steam Turbine Trip:             HE 19:00
4) Plant Shutdown             HE 19:00

Note: DETM can call for more or less MW throughout the day between tests as
needed.

The plant shutdown will last for approximately 3 days. The scope of work is
a subset of the previous planned outage worklist.   Another plant shutdown
will be required later to remove Steam Turbine strainers and to complete
the other outage list tasks.
