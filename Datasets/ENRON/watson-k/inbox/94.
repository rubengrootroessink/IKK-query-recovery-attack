Returned a call to Citizens late Friday evening and they were wanting to speak with Ben Tanner (Measurement Specialist out of Roswell).  Ben takes care of the RTU configurations for TW so I think Citizens was wanting to pick his brain or ask for assistance.  Both turbines at Griffith are now online as you probably know.....

Ugh! You were right, I removed it from below.  
I spoke at length with Russ on Friday and I also spoke with Laura Kunkel.  Laura indicated that the gains were adjusted in RTUs last week by Citizens/Griffith personnel which cased the shutdown.  There seems to be some other RTU programming issues that need to be addressed that Laura has mentioned.  They (Trigon-Sheehan) are considering a third party to write/recommend a new RTU file to operate controls.  Stay tuned, more to come.  EF
