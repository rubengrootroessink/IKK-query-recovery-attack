Her e:mail address is vvmundhenke@hotmail.com      The first two letters of her e:mail are v v, not w as it look.  It stands for Virgil and Verla.  She said they are having trouble with their e:mail a lot this last week.  Her phone number is (h) 011-39-081-524-9954, (c) 011-39-347-886-2085.  By the way, her birthday is Thursday the 20th if you talk to her!

Good luck.

Sue

Sue,

Have you talked to your mom since last week?  I would like to visit with her by phone or email about what her views/opinions are of the local viewpoints of the WTC tragedy.  May I have her phone number and email address again?  

Thanks, Kim.
