Kim,

We will be running assessments again soon, and we really need to get this caught up.  Do you have a cost center to transfer this to yet?

Thanks,
Diane

I am so sorry I don't have an answer for you yet.  Transfer the normal amount for the other pieces that we have agreed to.  I talked with Dan McCarty's secretary today (Danny is our Managing Director) and she is booking me some time with both Eric Gadd and Danny to finalize this.  I will get back with you in a couple weeks.  

Thank you for your patience!  Kim

I hate to nag, but have you had a chance to look at this?  Because of GPG's early close, this must be run today.

Kim,

We will need to have allocations from the research group ready to run by Friday and I wanted to check with you to see whether the "to be determined" amounts on the attached allocation spreadsheet had been determined yet.  If possible, I would like to catch up amounts from prior months.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Diane
