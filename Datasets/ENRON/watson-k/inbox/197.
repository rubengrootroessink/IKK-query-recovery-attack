WARNING:  Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program

This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.  We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.  We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.

In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.  Compaq customers affected by this recall and replacement program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC adapter for each recalled adapter.  These AC adapters were distributed worldwide in notebooks, as separate options, and as replacement spares for the following notebooks:
 
?          Armada M300
?          Armada 100s
?          Armada M700
?          Armada 110
?          Armada E500
?          Prosignia 170
?          Armada E500s
?          Prosignia 190
?          Armada V300
?          Notebook 100
?          Armada 3500
 
This recall and replacement program involves AC adapters made by only one of the multiple manufacturers used by Compaq; thus, not every notebook computer listed above will be affected by the recall.  The affected AC adapters can be identified by the adapter Model Series Number located directly under the Compaq Computer Corporation name on the AC adapter label.  
 
?          Model Series PPP003SD 
?          Model Series PPP003
?          Model Series PP2012
