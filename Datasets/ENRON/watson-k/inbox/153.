Dear All,

   This is Youyi from Hong Kong who misses all of you.
I am sorry for not contacting you earlier because of loss
of your contacts. Everything is fine to me in Hong Kong now
except for a big shock for the terror attack on WTC and Pentagon.
If you find out a chance of visiting Hong Kong, please give me
a call at (852)2609-8242 (O) or (852)2994-3485 (H). I will be
very happy to have a gathering with you.

Cheers,

Youyi
