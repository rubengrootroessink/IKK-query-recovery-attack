Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk
