It's not Pauline; it's Lad's group.  I will call Pat Davidson or get with you, Darrell to call David Taylor.

TK,

What are your thoughts on resolving this?  Would it help for you to talk to Pauline?  How can we assist Darrell in this?

Thanks, Kim.

FYI

As of 11/11/01 SoCal's oba is a receivable of 358,416 mmbtus.  I know that we do not control the Needles point; however ????

SoCal's oba remains volumetric and a drop in index prices would cause a large dollar hit.
