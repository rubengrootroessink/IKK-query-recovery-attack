Dennis has asked me to follow up on this project.
Please send me an e-mail explaining the project in terms of the location of this gas, Sid's operating pressure& volume conditions. Is this going to be a receipt or delivery at TW's system?. Are you requesting for a scope and cost estimate to tie this gas to TW ?

Thanks,
Mansoor
