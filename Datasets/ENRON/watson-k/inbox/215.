Pam:

As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.  It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.  

Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.  Please advise status and date of expected delivery.

Thank you for your assistance.
