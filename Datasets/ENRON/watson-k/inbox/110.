All,

Today, I learned that Kinder Morgan has approached FERC with a proposal to =
submit separate applications on phase one (NM, AZ) and phase two (CA) of th=
e Sonoran Pipeline.  Reportedly, FERC rejected the approach, advising KM to=
 come back when they could make an application on the full project.  This p=
robably delays their filing timetable because the California leg will be si=
gnificantly more difficult to market, environmental stakeholders are likely=
 to be more adversarial, and the probability of activist NIMBY landowners i=
s high.

Does anybody know when KM plans to file their application?  Is Phase one in=
-service of summer 2003 feasible if an application for the full pipeline is=
 required?  How long would it take KM to prepare the phase two application =
for the Sonoran project?

Please keep this info confidential.  Also, it would be helpful if you could=
 corroborate through your sources.   =20

Danny,

Today, Kevin and I met with Scott Parker (KMI), Ron Brown (KMI), and Chad D=
riscoll (Calpine) to discuss possibilities of bundling Kinder Morgan's Sono=
ran project with Sun Devil.  A summary of our discussions is outlined below=
.

Concept

Explore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline pro=
jects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San =
Juan to the California Border.  Progress separate projects for service to P=
hoenix (Sun Devil) and California (Sonoran).

Rationale

Lower costs, higher margins
Greater capacity, economic scale, expansion options
Reduced stakeholder interventions (Navajos, environmental interests groups,=
 shippers)
Reduced regulatory process

Background

On May 2, 2001, Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo=
p the Sonoran Pipeline, subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter=
est by potential shippers.  As proposed, the Sonoran pipeline will be a 1,1=
60 mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas=
in in northern New Mexico to markets in California.  The project, with an e=
stimated cost of $1.8 billion, will provide natural gas transportation capa=
city to California to serve growing electric generation demand. =20

The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases.  The f=
irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t=
he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B=
ay area. =20

The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o=
f 2003.  Phase one will consist of a 460 mile, 36 inch diameter pipeline fr=
om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P=
ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan, NM.  In addition, =
the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the California/Ari=
zona border.  A 20 mile, 24 inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock,=
 AZ.  The initial capacity would start with 750,000 dth/d, with capability =
to expand to 1 million dth/day.  The estimated cost of phase one is $624 wi=
th a targeted in-service date of summer 2003.  Sponsors said the open seaso=
n will seek at a minimum, 20-year term commitments at a fixed transport rat=
e of $0.39/dth for firm transportation.  Sonoran proposes to charge shipper=
s actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker.  Fuel is estimated at 1.3%. =
 More than 1 billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and non-bindi=
ng expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project=
. =20

Phase two will be a 590 mile, 42 inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the=
 California border to points within California, terminating near Antioch in=
 Contra Costa County.  Once completed, the pipeline will be able to transpo=
rt between 1 million and 1.5 million dth/day.  The in-service date for the =
phase two has yet to be determined.  The cost is projected to be $1.1 billi=
on.   Another 1.5 Bcf/d of non-binding commitments and expressions of inter=
est were received for phase two. =20

Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for =
400,000 dth/d for phase one and another 500,000 dth/d for its phase two. On=
ce completed, the new pipeline could connect with Kern River, Mojave, Elk H=
ills, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Gas and various gas-fir=
ed power plants. =20

SoCalGas's Residual Load Service (RLS) penalty woull not affect the Sonoran=
 project because the pipeline route parallels PG&E's pipelines and the prim=
ary target load is new gas-fired generation not within SoCalGas's market te=
rritory.=20

The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near L=
odi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of Houston base=
d Western Hub Properties LLC. =20

The project could have a noteworthy co-owner: the Navajo Nation, the sovere=
ign government of 180,000 residents on the largest Indian reservation withi=
n the United States.  An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an owne=
rship interest in the $1.7 billion pipeline that crosses their reservation =
was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy 2=
001, a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted=
 the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West.  As part of the =
deal to secure that right of way, the Navajo Nation would invest in the pro=
ject and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens.  The deal wou=
ld be structured to limit the tribe's exposure to risks during the construc=
tion phase of the project.  Gas from the pipeline could also fuel a propose=
d Navajo-owned power plant on the reservation.  Red Cedar Gas Gathering, wh=
ich is jointly owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Kinder Morgan mad=
e arrangements with the Navajo Indians.

Kinder Morgan is not interested in expanding the equity participants in the=
 Sonoran Pipeline.

Next steps

Kinder Morgan to evaluate providing facilities to serve TW open season mark=
ets (SJ, Phoenix, California) along proposed Sonoran Pipeline route and com=
e back to ETS with a proposal (operating lease, undivided interest, no ship=
per contractual arrangements).=20
