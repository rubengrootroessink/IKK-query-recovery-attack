Kim-
I just heard that all is going good with the appeal.
They are going to be back at it tomorrow afternoon.
Once appeal has been made, then ACC has until Nov 26th to return approval/no
approval.
Should not take that long, however.
I will keep you posted.
Kirk

Kirk,

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point
Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will
have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let

Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!
