We don't need anything at the moment.

Steve,  I just stopped in the office on my way out to the airport and saw this.  I will call you on Monday to discuss so we can give it to Danny quickly.  Will Danny also want something similar on Questar?

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Danny wants to compile and asset development activities in one section for purposes of the upcoming business review with Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley.  I've developed a standard template for my projects (Alaska Highway, Sun Devil, Heat Recovery) and propose you do same for TransPecos.  Here's a rough draft for your consideration.  Please complete and return to me at your earliest convenience, preferably before Monday, close of play.

Thanks-

Eric
