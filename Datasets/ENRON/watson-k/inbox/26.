Kim,
Here is the WSCC report from ENA on status of new generation facilities.
The status on EAMR is that I am in the process of finalizing the writeup on power plant services that I promised you a copy of.
We have been working very closely with John Dushinske's group on 3 new projects off of NNG where EAMR would potentially build or provide services for new laterals to new power plants.  The projects are Lincoln Electric System (6.5 miles), Omaha Public Power (<1 mile) and Mid American (12 miles).
On LES, the customer went out with an RFP for the design, ROW and construction management only.  On OPP, Chuck Wilkinson is his proposal to the customer gave 3 options: 1) NNG builds and owns with customer paying overheads and tax gross up, 2) NNG rolls project into rates (cost still includes overheads but no tax gross up) and 3) customer owns and EAMR builds and possibly operates facility.  The proposal for OPP is similar to MidAm. 
We have found that options 1) and 2) are fast and easy because Level A cost estimates can be used, however, for option 3, a much more detailed bid is required which is sort of like a Level B+ estimate, which is more detailed than normal Level B estimates.  We are working through the process and various issues for option 3.  To get definitive bids for option 3, a 30 to 45 day lead time is required.
This ground work for NNG will come in handy on TW projects.
