No magic to the 9%.  We could use any reasonable rate as long as we are con=
ceptually consistent in future situations.  I.e.,  we could use the FERC in=
terest rate here if we were willing to always use it in contract terminatio=
n situations.  Or, if we use a rate here that is X basis points over some g=
enerally accepted benchmark (FERC interest rate? prime?  LIBOR?) we'd have =
a tough time justifying use of a significantly different mechanism (even th=
ough the actual rate in the subsequent deal might be a lot different due to=
 interest rate movement).  df=20

We should give Maverix the option of paying the discounted sum up front or =
doing a keep whole payment each month of the transaction.    I like the 9% =
discount rate for Maverix but would not be happy with such from an outsider=
.    Is there a basis in the 9% rate?

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement =
under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation=
 contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue s=
hortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer a=
t the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows T=
W to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financi=
al risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release =
them from their contract obligations without penalty. =20

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the =
TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance th=
at a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came fr=
om.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that =
 "capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons inc=
luding contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR=
 rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as=
 soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity."  If the questioning=
 customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent =
policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any =
other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, =
if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, t=
he confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should=
 be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants m=
ore detail, is that "Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business =
of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business an=
d terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract terminati=
on subject to an indemnity or "keep whole" mechanism."=20

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow=
 up on this later today.  DF=20
