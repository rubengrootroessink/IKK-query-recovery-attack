Kimberly,  I'm sorry I missed the conference call regarding Gallup Power yesterday.  I understand you have assigned one of your staff to review the Gallup power contract.  I would like to work closely with that individual to make sure my power peak model matches the contract interpretation.

I am not certain I've got the latest version of the contract.  My copy is dated 7/17/2000.
