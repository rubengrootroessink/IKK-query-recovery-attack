I was really dragging after working 3 weekends in a row on merger and then loan documents, research, etc.  7 days a week work, and 12 to 14 hour days, is not conducive to good health or good mental attitude, etc.  But T-giving, we were off, which was great, so I feel much better today.  

How are you?  Hope you have not been too overloaded and that TW is going great guns!  Take care!

--Dot

	Security found purse & briefcase around 11 pm last night -- someone on 49 had taken it to their cubicle; I guess they 
	were waiting for someone to show up asking about it, but then they left or went to a meeting, and weren't there when 
	we were asking all around the floor.  Anyway, new lease on life -- I have everything back!  (Makes for a better Thanks-
	giving, you know!)

	I have been trying to call her but keep getting voice mail; that's why I wrote you.  Since then, I finally got her.  Thanks!

	Hope you and John have a great Thanksgiving too!

Hi Dot.

Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see 
what she says.

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)
