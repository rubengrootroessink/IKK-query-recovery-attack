Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton
