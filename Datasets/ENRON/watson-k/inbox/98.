Kim,

I think our emails passed in the night.

You should be getting a note with dial in numbers for tomorrow's call.  From the address list you can see several Houston folks that will be on it.  People may want to share an office, but I have not set anything up.  There are enough ports for everyone to call individually if they want.


John
