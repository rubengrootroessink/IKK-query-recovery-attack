Kim,

The book should reflect that as long as the spread is positive we will be l=
ong actual fuel multiplied times the Dynegy volume.  If the spread covers f=
uel, we will be long the Dynegy volume plus the additional volume. (approxi=
mately 20,000).

Subject:=09Fuel Risk on Index to Index Deals

Steve and Dave,

As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about=
 what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index =
deals.  Here are my thoughts...

For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San =
Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 c=
ould impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for t=
his transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi=
ll have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approxima=
tely 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over co=
llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have so=
mething less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio=
n.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assum=
e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 =
MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5=
,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that =
we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seaso=
nally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The rema=
ining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to=
 provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. =20

It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d o=
f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where =
Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually bu=
rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers=
 who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind f=
uel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actu=
ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not ha=
ve additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not=
 have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity los=
s on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on=
 their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that=
 we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provide=
d by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this part=
icular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash p=
rices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a pri=
ce that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunit=
y loss. =20

Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agre=
e that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow? =20

Thanks, Kim.
