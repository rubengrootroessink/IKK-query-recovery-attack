Hello.
       It's time again to take a 'head count' and be clear just who is coming
to dinner on Nov. 2.  We looked into the Haak winery and that's not an option
afterall, so Jim and I are holding the dinner at home.  We thought that
6:00pm might be better too.  So, we'd like to know for sure if you are
coming, so we can assign you a dish.  Please let us know ASAP if you will be
coming, and you'll receive a recipe.  Also, if you have a preference for a
course, please let me know.
       We're looking forward to having the Great Gourmands here in our home.
The theme is Creole and we've got a great selection of recipes from the
favorite restaurants in New Orleans.  So, let me know.
       We're looking forward to seeing you in November!
Be well,  Hattie & Jim
