I was deflated that my offer came in at flat bid, no signing bonus and no 1 year deal.  I'm still scheduled to meet with UBS to discuss.  No matter what, the news stories are disgusting me, so I'll probably take UBS, if only for washing machine effect.

My memory needs refreshing as I'm noticing curve type codes and risk type codes that I don't know.

Curve Type Code:
AP [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Price	 
AV [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Volatility 
BP [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Price 
BV [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Volatility 
PR [Keiser, Kam]  	Forward Price 
SP [Keiser, Kam]  	Settle Price	 
VO [Keiser, Kam]  	Volatility 

Book type code:
D [Keiser, Kam]  	Basis 
I [Keiser, Kam]  	Index	 
M [Keiser, Kam]  	intra-month and gas daily 
P [Keiser, Kam]  	price	 
X [Keiser, Kam]  	Exchange 

I should probably be shot for forgetting this stuff, but your help will be appreciated.
Thanks
Frank
