Kam, 

I only have the notes that I took while Chance was training me. They are detailed as well, but I don't have them in Excel. Chance probably has his Excel copy - I'm not sure if that's the same that Chuck made.

Biliana,

Do you have a copy of the detailed procedures that Chuck prepared for the morning reports?  I am looking for a copy in excel if you have them.
