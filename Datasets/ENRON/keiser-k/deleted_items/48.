Cecilia,

The Chicago books have been deleted.  There will be no trading out of the Chicago office.  The PB-West10 GCP id is 167143.  Let me know if I can help in any other way.  Thanks.

John

John,

I checked the book list and there are 2 missing:

FB-CHICAGO
PB-CHICAGO

Please provide me the GCP ids.  Also you have 2 PB-WEST10 listed on your spreadsheet and please advise which id is the final.

I'll update the id on our side once I hear from you.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Cecilia,

Attached you will find an updated listing out the GCP id's that we will be using.  These will also be the same GCP id's used by EOL on the gas side.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  

John
