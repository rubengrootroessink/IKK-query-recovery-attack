Building on the success of Infocast's recent Building New Nuclear Power Plants event, New Nuclear Power Plant Technology will explore in greater detail the reactor and other technologies that could be used in the next generation of nuclear power plants. The schedule will provide a half day on each major reactor class envisioned (advanced boiling water, high temperature gas-cooled, and pebble bed modular reactors), giving attendees an unprecedented opportunity to compare the technical features, potential costs, infrastructure needs, development risks, and performance traits of these technologies. The conference will also provide in-depth examinations of the issues surrounding the development of new nuclear technologies, the role of supporting technologies such as control room automation, and safety and licensing concerns.
