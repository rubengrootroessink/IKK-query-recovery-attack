Kam,

It can be done either way, depending on your need. Those directories can be made available for both Estate and NetCo or only for one of them. You need to let us know how you want to be done. Currently, we are assuming that everything need to be accessible from both Estate and NetCo.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Z,

We have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with Netco.  Will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them, or will copies be made so both groups could use the files?  If not, we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already.


Thanks

Kam
