Jeff,

We won't be moving the physical deals this weekend.  Russ spoke with logistics, Kim Olinger, and she said they won't be able to schedule gas until they create new capacity tickets and that may take a while.  I left a message with Bob Superty to get his help with this on Monday.  If they can get their stuff done Monday Russ can have the deals moved that night.
