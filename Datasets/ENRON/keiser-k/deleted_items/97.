My memory needs refreshing as I'm noticing curve type codes and risk type codes that I don't know.

Curve Type Code:
AP [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Price	 
AV [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Volatility 
BP [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Price 
BV [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Volatility 
PR [Keiser, Kam]  	Forward Price 
SP [Keiser, Kam]  	Settle Price	 
VO [Keiser, Kam]  	Volatility 

Book type code:
D [Keiser, Kam]  	Basis 
I [Keiser, Kam]  	Index	 
M [Keiser, Kam]  	intra-month and gas daily 
P [Keiser, Kam]  	price	 
X [Keiser, Kam]  	Exchange 

I should probably be shot for forgetting this stuff, but your help will be appreciated.
Thanks
Frank
