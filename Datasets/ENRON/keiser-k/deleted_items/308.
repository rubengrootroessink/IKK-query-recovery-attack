Thanks for the notes.  Monday will be the last time we calculate our books, all deals have been moved to the NG-Price book this weekend so don't worry about taking out those columns.  
 
Have fun on your days off.

Kam,
 
Not sure who will be running the highly acclaimed Rox-Mgmt book in my absence, so i thought i'd just send some info to you.  
 
Use the copy post id icon on my desktop.  Login = mgmt-rox.  When the id's copy, you will have to go to the gas daily index post id's for ft-pge and mgmt-west (i think its those 2, its the last 2 id's on the sheet), for some reason the liquidation is turned on, just change it to 0.  Make sure the fiz dates are correct.
 
I do not use meta calc, so each id will need to be calced and officialized in port calc individually.  sorry.  
 
For weapon X, the directory is in H, the folder is called something like !weapon X, should be the first folder in the H directory.  WACOG is 2.175.
 
Transport number to be entered into the P&L is Leg 83, called "West/Allen" on the transport model.  0's should be entered in for both the mgmt-west and wc-rox basis options.
 
Hedge strips should be fine.  Print out the "WC-ROX" and "MGMT-WEST" sheets, don't worry about the "MGMT - NO OPTION" sheet.  
 
i think thats about it...  i wanted to talk to you when i get back on wednesday about maybe taking some columns out of my p&l.  i.e. the basis options and mgmt-west index and gd index.  i figure now is a good time to do stuff like that.  Then again, maybe its not worht the trouble if we'll be setting up all new stuff if we get bought.  I mean when.  When we get bought.
 
though i won't be at work monday and tuesday, i will be in/around Houston, and accessible by mobile phone or pager.  Feel free to contact me if you need to, really, its ok.
 
Thanks,
-randy
