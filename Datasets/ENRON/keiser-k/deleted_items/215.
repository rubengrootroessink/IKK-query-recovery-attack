GNSS as a long candidate.=20

GNSS gaps over resistance at 70 so the move constitutes a breakout. BRCM di=
d the same thing today taking resistance at 50. a close beneath the 13-day =
EMA constitutes the roving cautionary flag as GNSS has had an excellent rel=
ationship with the 13-day EMA since the green bar birthed in november. GNSS=
 has not closed beneath the 13-day EMA since. so the 13-day EMA is the yard=
stick.=20

waiting i am for the next julianna hatfield concert! unfortunately the best=
 thing to be had at the local casino of choice is Styx.=20
