kam,
 
i appreciate you letting me be out today on such short notice.  i'll be in tomorrow.  if you need info or anything from me, you can call my cell phone up to about 4 oclock, i'll be on the road.
 
i was working on that project for hal mckinney with james, but it was at a standstill pending them figuring stuff out about oracle odbc drivers... if it gets fixed, and he needs someone to continue testing while i'm out, i have access to that folder on my pc (O:\erms\docs\xl_estate).  
login:  rbhatia
password:  !bellagiolv!
 
i was helping ashley fay with the performance book yesterday as well, but i think she can manage it fine without me.
 
thanks again, see you tomorrow.
