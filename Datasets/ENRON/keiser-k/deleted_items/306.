Good morning,

This is the plan for today.

Over the weekend the IT group moved the remaining deals to the NG-price book.
This morning, copy and recalculate your post-id's from Friday, run a forwards detail (and options detail) to make sure your books have no deals in them.  If they do, let me know and we'll move those manually to NG-Price.
Once your books are completely empty, you can calc. those for tonight's P&L and officialize (no need to wait for curves anymore).
We will still have physical deals in all books for a few more days so you will still have to wait for physical curves to come out at night.

Transport model - I want to combine all transport pieces into one P&L (WC-Cal) starting tonight.
All other books, if you had a piece prior to today, make that zero tonight (term and intra-month)


We won't be doing much over the next week or two so this is a great time to ask questions.  If there is anything you guys would like to learn more about, please let me know.

Thanks

Kam
