Debbie,

The credit committee needs to get some information from us that I could use your help with.  Can I get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and I will format it from there.  The information they need to see are the counterparty name, cash flows (MTM value) and positions.
As always, they need it by 11:00 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with I would appreciate it. 

Thanks

Kam
