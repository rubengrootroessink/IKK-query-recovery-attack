Kam, 

I think I may have deleted those notes about the morning reports.  Bruce, Brad and PLove all had copies of that stuff.  I'll check with my home computer and see if I still have a copy there.  I'll email it to you tonight if I do.  

Chuck

Chuck,

I know you made some extremely detailed notes for the morning reports but I can't seem to find anyone down here that has them.  Do you still have a copy saved you could send me?
