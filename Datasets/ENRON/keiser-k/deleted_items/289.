Kam -

I want all the regional portfolio codes to be the same.  One for price, Basis, Index, Gas Daily.  A different one for physical.

And then a seperate one on the financial desk.  Let me know if you disagree.

Have you started to set up any new books for NetCo. yet?

Do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier?
Also, I think we should have some consistency in book names (make them more descriptive).  any other suggestions?
