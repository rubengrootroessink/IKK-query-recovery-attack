Hi

I have removed you from our subscription list, as you requested. This may take up to 24 hours to process, so it is possible that you will receive up to two more messages. You have complete control over the emails you receive from ClearStation; to disable the emails (or to enable them again at a later time):

1. Go to FOCUS and then Customize (on the top line of the ClearStation nav bar).

2. Under the "Email Subscriptions" heading, uncheck the box for the list you wish to unsubscribe.

3. Click on "Apply Changes" at the top to save the changes.

Let me know if you have any other questions or need any help with this!

Regards,

Debbie
ClearStation Support
