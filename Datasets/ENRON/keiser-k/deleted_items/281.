Kam:

Regarding your question about having 1 Gas book (i.e. 1 portfolio/book code combination) with multiple org. regions vs. having multiple books 
with the same org. region (e.g. DESK), in terms of PortCalc performance, there is no difference between the 2 setups.

As you said in your voice mail, having one portfolio/book code combination provides more flexibility in terms of defining PortCalc mini-books.

Please keep in mind that Canadian-logic deals require separate Price/Index, GasDaily and Physical Intramonth books.

Thanks,
Jeremy
