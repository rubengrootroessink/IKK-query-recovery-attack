Kam,

Per my voice mail, I believe that Sean Riordan is no longer with Enron, so I am not sure who might handle his function.  Just to follow up, I believe that the below deals should change accordingly...

Deal		Current CP			Should Be CP
927642		Coral Energy Canada, Inc.	Coral Energy Resources, L.P.
848014		Coral Energy Resources, L.P.	Coral Canada U.S., Inc.
851409		Coral Energy Resources, L.P.	Coral Canada U.S., Inc.

Please advise when complete or who might be able to assist.

Thanks,

Scott Dozier
