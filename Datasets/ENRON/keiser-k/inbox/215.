Bill,

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short name and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871, 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I will be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as voice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks.


John
