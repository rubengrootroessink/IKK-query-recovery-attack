I spoke to Debbie Brackett about Risktrac.  She let me know that the NETCO version is not ready yet.  They ran into some issues on Friday.  Is 10 in the morning tomorrow ok for you to meet with me, Debbie, and possibly either Stacy or Casey?

Ok, once that is done, we need to set up the RMS access query to extract the new VaR and dump it in the positions by trader spreadsheet.

No, they are not.  Risktrac DB not set up for NETCO.  Jeff just talked to me.  He wants it all done by Friday.  Will do.  Just can't take excuses anymore from idiots and need to go around them.

Do you know if all of our books are set up and ready to go in risktrac, ready to report VaR?
