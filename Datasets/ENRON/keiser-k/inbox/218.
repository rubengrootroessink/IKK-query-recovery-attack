>When it was the new boy, Kenny's turn, the teacher gave him a candy

>She asked "Do you know what it is?" Kenny replied "No"
>The teacher said, "Go ahead and open it up and taste it." Little Kenny
>did so.
>The teacher then asked, "Now do you know what it is?" Little Kenny said
>"Nooooo."
>The teacher said, "I"ll give you a hint...it is something your daddy
>wants from your mommy every morning before he goes to work." A little
>girl in the back of the class jumps up and screams "KENNY, SPIT IT
>OUT......... IT'S A PIECE OF ASS."
