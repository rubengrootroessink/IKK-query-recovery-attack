Subject: Common Data Migration for Netco



To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.  

Thanks, 
Mike Croucher
