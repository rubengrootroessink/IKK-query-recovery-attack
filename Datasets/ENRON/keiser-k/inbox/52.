These are the official post-id's from Dec 31st for all live deals. We didn't have a "performance" book until January.   I included Canada and EMW at the bottom if needed.

Do y'all know when the books will be final for December - I had hopes of being able to utilize the people going to UBS, so if you can give me a status I would appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa
