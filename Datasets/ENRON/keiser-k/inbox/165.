If you are responsible for developing a merchant power project or managing a merchant power portfolio you should attend Infocast's Merchant Power Development Institute. This intensive, five-day technical course will give you the tools and practical knowledge to successfully develop a merchant power project. It will show you the pitfalls of many unsuccessful projects, taking into account the critical factors that successful developers use in assessing a project and structuring a development. This course describes the techniques and approaches that should be used to establish go/no-go criteria for a development, to effectively allocate risk among project participants, and to structure a development that can get adequate financing.	   <http://www.pmaconference.com/imagesemail/id000037/id00003.gif>
