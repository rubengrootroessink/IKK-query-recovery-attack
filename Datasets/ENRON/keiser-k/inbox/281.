FYI regarding the Canadian Power Books.  I am also working on adding the trader contacts to all of the Canadian Books.

Yes, lets try to inform the same group on my E-Mail, also, I will find the status of the status of the Address Roles associated with Traders.  I will pull a report detailing all the Books that has been setup todate.  Just a reminder, we will continue to set the NETCO Group Link on all Books/DESKS/PORT FOLIOS and with the Canadian also add the NETCO Canadian.  We will try to further sub down to NETCO Canadian Power etc, this should help in the future.

Hi Bill,

I have completed the set-up of the power and additional gas books - do I need to inform anyone else other than those affected in this office?

Thanks again for your assistance.

Nikole
