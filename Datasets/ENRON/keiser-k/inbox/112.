Dear Jim & Barry,

We are getting info from gas and power.  We do have an issue with the inception to date P&L (see Chris's memo), and I'm also a bit concerned with the accuracy gas position reported to us of 5500 (short).  We've discussed it with Jeff's group and they have confirmed it, but it still seems a bit big to me.

Well keep working.

Best regards
