Hello Cora and Kam,
Kay says below in response to my e-mail below that the 2 deals shown should be PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If either of you can, please make the change in SITARA.  If someone else needs to do this, please let me know.
Thanks for the help.
Doug

Kay,

Please look at deals #1192611 & #1193243 for Jan 2002......should they be with PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation?
Or is PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. correct?

Please advise.
Thanks,
Doug
