Subject:	estate files

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\Benchmark\2002\Jan-02
O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\2002\0102\regions
O:\erms\Excel Queries\ (Netco will need a copy of these files moved with them)
O:\Transport\Central Transport\2002\Jan02
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\East
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\GD-Central
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\NY
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\NYMarket
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\Southeast
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\Texas
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\West
