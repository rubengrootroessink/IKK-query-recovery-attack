Hi Kam,
I was unable to mail the file. So I saved the file "4thRequest.xls" under o:\_drooxbox\kam. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards
Sanjeev

WT Cal has been added. Could you run those additional post-id's?  There are deals in the Aruba book so I'm not sure why you aren't picking those up.  The deals are listed below.
