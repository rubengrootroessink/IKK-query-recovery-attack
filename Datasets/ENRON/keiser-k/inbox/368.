The Texas Curves are located in:
O:\Global_Trading\Financial_Trading\Texas Trading\Curves Bass... The files are:
	ft_tx0326   			for shipchannel basis
	Waha_Perm_0326		for waha/permian basis
	IndexCurves			for physical index
	TexasNewStyle			for intramonth gas daily and physical 
	Texas Gas Daily Index Curves	for Y curves

Also for Bridgeline:
O:\Bridgeline\BRMS\Risk\Benchmark	for positions
O:\Bridgeline\BRMS\Risk\P & L		for p & l

I'll continue to think and forward anything I come up with... O

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\Benchmark\2002\Jan-02
O:\erms\erms_adm\firmtrad\2002\0102\regions
O:\erms\Excel Queries\ (Netco will need a copy of these files moved with them)
O:\Transport\Central Transport\2002\Jan02
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\East
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\GD-Central
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\NY
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\NYMarket
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\Southeast
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\Texas
O:\TDS\TDS Curve\Central\West
