Bill, 

The top half of the attached spreadsheet has already been set up.  However, we need to modify the previous request to include the additional two risk types mentioned below.  The bottom half of the list has yet to be set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

John

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

J.P.
