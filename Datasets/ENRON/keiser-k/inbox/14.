As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!  

Thanks!
