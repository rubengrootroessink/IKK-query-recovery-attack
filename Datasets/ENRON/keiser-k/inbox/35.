Jeremy,

Please make appropriate changes to the NETCO ERMS database for the following requests. What needs to be done is to delete all other curve entries in the egs_curve_def and egs_curve points and egs_pub_names which are not listed in the attached file. I will talk to you about it.

Thanks

Zhiyong

 Zhiyong,

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.


Thanks

Kam
