Kam,

I need your help on something.   I am trying to compile a listing of all reports that were being run by the Risk leads and Specialist on a daily basis for the estate.  If you could please give me a general idea of the daily reports that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip  or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate.  I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.  

Thanks
Luchas
