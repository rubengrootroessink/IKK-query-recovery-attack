Hi Kam,

Per your request, the books have been created in GCP, and the CP ID's are on the attached spreadsheets.

     
Please let us know if you need anything further.

Cheryl,

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

Kam
