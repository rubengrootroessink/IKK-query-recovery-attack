ETX was supposed to be Electronic Transaction.  An exchange is a regulated =
body - which we are not.
We should be careful not to use the word "exchange".  I know this sounds tr=
ivial - but it matters to legal.=20

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY TESTING SCHEDULE


Please review the progress report from Monday's regression test below.   It=
 was a success, and the goals were accomplished!  Thank you for your partic=
ipation!
All the issues should be resolved by now.  If you are aware of any open iss=
ues, please email me ASAP.
Invoices are being settled now, and we are starting the SAP testing for thi=
s afternoon.
=20
We need your testing help (again), with the following tests below.  These a=
re limited to ETX (the name formally known as EOL) entered deals only, but =
need to process to SAP.
Please review attached for those scheduled, and respond with any updates/ s=
ubstitutions.
=20
Wednesday 10:00am - 03:00pm
Test:  Mock-mock test - ETX deal entry only.
Purpose:  Perform a simulation of a 4 gas physical/ financial, 4 power phys=
ical/ financial transactions using (Reliant/ Duke/ Williams/ UBS Warburg En=
ergy/ Enron Canada).=20
Goals include:
    (1) Simulate processing ETX transactions before Thursday mock test
    (2) If the NT user id conversion goes through on 02/05 pm, use the new =
UBS Id's
    (3) Validate any systems changes from Monday/ Tuesday
=20

User involvement:  See attached schedule.   Please review and respond if an=
y changes are needed.
    Global data should be setup already given we will use existing counterp=
arties/ addresses/ contracts.
=20
The ETX deals will be entered by 10:30, and we need the participants to pro=
cess these downstream.

1305 UBS Warburg Energy LLC acting as agent for UBS AG, London Branch
11266 Enron Canada Corp (rename TBD eventually)
54979 Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.
64245 Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company
65268 Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
3015 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.

Thursday 09:00am - 05:00pm
Test:  Mock ETX test -  ETX deal entry only.
=20
Purpose:  The business is planning a mock trading session tentatively for 2=
/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The traders w=
ill be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. The origina=
tors will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accounts.  ETX e=
ntry should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am), however, we need to set=
tle these in the afternoon.
UBSW personnel will be monitoring the transactions from deal entry to SAP.
=20

User involvement:  See attached schedule.   Please review and respond if an=
y changes are needed.

We are requesting the same counterparties as above, but awaiting ETX's resp=
onse.  We would like this to go as smooth as possible.

Subject: PROGRESS REPORT - Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4th


Below is an end of day progress report on Monday's regression test.
=20
Summary: =20
We did complete as planned the 25 types of transactions, including global d=
ata setup, deal entry (EOL, Sitara, TDS, EnPower) scenarios.    EOL passed =
us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transaction=
s.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties=
, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settleme=
nt on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.
=20
From a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  I=
ncluding TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.
Errors reported include continued NT userid "pilot burn-in" issues, as well=
 as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'trunc=
ated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (=
regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated=
 and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.
=20

The goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'EN=
RON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=
cluding SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading sessi=
on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.
=20
=20
Accomplishments/  what worked?
1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data p=
rior was from mid December.
2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'
3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods t=
hat we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstrea=
m needed.
4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement
5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlemen=
t
=20
=20
What did not?
1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifyin=
g the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing t=
o test Tuesday.  =20
2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating =
into Unify (resolved).=20
3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, a=
nd will be addressed early Tuesday am.
=20
Focus on Tuesday
Given the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor =
the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till). =20
There is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref =
tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the int=
ercompany transactions created on Monday.
=20
Note:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Sh=
utdown.
