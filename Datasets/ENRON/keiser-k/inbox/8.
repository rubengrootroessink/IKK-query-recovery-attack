Kam and Jeff,

I updated all of the indexes changes on my end, but I cannot get a clear confirmation that Tagg has updated them on their end.  Can you please find out and let me know?  I would appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Dawn

Please see attached.  There is a before and after column for those products that will have index name changes.

Thanks
