Hal:
The following file appeared to work fine - \\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Hal\HS_FT-Wellhead.xls.

However, some of the other files had a data source message box (see below) appear when I hit the GRMS Macro:
Files that did not connect:
\\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Felicia\Copy of HS_IM-East-Gulf.xls
\\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Sanjeev\HS_IM-East-Mkt.xls
\\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Cecilia\HS_FT-EAST.xls
 
Let me know if this is expected.
Thanks,

I have copied the excel files from the following numbered folders to the O:\erms\Docs\XL_estate\  folder with the corresponding number.  As you convert files  to point to the estate please move the file to a folder with your name (in the same directory).  I will be asking for help testing from some people with Kam Keiser's group to test these files after conversion since they should be most familiar with how the excels should run.

Hal,
	the list below was identified by Kam Keiser as potential
	spreadsheets that needs to change.
	Contact kam keiser before you do the changes because
	they are using these spreadsheets and you might overwrite
	what they are doing, Or they might overwrite what you did.
