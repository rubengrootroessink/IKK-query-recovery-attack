Kam - please advise.  Also, keep in mind that I just created these books in risktrac today using "PERFORMANCE" as the book id and will have to re-create them due to the name change.  This "PERFORMANCE" book must be an old book that was created in ERMS but not Risktrac.

Before I reply to all, the shortname "PERFORMANCE" is already used on another record, do you have another preference?  I just added "BK" just to get the record in the system, but it can be changed.
