Hey, John.  I found out today that early next week (perhaps Monday or Tuesday) will be the time that we can get risktRAC running on your group's desktops.

They plan to migrate the user IDs for all Netco users over the weekend.  So this means by next Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning you should be able to run the Netco version of RisktRAC.

My group will be moved over to the new building by Monday, and once we are operational, we can be there to start training on RisktRAC.

I'll check with Ramesh and see if we can send out an update message to your entire group, thanks.
