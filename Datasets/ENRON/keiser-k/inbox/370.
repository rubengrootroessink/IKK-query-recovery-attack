Subject:	Mark to market values by deals

RUSSELL I DIAMOND 
Phone : (713) 345-7095 
Had requested that I should get in touch with you.

He has a list of 2491 deals that he wants Mark-to-market values for specific dates.
- Mark to market for Dec 11 for Deals that are on the Bankrupcy book
- Current mark to market for deals that are on the PG  book
- Current mark to market for deals on other books, other than the Bankrupcy book and the PG book

I told him that the mark to market values are on the forward detail and the option detail
report if you have the post_id.  He said that he does not know that post_id's for these
calcs. I don't have the post_id's either.

I have created a program for him last week and also spend the entire day yesterday
to give him what he needs and it still not what he wants because:
	- the post_ids that the program pick up is wrong.
	- values are duplicated because it uses several post ids
	- values are missing because it is the wrong post ids

Russell said that I have to provide the post_ids for these calcs.
I told him I can not do that because I don't know the post_ids either.

Francis
