There will be a seperate database for Netco and Estate. 
The attached file has all of the current mappings.   It can also be found in the O:/dropbox/Sitara
Any questions, just give me a call -  I am just waiting in the old building for a presentation to BP.

Russ,

Can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations.  We are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all "internal" curves.  We need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes.

We also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well.  Will sitara have a separate database for Netco and estate like TAGG will?
