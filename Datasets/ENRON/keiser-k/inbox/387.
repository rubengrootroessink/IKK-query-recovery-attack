This document illustrates what my group does, what I expect will be needed from my group in a new entity ("NewCo") and lastly what will be needed to wind down/sell the remaining businesses ("OldCo").

I believe that a risk controls group is needed as part of NewCo not only to issue consolidated reporting, but to perform analysis of risk data and maintain the analytic systems.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

 

Best regards
