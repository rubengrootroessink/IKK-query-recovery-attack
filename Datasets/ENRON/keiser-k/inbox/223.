Dawn already notified us the other day about this but nobody confirmed me what to use at that time.  I'll change the Tagg bridge program to read OLT instead of EOL today.

We need to stop calling the UBS online trades EOL.  We also need to change the downstream systems - especially the auto confirms to something other than EOL for the transaction ID - or anything else.  I spoke to Dave Forster about this and he suggested we use OLT (on-line-trade) and OLT transaction number.   

Unfortunately the new website for trading does not have an exciting name (www.ubswenergy.com) - so unlike EnronOnline - it does not stand out.  

I realize it may take some time to change everywhere in all the systems it says "Enron" - but as you know, we definitely need to do it wherever the customers are involved.
