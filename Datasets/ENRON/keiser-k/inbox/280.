I would suggest to make username and password variables and user input.

Thanks

Zhiyong

How do you want to handle constant connection strings where the username and password are included?
Ie.
Private Const ODBCstring As String = "ODBC;DSN=estermtt;DBQ=estermtt;UID=mbennet_pc;PWD=mbennet_pc"

However, DSN like egsprod and ermt will be invalid. In other words, we want to eliminate any chance of database cross-referrence. So, I think we do need to change the spreadsheets that have DSN such as egsprod and ermt in the code.

Thanks

Hal,
	I have noticed that all of the Excel Spreadsheets use DSNs to connect to the data source. No change needs to be made in the spreadsheet only on the client machine.

Thanks,

Randal

Hello,

I was just informed that you (lucky?) people may be available to help us convert the VBA in the many excel spreadsheets we have so that they work with the estate database(s) (estermtp, estrmsp, etc.).  Please call me or come by my desk for further instructions/explanations.

THANKS for your help,

Hal

I have copied the excel files from the following numbered folders to the O:\erms\Docs\XL_estate\  folder with the corresponding number.  As you convert files  to point to the estate please move the file to a folder with your name (in the same directory).  I will be asking for help testing from some people with Kam Keiser's group to test these files after conversion since they should be most familiar with how the excels should run.

Hal,
	the list below was identified by Kam Keiser as potential
	spreadsheets that needs to change.
	Contact kam keiser before you do the changes because
	they are using these spreadsheets and you might overwrite
	what they are doing, Or they might overwrite what you did.
