Hi Kam,

The additional books have been created per your request.  The CP ID's are attached on the spreadsheets.  The GCP report is also attached for your review.  Please let us know if anything further is required.

Attached are the original spreadsheets with additional book requests in yellow.  This should be the end, or close to it, for the Netco gas book requests.  As before, could I get the global id's once you are finished? 


Thanks, 

Kam
