Kam,  if new locations are discovered over the next few days that will probably be used in New Co please compile them into a list of new locations   We won't need the list until next week (I think).
We aren't going to add the items into the database until the NewCo version of the RMS database is setup.

Thanks again!

Kam, 

Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.

The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
I think the dropdowns will automatically update.

If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!
