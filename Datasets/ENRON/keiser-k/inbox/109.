Kam, 

Can you quickly review before I send this...



Regan and Jane,

This note is written to request the migration of data contained in path O:common/Erms/erms_adm/Netco to the Netco/UBS environment before the testing period commencing February 4, 2002.  This folder contains models/tools used by the Risk Management group to support the trading activity in Natural Gas.  We have support from Zhiyong Wei and Hal McKinney in the conversion of the data to reflect the Netco/UBS environment, and we are now asking that the directory in whole be moved to the Netco/UBS environment. Please contact me at 3-9686 if there are questions or concerns with this request.
