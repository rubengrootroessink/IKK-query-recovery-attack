John/Bill,

Canadian GD books (e.g.166860) are already set up in Tagg/Erms using MC.  Please continue to use MC for the GD books and use MK for the P/B/I books.

I'll update the book names on our side to reflect the changes.  And the P/B/I books will be created today.

Please let me know when the corrections are made.

Thanks,
Cecilia

John,

The Long and short name modifications are complete on the first request, the second request for the "new" books with the previous CP long/short names/contacts is also complete.

Bill,

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short name and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871, 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I will be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as voice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks.


John
