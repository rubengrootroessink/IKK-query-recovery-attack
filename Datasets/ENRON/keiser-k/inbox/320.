No. The reference date has expired, thus adhoc VaR returns zero for VaR numbers.

Hi Scott,

Could I get the Var calculation for Bridgeline for October, November and December month end?  You may have previously sent this to Adarsh Vakharia, but I am not able to access his files.

Thanks,

Susie

Hi Kam,

Please provide VaR calculation as of 7/31 and 8/31 for the Bridgline/HPL/Coal accrual positions.
