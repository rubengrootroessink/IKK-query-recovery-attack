Sounds good. I was thinking the same about a template in excel for a interim fix. Maybe one of the assistants knows who we would order the old tickets from. We could design new tickets with the duplicate feature they had. If an internal company (ie: The Image Center) produced them, we may have to go to a outside printer. Anyway, this is by no means urgent, but I believe it will eventually be a necessary cost of business.

Good question,

I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?
