In regards to the (5,500) BCF position reported for US Gas on 1/29, Kam indicated it is really in contracts.  As there are 100 contracts per BCF, the position should actually be (55) BCF.  Please make the appropriate conversion going forward.  

Kam- I also learned that there are 1,000,000 mmbtu's per BCF.
