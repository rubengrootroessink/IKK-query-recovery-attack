Ok. As I said, I think it starts at 1:30. I can come and pick you up for the
movie around 12:45 or 1pm. I want to say hi to the putty tats as well.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?

Mandi
