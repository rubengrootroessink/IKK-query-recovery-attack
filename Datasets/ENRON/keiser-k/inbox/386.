Kam,

below are the paths to all the files I used:

O:\Gas_Trad\Yr_2001\Dec-01\Gas Bench\BenchByTrader
O:\Gas_Trad\Yr_2001\Dec-01\Basis Bench\Basis_1201
O:\Gas_Trad\Yr_2001\Jun-01\Gas Bench\VAR DATA.xls
O:\ERMS\1Intra\1Report\2001\1201phy\Reports\Ngpl 1205
O:\ERMS\1Intra\West\Special\Dawn\Morning_Check
O:\ERMS\Controls\RMSData\~ORMSDBS97a
O:\Bench\Desk Positions\2001\Dec01\Desk Positions 1203

I wasn't able to copy the Access database into the new folder, because I don't have access to it.

We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.

Thanks

KK
