     Lisa Lees informed me that you would be able to get me copies of
forwards details for the attached Enron Online deals.  It is actually the
same list that I forwarded requesting deal tickets.  If you are unable to
provide forwards details for any of the listed items please let me know and
I will forward the request t the appropriate person.  If you have any
questions please contact me at X56955.  Thanks for all your help.(See
