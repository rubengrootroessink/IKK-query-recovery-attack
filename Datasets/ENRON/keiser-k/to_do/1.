Kam,

From time to time we need to change the executable that we use in PortCalc within EnPower for calculation.  New executables are developed to refine such things as option valuation, for example.

I will contact the IT folks that are responsible for this to include you in on the mail distribution for the latest PortCalc executable.  Just be aware that often we receive messages for simply testing of the executable, and other messages are to change the executable on a official basis.

The current path to the executable is:
/prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new

What you should do then is 1) launch Enpower, then 2) PortCalc.  3) Go to the menu at the top and select 'Tools', then 4) 'Set PortCalc EXE'.  You would then 5) change the dropdown menu labeled 'Set PortCalc Executable:' to the option 'Use Test PortCalc Exec in path below'.  6) You should copy the path to the executable (as listed in black above) and 7) paste into the textbox labeled 'Test PortCalc Exec (FULL PATH):'

That's all there is to it.  Of course, anyone running the calculation should be on the latest version of the executable. Let me know if you have any questions.

Can you relay this message to the Kimat or Kam and show them how to do this.

Thanks,

Dear Stacey,

	There are 2 Post IDs ( 13065, 13070) for the Simulated Trading using the default PortCalc executable. Please remind other people that the ProdFix ( or Stage ) executable should be used.    (     /prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new    )

	Thanks,


Norman.
