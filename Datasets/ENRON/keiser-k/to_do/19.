Attached are the recommended PIP forms for your "5" rated employees. Please complete the appropriate form and forward to me for review. I will be sending your completed form to legal for their review and will notify you once it has been approved. Additionally, I will be sitting in on your feedback and development plan meetings. Please contact me if you have any questions.
