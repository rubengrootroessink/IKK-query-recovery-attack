Please review this list and our proposed solutions.  I would like for us to provide the consolidated list to Jeff on Monday, 07/30, (since we have no staff meeting next week).  Let me know if you see any omissions.
 
1) Management skills
    * Enable employees to provide anonymous feedback to other desk controllers
    * Management class
 
2) Mentality/Dedication of employees
    * Spread projects around within desk
    * Know what your employees goals are and try to assist them in achieving those goals
    * Amex gift cards (from both Risk and Trading)
    * Spend 2 weeks with new employees investing our time in them to help them learn
    * Have more group outings
 
3) Manual processes
    * Attend IT meetings (Greg)
    * employee for Greg
 
4) Development of analytical skills
    * Use quizzes as a tool to identify areas where employees are deficient
    * Let group members teach each other  (I don't remember exactly what this point was...help me re-word it)
