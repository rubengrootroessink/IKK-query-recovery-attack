Jeff,

Here are the post-id's for you (or whoever) for Friday.  Ignore the CAN tab.  You should have access to these books, if not you can use my computer.  kkeiser & tamu96ddd on the right computer.

I may come in for the afternoon.  Let me know if you will need help for anything else, I'll come in.  There hasn't been anything going on except running mini-books for Russell Diamond.


See you later,

Kam
