Genaro, we restructured the deal effective with November deliveries.  I have a copy of the document if you need it.  Phillip Love and Kam Keiser are familiar with the deal if they can help.  The customer is correct in their pricing.

Frank/Scott,

Are either of you handling deal # 22957 (sell to TBG Cogen)? There is a price discrepancy for Nov. 2001.

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro
