Then who is my strongest person? I do not know anything about Kristen. I prefer at least one aggressive person on the desk, Monte and Ashley are kind of shy.

Scott,  

I really think that Melissa would be able to handle Storey better than Kristen.  I think we should keep her on Central and let you take Kristen on the East.

Are you ok with that?
