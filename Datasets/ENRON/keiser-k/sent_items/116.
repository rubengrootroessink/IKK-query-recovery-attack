You should try looking at Duke,  they seem to be doing some mass hiring of Enron people and giving them big pay raises.

Hi Kam,
 
Could you send us your updated address?  Yahoo says you still live on 4444 Westheimer, which I know is wrong.  We would like to send you a wedding invite.  Have a happy holiday.
 
Take care,
 
JR
