Kathy,

Vladi asked me to give you a call.  I will be out of the office until about 2:00 today so I wanted to let you know what we did to populate Form A.
We gave all post-id's that were calculated on Nov-30th to Zhiyong Wei.  From there, he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets.  It will take a few hours for IT to get the file ready to use so I recommend getting that together ASAP.

Let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks

Kam
