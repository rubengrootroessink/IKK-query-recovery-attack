We are still trying to figure out some of the cash traders.  Once we get the word from Lavo we'll let you know. 

Thanks

Kam,

Are there any new developments in the trader world?  We still have the traders and books that you provided last week, but need to know if there are any changes to this.  Please let us know if you need a change so that the deals will bridge with the correct books.

Thanks,
Dawn
