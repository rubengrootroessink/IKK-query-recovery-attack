Ryan,
 
Everyone else is going to be here on Monday so please feel to stay a few extra days.  We will have the normal closing stuff, (liquidations, PMA's, etc.)  I've already checked out our PMA's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake.  Things may pick up a little bit on Wednesday getting the books closed for the year.
See you then
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Kam

Kam,
 
Hey... hope you had a good Xmas.  I am scheduled to be back to work on the 31st.  If I'm not really needed, let me know.  I'm more than happy to be back, but if it's not necessary, than I would stay in KS a day or two longer.
 
I'M NOT ASKING FOR MORE TIME OFF, I know I've taking a longer vacation than most.  I just want to make sure that my returning on the 31st is still needed.
 
-Ryan
