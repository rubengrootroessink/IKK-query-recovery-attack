FYI......

We are not bringing in prompt month value tonight.  Texas did, about $25,000.  The other regions don't have what we need for demand charges, etc. and no one has taken any time to research the values yet.  The other groups we need have been gone for hours.  We have some large positions which I don't really think are right.  I'll look closer in the morning.  

Hope you feel better soon, at least you have all weekend to recover.

See you Monday,

Kam
