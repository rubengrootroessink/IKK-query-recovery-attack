Thanks

Kam,

Jeremy was asking me about those "Financial" regions...  Do you want to use uppercase instead of lowercase so that they are consistent with Global (All uppercase in Global)?

Let me know, thanks.

Cecilia

One more thing - Financial (long/short name and org. region) is lowercase whereas all the other books are uppercase?

Thanks.

Regarding issue (1) below:

The reason I do not see MP and MD in ermt/estermtp is that the counterparties are not in global
and my script to check joins with tagg_global_cp also.

Since these are physical books with deals flowing from Sitara->CPR, we should be ok.

Thanks.

(1) What are the book names/codes for Canadian P/B/I?

(2) Don't see M P and M D for the physical (no hedge) books?

(3) For M C (Canadian GasDaily), for book, egs_cand_yn = 'N' (not 'Y'). 

Thanks.
