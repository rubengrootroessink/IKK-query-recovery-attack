I don't know who has been saving these daily.  Can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead.  They are for the estate and need to keep them away from the Netco files.

The files for the broker quotes have been moved from the Netco file to O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Those will be used for the estate.

Please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today.

Thanks
