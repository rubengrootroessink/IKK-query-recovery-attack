Now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high, we need to get back in gear, TODAY.

1.	Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again
2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated
3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN.
		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry
		start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances
		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from
		understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)
		
Just to be clear, this is coming down from Jeff Gossett.  
The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.

We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company.
I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.

The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.

I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed.
This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.

Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.

Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,

Thanks,
Kam
