In order to streamline getting users set up for access to the new environment supporting "Netco" (old EnronOnline applications),
we need to have the names and userids of your staff needing these applications.

In order to minimize processing several requests individually, we will use these lists to eliminate deletion of the names in the current database. This will save us from having to recreate them, which will save time on both sides. 

BUT, we need this information by 11AM tomorrow. Sorry for the late notice but IT has defined the deadline.

Thank you for your assistance.
