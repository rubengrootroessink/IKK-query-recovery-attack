Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?
