Here are the curves loaded for East, Texas, West and Central on November 30th.  They are also saved in O:\_Dropbox\Kam\Nov 30 Curves if you need to make any changes.
I left a copy of all broker quotes from that day on your desk.

All broker quotes are saved in O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Here are a few samples.
      





These are the curves for each region....basis, index, gas daily & physical.

Kam -

Can you get a list of all curves together for 11/30.  And any sample broker quotes that we may have.  ( I hope we are saving them at this point.)

Thanks
