Stephen,

I made a copy of your BenchbyTrader and cleaned it up a little by taking out all the hidden rows and old traders.  It is saved to the same directory as UBS BenchByTrader.xls


Can you look at this and check the macros to make sure it all still works?  Can you use that going forward?

Thanks

KK
