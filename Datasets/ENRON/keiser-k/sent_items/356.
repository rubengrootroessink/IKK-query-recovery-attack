Amanda,

Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are booked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's, it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.

Thanks

Kam

Hi!

First, I would like to say thanks for clearing so many variances last month.  It was greatly appreciated!  Here are the variances between the Risk P&L and the GL as of November 30.  Let me know if you have any questions.  FYI - I will be out of the office until December 31.

Thanks,
Amanda
