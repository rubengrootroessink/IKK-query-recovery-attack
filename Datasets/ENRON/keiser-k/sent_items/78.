The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into?
Is Canada doing their part?

Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris

Thanks
