As seen below,
 
Please start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to Chris.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  
 
Thanks
 
Kam
could you also CC me the first few times you send it?

While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets. 
 
Thanks,
