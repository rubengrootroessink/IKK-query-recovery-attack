Attached is a new list of Counterparty Deal terminations for Financial Natural Gas.  Please move all the Financial Natural Gas transactions for the Counterparties to the Bankruptcy Book.  I have included the Counterparty IDs for your reference.  Please let myself and Jeff Gossett know when the move has been completed.  Please call with any questions.
