I'm about to send this.  This counterparty name was inactivated and we had to manually change the name on about 200+ deals.

If possible, please forward these MTM values to me by the end of the day.  I'd like to get back together for a short meeting tomorrow to discuss the values and make plans for next steps.  Tina Holcombe will send out an email for meeting time later today.  Thanks.

I am forwarding Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU.  Please calculate our MTM values on those dates as soon as you can, and forward them to me.  Thank you.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.
