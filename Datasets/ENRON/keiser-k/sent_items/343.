Kam,

I spoke to Ramesh about this. According to him, rac.enron.com will be available in NetCo.

We need to add the RAC website to our list of programs to be moved over with Netco.

the website is rac.enron.com
Let me know when you get this if there is anything we need to do to make sure this happens.

Thanks
