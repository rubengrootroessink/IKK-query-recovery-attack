Carl,

The attached spreadsheet will show you the MTM value for all gas deals with TXU Energy Trading Company as of Nov-30.
Please see the PBI tab for Price, Basis and Index and the GD Options tab for options.

Thanks

I am forwarding Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU.  Please calculate our MTM values on those dates as soon as you can, and forward them to me.  Thank you.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.
