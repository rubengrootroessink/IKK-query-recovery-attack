Debbie,

Have you had any luck getting the Nov. 30th post id's? I did my best job trying to get them for Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with over 400 post-id's I guarantee that we missed some.

Let me know if you still think it's possible, I would like to get back to Zhiyong today.

Thanks again for your help,

Kam
