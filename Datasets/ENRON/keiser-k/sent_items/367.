All deals have been moved to ENA-IM WEST last night.  Set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-X, make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail.  If it is blank, you can run your weapon-X and input into your P&L this morning, you will also need to officialize your physical book one last time.  

Financial - you don't need to roll your p&l anymore, (except for Monte, you will have to due to the transport model).
Go into the RAC website and inactivate all of your books other than the physical, you will do that tomorrow.

Now that all tagg deals are in one book, we will be splitting up the alphabet among all groups to help monitor that the correct counterparties are being moved to the Bankuptcy book.  We will get with you all later regarding that.


Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

KK
