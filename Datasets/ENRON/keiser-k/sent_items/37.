Dear Scott,

Please contact the following people to help you:

EIM, EGM - Kevin Sweeney
Gas - Bob Hall
Electricity - Kristin Albrecht
Canada gas - Brian Gillis
Canada power - Kathy Reeves

Thanks

Shona

Risk groups:

Also, I wanted to let the risk groups know that I met with E&Y yesterday and they noted some items they would like to follow up on.  I've asked them to contact you directly.  Lastly, the form A's prepared were not consistent in regards to the treatment of intercompanies.  E&Y needs the 11/30 form A's without intercompanies.  For those of you who provided Form A's with intercompanies, please break them out and send us a second form.

Thanks

Shona,

Thanks for the Form A update meeting yesterday.  Here is a more formal
request for the follow-up items we mentioned.  If you could help point us
in the right direction to obtain this information, it would be appreciated.

1)We would like to review the results for a sample of queries for the Form
A's (whether these are reports generated or the output resulting from the
below queries).

Commodity:  Natural Gas

Transaction Distribution by MTM (#): >=$0mm, <$1mm
Tenor Distribution by MTM ($): >=3 years, <5 years

Commodity:  Electricity

Tenor Distribution by Transactions (#):  <1 year
Trade Type  Distribution by Transactions (#):  Forward
Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Forward

Commodity:  Eastern Coal

Tenor Distribution by MTM ($):  >=5 year, <10 years

Commodity:  C3

Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Swap

All queries are for both financial net and physical net values.

2)As a second follow-up, we would like a description and sample contract
of each product type (for the largest positive MTM within each category),
as defined by each commodity (this is item 8 on our comprehensive request
list)

3) A confirmation for the longest deal for each commodity (also related to
item 8 in our request list)

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)


I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott
