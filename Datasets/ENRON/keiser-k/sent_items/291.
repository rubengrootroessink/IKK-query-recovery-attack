I am reviewing the accrual, and have found a number of deals so far that look like they were terminated, but the demand charges/triggers are still in Sitara.  Should these be zeroed out as well, or are we really supposed to bill them?  I haven't made it through the whole list, but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning.  Please let me know today if possible.  Also, if I've left anyone off that needs to see this, please let me know.  Thanks.
