Kam, 

Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.

The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
I think the dropdowns will automatically update.

If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!
