Kam - I've had the coordinators go through all of the terminated counterparties, and here is another list of deals we are questioning.  Can Risk review the deals that are demand charges/triggers and either verify their validity or zero them out?  I'm meeting with Logistics this afternoon to review the deals that flowed past the termination dates to ensure that they are correct.  This needs to be done today if possible, as we will have to run the accrual on Monday.  Thanks.
