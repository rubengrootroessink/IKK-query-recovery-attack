O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group.  He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's.  He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well.  O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups.
  
Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that.  He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply.  He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions.  
 
James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months.  He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process.  Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems.
