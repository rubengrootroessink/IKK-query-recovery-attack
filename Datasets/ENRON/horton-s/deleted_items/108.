Dear Mr Stanley C. Horton:

There's plenty of advice for managers floating around out there...some of it very good and some of it downright disastrous.  The trick, of course, is knowing which is which.

That's exactly what Harvard professor Chris Argyris proposes to show you in his new book, Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not.  For more details, read the book review section in the current issue of strategy+business.

In the same issue, you'll find a generous handful of other great books discussed. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action is a good example...so is Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs, by AnnaLee Saxenian.  And you won't want to miss the s+b review of The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life or Absolut: Biography of a Bottle.

Reviews of important business books are just part of the reason strategy+business is eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we're on the subject of complimentary issues, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 13 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...especially if you make arrangements now.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
