Hi there.  Well, I got my accounting test back  and it wasn't that great.  =
I made a B.  I missed almost all my points  on one of the big problems.  I =
screwed up the formula and used the wrong  number as the denominator which =
made the whole problem wrong.  I was really  bummed and felt really stupid =
when she went over it.  My friend Missy sits  behind me and the exact same =
thing happened to her on the same problem so I  didn't feel so bad after th=
at.  Our prof is going to substitute our lowest  test grade with our final =
exam grade which she said everyone always does  really well on so I still h=
ave an A in the class.  I was still ticked  though.  I know a B isn't bad b=
ut when it's because of one problem you  screwed up it's frustrating.  If I=
 hadn't screwed up the problem I would  have had an A.  Other than that, to=
day had been unexciting.  I'll be  home tomorrow night and can't wait!!!  I=
 was thinking of coming over in the  morning on Thanksgiving Day and stayin=
g till noon.  Would that be ok?   I think the Saporitos are coming over at =
noon so I have to be back by  then.  Let me know what your plans are as far=
 as thanksgiving day goes and  if my coming over in the morning is ok.  I l=
ove you!!!  Have fun with  Nick (hehehehe - or should I say good luck).  Te=
ll Grandma Bettye hello and  I love her for me.  Talk to you tonight.
Love,
