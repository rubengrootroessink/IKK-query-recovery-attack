Stan,

Attached is the Enron Business story for your review.  Shelley has reviewed the story and was fine with it.  Do you think we adequately cover the other business units you oversee?  

Please let me know what changes you have to the story.

Can I hear from you by Tuesday, June 5 at 5pm?

Thanks a million!

Gina
