Announcer: June 4th, 2001. CHRIS BURY host:=20

Rolling power blackouts, bankrupt utilities, skyrocketing electricity price=
s.

Unidentified Man #1: It is the most volatile commodity in the world.=20

BURY: Are power generators gouging consumers?=20

Unidentified Woman #1: I think it's pretty appalling that the folks who sel=
l us power can charge whatever they want.=20

Mr. KENNETH L. LAY (Chairman, Enron): And every time there's a shortage or =
a little bit of a price spike, it is always collusion or conspiracy or some=
thing. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way.=20

BURY: And right in the middle, a federal agency you've probably never heard=
 of.=20

Mr. CURTIS HEBERT (Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): They di=
dn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overn=
ight either.=20

BURY: Tonight, Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis?=20

Announcer: From ABC News, this is NIGHTLINE. Substituting for Ted Koppel an=
d reporting from Washington, Chris Bury.=20

BURY: California is known as the great American incubator. From hem lines t=
o Hula-Hoops, the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east=
. That is why so many states are paying close attention to California's tro=
ubled attempt at deregulating electricity. Last week, California Governor G=
ray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power=
 companies. The president said no. Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue=
 the federal agency that regulates electricity prices. More on that later.=
=20

But first, the results of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. It suggests =
that President Bush is developing an energy problem. When asked what they t=
hink of the president's performance on energy, a clear majority, 58 percent=
, say they disapprove. That's up 15 percent since Mr. Bush released his ene=
rgy plan. When asked if they think the United States is heading into an ene=
rgy crisis, six in 10 Americans answer yes.=20

ABC News POLL The Washington Post=20

Margin of Error +-3.0%=20

How do you rate the president's performance on energy?=20

June 3 May 13=20

Disapprove 58% 43%=20

Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis?=20

Yes 61% No 36%=20

BURY: California is already there. For months now, The New York Times and t=
he public broadcasting program "Frontline" have teamed up to investigate. T=
heir collaboration, "Blackout," airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations. I=
t documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling=
 power on the open market. It's like the New York Yankees against the Toled=
o Mud Hens.=20

Unidentified Woman #2: We didn't use his five because their minimum was, yo=
u know, higher than what we were willing to pay.=20

Unidentified Man #2: I'll sell you 108 now.=20

BURY: (VO) On one side, companies such as Enron, the Texas energy broker, t=
rade electricity like any other commodity. A sophisticated trading operatio=
n buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day. It's the la=
rgest company of its kind in the world.=20

Unidentified Man #3: See what I'm saying?=20

KELLY: CRS. This is Kelly.=20

BURY: (VO) On the other side, in this converted department store in Sacrame=
nto, is California's trading team.=20

Unidentified Man #4: This is the operations center. This is the--this is th=
e location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California =
energy requirements.=20

BURY: (VO) Here, employees drafted from the state's water department go hea=
d-to-head with the pros from Enron and other companies. Since 1999, the cos=
t to California has skyrocketed from $7 billion to an estimated $60 billion=
 this year, an increase of 750 percent. And the demand for electricity, up =
less than 5 percent.=20

(OC) In their documentary, reporters for The New York Times and "Frontline"=
 address a fundamental question, who's to blame? Narrating this segment is =
"Frontline" correspondent Lowell Bergman.=20

Unidentified Man #5: Our forecast reserves look like they'd be pretty thin =
over the peak as well.=20

Unidentified Man #6: How much is...=20

LOWELL BERGMAN reporting:=20

(VO) The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by C=
alifornia's failure to build any major power plants over the last decade, d=
espite a booming economy.=20

Mr. LAY: I mean, we have a supply/demand imbalance. Too much demand, too li=
ttle supply in California.=20

BERGMAN: (VO) Not everyone agrees. Consumer advocates in California accuse =
the generators of actually withholding supply.=20

Ms. NETTIE HOGE (Executive Director, TURN): The idea that all of a sudden w=
e had a supply crunch is preposterous. What happened is, all of a sudden, t=
he new plant owners and the traders, like Mr. Lay's organization, looked at=
 the data and figured out how to manipulate the market. As soon as that hap=
pened, the prices never went down again. If it was totally a supply problem=
, why would we have excess prices at 5:00 in the morning on Christmas Day w=
hen nobody but Santa is working?=20

BERGMAN: (VO) The generators, in turn, say they shut down plants for routin=
e winter maintenance.=20

Mr. LAY: Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it=
's always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes peo=
ple feel better that way.=20

BERGMAN: But you know as well as I do that the price--it's nice for a busin=
ess.=20

Mr. LAY: Yeah.=20

BERGMAN: You're in the business of--of making money for your shareholders.=
=20

Mr. LAY: Mm-hmm.=20

BERGMAN: Right, as a company?=20

Mr. LAY: Yeah.=20

BERGMAN: So you would be foolish, as you said, to turn down the kind of mon=
ey you could make this past winter in California. Is--isn't there a...=20

Mr. LAY: I--I--I think you put words in my mouth out there.=20

BERGMAN: OK.=20

Mr. LAY: I said we--we made some money in California. We made some money ac=
ross the country and around the world. I mean, and as I tell my friends in =
California, Enron was doing quite well before California imploded.=20

Unidentified Man #7: So you can't blame the Enrons. I mean, they're the guy=
s--that's--that's what they do. They try to make as much money from the mon=
ey that they get invested. You blame the regulators.=20

BERGMAN: (VO) Across the country, tucked in an out of the way building behi=
nd Union Station in Washington, DC, sits the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=
ission or FERC. FERC's commissioners are appointed by the president and con=
trol a $250 billion energy sector critical to America's economy. With the c=
oming of deregulation, state control over wholesale electricity rates passe=
d to the federal government, making FERC the final arbiter of just and reas=
onable rates. It's a power FERC has been reluctant to use.=20

Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott, who convinced President Cli=
nton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in 1997. In January, President Bush made=
 him the FERC chairman, and Hebert has made no bones about where he stands =
on free markets.=20

Mr. HEBERT: The rules of competition govern that economies work, that choic=
e works. It's why we're American. We inherently like choice. It's why we le=
ft the mother country. We didn't like the rules they were setting. We wante=
d to make our own rules. We want our own choices and we believe that works.=
=20

BERGMAN: OK, but is electricity different?=20

Mr. HEBERT: It's a transition . It takes some time. Look, they didn't build=
 this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight eithe=
r.=20

Mr. WILLIAM MASSEY (FERC Commissioner): Without some effective price contro=
l this summer, I fear for the worst.=20

BERGMAN: (VO) William Massey is a FERC commissioner, a Democrat, who has fo=
und himself in opposition to his chairman.=20

Unidentified Man #8: Mr. Massey, what is the nub of the disagreement that y=
ou have with Mr. Hebert?=20

Mr. MASSEY: I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement a=
bout the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices.=20

I think it's long past time for this agency to step in and--and impose a te=
mporary time out on the markets.=20

Mr. HEBERT: Well, that is the problem because these people are saying tempo=
rary, but they don't mean temporary. It's kind of like the temporary rent c=
ontrol you have in New York. It's not temporary at all. Matter of fact, you=
 know, in Washington, DC, we don't do temporary very well, and that's a pro=
blem.=20

BERGMAN: (VO) In fact, late last year, after six months of unrelenting high=
 prices in California, the FERC finally did declare California's rates unju=
st and unreasonable, but took no action.=20

Governor GRAY DAVIS (Governor, California): So they found these people guil=
ty a year ago. They just haven't agreed on the sentence.=20

BERGMAN: Well, we talked with Curt Hebert. And we got...=20

Gov. DAVIS: Well that's, you know.=20

BERGMAN: That's what?=20

Gov. DAVIS: Lots of luck.=20

BERGMAN: What do you mean, "Lot's of luck"?=20

Gov. DAVIS: Because...=20

BERGMAN: He's the federal--he's the guy you are turning to to give you the =
money.=20

Gov. DAVIS: He is the chairman of the commission. But he has not been overl=
y sympathetic to California. He's more of an ideologue than a problem solve=
r.=20

BERGMAN: Well, he's saying you just want him to give you short-term relief,=
 price caps, which won't solve the problem.=20

Gov. DAVIS: Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already enormou=
sly wealthy energy companies.=20

BURY: How much blame do the energy companies really deserve?=20

BERGMAN: Watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are,=
 to a certain extent, reflected in your electricity bill. And don't think t=
hat this couldn't happen where you are.=20

BURY: And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself? =
Those questions when we come back.=20

Announcer: This is ABC News: NIGHTLINE, brought to you by...=20

(Commercial break)=20

BURY: Joining us from Boston, Lowell Bergman, the correspondent for tomorro=
w's "Frontline" broadcast. From our Los Angeles bureau, Laura Holson, a bus=
iness correspondent for The New York Times, who's been covering the Califor=
nia energy crisis. And here in Washington, Joe Kahn, who reports on energy =
and economics for The New York Times.=20

Laura, just before the break, we heard California Governor Davis blaming th=
e energy companies and the federal regulators. How much of his argument is =
sinking in. In other words, whom do Californians blame for this?=20

Ms. LAURA HOLSON (The New York Times): The interesting thing is Californian=
s blame everybody for this ap--for what has happened with the energy crisis=
. They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis tha=
t started, you know, a year ago, if you really, you know, look at when pric=
es starting going up. They are angry at their utilities who they feel have =
failed them. They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships =
with their utilities and they feel that they've been cheated. And they are =
very angry with the power generators, in particular, who they feel are char=
ging them just exorbitant amounts for energy.=20

In particular, there was a company last week, a power generator that said i=
t charged consumers, rather the utilities, 4,000, nearly $4,000 per megawat=
t hour, which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour. And when th=
ey heard this, they were outraged. They just thought, you know, `How can th=
is be? How can we get,' in their terms, kind of ripped off by power generat=
ors who are using them to make, you know, a lot of money.=20

BURY: Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight sug=
gesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on ener=
gy. How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington?=20

Mr. JOSEPH KAHN (The New York Times): Well, clearly the--President Bush and=
 the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the =
polls to select a new president, a slew of new power plants will be online =
in California. Electricity prices, presumably, will come down quite a bit a=
nd their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the pol=
ls. It's not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commit=
ment. This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the De=
mocrats now in control of the Senate. I think you can expect to see a legis=
lative initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in =
California. Some Republicans may sign on to that. Some have already indicat=
ed that they will. It's going to be a real knockdown political flight--figh=
t in Washington over what the strategy ought to be.=20

BURY: Lowell Bergman, talk a little bit about that free market activity tha=
t Joe just mentioned. We saw the clip from your documentary with the--the t=
raders from Enron pitted against the--the buyers from California. And I mus=
t say, it really did look like a mismatch.=20

BERGMAN: Well, in fact, some of the people at Enron told us that they welco=
me the day when PG&E and Southern California Edison, the regular utilities =
get back in the marketplace because they do feel like they've got them, if =
you will, outgunned. And--but I should point out to the audience, that when=
 Laura was talking about this $3800 a megawatt hour, which was Duke Energy =
Company, the normal price, if you will, the standard price for a megawatt h=
our was around 40 or less. So the level of profit that we're talking about =
is what people are upset about. And the problem here is--is primarily that =
in a free market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up i=
n particular, there's no limit to what could be--could be charged when you =
get close to that area of scarcity with electricity. Electricity truly is d=
ifferent and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary, he's the CEO of Enr=
on, it is the most volatile commodity in the world.=20

BURY: Yet, at the same time, Joe, we are seeing electricity traded as if it=
 were oil or soybeans or steel. I mean, how is electricity different?=20

Mr. KAHN: Well, for economic reasons, it's different in a--in a couple of k=
ey respects. For one thing, it's an absolutely vital commodity. People aren=
't prepared to do without it. Moreover, electricity powers every other part=
 of the economy. So, it's one of these sort of fundamental rights that we h=
ave. In fact, as far back as the New Deal, Franklin Roosevelt made clear th=
at electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legisla=
tion guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity=
 prices.=20

BURY: But just and reasonable electricity prices, Laura, do you want to pic=
k up the question of well, who determines what's just and reasonable here?=
=20

Ms. HOLSON: Well, it's very clear that President Bush believes that the mar=
ket, you know, sets what's just and reasonable. And, you know, that has not=
 been what Governor Davis has said at all. He believes that because this is=
 a commodity that people, you know, believe is guaranteed that there should=
 be some price cap on it. It's an interesting, if you will, situation when =
business and politics kind of intersect. Governor Davis said very early on =
that he did not want two things to happen in California. One is that the ut=
ilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for=
 consumers. And he's in a very tight spot right now because those two thing=
s that he did not want to happen indeed have happened. And it only looks li=
ke it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can ex=
pect another 260 hours of blackouts.=20

BURY: Laura, we have to take a break. But when we come back, we want to add=
ress the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes natu=
rally to them. Back with our guests in a moment.=20

(Commercial break)=20

BURY: We're back with "Frontline"'s Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe=
 Kahn of The New York Times.=20

Joe, aren't these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to b=
e doing, which is maxi--maximizing profits and to get the biggest return fo=
r their shareholders?=20

Mr. KAHN: Sure. That's their responsibility. They--they have no excuse for =
arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if th=
e market will bear a higher price.=20

BURY: Lowell Bergman, in your documentary, do you find any evidence that th=
e power companies are--are gouging consumers or doing anything illegal?=20

BERGMAN: Well, illegality, no one really has any serious evidence, although=
 there have been lots of allegations and there's been lots of speculation a=
bout it. But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times t=
hat some of the companies are starting to realize, it seems, that even thou=
gh they are owed hundreds of millions, in some cases $500 million or more s=
till by these bankrupt utilities, they're going to have to take a hair cut =
as Governor Davis describes it. They're going to have to make some bargain.=
 And I think we may...=20

BURY: Let me jump in there. What do you mean they're going to have to get a=
 hair cut?=20

BERGMAN: Well, apparently, that's Governor Davis's way of telling them that=
 they're going to have to take less to a--less than a full dollar payment f=
or what they are owed, and that there has to be some kind of settlement her=
e of between the various parties, other we're not--otherwise we won't see a=
ny progress.=20

BURY: Lowell, one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow t=
he money. And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administrat=
ion, accusations have been made, that the Bush administration is too cozy w=
ith the power companies and the power company regulators. What did you find=
 in your reporting?=20

BERGMAN: Well, we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about =
it, I mean, about his relationship with Ken Lay, the head of Enron, the fac=
t that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton. You kn=
ow, the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to hold pr=
esidential office in the history of the United States. So--but they are ver=
y open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and wi=
th the people who they feel comfortable with.=20

BURY: Laura Holson, this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting fr=
om California's misery, as it were, I suppose Californians find that partic=
ularly infuriating.=20

Ms. HOLSON: It's funny, in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up=
 near there, there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers, =
which is, as we all know, a football team and the Dallas Cowboys. And that =
seems to be replaced, if you will, with consumers in California who look at=
 Texas gen--at, you know, a lot of the power generators, which are based in=
 Texas, and who they feel now are just, you know, making a lot of money off=
 them. It's--there's always been a rivalry between those two states. And no=
w I think it's deeply personal because it's hitting consumers, or as they b=
elieve it, it's hitting them in their pocket books.=20

BURY: Joe Kahn, how long before these new power plants are going to be comi=
ng on line? And before they do, or in the time before they do, what--what i=
s it that the federal government can do to help California out?=20

Mr. KAHN: Well, it--it will probably be about 18 months before sufficient n=
ew power comes online in California to start substantially changing the sup=
ply and demand equation there. And that's a very speedy pace. That's with a=
 very expedited permit process for new plants. The governor in California h=
as put a lot of effort into building new plats--plants quickly.=20

BURY: So what happens between now and then?=20

Mr. KAHN: Well, that's the question. That's the debate. The Federal Energy =
Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act, in fact so=
me people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure=
 that just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all ti=
mes. It can't just selectively choose the times. And it has already found a=
t the end of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable=
.=20

BURY: So what's it doing about that?=20

Mr. KAHN: Well, it's--it's tried a variety of compromise measures so far, v=
ery limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during eme=
rgency hours. So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to re=
ducing the overall electricity bill in California.=20

BURY: Laura, Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls. Presiden=
t Bush has made it pretty clear that he's not going to lean that way. What =
options does Governor Davis have?=20

Ms. HOLSON: You know, it's--again he's stuck in this place where it--it doe=
sn't look like he's got any kind of real out. I mean, he can try to demand.=
 He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators, but if the fe=
deral government doesn't step in, he really can't do anything. The interest=
ing thing, at least I see kind of going forward, is how Californians have r=
eally adapted to a really, you know, awful situation. There's a law that's =
being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know months=
 in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a blackou=
t so they can plan. I mean, we've almost turned into--if anybody remembers =
traveling through Italy during their college days, you always kind of knew =
when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because they tol=
d you a day ahead of time. And that's very much what's happening in Califor=
nia where they're warning people, you know, two days, an hour, you know, on=
e day ahead of time so that they can prepare.=20

BURY: That's a pretty dark scenario. Lowell, we just have a few seconds lef=
t, what lessons should the rest of the country take from California's crisi=
s?=20

BERGMAN: Well, watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, whic=
h are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills. And don't th=
ink that this couldn't happen where you are. And I think that the industry =
itself is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may, in fac=
t, impact on the future of deregulation nationally.=20

BURY: Lowell Bergman, Laura Holson, Joe Kahn, thank you so much for joining=
 us tonight.=20

BERGMAN: Thank you.=20

Mr. KAHN: Thank you.=20

Ms. HOLSON: Thank you.=20

BURY: When we come back, an update on a NIGHTLINE broadcast from just over =
a month ago.=20

Announcer: To receive a daily e-mail about each evening's NIGHTLINE and a p=
review of special broadcasts, logon to the NIGHTLINE page at abcNEWS.com.=
=20

(Commercial break)=20

BURY: In May, we profiled the case of death row inmate Johnny Paul Penry, c=
onvicted of murdering the sister of a former pro football player. Today, th=
e Supreme Court overturned Penry's death sentence. It ruled, six to three, =
that the jury did not have clear instructions on how to weigh his mental re=
tardation when it sentenced him. The court will take up the broader issue, =
whether executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, in=
 its next term.=20

That's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Bury in Washington. For all of us =
here at ABC News, good night.
