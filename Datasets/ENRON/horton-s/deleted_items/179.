Unless either of you would prefer otherwise, I plan on accepting the following invitation to join the Southern Gas Association's Information Technology committee.  It does not involve any financial commitment, and provides a good forum for the exchange of ideas.

Hi Steve:

I wanted to follow up regarding your interest in joining the SGA IT
Committee.  I believe Debbie Adams with Duke spoke with you at the
Management Conference in Charleston, and said you were interested.

As SGA staff liaison to the committee, I would like to extend a formal
invitation to have you join us.  Sandy Comish, CIO at Williams Gas Pipeline
recently joined, and we would love to add you to the list as well.  Your
expertise would be a great addition to the committee.

Please let me know your thoughts. If you need more information regarding the
committee's activities before making your decision I would be happy to send
it to you.

Best regards,

Pat Downey
