Hello Stanley,

I thought this iMarketing News article about Compaq
Net Seminars selling large numbers of customer prospects might
be of interest to you.

http://invisioncs.com/r/J102_11.asp?CID=449828

The company helping Compaq put on the events, iNvision, has
provided its expertise to many organizations that are now
successfully producing and executing NET-Seminar campaigns
to sell customer prospects. The results speak for themselves...
see why Compaq has chosen iNvision
http://invisioncs.com/r/J102_12.asp?CID=449828
as the lead in this new communications medium!

If you think this might fit into your organizations marketing
strategy I'd be happy to talk with you further.

Many thanks for your time and consideration.

Brendan
