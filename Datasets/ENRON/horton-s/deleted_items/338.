Mr. Horton:

I understand that we recently rejected a cash offer for the wind company from a J.P.Morgan-backed group for approximately $400m. My understanding is that we have been trying to sell this company almost since we bought it, that the price is much higher than our cost basis, and that we definitely need the liquidity for our core businesses.  Are we reconsidering ?
