Dear GISB Board Members and long time supporters,

For our upcoming annual meeting on September 20 and 21 in Houston at the
Warwick Hotel in the Museum District -- we have several speakers identified
or tentatively approached.  We would like to thank the Board members and
longtime supporters who have helped, and would urge you to work with the GISB
office if you have other speakers in mind that would make our program the
best ever this year.

JoAnn Garcia from our office has been able to tentatively sign up Houston
Mayor Lee Brown to open the meeting and welcome the attendees to Houston.
Sheila Hollis is approaching Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-La), the chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee to speak and his participation
depends on his schedule, but we should hear back shortly.  Lyn Maddox will be
approaching a senior representative from the Federal Reserve Branch of San
Francisco, with whom he worked on the California problems.  Bill Boswell has
worked with JoAnn to identify Gary Ackerman with the Western Power Trading
Forum.  Gary has agreed to participate.  Bob Thomas will be approaching
Cambridge Energy Research Associates for a speaker.

Several state commissioners will also be approached including Commissioner
Bob Rowe of Montana,   Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer of Illinois, Commissioner
Bob Keating of Massachusetts, and representatives from New York, Idaho,
Texas, Pennsylvania and New York.  Representatives from the FERC and the DOE
have also been contacted for their participation.  Network Associates, the
largest security software vendor will also speak on the program regarding the
Internet and security issues.

Several slots are available for  speakers including opening remarks,
technology speakers and financial/market speakers.  Please let us know if you
have any ideas for other speakers.  Thanks in advance for all your help -- Rae
