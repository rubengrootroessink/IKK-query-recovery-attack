If it is OK with you, we'll just go ahead with Candover as it is.  I'm sure they will come back over to meet you if that becomes relevant and/or necessary.  I got your voicemail on the board materials for your meeting with Reiten, and we will get those to you on Monday.  Have a Happy Turkey Day!  Mark

This does conflict with a meeting I have in Washington D>C> with Nortwest Natural that Dick asked for.  Your call on rescheduling the meeting with Candover.
