Today, the FBI issued an alert to all its offices that Osami Ben Laden has directed his cohorts to attack the U.S. natural gas supplies in the event of his death or capture or that of his general Mullah Omar. There is no corroboration of this information but thought you might be asked about the likelihood. The article appears in Natural Gas Intelligence this afternoon.
