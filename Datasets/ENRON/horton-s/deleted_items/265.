Hey Daddy!!!!!!!  I'm so glad it's finally the  weekend after this long week involving entirely too many tests!!!  I bet  you're thankful for the weekend too considering your life is much more stressful  than mine at the moment!!  So what are your plans for the weekend -  golfing, sleeping, watching a race or two and trying to relax??  I don't  know what I'm doing this weekend - probably nothing exciting.  I can't wait  for Thanksgiving!!  It'll be so nice to be home for longer than a  weekend.  Oh by the way................I GOT A 92 ON MY STATS  TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was really excited.  I didn't expect to get  it back today since we just took it Wednesday but we got it!!  I was so  happy because I was really expecting a B instead of an A this time.  I've  decided my brain must understand this better than I consciously thought it  did!!  Anyway, I was happy, and I hope the news brightens your day.  I  took my accounting test today and think I did pretty well.  It was the  hardest and longest one we've taken so far, but I still think I did well.   Our teacher drops our lowest test grade too so if it's not an A, it'll get  dropped.  I'm sure it's an A or B though since accounting and I seem to get  along well. :)  Have a great rest of the day, and I'll talk to you  tonight.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron
