Is there any chance that Stan (PGE) may be allocated any charges this quarter for the Tomas transaction that ran through the PGG books last year.   It would seem like if we were trying to make the transmission and distribution business numbers look good this quarter we would want to avoid making that charge.   Plus it doesn't sound to me like it was a PGE deal.

Second, I understand a discussion has taken place about offsetting the $3.2 million in costs associated with supply chain software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra from the funds received from the termination.   What is the likelihood that we will get some relief for that item? 

As you can see I am trying to get some certainty to some loose ends.
