Dear Sirs,
Please take note of one of Lehman Brothers proudest achievements, the Lehman
Brothers' 10 Uncommon Values.  Attached is a brief summary of the history of
the Product back to 1949. As you will see, the Lehman 10 has outperformed
the S&P for the past fifty years.  There will be more information to come
over the course of the next two weeks.  We feel strongly that the product
speaks for itself, but would be more than happy to show you more information
on this product as it comes to us. Please feel free to contact our office
here via either phone or e-mail.
					All the best!!
