The California Electricity Crisis has resulted in an avalanche of
opportunity for the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM) to
provide its views on energy restructuring. Below you will find links to some
of our recent documents:

 - In May, CAEM issued an update to the RED Index 2001 that now includes the
13 provinces and territories of Canada. The RED Index is a scorecard which
evaluates and reports on the progress states are making in electricity
restructuring. Link: http://www.caem.org/red_index_2001.htm

 - USA Today did a full page spread using CAEM's RED Index to give a summary
of activity in the top 25 states. Link:

 - The Governor of Pennsylvania included the RED Index Rank of Pennsylvania
in his State-of-the-State Address. Link:

 - The NY PSC issued a Press Release on the RED Index. Link:

 - CAEM is pleased to announce the formation of a public-private sector
project called the Distributed Energy Task Force. At the request of
important members of Congress, CAEM will be assessing opportunities for
promotion of distributed energy technologies and matching those
opportunities with policy instruments, i.e., tax incentives, funds for R&D
etc. For a copy of the project description and participation information,
email a request to jwimberly@caem.org.

 - In February, CAEM sponsored a meeting of the newly formed Leadership
Council on Energy Restructuring, an umbrella group of industry executives
and public sector officials who support the development of a coherent
strategy on energy restructuring.

 - In April, CAEM filed comments with the FTC on the proceeding that was
initiated at the request of House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
Billy Tauzin on the impact of States restructuring. Link:

 - In March, CAEM held its first meeting of the DISCO of the Future Forum.
We have posted several documents from that Forum. Link:
