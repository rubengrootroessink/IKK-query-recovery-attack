Stan - 

Attached are the resumes of the key people that have worked with me for the last year and half.  They are Marc Hensel, Martin Sacchi, Bradford Brooks and Corbin Barnes.  I believe they are some of the brightest commercial people at Enron, and in particular have a lot of experience with corporate development, M&A, asset purchases and sales (including international experience).  They are also incredibly hard working people.  

Please let me know if your interested, or feel free to contact them directly.

Frank
