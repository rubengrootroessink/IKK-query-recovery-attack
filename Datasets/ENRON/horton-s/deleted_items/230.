Stan: If you recall, we spoke several  months ago about our client, a
private equity firm that partners with and funds executives to build
companies through acquisition and internal growth. We have trade marked this
program as CEOVisions and have attached a document describing it. Also
attached is a description of the type of acquisitions our private equity
clients seek. Please call me to discuss this in more detail.
