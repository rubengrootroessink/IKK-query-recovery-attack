-Presentation scheduled in San Francisco on Friday to possible buyer.
-Prices down in power and gas markets. No  extreme loads,  thermal generation
returning from outages, and increasing water flows all have contributed.
-18 month delay of deregulation in Oregon passed by House. Hard to predict
what Senate will do. Probably won't know until end of session, or possibly
even until possible Governor action. Still planning to be able to move forward
Oct 1 if necessary, but doing more work manually, as opposed to all systems
being ready, as there don't appear to be many customers who will take action.
-Working on contingency plans for possible rolling blackouts this summer, with
other regional suppliers. Lastest customer surveys show willingness to accept
short/infrequent outages(at least on a temporary basis), if it will keep costs
lower, until supply issues are resolved.  
-Still working with BPA on Colstrip transmission issues. Meeting scheduled
with Administrator next week.
-Jack Urquhart and Robert Eickenroht toured Trojan, and received an update on
Nuclear activities, as part of their continuing review. They seemed pleased
with the good progress that is being made on decommissioning.
