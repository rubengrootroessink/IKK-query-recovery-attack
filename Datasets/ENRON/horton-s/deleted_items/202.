I got your voice mail.  Kirk Stevens and I are meeting this morning to look at
the quarterly forecast numbers.  May closing will be completed tomorrow and
this will give us a better picture on the 2nd quarter.  After Kirk and I talk
we will get back to you with a response on where we stand for the quarter.
