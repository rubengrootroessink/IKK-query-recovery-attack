<P>New York, December 18, 2001 -- Tired of waiting for 3G wireless technology? Try 2.5G. Despite the delayed deployment of 3G in the U.S., wireless enterprise applications and e-commerce solutions are now fully operational. Scores of applications -- from simple messaging to wireless extensions of CRM and ERP solutions -- don't require high bandwidth. CIOs should consider the potentially significant improvements in sales force productivity, customer service, as well as supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies that can be realized today. </P>
