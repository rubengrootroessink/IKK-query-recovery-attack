> Earlier this week some significant changes in legislation were passed by
> Congress.
> Of particular interest  were the significant changes to estate taxes which
> will eventually be
> eliminated  In the file below we have provided you with a summary of the
> provisions contained in the
> Conference Agreement for H.R. 1836.
>
> We recommend you review page 9, section V.  which summarizes the changes
> and eventual elimination
> of estate taxes.  Also, an important change which positively affects
> college savings through 529 plans waas passed.
> Under the legislation, withdrawals for qualified expenses are now
> tax-free.   As a review, the 529 plan allows
> you to save for your children's, grandchildren's..etc. education. The
> assets grow tax-deferred, assets can be withdrawn tax-free for qualified
> expenses, assets are removed from your estate even while you still
> maintain control over the assets.  Additionally, unlike a UGMA/UTMA
> account, the gift is revocable, allowing you to change beneficiaries at
> any time.  If you are currently funding an education via a UGMAUTMA
> account, these assets can be moved into a 529 plan.
>
> We hope you find the file below helpful.
