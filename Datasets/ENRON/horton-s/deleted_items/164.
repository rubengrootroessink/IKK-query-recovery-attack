Stan,
Saturday is great with me... I can not make Sunday.
Even if the tee time you get for us is not ideal...please count me in...
Regards, Chris

Did anyone make a tee-time for golf this weekend.  I can play Saturday
as long as we are done by @ pm or any time on Sunday.  Please let me
know.  I can make a t-time but I am not sure what we will get at this
late date.
