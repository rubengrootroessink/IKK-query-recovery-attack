Stan:

	Cindy informed me that your are having some difficulties accessing your Outlook e-mail from home and from locations outside the Enron Building.  Here are some instructions that will help you get in:

1) Make sure you are connected to the Enron network.  If you are at home and use dialup to get into Enron, dialin as you normally would to get the connection.  If you are in another Enron office, you should be fine.
2) Open Internet Explorer.  By default, this usually takes you to home.enron.com.  Change the address to mail.enron.com.
3) A login screen will appear, asking for an ID and a password.  In the ID box, type CORP\shorton (case is not important). 
4) In the password blank, type in your network password.  This is the password you use to login to your machine each morning.  When you change your network password, your Outlook password will automatically change with it.
5) You should now see your Outlook inbox.  You can access your mail, your calendar, and your contacts.  


If you have any further questions, please let me know.
