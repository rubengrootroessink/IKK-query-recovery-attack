Stan: Good hearing from you. I'm currently consulting with Raytheon. I told
them that I do not want to be committed for the long haul which they've
agreed to. They've got lots of issues in Asia so that's where I'm headed
next week for probably three weeks. I'll give you a call upon my return. I
understand that things need to shake out a bit at EES. Thanks for guiding
me through this and please keep me in mind as you discuss key personnel
issues with your Enron associates. You can contact me through my Raytheon
email address. Regards

Rich Leong

Rich:

There have been some management changes at EES since we last talked.   The
new team needs time to access where they are before looking at additions to
staff.  The world never stays constant!

Please check back.
