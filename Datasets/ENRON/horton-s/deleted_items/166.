Hello Stan,

I have not received any response from Lou Pai.  Is he still with Enron?  I did not get a return receipt from the e-mails I have sent to him.  

Do you have anyone else that may be interested in looking at this potential gas fueled auto technology that these entrepreneurs have?   

The reason why I contact you again on this is that the folks that wish to submit the unsolicited proposal to Enron called me again asking if we are interested.  

Sorry to bother you with this again, but if there is anyone else I can contact I would appreciate it. 

Regards,

Henry

Contact Lou Pai.  He is heading up our new Xelerator program that is looking at new business opportunities that are outside of our mainstram businesses.

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry
