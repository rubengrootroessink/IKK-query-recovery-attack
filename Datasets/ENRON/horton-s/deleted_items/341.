Eric and Darrell - Please investigate these complaints.  Joseph (who I do not know) is raising discrimination concerns as well as safety concerns.   Darrell - also send a written message to Joseph letting him know that his concerns have been brought to your attention and that we will take appropriate action to investigate.  Eric - you may want to drop Jim Derrick a note (since Key Lay was copied on this) and give him a heads-up.  Thanks. Adam
