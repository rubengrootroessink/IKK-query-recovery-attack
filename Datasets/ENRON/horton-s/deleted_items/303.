My special thanks to the both of you for being there, for being trustworthy (in a time when we can't say that to many), for caring about your staff and employees.  Best wishes to you both for a wonderful Thanksgiving.  And, yes, you're right Stan, this Thanksgiving 2001 is viewed by all of us in a very different light.

Janice
