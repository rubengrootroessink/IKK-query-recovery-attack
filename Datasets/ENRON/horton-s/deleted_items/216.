Stan - Operations have been normal this week. NBP's unit price recovered to above $38. Prices in the midwest have continued to be low vs. Alberta, so we have been running at around 90% load factor (200-300/d empty space). Hopefully the current cold weather will hang on until next week when the industries come back up after the new year.

 I have not seen Crestone/Bearpaw volumes this week. We should get an update after the holidays. No reports of any problems. 

One very sad note. Larry Weisman (52) of the Petersburg Team on MGT died as a result of a heart attack on Christmas eve. I will send along details as I get them. We have sent flowers from here. I believe the funeral will be Friday. We will have Company representation at the funeral, but I do not plan to go.

I will be in the office this week, but on vacation Monday 12/31. I will give you a call next Wednesday with next week's update. On Friday 1/4, I will be in late due to the big party after the Husker Rose Bowl victory.

Please give me a call if there is any big new news regarding Enron this week.

Happy New Year,
Bill
