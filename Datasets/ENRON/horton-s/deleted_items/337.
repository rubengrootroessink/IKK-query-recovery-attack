Many of the costs associated with Enron Net Works are allocated to the business units based on person/desk top.  Enron Net Works will be reducing their head count as a result of certain business units reducing people.  They have asked if ETS/EGS will be reducing head count so that they can make the appropriate modifications to the Enron Net Works staff.

Please let me know if there is any insight you can share with me regarding this topic.

Thank you.
