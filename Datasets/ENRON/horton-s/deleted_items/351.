The week has been dominated by speculation on the future of Wessex and calls
from potential buyers.  I had a contact from Mark Muller from Enron asking
for information about potential buyers.  This was subsequently followed up
by a guy called Jeff Golden who says he works for Mark and is co-ordinating
the activity on Wessex.  I have agreed with John and Michael the attached
note which I have sent to Jeff Golden who says he is happy with the process
and will act as the co-ordinator for the office of the Chairman.

As I see it, at this stage, we are saying to potential acquirers of Wessex
that although Wessex will be for sale, the timing is not yet determined.  In
the meantime, we will seek the information set out in paragraph D3 so that
when a decision is made we are in a position to move quickly.

The only other action I am aware of is that RBS have a meeting with Jeff
McMahon next week.

I will keep you updated.

Colin
