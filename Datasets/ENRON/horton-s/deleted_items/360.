sure hope Tod is okay; I will chat with him later today.  I know Mike Miller; he is actually an old wind guy (from a prior life).  My sense is that he would be a good person to have on the team. He also helped Fastow conduct due diligence on EW when there was consideration of doing something with LJM several months ago, so he knows the business.

Ok, but please expedite. Also, you should be aware that Todd has informed me of his need to pursue going on short-term disability.  We are looking at internal candidates to serve as the CFO for the interim period as we seek to seel Enron Wind.  You will of cource have input into the decision.  My first interview is Monday with a Mike Miller who is in corporate development.  I will keep you informed.

Stan - we have commenced an investigation of Toman's concerns. At this stage, I do not know whether he is a disgruntled employee blowing off steam or whether these are serious concerns (or maybe a little of both).  I will let you know what we learn.  For now, I do not think you need to send out an audit team - let us find out whether there is any substance here.  Adam

What is going on here?  I think I need to send out my operational assessment team to do an audit.  Please advise immediately.

Eric and Darrell - Please investigate these complaints.  Joseph (who I do not know) is raising discrimination concerns as well as safety concerns.   Darrell - also send a written message to Joseph letting him know that his concerns have been brought to your attention and that we will take appropriate action to investigate.  Eric - you may want to drop Jim Derrick a note (since Key Lay was copied on this) and give him a heads-up.  Thanks. Adam
