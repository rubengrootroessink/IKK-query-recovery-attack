-Thanksgiving day storm, never fails, that wind and weather arrive for holiday. Crews worked good part of day, but were able to get customers restored for turkey dinners.
-OPUC denied customer advocacy groups request for reconsideration of rate increase. Staff did request that we consider smoothing the rate increase, by financing over longer period of time and keeping rates higher, rather than decreasing as prices come down. Working to analyze options and determine if Enron and NW Natural would allow, given increased debt that would be required in short-term. Would like to at least give some customers option of having this choice, if financials look neutral and approvals can be obtained.
-Enron uncertainty is creating problems with our issuing of debt. Have call scheduled with corporate to discuss this week.
-Allegheny Energy Supply Co, temporarily limited trading to prompt month because PGE is an affliate of Enron. After discussion of OPUC ring-fence, trading was reinstated.
-The market is experiencing increased trading outside of Enron-On-Line.
-PGE is no longer allowed to transact with Dynegy.
