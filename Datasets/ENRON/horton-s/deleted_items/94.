Stan,

Since returning to Enron, I have been working in ENA's Upstream Business Unit.  For the past year we have been pursuing infrastructure opportunities in the deepwater GOM.  The infrastructure projects consisted of deepwater pipelines and floating production systems such as spars or tension leg platforms.  Recently, ENA has re-evaluated its business strategy in deepwater and is questioning the amount of exposure ENA should take given its ownership position in Mariner.  ENA may not view offshore infrastructure as a strategic business opportunity for Enron.  

I would like to meet with you to discuss current and future deepwater project developments in the Gulf of Mexico.  These projects may represent a significant opportunity for EOTT.  I have worked with EOTT extensively to determine the best crude oil export option for each projects.  

In addition, if ENA determines that deepwater infrastructure projects are not strategic, I would be interested in your opinion regarding opportunities with ETS for someone with my experience.  I have attached my resume for your convenience.

 

Could your administration assistant call and set up a time for the brief meeting?


Thanks .... Kevin Miller
