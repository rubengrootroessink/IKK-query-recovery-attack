I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.
