All:

Today marks a tremendous milestone in that the letter that confirms the
"Pipeline Industry" has joined together to address regulatory and
legislative pipeline safety issues in a unified fashion has been delivered
to the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, via courier.  These
documents were also sent to select Senators, Congressmen and Staff.  You, as
signatory to this letter, acting as CEO's, Chairman of Boards & Executive
Committees of Associations, CEO's & Presidents of the Associations and
Institutes, and Industry Leaders, confirm the path forward for the entire
industry and collectively we represent the entire industry.  We need to roll
out this confirmation to all the industry stakeholders and encourage the use
of these documents to advance our efforts.  A follow-up face-to-face session
with Secretary Mineta and a few of the CEO's will be worked into  his busy
schedule as soon as possible.

A copy of the signed document went out in the mail to you today and a
electronic copy (without the signatures) is attached for your convenience.
Also attached is the "One-Pager" that accompanied the letter and a Industry
news release.

Congratulations to all who made this possible.

To you and yours.....Happy Thanksgiving.
