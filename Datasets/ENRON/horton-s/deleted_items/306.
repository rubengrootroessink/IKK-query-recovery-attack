I wanted each of you to be aware that TransCanada has agreed to a request from Governor Knowles office for a meeting on November 30th in Anchorage on behalf of the A to B project sponsors.   I expect we may all receive a communication from TransCanada (Dennis McConaghy) with details regarding this meeting.
