Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.
