Golf is scheduled for 2pm Saturday.  Lousy start time but evidently they have a tournament of some sort on Saturday morning.  Let me know if you can play or not.  It is only you and I.  Phone numbers are:  work 713.853.6177.  Home 281.320.1240.  Also please email your phone numbers for future reference.  No one has them.
