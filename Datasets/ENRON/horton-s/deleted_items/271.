Stan,

Below is a Thanksgiving note from you to all EGS US employees.  Please let me know what feedback you have.  John Ambler reviewed and approved this message.  I'd like to get this out to employees on Tuesday, Nov. 20.

Also, I'm on tap with Lou to get an ETS Salutes memo out early next week acknowledging the employees/departments who worked this week on the financing.

Look forward to hearing from you....Gina



With the Thanksgiving Holiday upon us, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives and who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I know here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and everyone in the organization is working hard.  Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan
