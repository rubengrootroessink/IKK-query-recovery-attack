Stan,

Thanks for thinking of us during these trying times.  In light of the Enron issues I realize how hard it must have been for you to enjoy your time with your family for thanksgiving. To let you and those that must manage these hard times know,  you all are in my thoughts and prayers, and I wish you well.

Sincerely,
Frank Acuff
