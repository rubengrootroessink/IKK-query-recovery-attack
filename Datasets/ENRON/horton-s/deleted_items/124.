Stan,

Below are the items that will be discussed under the 'GISB Issues Update' agenda item.  Please note that the pipeline segment Executive Committee representatives are bringing these items to your attention to raise your level of awareness.  We welcome your comments and suggestions.  We understand that the best course of action may be no action.

Lack of ratification results.  The 'Final Actions' page of the GISB Web site has not been updated since January, 2000.  Three ratifications have taken place since that time; two more are occuring this month.  Most importantly, this information is needed for internal planning purposes for computer system changes.  GISB subcommittees also need this information in order to operate effectively.  ENA has been attempting to obtain the results of the April 9 ratification since mid-April.  They're unable to obtain verbal results, much less something in writing or posted.  ENA is considering sending a letter to GISB requesting that the GISB Web site be kept up-to-date.  If so, they'll be looking for other parties to co-sign.

Request logs are not kept current.  GISB's logs, which show the status of requests, have not been updated since May 10, 1999 (per the logs that were last posted).  These logs appear on two Web pages - for standards requests and for interpretation requests.  The log that is currently posted for interpretations requests is dated May 10, 1999.  For standards requests, the logs were removed from the Web site at least six months ago.  At that time, they were current as of May 10, 1999.

Lack of participation.  This was mentioned during the December, 2000 Board meeting.  The EC reps simply want you to be aware of this fact.  The Technical Subcommittee usually has two attendees - including the chair.  The attendance at the Information Requirements Subcommittee (IR) meetings has slightly improved over the last couple of months.  As a reminder - since Jim Keisler passed away, IR is looking for a second co-chair.  I've been approached but have not yet given a response.  Shelley, Brad and I are addressing this.

The May 24 BPS meeting.  You've received at least two e-mails on this topic.  The EC reps will answer any questions the Board members may have and again welcome your comments.

Thanks,
Theresa
