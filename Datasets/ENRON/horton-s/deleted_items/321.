Stan and Bill,

I just wanted to briefly call to your attention that the merger between Dynegy and Enron could bring about greater business opportunities between Northern Border Pipeline and Illinois Power.  Illinois Power serves 650,000 natural gas and electricity customers in a 15,000 square-mile territory across Illinois.  

Illinois Power currently holds a 40 MMbtu/d contract on MGT that will expire in December of 2002.  This contract serves a power plant off their system near Urbana, IL.  We hope to continue and expand this relationship with MGT. 

Northern Border does not connect with Illinois Power but is within 10 - 15 miles of a portion of their system in north-central Illinois.  We have begun discussions with Illinois Power about developing a project to access this market.

Paul
