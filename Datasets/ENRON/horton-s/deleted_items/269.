The Enron Dabhol team intends to meet with GE and Bechtel early next week a=
nd seek/obtain their approval on putting a joint offer on the table regardi=
ng what we would accept for our Dabhol investment. This will include price =
and other terms of the offer. We need to buy some time for the sponsor meet=
ings to occur next week as well as correctly position the current status in=
 the press. Currently, there is considerable Indian and international wire =
service press that is saying that Enron, GE and Bechtel have agreed to part=
icipate in an equity sale on the terms and for the price range outlined by =
the Indian banks. This is clearly not the case, and I recommend we give a f=
irm push back on this, while keeping the door open for a subsequent offer f=
rom the sponsors. Below is a letter I intend to send to the Indian banks on=
 Tuesday morning, India time. The summary of the letter is that it tells th=
e Indian banks that we are meeting with Enron, GE and Bechtel next week and=
 will be jointly deciding our next steps, including what we are willing and=
 not willing to do. And we will communicate this back to the banks after ou=
r meetings next week.

Letter  will go to IDBI, ICICI and State Bank of India.

"Gentlemen:

I trust your Diwali holiday season was enjoyable, and I wish each of you a =
very happy and successful year ahead.=20

Following our meetings in Singapore, we will be meeting jointly with the of=
fshore sponsors to discuss the next steps with them and get their approval =
on how to proceed. These meetings will discuss the various options availabl=
e to the offshore sponsors that we have mentioned to you in the past, inclu=
ding whether they wish to proceed with a due diligence process and on what =
terms, especially given the very low indications of value proposed by the I=
ndian financial institutions in Singapore as well as the absence of funding=
 of ongoing costs of Dabhol Power by the lenders. Until we have those offsh=
ore sponsor meetings, we will not rule out any possibilities and will work =
for the best possible outcome that protects the economic value in the Dabho=
l project. =20

As you are aware, just as this past week was a major holiday week in India,=
 this current week is a major holiday week in the United States. Thus our m=
eetings with the offshore sponsors are scheduled for November 26 through 29=
 in the U.S.=20

As soon as the offshore sponsors have formulated their views, we will commu=
nicate the same to you. I anticipate this will be during the week of Decemb=
er 3.

Regards,


K. Wade Cline
