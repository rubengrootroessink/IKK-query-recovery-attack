Stan -   As you know, Joseph Toman sent a variety of e-mails and faxes to various members of Enron management on November 21, alleging safety, discrimination and other violations at Enron Wind.  We commenced an internal investigation over the Thanksgiving holiday and, although a few interviews still need to be conducted, we have a fairly good sense for the facts.  Here is the summary:

	1.  Joseph Toman is a temporary engineering employee (hired for a short-term assignment through a temp agency), not an Enron Wind full-time employee.  He employer is the temp agency, not Enron Wind.  

	2.  Toman started in August, 2001 for an assignment expected to last several months.  

	3.  Last week, his supervisor told Toman that his project work was ending as expected and his services would not be needed after November 26.  His memos were sent after that meeting with his supervisor.  Toman's temp employment has, in fact, ended today - November 26.

	4.  In conducting an interview with Toman, Toman told our HR VP that unless his employment was extended, he would not cooperate with us in explaining the specifics of his safety and other concerns. 

	5.  Other employees generally viewed Toman as uncooperative and not a team player.

Based on the facts we have uncovered so far, I do not feel there is a need for further action.  We will complete this investigation and I will let you know if we uncover any additional and/or contrary facts. 

Adam
