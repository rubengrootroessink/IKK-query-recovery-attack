Wade/Rob/Bruce:

I think we should reconfigure the MOU to constitute a binding obligation to purchase and sell rather than a MOU that would lead to a definitive agreement.  We are trying to force an answer, it seems to me at this stage of the game, a definitive offer should be put forward for acceptance or rejection.

Thoughts?

Jim
