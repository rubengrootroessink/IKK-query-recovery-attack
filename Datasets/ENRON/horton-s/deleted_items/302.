Stan - Thanks for the kind message.  These are indeed challenging times and I can only imagine how difficult it has been on you to see the impact it has had on our company.  Please know that we continue to be focused and dedicated to "doing the best in everything we do."  

Please enjoy the holiday especially the time spent w/ your children.

Thanks.  John D.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan
