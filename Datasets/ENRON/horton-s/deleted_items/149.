Attached you will find an updated PowerPoint presentation regarding PGE Power
Supply.  This presentation was emailed to Stan previously, however the
2002-2003 power position slide has now been updated and corrected.  This
presentation may be referenced in a conference call this morning with Peggy
Fowler.

Thanks,
