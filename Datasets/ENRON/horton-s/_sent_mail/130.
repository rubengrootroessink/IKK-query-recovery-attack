I bought 5,000 units of Northern Border Partners at $39.56 with part of the 
proceeds.  The roughly $975K is correct.  Thanks.  Any ideas on the cash?  I 
was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.  Your 
thoughts.

We received the two deposits you expected this week. The amount of the
larger one was not the number you gave me. Take a look at client serve and
see if it is correct.
