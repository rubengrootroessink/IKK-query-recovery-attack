Good morning.  Thanks for the yahoo greeting.  It made my day.  Have a great 
day.  Remember that Cathy and Carol's birthday is Nov. 30th.  I sent them a 
card and a $100 check to go out to dinner on us.  I signed it from all of 
us.  Hope you don't mind.  

They would enjoy an email from you.

Love' Dad
