After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE 
business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand 
better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial 
exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy 
to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast 
of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and 
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!
