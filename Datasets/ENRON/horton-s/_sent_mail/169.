> > foundation upon which you must build a life. You learn

> > You learn that you will not be more beautiful,

> > glorify you with his or her touch... and in the

> > And you learn that your body really is your temple.

> > You begin eating a balanced diet, drinking more

> > that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create
> > doubt and fear, so you take more time to rest. And,
> > just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels the soul,

> > that wishing for something to happen is different
> > from working toward making it happen. More
> > importantly, you learn that in order to achieve
> > success, you need direction, discipline, and

> > it all alone and that it's OK to risk asking for
> > help. You learn that the only thing you must truly fear

> > itself. You learn to step right into and through your

> > handle it, and to give in to fear is to
> > give away the right to live life on your terms.
> > And you learn to fight for your life and not to
> > squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.
> > You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't

> > sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good

> > primal state - the ego.
> > You learn that feelings such as anger, envy, and
> > resentment must be understood and redirected, or they
> > will suffocate the life out of you and poison the
> > universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when
> > you are wrong and to build bridges instead of

> > soft warm bed, a long hot shower.

> > a promise --to never betray yourself . And
> > you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can
> > listen to the wind. And you make it a point
> > to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to
> > every wonderful possibility. Finally, with courage in
> > your heart and with God by your side,
> > you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you

>
>  > Fly, fly do not fear
