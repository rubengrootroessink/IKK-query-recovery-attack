Subject: NBP Underwriting Group

Attached is a short memo on our selection rationale for the underwriting=20
group for a planned (mid-May) equity offering of about $130 - $150 million=
=20
for Northern Border Partners.  Some of these firms may be contacting you, s=
o=20
this should be helpful in fielding those calls.  With this group we are=20
attempting to balance our placement into firms that have substantial NBP=20
holdings (UBS Warburg, AGE) and diversify and expand holdings in other majo=
r=20
systems (SSB, Banc of America, First Union).  Please note that for the firm=
s=20
not selected, i.e. Lehman, Goldman and Merrill, part of our rationale was t=
o=20
hold these systems for a potential offering later in 2001 that could be=20
accomplished on a sole-managed basis for up to about $50 million.

Kelly:  As Ben requested, the underwriting fees are expected to be about=20
4.25% and the breakdown by firm will be provided when we have determined th=
e=20
allocations.

Let me know ASAP if you have any questions or concerns as we will begin=20
discussions with these firms tomorrow.

The following provides the rationale supporting the recommended underwriter=

common stock.  Thus, sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio=

of a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of=

Lead Manager - Salomon Smith Barney
SSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong=20

increased recently as their MLP analyst has raised his rating on NBP to=20
"Outperform".  SSB has served as a co-manager in past NBP offerings and has=

performed well.  Furthermore, due to their comparatively small allocations =

these deals as a co-manager, we are confident that their system has=20
significant untapped demand for NBP units.

Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)
UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20
conducted via the rapid placement (limited marketing) process, so they are=

very familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage.  While we ar=

than placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa=
y=20
a lead manager allocation, it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint=

lead role.

Co-Managers
Dain Rauscher and A.G. Edwards
Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20
ability to place a significant number of NBP units in past offerings.  Thes=

Royal Bank of Canada, which provides commercial bank lending to NBP and NBP=

so NBP will be able to leverage DR=01,s participation in future debt=20

Bank of America and First Union
Bank of America has been a significant provider of commercial banking=20
services to NBP and NBPL over many years, while First Union recently became=

an NBP lender in the March 2001 transaction.  Both have retail distribution=

systems available which currently hold a limited number of NBP units.  Both=

have participated in past MLP offerings, with Bank of America serving as a=

joint lead for highly successful Williams MLP IPO.

Other institutions considered but not selected
Goldman Sachs & Lehman Brothers - Both firms support the MLP product=20

systems are geared towards institutional sales and high net-worth clients, =

their breadth of distribution for MLP units is more limited as compared to=

SSB or UBS.

Merrill Lynch - Historically, this firm has not supported the MLP product=

despite its natural appeal to Merrill=01,s average customer.  Admittedly, t=
