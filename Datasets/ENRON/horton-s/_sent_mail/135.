Dear GISB Members,

Please find the attached ballot to record your vote on the ratification of
the set of recommended modifications to GISB standards adopted by the
Executive Committee (EC) in March and May, 2001.  To record your vote, please
fill out page two of this communication and either email (gisb@aol.com) or
fax it (713-356-0067) to our office by June 11.

The EC voting record and discussion for each of these new standards,
modifications to existing standards, interpretations or deletions of
standards is contained within the EC minutes beginning on November 16, 2000
and carrying through to the EC meeting held on May 8, 2001.  The EC minutes
can be found on the GISB home page (www.gisb.org), as can the requests,
recommendations, and related subcommittee and task force minutes.
Transcripts of the EC meetings where these recommendations were discussed can
be ordered by calling the GISB office - 713-356-0060.

A separate email will be sent to you containing a summary of the
recommendations and the recommendations themselves.  The recommendations are
