Stan -

Both JoAnn and I have spoken to Henry Norton at Flashfind.  We both told him
that the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to consider
membership and certification if it applied, and to send in a request if he
thought that standards should be developed.

We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requests
for standards development, and have only declined to process a handful of
requests because they were out of scope.  If he considered that the request
for standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas,
and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization, it would have
a good chance of moving forward.  Our plate right now is pretty full, as it
always has been, but that has never stopped a company from requesting that
additional standards be development.

We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and looked
forward
to working with him in the future.  I am not sure that he will follow up with
us on membership, certification or providing a request which would go through
our normal process.  I will keep you updated as or if this progresses.

Best Regards, Rae
