Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

Best regards.
Steve Westlund
