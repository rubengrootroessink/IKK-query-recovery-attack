Debbie has to be downtown for other reason on May 24th.  Could you meet with 
her about 4:15pm at my office.  I will schedule a conference room for your 
meeting with Debbie.  Perhaps yopu could come around 3:45pm and I could go 
over any and all changes that I have on tem prior to your meeting with 
Debbie.
