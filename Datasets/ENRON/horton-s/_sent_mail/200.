Thanks.  I am glad everything is going well with the newlyweds.  Debbie and I 
share some Astros tickets with some other people.  Don't know if you are an 
Astros fan but we would love to have you and Ann join us at one of the games.

We miss you on Saturdays.  I am getting better.  94 last week with three 
triple bogeys.  I can feel an 89 in the not too distant future.

Stay in touch.

Just thought I'd drop you a quick email and say Hi.  I hope you and your
family are doing well.  Take care.
