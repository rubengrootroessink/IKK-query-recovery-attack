I will leave Houston around 10:30 tomorrow, so lunch should be around 1:30.  
Then I am free for at least a couple of hours before I have to go to the 
Hyatt.  I will leave SA on Friday at noon if you want a ride home or if you 
want me to follow you.  I think however you leave earlier than that and thats 
ok.  I will be tied up the rest of the time there.  

Love, Dad
