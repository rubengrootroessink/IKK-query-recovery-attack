I am sorry that you don't feel well.  Sounds like you have a cold or flu 
bug.  Please go to the Health Center and get some antibiotics.  If you feel 
bad later in the week, make reservations to fly home this weekend and put the 
bill on the credit card.  I will check with your mom tonight to see how you 
are.  

Love,  Your Daddy
