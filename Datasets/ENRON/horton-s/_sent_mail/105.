Tomorrow is best for me.  I will make reservations as Massas across the 
street.  Does that work for you.  Around 11:45?

I am free for lunch both Wednesday and Thursday so whichever is better for 
you is fine with me or we could do both days.  Just let me know what you 
would like to do.  I know Mom still has that magazine so I'll get it from her 
so you can read through the golf info.  I hope you're having a good day.  
I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron
