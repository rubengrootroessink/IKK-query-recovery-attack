The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie 
said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of 
the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty 
good, huh.

Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They 
had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a 
little bit.

Love, Daddy
