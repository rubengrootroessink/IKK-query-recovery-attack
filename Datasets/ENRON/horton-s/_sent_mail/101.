I am very happy for you.  It sounds as if everything in your life is going in 
the right direction.  I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for 
Joe.  I am sure you will learn alt.  Also, thank you for remembering Jason 
and Jessica's 1 year birthday.  The designer T-shirts were great and they 
look really cute in them.  That was very thoughful of you to remember.  Good 
luck!

Stan,

As you probably know, I have accepted a position as Regulatory Analyst 
reporting to Joe Hartsoe.  My last day in Houston is June 29 and I will start 
my new responsibilities on July 16.

By means of this message I want to thank you for making this possible.  This 
is a big challenge for me and opens a new spectrum of possibilities in a 
completely different arena.

I am looking forward to being a part of the ETS team.

Thanks again,

Karina
