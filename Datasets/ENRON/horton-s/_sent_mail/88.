Hello, Kimberly!   Stan is out of the office until Monday.    Can we wait 
until Tuesday to send out?    In the future, we should try to incorporate a 
bit more "lead" time on items like this  just in case Stan might be out of 
pocket, etc., which is the case here.

Cindy

I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We plan to deliver 5 boxes of food 
and toys on Tuesday, Nov. 14, to the Downtown location of the Head Start 
program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your generosity, the Head 
Start Program will be able to help those less fortunate .

Thank you again for your kindness.
