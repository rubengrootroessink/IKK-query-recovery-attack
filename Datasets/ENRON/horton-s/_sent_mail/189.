30 days is acceptable.  This is extremely important to us.

You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of 
strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  
As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer 
them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am 
strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 
days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due 
diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience 
with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time 
frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.
