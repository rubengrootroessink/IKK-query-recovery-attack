Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work 
schedule.

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION  
luncheon on the 11th.

Thanks,
Stan Horton
