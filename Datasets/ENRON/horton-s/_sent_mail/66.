My knee is killing me.  I am going to sue Dr. Frost!!  I just decided to go 
pretty easy on it for the next couple of weeks and see if it gets any 
better.  Talk with you tonight.  Bye the way Jessica is not doing well. DK is 
taking her to the doctor today.  I will let you know how she is tonight.
