As you are aware, we have been pricing an upgrade to our Computron financial 
accounting program.  The vendor selected was Axes-One, which is the new name 
for Computron.  To keep the project on target for implementation, we have a 
quote from the vendor that is good until May 1, 2001.  This is a budgeted 
expenditure and the license fees are approximately $300,000.  

Dana asked that I run this by you before we get the license signed.  Please 
let me know if we can go ahead and execute this agreement.  If you have any 
questions, please call me.  Thanks.
