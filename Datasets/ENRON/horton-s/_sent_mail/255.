Would you please look into this and advise me as to whether we can do this.  
Also, Rod Hayslett is checking with Michael Anderson on whether Wessex would 
like to perform certain billing and payable functions for Enron Europe.

Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.
