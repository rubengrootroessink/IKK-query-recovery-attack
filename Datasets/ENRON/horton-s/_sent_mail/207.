Stan + Mark,

as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water
businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK .

They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America .

We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in
order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions
in Italy .

Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer,
when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and
telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi
utility .

 I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you
be interested in discussing a potential approach ?
