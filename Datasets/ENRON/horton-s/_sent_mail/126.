Stan & Phil =01) a quick update on the status of our activities on EOTT=01,=
s Hunt=20
Pipeline this week.

o On Monday, Jordan and David Sztroin drove as much of the pipeline as=20
possible in preparation for Tuesday=01,s meeting.
o On Tuesday, Jordan, David and Dan Cole met with representatives from Boot=
s=20
Smith Construction in Laurel, MS to discuss the project.  Discussion center=
ed=20
around the pipe size (10=018 being the most likely), and what was included =
in=20
the lump sum construction price from Boots Smith.
o His price did not include a number of items, such as concrete coating,=20
stream crossings, wetlands installation (including mats), directional drill=
s,=20
silt fencing, and several other identified items.  He has provided, or will=
=20
provide, unit prices for some of these items; we will estimate the balance.=
 =20
In addition, his price is for construction now, and could change if=20
construction is delayed too long =01) how long is not defined.
o He stated he was not interested in a total =01&wrap=018 turnkey project. =
 He=20
works closely with an engineering company, but did not feel comfortable doi=
ng=20
the entire project, including surveying, ROW, engineering, permitting,=20
procurement, etc.  His price is only for normal construction.
o On Wednesday, Jordan, David, Dan and I held a conference call.  I assured=
=20
Dan that we would, as always, be diligent in trying to minimize cost and=20
schedule while maintaining appropriate safety, quality and environmental=20
parameters.

I have assigned Jordan as the Project Director for the project.  He is=20
working to more clearly define the scope, standards, specifications,=20
execution approach, cost and schedule.  We will advise the target schedule=
=20
and revised cost estimate as soon as possible.  Of course, there are many=
=20
permitting and environmental issues to overcome, and Jordan is working=20
through those now; the survey needs to start ASAP in order to file for the=
=20
permits.

Dan, if you have comments on my notes, or on the meeting, please let us=20
know.  We=01,re looking forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Jerry
