No.  The GP contribution is enough.  I don't want to go to Jeff for another 
$2 million.

It looks like our GP contribution will be about $2.5 MM.    Do you still want 
to get another $2 MM on top of that?    The second part of his message is the 
potential NB unit TOtal Return Swap, or monetization that we have been 
working on.

I did get your voice mail on the potential placement of $2 million in units 
with Enron and we're working that into things.  Our attorneys commented that 
the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on) 
may "chew up" the benefits.  But that is their normal reaction - I don't 
think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.  Most likely 
it will need to be priced simultaneously with the offering to avoid any 
perceived "insider" pricing benefit.  But - do you think that will cause 
problems internally on the DASH?  The GP contribution will be about $2.5 
million.  My concern is RAC will require the $2.5 million GP investment to be 
combined with the $2 million in LP units, which I believe will trigger 
Skilling's sign-off.

On the FAS 125 idea, we have a structure that has been proposed by SunTrust 
that I need to review with you and someone in EGF.  I was planning on setting 
that up after our road show is completed on about 5-17, unless that needs to 
be accomplished sooner.  Let me know about timing and who you think should be 
involved (I was going to raise this with Ben Glisan in the next few weeks at 
his staff meeting).
