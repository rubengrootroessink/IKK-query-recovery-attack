We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to 
you to insure that one does not happen.

Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same 
attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit 
surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana 
the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something 
broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told 
you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some 
length but since his work on the international side was winding down and 
Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his 
measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and 
I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship 
building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could 
handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or 
relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal 
with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this 
answers your questions.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,
