Subject: Thank you

Good morning, Stan.  I would just like to extend my appreciation to you again 
for allowing me to join you on the visit to the Wiggly Compression Station 
Friday.  
The main factors influencing my choice to join Enron were the laid back 
culture and the treatment of the employees.  Thus, it was wonderful to see 
the interaction between the Executive and Operational team.  

Sincerely,
Monica Hwang
