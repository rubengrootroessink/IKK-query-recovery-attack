Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet 
until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for 
planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even 
worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.
