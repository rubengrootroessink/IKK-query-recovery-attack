Congrats!  Great job. And my team certainly appreciates all the great help on the teaser. We have several CAs signed up with a few outstanding issues on a few more so being able to distribute on Monday will be helpful.  Mark

The Indian Mesa sale closed last night in NY.  Our team did a great job.  All we have to do now is convince Enron's creditor's committee to let us use the net proceeds through a sale of the wind company!  

Regarding the sale, we are wrapping up today the revised '01 numbers and the '02 and '03 projections and expect we will have the teaser done for a Monday distribution as planned.  Happy New Year.  Adam
