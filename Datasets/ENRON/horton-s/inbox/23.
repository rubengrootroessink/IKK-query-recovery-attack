Folks -- Attached for your review are the draft comments by ETS on whether the Commission should re-impose the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions.  Thank you for providing comments on my original draft and I have included the arguments we discussed at the Regulatory Roundtable.  

According to the Federal Register, comments are due June 11.  Please provide me your comments by noon on Monday, June 11.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call  -- 202.466.9150.  Thank you.  Joe
