Here are the bullets for your discussion w/ Kevin regarding EBS interest in service from EAMR.




	EAMR/EBS OPPORTUNITIES

?	Asset Management Services provided by EAMR will generate costs savings for EBS.

?	EBS assets under consideration -    Cable Duct and ROW
Signal Amplification Re-gen facilities (located    approximately 50 mile intervals)
Customer Terminal locations ( Buildings, HVAC  Maintenance)
					      POP's  "Point of Presence" ( Electronic Switching)

?	Services to be provided    Operations/Maintenance
          Fleet Management
				          Material Management
				          Safety
		                     Technical Services
			         Environmental
			         ROW
		                     Communications
			        Computerized Maintenance Management System
			        Crisis Management/Emergency Response
			        Damage Prevention

?	Preliminary estimate of cost savings at approximately $2 million annually.  EAMR would propose to share those savings with EBS.

?	EAMR would absorb some of the existing EBS operations employees that are necessary to achieve required skill levels for EBS facilities. Approximately 40% of EBS ROW is in proximity to pipeline assets.
