PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 51
December 28, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


1.	OPS Inspection Protocols for Integrity Management Revised and Published

The Inspection Protocols to be used for the Office of Pipeline Safety's
Segment Identification and Completeness Check Inspections have been revised
to reflect experience gained in the pilot tests.  These are available for
viewing and downloading from the following location:
http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/iim/protocol.htm.   These inspections will be
conducted in the first quarter of 2002 for operators who own or operate 500
or more miles of hazardous liquid pipeline.  The primary objective of these
inspections is to determine operator compliance with the requirement to
identify all pipeline segments that can affect High Consequence Areas by
December 31, 2001.  OPS will also conduct a completeness check to ascertain
the status of the operator's progress in developing the Integrity Management
Program Elements required by the new rule (49 CFR 195.452).  The protocols
provide the basic questions to be used in performing these inspections and
the framework under which more detailed lines of inquiry may be conducted.

2.	House Pipeline Safety Legislation

H.R. 3609, the House pipeline safety bill introduced December 20, is not up
on the Library of Congress website: http://thomas.loc.gov, but highlights
from the table of contents to give you a sense of the bill's provisions:
Sec. 2 strengthens the federal one call notification law passed two
Congresses ago and gives a big boost to the Common Ground Alliance;
Sec. 3 strengthens federal enforcement of one-call requirements;
Sec. 4 requires each pipeline operator to have a public safety program;
Sec. 5 authorizes the Secretary to require operators to take corrective
action to address potentially unsafe conditions or vulnerabilities to
terrorist attacks;
Sec. 6 increases civil penalties under the Pipeline Safety Act,;
Sec. 7 strikes the word "demonstration" where it is used in connection with
risk management;
Sec. 8 provides for a federal study of land use practices and zoning
ordinances with regard to pipeline rights-of-way;
Sec. 9 establishes a program of pipeline integrity research, development and
demonstration;
Sec. 10 requires each pipeline operator to have a program to qualify
pipeline controllers that is certified by the Secretary of Transportation;
Sec. 11 directs the Secretary to require each pipeline operator to have a
terrorism security program;
Sec. 12 makes participation in the National Pipeline Mapping System a
statutory requirement;
Sec. 13 provides for the expediting of permit review by federal agencies for
pipeline repair and rehabilitation projects;
Sec. 14 protects sensitive information about pipeline vulnerabilities from
disclosure;
Sec. 15 makes technical changes; and
Sec. 16 authorizes funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety for four years.

	Under the AOPL/API Environmental and Safety Initiative, the Integrity and
Reauthorization Team, captained by ChevronTexaco's Jeet Bindra, will develop
the oil pipeline industry's response to this bill.  If you are interested in
working with this team, let us know.

3.	Fiscal Year 2002 Fees

The fees to be assessed for natural gas transmission, hazardous liquid and
liquefied natural gas (LNG) are: natural gas transmission pipelines: $109.15
per mile (based on 298,132 miles of pipeline); and hazardous liquid
pipelines: $121.99 per mile (based on 160,546 miles of pipeline).  LNG is
based on the number of plants and total storage capacity of each plant.  The
official announcement: http://ops.dot.gov/userfee/FY2002feeAssess.htm.

first to cross beneath the Great Lakes.
