Thanks Stan -- with Bill's strong involvement this last year, it will
certainly ease the transition next year and all the producers and Julie are
okay with it.  I haven't heard anyone note a concern, and several Board
members have been talking about this since September.  For a while Bill
Benham considered doing it, but then he picked up extra international
responsibilities including Hanoi, so not only could he not do it, but he is
not returning to the Board in 2002 either.  Lots of changes -- Rae
