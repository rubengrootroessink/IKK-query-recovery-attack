The Bankruptcy Court has approved our sale of the IM Project to AEP.  The C=
ourt's formal order will be entered sometime Friday morning.  With this app=
roval, we expect to close the sale either Friday or Saturday.  Approval was=
 conditioned upon our agreement to the following procedures with respect to=
 the net sale proceeds (approximately $108mm): =20

=09-=09$25mm will be returned to Enron (repayment of the post-petition work=
ing capital loans made to EW);=20
=09-=09$10mm will be retained by EW for working capital to use over the nex=
t 2 weeks;=20
=09-=09$78mm (the remaining balance) will be set aside in a restricted acco=
unt of EW, pending approval by the creditor's committee of the use of those=
 funds for payment of existing obligations and for ongoing working capital =
by EW. =20

We have until 15 January to obtain creditors' committee approval for the us=
e of the remaining balance, at which time if no approval is obtained, we ca=
n ask the BK Court to rule on the matter.  Obtaining creditors' committee a=
pproval will require that we (a) demonstrate that the continued operation o=
f EW as a going concern is in the bankruptcy estate's best interest (becaus=
e it will enhance or at least maintain the value of EW for sale) - this dem=
onstration will need to be made by Enron (Mark) and CSFB (Matt), and will n=
eed to include an overview of EW's value on sale, including arguments why t=
here is significant value in the EW - Americas business unit notwithstandin=
g the short-term issues facing the US business, and an update on the sale p=
rocess; and (b) demonstrate the legitimacy of EW's current obligations and =
future working capital needs - this will need to be done by Umanoff and Wes=
tbeld (we initially projected that we would need approximately $54mm of the=
 $78mm through the end of Q1, a likely closing date for sale of EW; Mike an=
d his team will be scrubbing these numbers over the next week).  We are tar=
geting early in the week of Jan 7 to make our case to the creditors' commit=
tee, although no firm date has been set.

One final note - a representative of GE attended the BK court hearing and i=
s aware that our request to use the remaining balance to pay our past due o=
bligations (including $9mm owing to GE) was denied pending implementation o=
f the above procedure.  We can expect continued pressure from GE.

Call me with any questions.
