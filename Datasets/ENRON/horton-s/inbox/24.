We are planning on the following schedule for the upcoming business review in Omaha.  The goal of the meeting is to encourage discussion about the focus and direction of each of Northern's Marketing teams rather than simply presenting material.  With this in mind we are planning to have smaller meetings and divide the discussion in to four sessions.   In additon to Stan, Dan, Rod (if available) and myself, we will have only those people listed below at each session. 


10:00 - 11:15   - Topic:  Power, Business Development and Acquisitions (plus long term South End Strategy)
                                - Participants:   John Dushinske, Mike Stage, Chuck Wilkinson, Mike McGowan, Shelly Corman

11:15 - 12:00   - Topic:  LDC Accounts and relationships
                                - Participants:  Bill Fowler, Frank Semin, Bob Stevens

12:00 -   1:00 	- Topic:  Overall Commercial / Regulatory Strategy (SLA, 637, Rate Case)
                                - Participants - Mary Kay Miller, Steve Kirk, Kent MIller, Drew Fossum, Shelly Corman

1:00 - 2:00        - Topic:  Storage, Pricing & Structuring, Risk Management
                                - Participants:  Kent Miller, Jo Williams, Sue Neville,  Lee Ferrell

We will follow up with a more detailed outline prior to the meeting.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Thanks,

Dave
