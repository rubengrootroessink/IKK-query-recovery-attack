Dear Natural Gas Executive,

With Natural Gas prices being sustained at levels never before seen, the
publishing of NGW's Daily Price Snapshot: The Natural Gas Market Outlook:
Winter 2000-01 could not come at a better time.

The Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-01, written by the staff of
Natural Gas Week and NGW's Daily Price Snapshot, deals with opportunities
and potential pitfalls for the natural gas industry this coming winter.
Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-2001 focuses on issues and market
factors that could play a role in the gas industry's performance during its
highest demand season, and one that is predicted to be a stern test for the
pipeline grid and the market in general.

2000-01  simply visit our website at www.energyintel.com

Sincerely,

Donald W. Reid
