As you guys probably know, I will be officially retired on January 1, 2002;=
 therefore, the meeting on November 12th will be my last and a good time to=
 elect my successor.  Thanks for letting me continue as your corporate secr=
etary after stepping down from that position at Enron.  I don't think I cou=
ld have let go "cold turkey," and I loved EOTT because of my fondness for t=
he directors and most of the management.  (I'll reserve comments on some me=
mbers of management who are no longer with us.)  I have really enjoyed it s=
ince Stan-the-Man got involved, and the morale and operating results show h=
ow positive that was for the company.  I have also been a long time admirer=
 of Good-Golly-Miss-Molly and loved working with Walt Zimmerman.  So, it is=
 my hope and sincere recommendation that Walt be selected to succeed me.  H=
e has demonstrated repeatedly that he is capable of doing the job -- in fac=
t, he has been doing the job for a long time, all except the actual taking =
of the minutes, and he has relieved me of that duty on more than one occasi=
on.  He's a person of integrity, loyalty, and dedication, and I know the Di=
rectors like him.  I hope you two agree.

I'll miss you guys, and Mollie, I'd love to have lunch with you and Walt an=
ytime.  I'll also be available for any help and advice that I can give.

Thanks again.
