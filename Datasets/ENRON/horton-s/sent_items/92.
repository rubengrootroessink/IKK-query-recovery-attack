I would like you to get directly involved in selling the assets we have targeted for next year while overseeing the operations of Mariella, Pete and Orlando.  That is alot of stuff.  However I will keep you in mind as we figure out who is going to be on the transition team.

Assuming we limit our India involvement to an offshore legal strategy, I will need more to do.  If you are asked to contribute a resource to transition, I am probably going to have excess time available.
