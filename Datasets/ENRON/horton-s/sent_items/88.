Thanks.  I have heard from just about all of Steve's reports about retainin=
g him.  Steve was given the choice to stay at ETS.  He made the choice that=
 was in his and Enron's best interest.  Steve is a quality individual and a=
n exceptional leader.  His talents need to be showcased and I think he unde=
rstood that.  I appreciate your comments on Steve's replacement.  We have f=
inished the interviewing process and will make a choice in the next couple =
of weeks or sooner.  Your recommendation is appreciated.  Thanks again for =
the kind words.

Stan

Stan,
I know that you are overloaded with all the company issues, but I just want=
ed to relay a few thoughts.  First of all, thank you for the words of encou=
ragement and confidence at your floor meeting.  This is a very difficult ti=
me for all of us, but you especially have a big burden.  Your openness, hon=
esty and confidence was very reassuring.  Other thoughts on my mind are jus=
t concerns about Steve Hotte leaving the organization given all the other c=
hanges.  Would it be possible for you to ask Steve to stay given the curren=
t situation?  I would think he would be very concerned about his change mov=
ing into ENA right now.  He might reconsider a move if you discuss it with =
him.  Finally, if it is best for him to move on, I feel it is extremely imp=
ortant to have someone in that job that understands our business.  I think =
Steve's business knowledge and ability to work closely with the Commercial =
group is what has made him so effective.  The Technology group's greatest c=
hallenge is never technology itself, but rather understanding the business =
so that technology can be appropriately applied.  I am aware that Brad Holm=
es is on the short list and just want to say that I have been very impresse=
d with him.  He has very good knowledge of our business and has good techni=
cal savvy.  He has developed a very good working relationship with the IT o=
rganization and I have enjoyed working with him.  I would feel very good wi=
th him in that position if we have to loose Steve.  I understand there are =
several other candidates to consider and that this will be a difficult deci=
sion.  I will certainly support and respect whatever decision you make.  Th=
anks for listening and I'll keep you in my prayers for strength as we work =
through the toughest days that we have ever faced as Enron employees.
