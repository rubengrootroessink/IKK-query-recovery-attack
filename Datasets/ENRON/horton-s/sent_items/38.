Subject:	Question

Gary, I have a question and I can't seem to get a real good answer so I will ask you.

I have quite a lot of money in the stable asset fund that I am told I cannot get until I terminate. My question is this, Where is that money? Is it safe from all that is going on? is it with some other company in some type of trust? Is it safe from being used by the company officers? What happens to it if I survive the merger? What happens to it if bankruptcy occurs?

Any help you can give me about this would be appreciated.

thanks    al
