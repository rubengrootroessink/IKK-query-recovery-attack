I have secured a tee time for Saturday at 9:52 am for the New Course.  If I hear from Steve or Tom that they have a tee time already I will email you.  So check your email tomorrow and I will confirm the time or call me tomorrow evening if that is more convenient.  I look forward to playing given the mastery of the game I exhibited over the final 9 holes last week.

Stan,
Saturday is great with me... I can not make Sunday.
Even if the tee time you get for us is not ideal...please count me in...
Regards, Chris

Did anyone make a tee-time for golf this weekend.  I can play Saturday
as long as we are done by @ pm or any time on Sunday.  Please let me
know.  I can make a t-time but I am not sure what we will get at this
late date.
