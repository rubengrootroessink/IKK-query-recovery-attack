Thank you for your kind words.  We will get through this and we all will be better for it.  Lessons are sometimes learned the hard way.

Stan, I wanted to thank you again for the time you took from your busy day to visit with us concerning the future of our company.  I as well as many of the employees in Enron took some risks with our stock and 401K and lost almost everything we have worked 28+ years, based on what Mr. Skilling advised.  You were right that we suffered a severe blow to both our company image as well as our future personal plans.  

I also realize you did not promise us anything and know that you cannot, but it really felt great to hear your encouraging words.  Yes we have had a great loss, but with time (and a job with our new company) can replace some of the loss.  It takes time to heal from these financial wounds, but if we continue to communicate with management and between employees, we can again be proud of what we have worked so many years to build.  It has really been great to work with you through these past few years and look to you to lead us into our new world.  

Sincerely,

Bruce A. Martin
