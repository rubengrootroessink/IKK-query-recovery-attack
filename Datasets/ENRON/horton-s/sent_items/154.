Subject:	GISB Board of Directors Officers for 2002

Dear GISB Board Members,

Bill  Boswell,  Hugh  Roberts  and  Julie Gomez, GISB's chairman, first and
second vice chairs, respectively, assumed office at the March 2001 meeting.
Under  established  guidelines Hugh would have become the 2002 chairman and
Julie  the  first vice chair; however, due to a reassignment, Hugh resigned
from the board and GISB was left without a first vice chairman.

The  Producer Segment directors have informed the GISB Office they have not
yet decided on a replacement for Hugh as first vice chairman, but in any
event none of them desire to  assume  the Chairmanship in March 2002.
Likewise, Julie Gomez has also declined  to  assume the Chairmanship,
although she is willing to remain as
vice  chairman  for  the  coming  year.   Therefore,  the  Producer Segment
directors and Julie Gomez of the Services Segment, are requesting Bill
Boswell to
continue  as  chairman throughout 2002, and these segments will then resume
their  rotation at the end of Bill's extended term.  This is similar to the
situation  which  occurred  when Steve Chesebro' continued as chairman from
June  1994  to  March 1996, after which, Mary Jane McCartney rotated to the
chairmanship.

Bill  Boswell  was  asked  and has agreed to do so long as it was clear the
request  was  from  the Producer Segment as next in line for the chair, and
provided Julie Gomez as second in line also requested this to be handled in
that manner.  This has been done with both the producer directors and Julie
also requesting this issue be clarified now so as to provide GISB and NAESB
with clear continuity into next year.

Pursuant  to  the bylaws, the existing officers will continue through 2002;
therefore,   Bill   Boswell   will  continue  as  chairman,  the  producers
subsequently  will  name  a  first vice chair in place of Hugh Roberts, and
Julie Gomez will remain as second vice chair.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston or hearing from you over the phone on
December 5 -- Best Regards, Rae
