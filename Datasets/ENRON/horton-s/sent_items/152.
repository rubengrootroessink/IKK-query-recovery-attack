I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.  However, I get very=
 nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due dil=
igence.  Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.=
  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1=
 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.  As to your involvement, you m=
ade the right call.

Stan/Jeff:

I have been contacted by a number of close friends/business contacts that w=
ant to put together a deal to buy a number of our smaller assets, primarily=
 the power assets.  The strategy they have in mind is simple.  They want to=
 offer us a lightning quick sale of a package of small non-core assets that=
 together would be a material deal that could be announced and help stabili=
se our situation.  They would then be able to manage in a more orderly mann=
er either the sale or continued operation of the assets and hopefully reali=
se a premium over what they pay us.  They have power and energy industry ex=
perience.  In the interest of full disclosure, they asked me to participate=
 in the deal, but I have said that probably makes a negotiated deal unlikel=
y given the related party concerns.  I indicated if they want to do a deal,=
 they will have to leave me out of it. They have indicated a willingness to=
 conduct due diligence over ten days, sign an agreement and announce the de=
al and then close by end of the year, but only if we can begin immediately.=
  They are assuming we would put a priority on both announcing and funding =
a deal quickly.  They are willing to structure around issues to meet this o=
bjective.

I intend to meet with these guys and make my own judgement as to the legiti=
macy of the proposal.  I think they are considering a transaction of betwee=
n 100 - 200 million.  It would probably involve a half dozen or so assets. =
 Not a huge deal, but it would efficiently get rid of some cats and dogs.  =
It probably qualifies as a "fire sale", but might make sense anyway.

Your thoughts?
