Stan - 

Phil forwarded (to me) your response (see below) to the e mail he had sent regarding the Robin Border memo. I concur with your thoughts on trust and will continue my efforts in that regard. 

'Thanks for the update.  Doesn't appear as Robin is helping out any.  I am not sure why Dana values his opinions so much on this topic.  Keep working the progress.  The key people you need to make happy are Robert and Dan.  I trust that Mike is developing a effective relationship with them and Dana.  Trust is essential in making this partnership work.'  

I've been meeting with a nunber of the ETS folks that have been working on EOTT issues and assignments, and although we have been working hard, we simply have some additional work to do in the areas of communication, which I will address and facilitate. We meet with the commercial folks on Tuesday after the normal EOTT Staff Meeting regarding the Enhanced Integrity Plan, where we can hopefully move forward. In addition, I will put together a presentation outlining the 2002 EOTT Integrity Plan for presentation the next time the commercial folks meet. It will also include facts of our on-going remediation plan and  hydrotest / pigging efforts for 2001.     

In my opinion, the EOTT operations assignment has been a challenge for ETS. ETS - and Phil in particular - has dedicated tremendous effort to significantly enhance EOTT operations. Few could have tackled the EOTT operational challenges as well as Phil has. Besides the fact that it may not have been a popular decision at EOTT to relinquish control of Operations, he has done an outstanding job in keeping his staff focused on performance with integrity and quality, all the time within a financial framework that adds value to the overall picture of Enron and EOTT. It has not been easy. I am confident you recognize how well he has changed the face of operations in ETS and EOTT as you have changed the face of both organizations overall.

Best wishes for a good Thanksgiving.
