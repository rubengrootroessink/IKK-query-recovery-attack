Stan,

We are all shocked to read the news although I guess given the way the press
and the markets have acted recently not surprised.

For the employees here we are delivering a very clear business as usual
message.  Press enquiries we are routing to Enron.  The UK press is full of
speculation that Wessex Water is to be sold.

When the dust settles it will be useful to discuss what happens now.  In
particular we need to decide how we deal with AEL refinancing etc.

There is no rush but when you have a minute I would welcome a word.

Colin
