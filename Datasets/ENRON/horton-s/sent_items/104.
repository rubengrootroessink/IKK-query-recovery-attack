Thanks Ken.  The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about Enron's pipelines and about me coming over.  The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.  I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.  I would like to see this thing through.  I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.  I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.  My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.  Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.  Either way I will be fine.  Thanks for your concern.  It means alot.

Stan

I hope everything is going to work out ok for you. I just read about Lay
turning down his 60,000,000.00, when are they going to decide who stays and
goes?? I hope you have a buyout clause in your contract!!!!!!!!write when you
have a chance,just wanted you to know I was thinking of you.  Ken
