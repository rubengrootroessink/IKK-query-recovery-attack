Hello there.  How are you today?  I have  a test in mythology today and an accounting thing to go to tonight where I meet  some of the reps. from some of the companies Trinity deals with through our  internship program.  It's at 7:00pm so I'll give you a call afterwards and  tell you how it goes.  I hope you have a good day today and I'll talk to  you later.  I'll give you an update on how Rose is doing when I find out  from Mom or Jennifer.  I love you!!
Love,
Caron
