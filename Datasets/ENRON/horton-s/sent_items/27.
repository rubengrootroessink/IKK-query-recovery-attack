It is a bad day getting worse.  Any more questions about how I am doing?  If it rains I am going out and standing in it because it will mean my day is actually improving.  Talk with you later.

Good morning.  How are you today?  I'm good but tired.  I was very happy to see it was no longer raining this morning although I think there is still a good chance of rain today.  I'm sure if it does rain it will wait till 5pm so I have to walk to the bus in it but oh well.  I do have my umbrella (for whatever good that will do me!!).  Thanks again for the ride home yesterday.  I love you and hope you have a good day.  I'll talk to you later.
Love,
Caron
