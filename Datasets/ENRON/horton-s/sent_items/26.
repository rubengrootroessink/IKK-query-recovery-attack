Lunch is not good this week.  I have a business lunch tomorrow.  Thursday is the GISB Board meeting.  Are you going?  I"ll give you a ride there and to your car afterwards if you do not need to come back downtown to work.  Let me know.

Dad

Good morning.  How are you today?  Mom told me you called last night and would be at EOTT all day, but I know you can get your email there.  :)  So how does the rest of the week look for lunch?  Are you free Wed. or Thurs.?  Let me know.  Next week I'll be gone to Regionals!!  I can't believe it has come up so fast.  I can't wait, but I also remember just how unpredictable Regionals can be so I don't want to get my hopes up about anything.  Of course, my two kids are being little angels which is making me feel pretty good about my chances so we'll see what happens.  Well, I better go do some actual work (although no one is even here yet so I'm not sure what exactly I'm supposed to do this morning), but oh well.  I'll talk to you later.  Have a good day.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron
PS - Hopefully I will get my paycheck today!!!!!!  :)
