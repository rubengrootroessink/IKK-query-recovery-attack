Stan,

A quick update-

I expect to sign and return the ANNGTC MOU tomorrow.
A contingent of the current and rejoining partners will meet with Senators in DC on Thursday.  Joe Hartsoe will represent us.
Following meetings with Senators, a joint press release will be issued announcing the MOU.  Gina Taylor and John Ambler are vetting the release/Q+A's; Gina will be the media contact.

I'll forward a complete package for your files when finalized.
