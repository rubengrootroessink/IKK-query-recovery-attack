I have it on my calendar and Debbie would like to come also.  The plane can only fit so many so be careful you don't over invite if they are counting on the plane for transportation.

Thanks.

Stan - We would like to invite you and Debbie to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha. We are having a combined ETS/NBP wild blowout. We are planning a social hour at 6:30 with dinner at 7:30 and service awards after dinner. After that the dancing begins, and McGowan starts wearing funny hats.
Mike is inviting Danny and if it works out that you bring the plane up, we would probably ask Shelly, Rod, Phil, etc. to see if any of your or Danny's staff would like to join us also

    Bill.
