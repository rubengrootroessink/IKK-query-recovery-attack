Thank you.  I feel I have neglected Wessex and you with all that is going on.  The truth is that John, Michael and you are very capable of proceeding with little input from me.  I did make sure with Corporate Development that Michael had to be involved along with you and your team.  Communication here is not the greatest so please keep me updated.  Thanks.

Stan

As with you I guess, the week has been dominated by the fall out from the
Enron problems.  We have focused on reassuring suppliers, customers and
employees that Wessex Water will continue to trade as a viable business.

We have agreed a way forward with Mark Muller and Michael Anderson on the
potential sale of Wessex.  The intention is a package deal that involves the
buyer of Wessex first dealing with the Azurix high yield bonds.

Enron/Azurix are appointing a bank to handle the process.  We have three
serious contenders - WestLB, RBS and Barclays.  Due diligence will start at
the end of next week/beginning of the following week.

I will keep you posted.

Colin
