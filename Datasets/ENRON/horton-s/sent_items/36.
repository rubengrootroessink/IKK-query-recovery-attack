It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.
