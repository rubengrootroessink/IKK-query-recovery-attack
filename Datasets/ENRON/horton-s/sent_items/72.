Too bad about the Saporito's.  It's tough to see a family break apart.  It was nice that ours could stay together even if it is non-traditional.  You know how much I care about your Mom's happiness and welfare.

Too bad about your week coming up but considering the two weeks I have had you get no sympathy.  I will be here late tonight.

Love Dad..

GET THE WSJ EARLY TOMORROW!

Hey there.  How are you today?  I'm soooo  tired but okay otherwise.  I looked at my schedule for next week last night  only to realize next week is going to be the most horrible week EVER!!!!  I  have a Greek and Roman History test Monday, a stats test Wednesday, and both a  b. law test and an accounting test on Thursday.  Way too many tests in the  same week especially with two on the same day!!!!!!!!!  I'm sure I'll live  through it but next week won't be fun for sure.  
    By the way, I just thought I'd  let you know that Joe Saporito left Lynne and the girls and is getting a divorce  from Lynne.  Because of that Lynne, Lauren, and Rachel are going to come  have Thanksgiving with Mom and I.  I just thought you might want to know  that since I know you like the girls a lot.  
    Well, that's all the news I've  got.  I read the WSJ for yesterday and have today's but haven't read it  yet.  I am becoming very informed.  It's very interesting for  sure.  I love you and will call you tonight. 
Love,
Caron
