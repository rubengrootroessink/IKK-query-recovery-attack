Dear Stan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!  

Kindest regards,  Ray
