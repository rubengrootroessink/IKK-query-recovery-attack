Thanks for the article. It was good to see and talk to you again, if you need
help scheduling a time in dec. for Orlando let me know if I can help. Good
luck with your decision making in the coming weeks and know that the quality
of your christmas gift depends on the amount of my enron losses. !!!!! But
don't allow that to interfere with right and wrong. Keep in touch when you
can.  Ken
