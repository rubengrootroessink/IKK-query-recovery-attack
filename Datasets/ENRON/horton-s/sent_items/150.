Hi there Dad!!  How's today shaping up to be....better than yesterday I
hope??  My day has been okay.  Good news...I got a 23 out of a possible 25
on my b. law test from right before thanksgiving.  What the good grade means
is that I'm still making a strong A in there (a 94 I think) so I'm a very
happy girl.  Other than that my day has been quiet.  It's really getting
cold here and has been really windy which makes it seem colder.  I'm sure
you are getting this great weather as well by now so warning it's really
chilly.  Poor David went out to his car today and discovered he had a flat
tire from a nail that he must have picked up yesterday when we went to the
grocery store.  He's having AAA come fix it.  That's about all the exciting
news I have to report today.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!!!!!!!!
Love,
Caron
