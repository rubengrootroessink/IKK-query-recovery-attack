Hello - how is your day going??  Just think  it's almost Friday!!!!!!  I'm so glad, I'm ready for the weekend.   Nothing exciting here today.  Just homework and a nap probably.   Tonight I'll be cooking and marinating in preparation for david and I's big  cookout tomorrow night.  I'm making fajitas, my famous 7-layer dip, and  spinach puffs.  Plus we'll have the normal ammenities like chips and salsa,  ranch dip, refried beans.  I'm excited - it should be fun.  Well, I'll  talk to you tonight sometime.  I love you and miss you  bunches!!!!!
Love,
Caron
