Long term investors get rewarded.  Hang in there.  You haven't lost until you have sold.  Be careful not to let your losses turn into long-term losses.  Short-term losses are treated as ordinary income for tax purposes meaning Uncle Sam absorbs 40% of your losses!  Then buyback and hold for a few years.
