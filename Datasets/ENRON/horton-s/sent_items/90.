Hi Daddy!!!!!  I haven't gotten my WSJ today,  but I will or you can bring yours home for me to read if you want to.   :)  I can't wait to come home today.  I miss you bunches!!  I  haven't seen you in too long a time.  Are we still on for lunch  Saturday??  I hope so!!  Anyway, I'm not sure when I'll get home  today.  My last class gets out at 2:30, but David has an appointment at the  urologist at 3:00 so we can't leave till that's over so I'm not real sure when  we'll get out of here.  I know we're leaving right after that to come  home.  I'll give you a call tonight sometime though.  I love you and  will see you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Love,
caron
