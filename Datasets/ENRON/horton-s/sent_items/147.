Stan,

I wanted to thank you again for your guidance through my recent organizational changes.  I want you to know that I am in firm support of wherever you carry the flag, no matter what it may say on that flag.  If you need me and my team to take a hill, we'll make it happen.

Others in the group appreciated my staying, as presented in the following notes, but I would not have been in the position to make this decision without your support.

You and the family have a well deserved Happy Thanksgiving.

Appreciatively,
Steve

Steve, I hope you are not disappointed, because I am sure I speak for the majority in saying we did not want you to leave us.  Thanks for staying.
