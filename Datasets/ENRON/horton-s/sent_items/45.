Stan

The Wessex sale process seems to be proceeding well.  So far we have made
presentations to Barclays, RBS, WestLB, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, ENEL
and Candover.  There should be another six or seven early in the new year
with the aim of getting firm bids by about 18 January.

We are trying to kill any media interest although with so many people
involved this is always going to be difficult.  Michael Anderson has been
doing a great job in co-ordinating the process.

Meanwhile, in the real world, the business is going pretty well although we
are running through a very dry period at a time when we would expect to be
achieving groundwater recharge.  We are having to utilise more expensive
river sources to rest the groundwater and provide security for the summer.

Have a good holiday.

Colin
