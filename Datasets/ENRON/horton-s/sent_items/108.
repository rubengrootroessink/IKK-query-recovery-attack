Stan, I know you have a lot going on right now and probably don't need more=
 emails that seem to be coming from off the wall but I felt the need to exp=
ress some of my thoughts about what's going on right now and I hope you wil=
l take just a minute to listen.  As you get older, you seem to reflect more=
 on things that are happening around you and how it affects you and those a=
round you.  Some might perceive this message as "sucking up" or "jockeying =
for position" but nothing could be farther from the truth.  This one is fro=
m the heart. =20

First, I want to say that I believe that many of us in the pipelines have t=
aken for granted over the years the kind and quality of leadership that we =
have had.  I want to thank you for being the kind of leader that you have b=
een, one that's honest, straight forward, tells it like it is and yet will =
make the tough calls when they need to be made, but always in the interest =
of the company, the employees and its shareholders.  I've been fortunate to=
 be able to work with you over the last ten or so years and know that you h=
ave lived the Enron values.  Had others run their business units the way yo=
u have run the pipes, I truly belive that we would not be where we are at t=
oday. Thank you for being the kind of leader you are.  I for one appreciate=
 it.  =20

For those of us that have poured our hearts and souls into this company for=
 most of our life, these are tough times and I know that you can certainly =
relate to that.  And while my financial well being and security has certain=
ly been impacted, there are others out there far worse off than me and I ac=
tually feel like I am truly blessed.  Blessed to have been a part of such a=
 great company, blessed to work with the kind of people that have made this=
 company what it is and blessed to have the opportunity to rebuild a new an=
d even better company.  There are things in life much more important than m=
oney, family (grandsons), life, challenges in your work, health and happine=
ss.  I don't know what the future holds for me or the company, I just know =
it's part of a much bigger plan that I can't control.  I also know that we =
can't look back.  What's done is done and it happend for a reason.  What we=
 have to do is move on.  If there's a meaningful  role for me as we go forw=
ard, I will approach it with the same commitment, dedication and enthusiasm=
 that I have any job I have had.  If there's not, I'm at peace with that to=
o.  The success of this company, past, present and future will always be in=
 our people.  Thanks for the time and thanks for the leadership you have pr=
ovided ETS all these years. =20

WOW, does this sound depressing or what?  It's really not meant to be.  I h=
ave a great attititude about what the future holds. Have a great day.
