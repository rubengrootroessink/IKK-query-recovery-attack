Stan - Thank you for taking the time to brief the employees in Omaha today.  Needless to say, these are trying times and you are correct when you say that communications are very important!  All of us have to provide leadership and set the example for the employees.  We really appreciate your leadership and commitment to the employees!!!  It really does mean a lot to the employees.

Thank You very much.

Mike McGowan
