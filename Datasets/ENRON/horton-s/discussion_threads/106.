Guys,

Regarding Tim's fax dealing with Bush's position on American Indians--I have 
been working with Ken Lay and Mark Palmer  since about last June trying to  
help Bush's staff develop an American Indian policy platform.  Frankly, 
they've been somewhat of a reluctant audience, but hey, since when has that 
ever diminished my enthusiasm? 

 I'll keep you apprised of the substance of any progress.

Thanks!

--Christie.
