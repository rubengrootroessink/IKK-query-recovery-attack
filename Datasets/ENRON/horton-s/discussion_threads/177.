Stan, Hugh & Bill:
Thanks for responding to me on this item.  While you have public email
addresses, concern was noted that Board members not be provided with
unsolicited emails simply because they are GISB Board members.  I will see
Miriam (AGA representative) next week respond to AGA that we are not in the
practice of providing Board member emails to other than Board members.  I
would be happy to forward his comments to the Board or have them posted for
public review -- as we have asked for comments on this subject.    Thanks, 
Rae
