Dear task force members,

At the conclusion of the call, we said we would include a motion for the
intent of the Board, (see below).  Please let me know if you have any changes:

It is the intent of the Board of Directors to endorse a direction that GISB
change its organization to permit the development of retail and wholesale
standards for the natural gas and electric markets, assuming that the
industry evidences sufficient commitment within the next 90 days, both
monetarily and with necessary manpower, to support such efforts.  The changes
to the GISB organization would be structured to ensure fair and balanced
representation for all industry segments -- both gas & electric.
