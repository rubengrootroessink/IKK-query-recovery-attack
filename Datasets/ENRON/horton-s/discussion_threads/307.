Stan:
 Attached, for your review and comment, are several drafts of communications 
pieces that you have requested in conjunction with the organization changes 
we are announcing next week.
 The first is a draft of an "FYI from GPG" to explain the why behind the 
reorg.  You and I discussed sending it out sometime around Wednesday, July 
19th.  


 The other three drafts are proposed approaches to customer letters--the 
first of which regards Larry's retirement and Bill's appointment to succeed 
him, the second to go to FGT's customers amplifying on Rock's new role and 
Danny's arrival, and the third to Northern's/Transwestern's customers 
regarding Bill's departure and Danny's new role.



 I would appreciate it if I could get your reaction ASAP.  I expect to be out 
of the office for several days following our return from Omaha Monday 
afternoon, and would like to put in place whatever needs to be done to get 
all these items out in whatever timeframe you deem appropriate.
 
  d.s.
