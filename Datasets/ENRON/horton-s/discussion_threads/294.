"and provided further, that if the General Partner determines in its good
faith judgment that a postponement for up to four months of the filing or
effectiveness of the requested registration or the sales pursuant to an
effective registration would be in the best interests of EEP and its
Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or other event, the
filing or effectiveness of such registration statement or any sales pursuant
thereto may be deferred for up to four months, but not thereafter."
