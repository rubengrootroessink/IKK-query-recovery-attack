PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL


Please see the request that was made by the Navajo EPA to Larry Campbell (one 
of our New Mexico Division Environmental Specialists) below.  The Navajo EPA 
has no jurisdiction over pipeline safety and there is a serious question as 
to whether the  expertise exists within the Navajo EPA to interpret the 
corrosion records we keep.   

Dave Johnson and John Shafer have advised the lads to funnel this request and 
similar requests through our p/l safety group, legal and the VP of Operations 
and be extermely careful in our responses.  However, this request presents 
its own special issues.  I'll speak to John Gormley and ask him to say simply 
that he will pass the request along.

Rather than respond indiviually, it seems we would wish to coordinate a 
response with at least El Paso and Questar.  Thgts??

Subject: Corrosion Records Request for Pipeline on the Navajo Nation

I received a call from Ronnie Ben (520) 871-7995 of the Navajo Nation EPA 
requesting corrosion records for all pipelines owned by Transwestern on the 
Navajo Nation.  We talked for awhile and I informed him that John Gormley in 
Albuquerque handled corrosion on those portions of the Transwestern line on  
reservation lands.  He said that he would be contacting John and a request 
will be made for all corrosion records and compliance activities for 
pipelines on the reservation. This may be a ripple effect from the El Paso 
incident near Carlsbad, N.M. which happened a couple of weeks ago.
