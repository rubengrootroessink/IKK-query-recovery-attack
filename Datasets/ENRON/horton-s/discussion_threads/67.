To followup on your comment Stan, to sell the line,  this is already sold 
with certificate authority to KN, however, they have requested an extension 
until 7/31 to allow Oneok to review and decide.  this is part of the 
Skelleytown system, and it is the area that we want sold--   I don't believe 
that we have granted them the extended date  yet and maybe we can use this in 
conjuction with the Hobbs line where we didn't get the required info on 
pressure for maop purposes.  Just some thoughts--  MK
