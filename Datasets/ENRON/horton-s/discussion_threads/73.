PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION


At approximately 11:30 a.m. today 2/17/00, there was a release of 
approximately 80 barrels of crude oil.  The crude oil entered an unnamed 
tributary near the Northwest corner of Caddo Lake.  The release was contained 
approximately 50 yards from the lake entrance.  The release occurred from a 
3" or 4" infield gathering line between a production facility and EOTT's 
Trees Station.  The release occurred approximately one mile east of Trees, 
LA.  The pipeline integrity was compromised by a tree limb.  It is believed 
that during the last freeze the tree limb fell on the gathering line.  This 
gathering line has not been run since before the freeze.  All appropriate 
agency notifications have been made.  The following EOTT personnel have been 
verbally notified: Cutty Cunningham; Mary Ellen Coombe; Molly Sample.  I 
suggest this be forwarded to Mike Burke, Cutty Cunnungham, Mary Ellen Coombe, 
Dana Gibbs and Robert Sandford
