Attached is the final program (Word format) with times, places, speakers and
titles, and who is doing the introducing/moderating.  We have, in the last 48
hours, had to accommodate several speaker adjustments at their requests --
due to inability to attend (Raul Monteforte/Alejandro Brena, Bobby
Perez/Paula Miles) and travel schedule restrictions based on hearings on
pending legislation (Cathy Van Way).  All in all, this should be final -- and
JoAnn and I have the gray hairs to prove it!

Bios and script (including the changes above) should be provided shortly.  Rae
