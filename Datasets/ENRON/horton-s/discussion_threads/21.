Cutty is very enthusiastic about joining the EOTT team and taking on the 
"insurmountable challege".  He is also willing to begin initially with an 
organizational structure that has 
           administrative/commercial reporting to the Regional Business 
Managers and functional/technical reporting to Operations Governance.  He is 
planning on joing us on 2/1/2000 and I know he will make a major contribution 
to our future success.
