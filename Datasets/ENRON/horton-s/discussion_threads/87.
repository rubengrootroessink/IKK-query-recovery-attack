Stan,
I plan to participate on tomorrow's conference call on your behalf. 

I met with Rae earlier today and had a quick preview of this document.  The 
crux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote 
at the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward 
with pursuing retail standards.

If the procedural vote is "yes," then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and 
Bill Boswell start drafting the governance documents.  I mentioned that I 
would like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your 
representative.

I think that the attached backround and Feb. 14 meeting summary is fine.  I 
have lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document -- 
but these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions.  
I'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point.   Rae reports 
that Warren Mitchell of SoCal Gas, Reliant, End-Users and a number of state 
commissioners are firmly behind moving forward.
