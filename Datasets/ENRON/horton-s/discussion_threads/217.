Stan -

I was wondering if you could provide my with feedback from the meeting
yesterday with representatives from EEI concerning the GISB scope issue.  I
attended the last meeting at FERC and left with the distinct impression that
there was little enthusiasm for GISB's proposal from the electric industry
representatives.  From William's perspective, we support the concept of
standards for the electric industry.  However, the mechanics and structure
should not dilute the sector balance we have achieved or drain our limited
resources in terms of people and funding.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ron
