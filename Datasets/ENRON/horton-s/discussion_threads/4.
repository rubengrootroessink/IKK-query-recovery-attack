Rod, please find the enclosed first glance comparison of the El Paso offer.  
Please fwd this to Rock and Mike Moran after you have read it.  As it turned 
out, I got diverted to my PNet meeting in Las Vegas, and I plan to be out of 
here by mid Monday afternoon.  I will call you early Monday morning to 
discuss this memo and the offer.  Lets plan on an early Tuesday meeting with 
Stan/Rock/Mike/you and I?  Your call.
