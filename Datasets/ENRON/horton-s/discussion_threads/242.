Mary Ellen could you help me with two matters:
1.  Before we make the final decision on selecting a consultant group on team 
building for EOTT's leadership, I would 
like to meet with the principals.  Could you please give me their phone 
numbers.

2.  And following up on an earlier request could you please give me the 
ratings and rankings of our employee group that we 
conducted at the end of 1999.

Thanks for your help.
