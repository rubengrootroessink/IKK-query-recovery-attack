Based upon discussions with L. Dietz and S. Misner ( Kansas ) who, are 
working with C. Presgrove (Oklahoma ) to control the vols. and BS&W  received 
unmetered via truck into the Kansas system. Last winter the water content of 
such crude transported via pipe to our Ok. system was unacceptable ( 1+% ) 
therefore, the pipeline from Ok. to Ka. has been targeted for measurement 
improvement. L. Dietz is working with C. Presgrove to identify surplus 
equipment in an effort to reduce the cost of this project. The locations, 
vols. and original cost estimate are as follows.

Based upon the above, I recommend approval of this proposed project pending a 
revised cost estimate. The remaining un- metered  truck injection stations 
located in Kansas will be a 2001 project.
