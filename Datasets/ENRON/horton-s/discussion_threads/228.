Bob Baird and I are already working with Tye Darland at Koch on this general 
issue.  Tye is Koch's in-house securities lawyer.  Shelly should not call 
Koch.  Instead, Bob and I should arrange any larger EOTT/Koch meeting through 
Tye or we could wind up with confusion and possible legal difficulties.  At 
this juncture, Bob and I think it best to let the lawyers for the two sides 
handle the initial discussions on these matters (because there are potential 
inside information issues involved, etc.).  If you agree, Bob and I will 
contact Tye Darland to see how Koch wishes to proceed.

Also, everyone needs to be aware that we still have a contractual duty to 
Koch to facilitate the sale of their EOTT units through a registration 
process.  Due to our late 10-Q filing, we will now have to do an S-1 
registration for Koch instead of an S-3, and this will be considerably more 
expensive and involved.

Mike/Steve-

I think that we need to set up a meeting with Koch to discuss their request 
to sell shares and our current issue re the first quarter.  I suggest that 
Shelly call Koch -and set up the meeting.  If you agree please respond so 
Shelly can set up.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

Dana
