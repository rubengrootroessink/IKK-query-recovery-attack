Are you aware of what has been happenning at EOTT lately?  

ARE YOU INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHERE EOTT'S NEW CORPORATE OFFICE WILL BE??

Do you know about Power Optimization...or Data Warehousing?  What about our 
EOTT Heroes?  Can you name those employees that have been here longer than 15 
years???  Interested in details on some of our field facilities.

OR What about some FUN mind games?  Interested?  We sure hope so!  I would 
like to welcome our first quarter 2000 EOTT Connection.

The EOTT Connection is available via our intranet - by clicking on the Quick 
Links calendar icon .

I hope all of you will take the time to read through the articles....valuable 
information can be found on every page! 
Don't try to digest it all in one setting.  The power of this new medium is 
that you can access it quickly and always
know where to find it.
