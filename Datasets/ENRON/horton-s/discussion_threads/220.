Thanks, Stan.

And again, thank you for the hospitality.

I think next steps (in chrono order) are:

- EEI Task Force agrees with results of Houston meeting (in progress)
- GISB Board postpones electric decision and sets up group to work with us
- EEI Board agrees with Task Force approach (June 19-21)
- Group agreement on Principles (after EEI Bd)
- Group identifiication, discussion of organizational alternatives (after EEI 
Bd)
- Group agreement on organization
- EEI Board Report & action item approval
- On to detailed design & implementation

I frankly don't know if the EEI Board will agree to internal Principles and 
to investigation of organizational solutions in one sitting.  My temptation 
and recommendation is to go for it, but one can never be sure.

We need to figure out a way to work the last two items with an absolute 
minimum of physical meetings.  Perhaps I could set up a list server just for 
the players.

Your thoughts?

Thanks
  -Mike

Mike:

Just a note to thank you for helping set up the meeting with EEI's CEO Task
Force.

I thought it was a good exchange of ideas, concerns and positions.

What do you expect the next steps in the process to be?

Stan
