This letter is to confirm our discussion of Thursday June 15 that I have 
accepted a position with another company and my last day at EOTT will be June 
30, 2000.  I have enjoyed my career at EOTT and the professional 
relationships that I have developed over the past seven years.  

I wish EOTT the best of success in the future.  

Sincerely, 
John Oveson
