Stan,

Having circulated the attached meeting summary, action steps, and principles 
to the group, and having heard only affirmative comment, I believe we will 
use the attached as the go forward plan for our CEO meeting.

It is right in line with our earlier discussion.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  I'll be out of 
the country 6/1-6/6.  It would be most appreciated if someone would advise me 
of GISB Board actions as soon as they occur.

Thanks
  -Mike
