Rae, I think that is too strong for our purposes.  Here is my redraft:

     RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors endorses the efforts undertaken at
its behest since the December 1999 meeting to determine the level of interest
in, and whether and how GISB should expand its focus to address electric and 
gas
wholesale and retail standards, and

     Further RESOLVED, that the Board directs its officers and the task force
established in December 1999 to continue meeting with interested parties to
gather their input and financial and other support, and to prepare drafts of 
the
documents necessary to effectuate any required structural changes, should the
Board determine to put them into effect, and

     Further RESOLVED, that the officers and task force shall report back to 
the
Board at its June 2000 meeting regarding their activities and progress.

Bill Boswell
