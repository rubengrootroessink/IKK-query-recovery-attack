Subject: Entergy - Desoto County Project / Potential Change in FP&L "Strategy"

Per discussions with Entergy today regarding the Desoto County peaking 
project:
 - Entergy has an internal meeting planned later this week to decide if they 
want to continue with the project
 - The Desoto site is one of the sites which IPS did the groundwork for, as 
far as permitting, etc.

 * Entergy has a meeting scheduled with FPL to discuss a "tolling 
arrangement, whereby FP&L would provide gas        deliveries to obtain a 
portion of the power output  ------  Note:  I said this would be a major 
change in FP&L's         business approach and Entergy indicated FP&L appears 
to be changing their thinking regarding merchant power        plants and that 
FP&L may announce a new "position" on merchant plants in the next few weeks
