In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had 
some issues with your new Broadband business.  Please provide me with some 
more detail as follows:

It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark 
fiber.  How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?  Are we laying the 
dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated 
capital expenditures annually for this venture.  Who are the customers?  What 
is the expected return?  What is the payback on our investment, etc.

Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?

Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and 
where we are going with it.
