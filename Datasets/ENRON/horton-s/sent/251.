Thanks, John, I will add Sarita to my "cc" list.    And, yes, we'll get both 
you and Phil on Stan's calendar to go over the "Operations Alliances" 
topic...I will await their call to schedule.

Cindy

Cindy,
Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future "cc" 
lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John

P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable 
date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to 
go over the "Operations Alliances" with him (since his half day staff meeting 
was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be 
in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS
