Subject: systems use


Hi

I am the systems security administrator. I am in the process of cleaning up
the systems user lists. Your name is on the user list but it does not seem
to be on the employee/ETS  lists that I have. Please let me know if you are
an employee so I do not delete your access in the clean up.

Thanks
