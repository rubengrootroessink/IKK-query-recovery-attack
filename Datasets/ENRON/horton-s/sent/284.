Subject: PGE Position Report

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position 
Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via 
telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is 
being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early 
next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.
