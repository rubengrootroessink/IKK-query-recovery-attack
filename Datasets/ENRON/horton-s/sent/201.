Subject: Methane Auto

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in 
a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an 
unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check 
to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to 
these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% 
-  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry
