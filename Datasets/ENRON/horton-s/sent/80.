Thank you for sending these reports to me.  They are informative and timely.  
By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?  She has asked 
me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she 
had mailed it in.  Please let me know.

Thanks to you and David for the outstanding service.

Stan
