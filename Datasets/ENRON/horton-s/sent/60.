Thank you for a very successful holiday party.  Debbie and I thoroughly 
enjoyed the evening.  Your hard work definitely paid-off for our entire 
organization.

I would like to host a lunch for the committee, after the holidays, as a way 
of thanking you.   I will have Cindy coordinate your schedules.

Thanks again,
Stan
