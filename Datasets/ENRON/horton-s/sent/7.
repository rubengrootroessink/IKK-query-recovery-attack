I am at EOTT this morning.  Glad we early voted.  I think Bush has it and I 
don't think it will be that close.  Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go.  
If they go Bush; its over.  If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if 
he takes Michigan.  Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.

I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.  

Sorry you don't feel well especially since this your your long day.  Good 
luck on your test.  I will be at the Rockets game tonight with tthe guys.

Email later this afternoon.

Love, Dad
