I go to Washington DC tomorrow morning returning on Wednesday evening.  I 
will not be in the office either day.  Do you want tickets to Astros game on 
Friday night?  If so let me know.  They play St. Louis with Mark McGuire.  I 
know you will do great this week.  You are always prepared.  Good Luck.
