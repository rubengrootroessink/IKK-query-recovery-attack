Thank you for agreeing to be a speaker at INGAA's Annual Security Analysts 
Conference, scheduled for July 12-14 at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado.

INGAA hosts this conference every year as a forum for the 25-30 top natural 
gas analysts to meet with CEO's and other industry leaders.  

You will be participating on a panel on natural gas supply, scheduled for 
8:15 to 10:00 a.m. Friday, July 13.  As a panelist, we would like to hear 
your views on the natural gas demand and deregulation, and you are more than 
welcome to join us for the entire meeting if your schedule allows.

You will be receiving a complete packet of material details from INGAA.

Don't hesitate to call me if you have any additional questions.

Stan
