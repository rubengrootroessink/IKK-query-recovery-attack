I am open for luch Wednesday and Thursday.  Let me know which fits your 
calendar the best.  DK did tell me about the Mark Marin tournament.  If your 
Mom saved the paper let me have it for reference.  Did you see the Sunday 
paper RE: the 100 highest paid executives in Houston?

Dad

Good morning Daddy!!!  How are you today?  Did you enjoy your nice long 
weekend?  Did Debbie tell you about the golf tournament Mark Martin is 
hosting in New Smyrna the week you'll be there that you can play in or at 
least watch?  If not, I'll tell you all about it tonight.  Have a great day, 
and I'll talk to you tonight.  By the way, let me know if you have any days 
free for lunch this week.  I love you!!
Love,
Caron
