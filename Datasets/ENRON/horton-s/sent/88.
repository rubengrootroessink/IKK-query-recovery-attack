Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest 
and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at 
hand.

Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I 
have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done 
by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!
