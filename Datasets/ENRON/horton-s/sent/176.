If you are bored go work out!  That is time consuming and good for you.  That 
is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it 
on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 
and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you 
got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.

Have fun at the game tonight.  My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting
to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David
flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit
card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he
sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the
credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You
can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you.
With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we
left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have
nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for
a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do
like......SHOP!!!!!  No I'm just kidding - I wouldn't do that.  Well, I'll
talk to you sometime this week and have fun tonight.  I hope the rugrats
feel better soon for their sake and ya'lls!!!!  I love you!!!!
    Love,
    Caron
