Good morning.  I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a 
little while.  Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I.  Fell like 
I am coming down with something.  Talk with you later tonight.  Sorry I 
didn,t get to talk with you last night.  Both babies were real fussy and we 
had to work hard to get them down.  I did a pretty good job with Jason!

I look forward to you getting home for Turkey Day!

Dad
