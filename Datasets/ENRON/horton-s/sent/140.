I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of
your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod
who checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to either
kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 

1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the
transactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.

2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or
seller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this business
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a
sale? 
3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval. The projected Phase I
capital is above my threshold. 

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you. Sound like
a plan?
