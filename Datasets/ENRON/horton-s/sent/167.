As you heard Stan Horton say y'day, he will get Jim Davis cleared to work
on our TxNMx Quality Management Project pronto.  Jim, thanks for good
presentation and excellent footwork leading to it.

Jim Davis was advised Friday that he should not spend any development time
on the Jal project until it has cleared ETS planning group.   Jim will make
the tour Monday but will then be unavailable to us on this project until
this instruction is changed or the project makes it through channels.   Jim
indicated that he received this instruction from Rick Johnson and Mr.
Martin, (didn't get the first name).  Mr.  Martin reports to Phil Lowry.
