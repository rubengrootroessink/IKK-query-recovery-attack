Ms. Conners:

Thank you for your recent letter regarding my personal financial 
situation.    I do appreciate your concern and interest; however, I have a 
very qualified financial advisor who handles ALL of my personal financial 
needs.

Please remove my name from your written correspondence/phone call contact 
list.

Sincerely,
Stan Horton
Enron
