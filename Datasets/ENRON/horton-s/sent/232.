Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to 
attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to 
get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went 
to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her 
to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks 
for the invitation!
