Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou 
would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus 
should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all 
of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention 
bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave 
before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place 
that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should 
we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently 
offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA 
assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those 
positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual 
agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced 
severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford 
and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for 
him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.
