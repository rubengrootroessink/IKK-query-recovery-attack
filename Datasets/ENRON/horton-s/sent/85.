The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of 
Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested 
groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.

Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences 
between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of 
similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by 
the end of January.  
GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two 
proposals which have been advanced thus far.
