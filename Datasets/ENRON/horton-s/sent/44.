Thanks for the strawman.  I would like to discuss it at our GISB Board 
meeting on December 7th.  Any problems with doing that?  We have distributed 
to the Board Committee only.  My initial reaction is there is alot we agree 
on but there is much we do not agree on.  Let me know about the Board meeting.

Also, this Board meeting will be my last as Chairman.  I do not know what 
role, if any, Bill Boswell  (the incoming Chairman) would like me to play in 
the future in this effort.
