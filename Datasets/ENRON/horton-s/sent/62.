You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better 
enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.  You never get another chance 
at today!!  End of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday!

You are welcome to the car.  I will try to bring it tonight or better still 
can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.  Either way is ok.
