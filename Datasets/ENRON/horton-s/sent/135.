I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of 
your proposed broadband project.  They aren't doing anything according to Rod 
who checked for me.  It seems to me that we need to do several things to 
either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a 
sale.  

1.  We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the 
transactions being proposed.  I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this 
issue.
2.  We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer 
or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.  If they want to be in this business 
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a 
sale?
3.  A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.  The projected Phase I 
capital is above my threshold.

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you.  Sound 
like a plan?
