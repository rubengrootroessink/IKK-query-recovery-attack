> > handle it, and to give in to fear is to
> > give away the right to live life on your terms.
> > And you learn to fight for your life and not to

> > You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't

> > You learn that feelings such as anger, envy, and
> > resentment must be understood and redirected, or they
> > will suffocate the life out of you and poison the
> > universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when

> > you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can
> > listen to the wind. And you make it a point
> > to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to

> > your heart and with God by your side,
> > you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you
