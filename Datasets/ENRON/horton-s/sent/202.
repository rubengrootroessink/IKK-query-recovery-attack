Subject: Annual Election of Officers


At the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, we typically elect EOTT's
slate of officers for the next 12 months.  I have attached a draft
resolution which provides for the reelection of EOTT's current slate of
officers.  Please let me know if I need to make any changes to this
proposed slate before it is included in the board materials.

Thank you for your assistance.
