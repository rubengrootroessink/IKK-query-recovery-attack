Stan. I am a glutton for punishment with now pursuing my MBA. But it is 
energizing (pardon, the pun) and very enjoyable. In light of this, I am to 
interview a leader about certain aspects of leadership, i.e. does leadership 
develop with experience, have there been one or two instrumental experiences 
that were signficant in developing your own leadeship style?

As my leader, would you have about 30 minutes or so, sometime this week, to 
discuss your ideas about leadership with me? To maximize your time, I would 
be glad to provide all questions in advance so I don't waste any time.

Please let me know and I hope you can visit with me.
