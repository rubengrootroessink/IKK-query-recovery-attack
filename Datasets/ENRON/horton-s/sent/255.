Stan,
Attached below are four PAAs for employees in Steve Hotte's organization who 
worked on the P-Gas project.  Steve discussed these with both you and I.  
Three of the four are for $3,000 each (the other is for $1,000).  Typically 
your approval has been requested for PAAs greater than $2,000.  Please reply 
by email if you approve this request.
Gary
