I recieved the same document.  If you would distribute it to the committee 
that would be appreciated.  I would think we might want to discuss it at the 
Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.  What do you 
think?  I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board 
meeting.

Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from 
the Board to work this matter.  Bill we need to get the Board to continue to 
follow him if we are to make progress.
