Subject: Midwestern closing press release

Attached is the final draft of the Midwestern acquisition press release.  
Please provide any comments to me by 2 pm tomorrow, May 4.  If I don't hear 
from you by then, I will assume no comments.

We are targeting a Monday, May 7 release before the market opens.

Thanks,

beth
