As you can see by the attached memo, we have slightly diffferent
interpretations of what the committee members agreed to.  However, the
direction is still positive.

Waters,
I see the problem - my address is mmcgrath@eei.org - not kmcgrath. Sorry
about that - it was misprinted in a ubp list some time back, and has
haunted me ever since.

Also - be advised we do not yet support the EISB option - we only agree to
find acceptable organizational solutions - which could be an EISB.  If we
jump to EISB at the outset folks will resist.  Let's not introduce that
concept until there is support for it.  I can assure you there will be
resistance to creating another wholesale rule writing group - homework must
be done.

Thanks for your help
  -Mike

The next EEI CEO meeting will be held June 18-21.  I believe the CEO EISB
Task Force will recommend to proceed with the next step of working with
GISB to prepare a formal EISB proposed organization plan which would be
voted on by EEI at a future meeting.  We will let you know the outcome of
the June 18-21 meeting.

Waters
