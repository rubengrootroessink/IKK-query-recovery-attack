Dear GISB Members,

The GISB status report regarding version 1.4 of our standards was sent to the
FERC last week.  It has been posted and can be downloaded from our home page
(www.gisb.org).  If you would like the report emailed to you (it is 238 pages
in .pdf format), our office will be happy to accommodate you.  If you do not
want to receive notices of this type, or would prefer that we send them to
others in your office, please let us know and we will make the necessary
changes.

Best Regards,  Rae McQuade
