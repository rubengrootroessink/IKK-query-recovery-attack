Thanks for the present-I really appreciate your thoughtfulness.  Am going to
have it framed and put up some place in the house.  Heard the great news
about Debbie and you-my congratulations.  As we both know kids make this a
special place-wish you all the happiness and joy in the world.

Hope all is well with you and that you had (are having) a great Holiday
Season.

       Bill
