Uncle Stan,
     I just wanted to write you and say hi and ask you a couple of
questions.  I wrote to Caron a couple of days ago to see how she was
doing and she told me that she has a horse show coming up.  She sounded
pretty excited about it.  I hope she does well.  I got to pitch for the
first time last weekend.  I pitched against Florida State who is number
one and I did pretty good.  I pitched 5 innings and didn't give up any
runs and gave up 3 hits.  I pitched against them again this weekend and
gave up 3 hits and 1 run in 3 innings.  I guess I'll have to teach you
how to throw strike someday.  The other thing I wanted to talk to you
about is this summer.  When you were down in Orlando last month you
mentioned something about an internship.  Tara and I really thought that
it would be really fun to come out to Texas this summer to do that.  I
was just wandering if that was still an option and if so does the offer
still stand.  I know there is still a lot Tara and I to talk about like
where we are going to live and things like that but we were just
thinking that it would be a great oppurtunity for the botb of us. Tell
Debbie I said hello and we are all wishing her the best.  Thank you for
everything.
