Mike,
This is obviously a key question for both of us.  Many years ago, I was
working in a staff job with a lot of routine and very little excitement or
pizzazz.  You offered me a position doing something I understood very well.
At the time, Pilko and Assoc. had completed an environmental assessment and
produced an "Oh My God" report which you shared with me.  Taking on the
challenge of that job, and doing well, meant changing the entire culture of
the organization.  I felt that you were sincere in your desire to do the
right things, no matter what, and I was excited about my ability to
contribute to the revamping of the entire company.  You were true to your
vision and you never, ever let me down.  I've learned a lot since then about
leadership and effecting change.  I led the Operations group into five
successive record years for TEPPCO with no major acquisitions and only
incremental expansion on the existing pipelines.  We were doing Great Things
and we all loved it.

TEPPCO added the Crude Oil Group in November, 1998.  I was very involved
in the Due Diligence and in negotiation of all the deal documents.  I am
familiar with the independent mindset of the crude oil folks and their
resistance to change.  I can see many opportunities for improvement, but I
am unable to effect needed changes.  I am working harder than ever, with
less job satisfaction than in prior times.

I appreciate your candor regarding the challenges at EOTT.  As before, you
have allowed me to peek inside and see just what lies ahead.  I will admit
that I am envious of the opportunity that you guys have before you.   The
intensity that you, David, Dana and Mary Ellen bring to the discussions of
the work being done is truly refreshing and exciting.  I like the openness
of the group and the shared commitment that I feel you all have.  Everybody
at EOTT has made it clear that joining your team would not be easy.
However, I've also heard that they are so excited about the work that they
can't wait to get to work in the morning.

I always felt that your visionary leadership combined with my bridge
building/implementing skill and leadership produced great results.  I
believe that my demonstrated determination, self-confidence and perseverance
are what lead you to talk to me in the first place.  The only thing open to
question is my desire and energy to take on a tough assignment.  Thanks in
advance for not questioning my sanity for thinking about leaving a good job
at TEPPCO to join a group of wild rebels in the midst of a revolution.  The
fact is, I love a big challenge.  Always have.  You have presented me with
the most exciting opportunity to come my way in years.  I think I am
uniquely
qualified to take on this challenge and help drive the company to new levels
of performance and profitability.  I am very excited about talking in more
detail about the position, the responsibilities and how you envision me
fitting into the team.  I will call you today to see when we can get
together.

Cutty
