Michael Burke resigned abruptly Friday from the chief executive's post
at crude oil pipeline operator EOTT Energy Partners.

The Houston company said its board of directors had accepted the
resignation of Burke, "effective immediately." Burke, 56, is leaving the

company "to focus on emerging investment and business opportunities,"
the company said in a written statement.

The partnership has lost money the last three years in a row but it was
profitable in the first quarter of this year with a net income of $2.2
million.

Burke's resignation came just days after the pipeline partnership
revised its first-quarter net income upward by $100,000.

The revisions were made as a result of a review of the company's
computerized marketing and accounting system, the company said. In a
filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the
computer problems resulted in "unexplained variances in financial
results
reported by the system."

Stanley Horton, chairman of EOTT , will assume the duties of chief
executive officer. Dana Gibbs, currently executive vice president and
chief
commercial officer, will become president and chief operating officer of

EOTT . Horton and Gibbs will comprise the office of the chairman for
EOTT .
