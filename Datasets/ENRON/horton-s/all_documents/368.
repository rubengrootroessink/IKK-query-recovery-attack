louie, i do not expect the navajos to abort this deal
by a hard line position on the standard terms and
conditions. i do expect that they will take a hard
line position until they believe we mean what we say.
we have had completely contradictory expressions from
them--at one time they said they understood our
concerns and thought they could accomodate them. at
others times they have said "standard terms and
conditons, take it or leave it". i agree with lynn
that we should have very low expectations of federal
courts relieving us of the terms of our deal--perhaps
only to the extent the public interest demands it.
this is clearly a management call, but i continue to
recommend against taking the risks associated with the
general terms and conditions. jim
