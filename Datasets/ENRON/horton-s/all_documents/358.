Jeff:  okay, DOE will do it but wants to make a bigger deal out of the 
announcement  than Monday at NARUC.  Translation, Secretary Richardson is a 
powerful Secretary and he wants to make the announcement and take credit for 
this himself.  Congratulations!  We'll let you know when it happens.  Also, 
NRDC thinks this is a great idea and wants to serve with Ashook Gupta as 
their representative.  Have a great week-end!        cynthia

We are going to do it -- but I don't think Bob will announce -- I'm saving 
for a bigger announcement we are going to make on reliability.
