I apologize for not thanking you earlier for sponsoring the INGAA dinner last 
month.  I truly enjoyed the informal setting of the dinner, providing my 
thoughts on energy related issues, and hearing the views of those who 
attended the dinner.  Hopefully, the dinner guests received some value for 
their attendance.

On another front, I hope everything went smooth for the big move, although I 
missed your participation at the lunch that Ken Lay had for me and others.  
It is clear that gas issues are on the back burner these days, and that 
electric related matters and e-commerce are just more daunting and 
interesting.  Of course, that is where the money--profit-- will be in the 
future.

On a more personal note, I wish you and Debbie the best, and hope your new 
arrivals will bring you so much joy.
