Stan,

Per your interest in putting some money to work, we will not be raising a
new fund until next fall at the earliest but I wanted to let you know about
another situation that might be of interest to you.  A good friend and
former client at Compaq, Bob Stearns, is putting together a fund to invest
in early stage technology deals.  Bob was SVP of technology and business
development at Compaq for several years but left when the crazies took over
(all of whom got fired, I might add).  Since I value my friendships too
much, I don't generally recommend people unless I really believe in who they
are and what they are doing.  Bob is top notch, which is why I would feel
comfortable recommending him to you and would be very pleased to introduce
you to Bob because you are top notch as well.  I thought Bob had closed his
fund already but he said he was going to have a second closing in about 30
days so there is still time to get in if you are interested.  The typical
investment is in the $500k to $1m range although I know of one person who
got in for $250k. ( I introduced him to Frevert and Rice and they have both
invested.)  Bob is still in Houston and offices over in the Galleria area.

If you would like to talk to Bob, let me know when and where you can be
reached and I will forward your information to him.

Dave
