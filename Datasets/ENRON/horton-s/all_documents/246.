Dear Jim, Stan, Hugh & Bill,

Attached please find correspondence from Mary Jane McCartney regarding
ConEd's perspective on expanding GISB's standards setting activities.  I
spoke to her this morning, and she has shared this correspondence with the
LDC Board members and felt that it was appropriate to share it with you also.
 She noted that she did not intend it as comments for posting on our web
site.  Please let me know if you have trouble downloading the correspondence
-- it is in Word format.

Best Regards,  Rae
