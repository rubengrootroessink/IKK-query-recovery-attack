Jon,

Following up your two questions this morning, we obtained the following info 
from pulling invoices and phone inquiries.

Temp & Contract - Systems Fees ($28) variance 

Variance attributable to RC 9701 - Systems Software which budgeted $6.7 and 
incurred $34.8 for consulting services and contract support. Discussed with 
Steve Findley. The invoices are summarized as follows:

McCorquadale Consulting - $8.2 for commercial maps and web support.
Indu Kilambi Consulting -      $5.1 for general systems support
Idea Integration -                     $8.6 for commercial maps and 
documentation preparation
Comsys Consulting -           $12.9 for FoxPro position reporting issues
                                                   $34.8


Major Expense Jobs - Crane System ($106) variance

Variance attributable to RC 7354 - TXNM Crane System which budgeted -0- and 
incurred $105.6. Discussed with Gary Wright and Fixed Assets accounting, 
waiting on answer from Bobby Garduno.

Review of invoices revealed that only $24 related to Crane Flood (Albritton 
Machine, Inc. for pump repair and reconditioning). Garduno to provide 
description of flood. Balance of $81.6 related to cleaning and work on Ozona 
Tank #1339. Apparently an AFE has been prepared for the Ozona Tank work, but 
the AFE has not been approved. If the AFE is approved, these costs will be 
capitalized.
