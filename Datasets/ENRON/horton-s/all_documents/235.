Attached is a detailed report on the deals that GPG Bus Dev is currently 
looking at, and a historic log of prior activities.  It is very much a "work 
in progress", and will be updated weekly.  I plan to share it with anyone 
within GPG that would find it useful probably on a monthly basis. 

Your comments are welcome.
