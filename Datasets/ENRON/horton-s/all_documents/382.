Stan, feedback as follows:

Does the candidate posess the required technical skills to be successful in 
this job?

Clearly has an appropriate background to support the role - able to talk 
sensibly about the science of market risk (value at risk, options etc.) and 
the art too (culture and interplay between front, middle, back office). 
Perhaps a little light on some of the finer points of a VAR - based metric, 
and I did not delve into the nuances of the oil transportation world.

Does the candidate possess the necessary leadership and teamwork skills and 
behaviors?
Does the candidate possess the necessary communication skills (internal & 
external)?  

I liked his style - calm, collected, succinct. Professional but with some 
humour (!). Body language was open and will facilitate good rapport.
Strong personality which at times made me feel I was the interviewee, but I 
think that could be a good thing here.
I think he will be able to build good relationships, that support both the 
"customer service" and "independent controller" aspects of the CFO role down 
at EOTT.

In your opinion, do you believe the candidate would be successful in this job?

I do, but I assume we have other candidates to compare also ?
