I engaged Lou Rieger of SpencerStuart this past Monday morning.  I am asking 
Shelly to send you the job description I wrote and sent to Lou. Please advise 
if you have any suggested changes.
Also, I would like to try to keep this confidential. the only others that I 
have told of this action are : Dan Gibbs, David Hultsman, Mary Ellen Coombe, 
Shelly Worrell.
