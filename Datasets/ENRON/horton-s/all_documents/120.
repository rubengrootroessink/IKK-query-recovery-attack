Dave,

I had a short conversation with Scott this morning and explained the job, why 
we have vacancies, etc.  He is going to evaluate the job description and see 
if there would be any ties in this job to his future career goals.  In other 
words, he doesn't see himself taking a long-term departure from Investor 
Relations, but possibly there are some skills he would gain in this job that 
would make him even more valuable in a future IR role.  For example, when he 
was with El Paso, IR and PR were combined.

He said that he would follow up with me this afternoon or Monday and let me 
know if he has interest in discussing further.
