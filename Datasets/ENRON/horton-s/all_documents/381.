Stan,

I have worked with Lawrence over the past three years while he was working 
with Aquila.  As you know, Aquila is a major trading partner of ENA.  
Lawrence and I have had numerous meetings/discussions related to credit risk 
management and overall corporate credit exposures between ENA and Aquila.  My 
initial feedback on Lawrence is that he has developed a good grasp of high 
level apects associated with trading operations.  He is very attentive to the 
detailed aspects of capturing and reporting risks and appears to be a vocal 
and demanding leader.  My only concern is that in some of our past 
negotiations he did not seem to be as flexible and innovative as Enron would 
typically would like.  I am not sure it that is an issue with his style or if 
that is a reflection on Aquila.

I don't know your expectations of Lawrence in the CFO role for EOTT, but I do 
believe he has the ability and confidence to provide value to their 
operations.  

Regards,
Bill
