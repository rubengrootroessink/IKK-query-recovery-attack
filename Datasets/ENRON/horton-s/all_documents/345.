Gentlemen -

The revised counter was delivered to Zaman earlier today.  McGee spoke with 
Zaman and later with both Trujillo and Zaman.  They delivered what they 
stated, and McGee believes, is their final and bottom line proposal.  They 
would not consider Standing Rock as part of this negotiation (although they 
would be open to separate negotiation over Standing Rock), they required $15 
million up front and $2.34 million per year with a CPI escalator.  This is 
just slightly over $29 million in today's dollars.

They wish an answer tomorrow to the proposal.  McGee did not commit to do so 
but he did request that Zaman and Trujillo confirm from the Task Force this 
Friday whether they had the authority to make this proposal.

REVISED COUNTER:   $15 million up front and $2.0 million per year fixed 
payment (no CPI adjustment) and Standing Rock right-of-way.

What does everyone think?

I agree 100%. That would be my position as well.

Subject: Navajo Offer

McGee spoke with Zaman this afternoon.  Zaman relayed an informal counter 
proposal to Transwestern's offer of earlier this week.  Zaman (and Das and 
Trujillo) would recommend to the Task Force a settlement of $15 million up 
front with a $2.5 million per year payment for each of the renewal years.  
The $2.5 million figure would be escalated by the CPI index.
