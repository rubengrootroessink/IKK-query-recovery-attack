This is Wiley's report on his meeting with the Cabinet aides, if you want to 
read.  The meetings all went very well.  The hearing is on the 22nd, I 
believe.

Subject: RE:Briefings of Cabinet Aides  

Anne Longman and I briefed Cabinet Aides for the Governor, Secretary of 
State, Commissioner of Education, and Insurance Commissioner today.  Anne's 
associate, David Ramba, joined us for i ntroductions to the Governor's Aide 
and to the Secretary of State's Aide.  We covered the materials and had good 
discussions in every case.  The Governor's Aide was very encouraging and 
interested in the project.  He shared with us that the aides had been 
discussing the competing "want-a-be pipeline" projects and he believed that 
they would not be built due to the lack of economic feasibility.  Every one 
of the aides comprehended that this is a real project on the way to being 
built in a timely manner.  The Education Commissioner's Aide asked the only 
question that we were unable to answer.  "How many jobs will be lost in 
Florida due to the displacement of the fuel oil transportation?"  Having 
asked the question, she said she did not really have a problem with it .  I 
believe we should have the answer in case it comes up again.

One very beneficial event which took place yesterday  was the visit by every 
aide we briefed today to the Hines Plant of Florida Power Corp.  They had a 
much better understanding of  a combined cycle plant.
 
In our last briefing of the Insurance Commissioner's Aide, he requested that 
we provide the Commissioner with an aerial view of the West Leg extension if 
we could do so without going to a lot of expense.  He says the Commissioner 
is real "aerial/map" person.  This probably  relates in some way to his ride, 
while he was a Congressman, on the Space Shuttle.  If we have access to an 
aerial taken from high altitude (from a satelite) that we can mark the route 
upon, then we can probably benefit from this particular aerial/map interest.

Tomorrow  we plan to complete the final three  briefings in the afternoon.

Thanks for all of your efforts on Phase IV and particularly for bringing Anne 
and I up to speed.  

Please let us know by contacting Anne's office tomorrow if you have any 
questions of comments.
