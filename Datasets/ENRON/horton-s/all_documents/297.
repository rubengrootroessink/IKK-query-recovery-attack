I wanted to report that since meeting with the Crossroads folks in May they 
have owed us information which would allow us to place a new valuation on the 
Crossroads acquisition.  They have called in twice to ask for more time to 
provide the information. Since we have been focusing our attention on Wyoming 
and Alberta deals we did not object to their delay.

This week Dan Gavito called in and left the message that in a few days we 
might see an announcement that the utility, NIPSCO and the new pipeline 
Vector have concluded a deal where NIPSCO will take short haul capacity on 
Vector ( to Indiana) and that Vector will interconnect with Crossroads.  Dan 
called to emphasize that this deal with Vector would have NO impact on 
Crossroads continuing conversations with NBP to buy a share in Crossroads.
