Mr. Zaman called Larry yesterday to discuss the most recent offer.  

Larry had the opportunity to discuss with Mr. Zaman the sense of urgency on 
TW's part and the desire to meet with the decision making body - the NNERTF.  
Apparently Mr. Zaman was of the impression that TW would not be pressed to 
take legal action until the ROW expired.

Mr. Zaman was encouraged by the TW approach of an incentive but offered no 
insights on the acceptability of the offer.  He did promised to review it 
with the task force in the near future and indicated that Johnny could expect 
a response in the near future regarding the letter and the request for a 
meeting.
