Stan,

Once again I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you and Dana about the
EOTT CFO spot.   I apologize for getting back to you so late last night.  My
wife and I had just left the hospital and were grabbing a late bite to eat.
I was thinking a little more about our discussion and wanted to offer a
couple of names to you that may or may not be popping up in your search:

        1) Ross Benavides-currently the CFO at Genesis
            2) Jim Diediker- former Controller at EOTT years ago.  Jim
pursued his Phd.
                at A&M and is now with AEP here locally.
            3) Ken Stockel-currently CFO at British Borneo here in town.
            4) Georgeanne Hodges- currently with Enron and could be
considered more
               at Laurie's level
I was fortunate to have all four of these folks work for me at Phibro so I
could vouch for each of them.  If you were interested in any of them feel
free to give me a call and I could give you some pros and cons relative to
your situation there.
Stan, I wish you well in finalizing your search.  All the best in turning
around the EOTT situation.


              Regards,


              Bob Flavin
