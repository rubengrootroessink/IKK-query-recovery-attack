Stan,

I'm thinking through that right now.  Frankly, the problem I see is in being 
able to put an agenda together that would be attractive enough for our CEO 
task force members.  I haven't figured out how to make a face to face meeting 
before the September board meeting worthwhile, although a conference call 
might work.  We probably could develop a formal task force response to the 
strawman, but in some ways I think the first meeting notes, draft principles 
and the concerns paper covered some of the turf.

So I'm thinking of an alternative - and please think of this only as a 
maybe.  Suppose at the September board meeting I have a closed meeting on the 
principles & scope & whatever else we can manage, and then have you come in 
and talk to everybody in general session.  We could work out the content of 
your talk, but it would be centered on the value of uniform practices, their 
applicability to electric wholesale markets, and the "EISB" approach.  
Perhaps we could get Chuck Watson to help you.

There would be tough and probing questions - which you would know in advance.

How does this sit with you?  I think it might be an interesting discussion 
that would help to increase the collective knowledge and support.  I do not 
have internal concurrence & support on this idea, but if you like it I'll try 
to get it.

On another matter - I really need 5 or 6 examples  of areas where wholesale 
electric practices would be useful and appropriate.  The question on the 
floor is "Exactly what are the areas and types of practices we might develop 
for wholesale electric markets?"

On the retail side the answer is easy, because we already have them (e.g., 
customer enrollment, billing & payments, metering,  load profiling, etc.).  
But there really is no such list on the wholesale electric side.

Can you or Jeff help?  We can't just say "it's up to the members".  Having a 
list would help demonstrate value.  I need something by next Thursday for an 
internal strategy meeting.

Thanks
  -Mike

Mike:

Any suggestions as to when our respective committees could meet to begin
discussing matters such as principles, scope, governance, organization,
etc.?

If a meeting is not possible, is it possible to get your committee's
response to the "strawman" I sent to you?

Thanks,
Stan
