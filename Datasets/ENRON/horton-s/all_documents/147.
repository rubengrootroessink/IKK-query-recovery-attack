PRIVILEGE  

Thanks for the update, but Steve's position is pretty pathetic. If (when) the 
grand jury indicts him, he's going to have a pretty tough time with a 
defamation or libel suit. I think its a deluded puff.  SWD

Subject: Steve Todoroff--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

I wanted you to be aware of something we learned today from one of our 
trading counterparties.  Dana Gibbs spoke with an individual at Koch who has 
recently spoken with Todoroff.  Apparently, Todoroff is in the job market.  
He has apparently indicated that he intends to sue EOTT for defamation as 
soon as EOTT links his name with the NGL theft.  He also apparently told Koch 
that his attorneys are "ready to go with the lawsuit" as soon as EOTT links 
his name with the theft.  

Todoroff's "planned lawsuit"  may just be some more yarn in this fabrication, 
but it emphasizes again the need to keep this matter as confidential as 
possible (at least until Todoroff is indicted). 

On a side note, Todoroff has certainly developed an interesting interview 
technique!  Just imagine going in for a job interview and saying, "My former 
employer is alleging that a former trader stole millions of $$$.   I'm just 
waiting on them to say that I'm the thief so I can sue them."  With that 
story, I'm surprised employers aren't beating down his door to give him a job.
