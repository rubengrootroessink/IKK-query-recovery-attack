 Joe advises that Equilon's Board has decided to go forward with us.  They 
want to get an MOU signed up this week.  I believe we can manage disclosure 
on this for the next few weeks (at least until we file our 10Q).  Also, I met 
with Tom White today and he will ask Dan Leff or Jeff Messina to contact me 
about possibilities at EES.  Thanks.  SWD
