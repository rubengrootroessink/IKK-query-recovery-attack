CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION & ATTORNEY'S WORK 
PRODUCT

Thanks for sending this message.  Checked with Baird and his initial view is 
that we should say something in the form of an additional release if Monday 
comes and we can't complete our Q.  He will discuss with Rex and give me 
final input as soon as possible.  I know this isn't a desirable result, but 
Bob thinks we'd be worse off if we said nothing---and then waited for people 
to call us.  We wouldn't need to say much, just something to the effect that 
we are continuing to work through the open integration issues, etc.  The 
specific wording would have to be worked out internally. I believe Susan and 
Dana also believe that we should say something if we can't complete the Q on 
Monday.  I'm in Ireland with my son, but I will follow up on this with IR and 
others and advise. Thanks.  SWD

The past several weeks have been especially difficult for everyone.  I do 
appreciate, however, the tremendous effort everyone has made to identify and 
fix the problems that keep surfacing.

At times like these, it is human nature to place the blame.  Such an exercise 
is pointless.  In my opinion, there were a lot of things that we would ALL do 
differently if we had the chance to do them over again.

The important issues now are:

Let's get it right;
let's learn from our mistakes;
let's recognize that we have to work as a team to accomplish 1. and 2. above; 
and,
let's appreciate how our job performance impacts the performance of the team.

Also, let's not forget that the commercial trends are favorable.  We appear 
poised to turn the corner.  Stabilizing our systems, getting good regional 
profit and loss data, which will improve our commercial decision-making, 
coupled with aggressive cost reductions, will get us to the promised-land.

Thanks again,
Stan
