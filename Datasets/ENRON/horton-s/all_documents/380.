Here is my read>>>>>>>>


It would be appreciated if you would follow-up with an e-mail to me giving me 
your thoughts on Lawrence.  Specifically, answers to the following questions 
would be helpful:

Does the candidate possess the required technical skills to be successful in 
this job?     No question in my mind.
Does the candidate possess the necessary leadership and teamwork skills and 
behaviors?    Appears to have the necessary skills and behaviors, got along 
great and would argue that he is probably a step up from Nick Bednorz.
Does the candidate possess the necessary communication skills (internal & 
external)?     Extremely good discussion on some technical accounting issues 
convinced me he could articulate succinctly rather complex accounting in 
simpler terms.    Believable and gave me a feeling he could be trusted. 
Does the candidate seem in alignment with Enron's values?     Saw nothing 
that would indicate otherwise.
In your opinion, do you believe the candidate would be successful in this 
job?     Better bet than most, I would say.

Any other feedback would be most appreciated!   Found him to be warm and 
friendly and easy to talk to.    Although hard to judge it appears from our 
discussion that he has had jobs that have forced him to complement his boss' 
style and is comfortable in that role. 

Thanks,
Stan
