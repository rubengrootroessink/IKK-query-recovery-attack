Dear GISB Members and interested industry participants,

    The GISB industry comment period begins today and ends on March 29 for
the ten recommendations included in the attached request for comments and
posted on our web site.  Subcommittees and task forces submitted the
recommendations for your review on February 28, 2000.   All comments received
by the GISB office by end of business March 29 will be posted on the Home
Page and forwarded to the Executive Committee (EC) members for their
consideration.  The EC members will consider all comments and are scheduled
to cast their votes on these recommendations on April 13 at the upcoming EC
meeting.

Best Regards,
Rae McQuade
