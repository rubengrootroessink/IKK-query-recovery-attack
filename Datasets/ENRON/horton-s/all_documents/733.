I talked to Dave about the PRC process and he has invited me to attend the 
GPG Managers PRC meeting on July 20.  This will help me understand the 
process "live".  I will be meeting with Anne Vaughn in advance of this 
meeting, hopefully next week.  Anne will walk me through the portion of the 
data gathering process and game plan as to how we can utilize the process and 
potentially the software to initiate a similar process in EOTT.

Ladies & Gentlemen:

This is to confirm your appointment as a member of the Performance Review 
Committee (PRC) that will cross-calibrate mid-year performance rankings for 
all GPG manager-level employees.

For the first time, we will convene a GPG-wide PRC to review the ratings 
developed in functional and business-unit performance-mangement sessions in 
order to determine final ratings for all employees in manager positions.  
This cross-calibration, which will be ratified by GPG's Management Committee, 
will help ensure equity in how performance is measured and rewarded for our 
managers. 

Your participation is critical to the success of  this meeting, which is 
scheduled for Thursday, July 20, in Houston at 1:00 PM. (We'll shoot to be 
finished between 5:30 and 6:00 PM.)  Please advise me a soon as possible 
should there be any conflict affecting your availability to attend.  Sheila 
Kundsen, corporate vice president of compensation, will facility this 
important meeting for us, I will participate with you as a member of the 
committee.  Additional information about the session will be provided to you 
as the meeting date draws nearer.

Please contact me with any questions you have regarding the meeting.

Regards,

 dave
