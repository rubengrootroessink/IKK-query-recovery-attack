Dear Board Task Force Member,

At the conclusion of our meeting on February 14, Mr. Templeton noted that
participants could forward additional comments including their reactions to
the meeting to the GISB office by February 25.  Some of the comments were
received late, which resulted in this notification being delayed.  Ten
organizations offered comments which are attached for your review.  They have
also been posted on our home page for general access by interested parties.

Best Regards,  Rae
