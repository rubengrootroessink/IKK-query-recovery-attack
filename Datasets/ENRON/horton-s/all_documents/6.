Cindy,

Thank you for returning the message.  I did intend it for Bob
Stearns...sorry about the mix up!

As you have probably seen from our exchange of emails, Stan had asked me to
keep him apprised of any attractive investment opportunities I came across.
I took it from Stan's last message that he may or may not be interested in
Bob's fund, Sternhill, at this time but he would at least like to meet Bob
(hence the email to Bob that you received instead).  As you could see from
the email, I have asked Bob to contact Stan and to mention my name so that
you would have a reference for his call.  You should, therefore, expect Bob
to be calling (probably today) and please let Stan know that this was the
fellow I had mentioned in my message to him.

Thank you and happy holidays,

Dave Noble

You sent this to Stan but it's addressed to Bob.    I have not shown this
to Stan...and will await further instructions from you.

Bob,

I should have checked farther down my email.  It looks like he is on the
fence but you ought to go ahead and contact him any way.  Stan runs all of
Enron's operations world wide and is a good friend.  You should be able to
reach him through Enron's main number (713-853-6161) and say that Dave
Noble
said to call when you reach him.

Dave

Dave:

Thanks for suggesting that Bob Stearns and I get together.  I think I'd
like to wait for your next fund, but feel free to give my name to Bob.

Thanks, Dave!

Stan

Stan,

Per your interest in putting some money to work, we will not be raising a
new fund until next fall at the earliest but I wanted to let you know about
another situation that might be of interest to you.  A good friend and
former client at Compaq, Bob Stearns, is putting together a fund to invest
in early stage technology deals.  Bob was SVP of technology and business
development at Compaq for several years but left when the crazies took over
(all of whom got fired, I might add).  Since I value my friendships too
much, I don't generally recommend people unless I really believe in who
they
are and what they are doing.  Bob is top notch, which is why I would feel
comfortable recommending him to you and would be very pleased to introduce
you to Bob because you are top notch as well.  I thought Bob had closed his
fund already but he said he was going to have a second closing in about 30
days so there is still time to get in if you are interested.  The typical
investment is in the $500k to $1m range although I know of one person who
got in for $250k. ( I introduced him to Frevert and Rice and they have both
invested.)  Bob is still in Houston and offices over in the Galleria area.

If you would like to talk to Bob, let me know when and where you can be
reached and I will forward your information to him.

Dave
