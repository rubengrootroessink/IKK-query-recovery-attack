I followed up yesterday on this issue and was advised that the sign off is 
circulating with in the St. Paul organization, due to the size of the 
payoff.  The adjuster indicated that this process was routine.  He 
anticipates having a letter/settlement agreement out to us by Friday.  Walt 
if this comes to you by chance would you let me know immediately.
