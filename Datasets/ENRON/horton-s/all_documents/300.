To foster  greater team spirit and communication, I would suggest two 
things:  1.  Try to create an environment where ALL critical and important 
information about the company and its future (including legal, financial, 
commercial and employee benefit information) is shared equally with the 
entire officer group.  I personally believe that it hurts morale when bits 
and pieces of critical information are distributed to only a select few 
within the officer group.  If the entire officer team is trusted with 
sensitive information, you will get a much stronger team effort from the 
collective group----and you will avoid situations where "knowledge is power" 
between those who are in the know and those who are not.  2.  Consider 
establishing a chief of staff position within EOTT to assist Dana with 
keeping everything "tied together."  Dana cannot be everywhere at once, and 
his focus should probably be on the commercial side, so he would probably 
benefit greatly from having one individual responsible for staying on top of 
everything else.  The individual could keep Dana updated on all support 
sections, keep him focused on critical issues within those areas, and, in 
certain instances, carry out Dana's directives with respect to the various 
support sections.  The chief of staff would also be responsible for making 
sure that all officers are "in the know."  My suggestions, for what they're 
worth.  SWD

Thanks for your support and leadership over the past couple of weeks.   I 
believe the future is bright for EOTT if we can all pull together as one team.

I'd love to hear of any suggestions you may want to share?

Stan
