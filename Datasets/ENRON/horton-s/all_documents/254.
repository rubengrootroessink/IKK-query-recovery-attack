Land owner James Moore of Gladewater Tx. reported today that EOTT Energy had 
a release of crude oil (approximately 25 barrels) that had flowed into Moody 
Creek, near Gladewater, Tx.  EOTT Response crews were dispatched to the 
site.  Booms were deployed 200 yards down stream to stop the release and to 
start recovery.  There pipe was clamped off and the leak was caused by 
internal corrosion.  Oil in the creek is approximately 20 feet wide and 200 
yards long.  Equipment on site at this time include 2 vacuum trucks, oil 
skimmers, a boat and 100 feet of boom already in place.  Recovery was started 
at 1 PM and will continue until we have the oil out of the creek.

Agencies notified at this time are:

Railroad Commission Region 6
TNRCC Region 5
National Response Center

I  do not know at this time how long the clean up will take, however I should 
have that information in the morning.  Will keep you up to date.

I will be at the site to do my environmental & safety thing.

Thanks,  Mr. Ed
