Stan,
We had our board meeting last week.  It worked out the way we hoped it 
would.  Results:

1.  Our CEO UBP Task Force will continue to work with your new team, 
discussing matters such as principles, scope, governance, organization, etc.

2.  Each of our CEO Policy Committees (Energy Services, Supply, and Delivery) 
will provide commentary on the principles, scope, governance, organization, 
etc.

3.  Progress report to board in September.

I am going to work up a plan for getting much of #2 done before the September 
board meeting, so that we can develop some rough proactive overall position 
on wholesale before December.  Can't make promises yet.

It would be most helpful to me if I could give concrete examples about new 
uniform practices can be a win-win in wholesale markets.  Do you know of any 
examples we can use of practices that we really wish we already had?  I'm 
sure somebody in GISB has a wish list.  We had such a list when we started 
the retail effort,  much of it came from CUBR.  It is useful in helping 
people understand what we are talking about.  I can use it as a "for 
instance".

Thanks
  -Mike
