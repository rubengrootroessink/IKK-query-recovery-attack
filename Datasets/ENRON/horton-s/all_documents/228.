I agree completely and make the commitment to fulfill my obligations to my 
team mates and fellow employees in the most positive manner possible.  I am 
well aware of how personal actions reflect on a team performance; if we are 
not always synchronized with our team mates,then high  performance results 
will not be achieved.   This team can get us all to the promised land.   As 
an aside, I am pleased to have a more active chairman and a revitalized CEO 
focused with the rest of the team on achieving the outcomes available to 
EOTT.   

Thanks for taking the time to send the note.........

The past several weeks have been especially difficult for everyone.  I do 
appreciate, however, the tremendous effort everyone has made to identify and 
fix the problems that keep surfacing.

At times like these, it is human nature to place the blame.  Such an exercise 
is pointless.  In my opinion, there were a lot of things that we would ALL do 
differently if we had the chance to do them over again.

The important issues now are:

Let's get it right;
let's learn from our mistakes;
let's recognize that we have to work as a team to accomplish 1. and 2. above; 
and,
let's appreciate how our job performance impacts the performance of the team.

Also, let's not forget that the commercial trends are favorable.  We appear 
poised to turn the corner.  Stabilizing our systems, getting good regional 
profit and loss data, which will improve our commercial decision-making, 
coupled with aggressive cost reductions, will get us to the promised-land.

Thanks again,
Stan
