Stan,

Thanks for your email and we may take you up on your offer to help at some
point.

Also, I'm glad you let me know that you/Enron are interested in investment
opportunities.  My investment focus is exclusively on business-to-business
e-commerce and technology companies which are currently pretty good places
to invest.  We will be raising a new fund hopefully next year...I'll keep
you posted.  Also, I come across attractive early stage deals which our fund
is not set up to handle.  When I do, I set up an LLC and get some people to
kick in (Frevert and Rice came in on the last deal), so if that is of
interest I'll keep you in mind.

Talk to you soon,

Dave
