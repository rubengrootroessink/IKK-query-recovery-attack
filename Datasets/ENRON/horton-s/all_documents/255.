Cutty, I know you are extremely busy, but as you continue to work with Phil 
Lowry on the new initiatives we have discussed,
please redouble your efforts to keep in close communication with the Regional 
business leadership.  It would also be a
great idea if you visited the EOTT trading floor at least once a day , every 
day you are in Houston.  You are off to a great start in 
developing rapport with the commercial group, so continue to build on those 
relationships.  Thanks for all you are doing on so many fronts.  EOTT is very 
fortunate to have you on are leadership team!
