Larry - Ms. Tapahe has not called my office as of this writing.  I'll be 
traveling tomorrow but will check in.  Thanks for the efforts.  Keep in touch.

Lou:

Luralene Tapahe, Esq. called today (she had been in the hospital). She
is favorably inclined concerning a meeting and will be talking with
Arvin Trujillo today and get back with you or us.

Ms. Tapahe asked for an update on where we are, which I provided (in
general terms).

We agreed that it would be better for the Task Force to hear TW's
position from TW and for TW to hear the Nation's position from the Task
Force, rather than from a "gatekeeper."

Hope all is well.

LAR
