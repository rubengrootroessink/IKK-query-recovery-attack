INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS :
* We are downgrading EOTT Energy Partners to 2-Outperform from 1-Buy based
in
  part on the reduced prospects for near-term acquisitions.  We are also
  reducing our price target from $17 to $16, which is based on a cash
  distribution of $1.90 and a yield of 13.4%.
* We are concerned about the lack of near-term acquisition prospects for
  EOTT, and the subsequent impact this will have on cash distribution
  coverage levels.  EOTT's coverage level of total units is estimated at 75%

  for 2000 and 84% for 2001.
* EOTT's unit price is already up 9.1% through 2Q00 versus the S&P 500 which

  is down 1.0% in the same period.  We believe further unit appreciation
will
  likely be inhibited until coverage levels improve.
WE ARE DOWNGRADING EOTT ENERGY PARTNERS TO 2-OUTPERFORM FROM 1-BUYBASED IN
PART ON THE REDUCED PROSPECTS FOR NEAR-TERM ACQUISITIONS.  We are also
reducing our price target to $16 from $17, which is based on a cash
distribution of $1.90 and a yield of 13.4%.  We are maintaining our earnings

estimates for EOTT at $0.50 for 2000 and $0.64 for 2001.

WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF NEAR-TERM ACQUISITION PROSPECTS FOR EOTT
AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT THIS HAS ON IMPROVING THE CASH DISTRIBUTION
COVERAGE LEVELS.
We estimate that the total unit coverage level will be 75% in 2000,
increasing to 84% in 2001, assuming a cash distribution of $1.90 per unit.
EOTT will need to boost its distributable cash level by approximately $14
million in order to reach the 100% coverage level for all units in 2000.
Without making an acquisition, it is unlikely that EOTT will reach this
coverage level before 2002.  Furthermore, although an acquisition would be
accretive in the long run, it would likely be dilutive to earnings and cash
in
the near-term.  In the meantime, EOTT has coverage support from Enron
through
2001.

UNIT PRICE APPRECIATION IS LIKELY TO BE INHIBITED UNTIL COVERAGE LEVELS
IMPROVE FURTHER
EOTTs unit price has appreciated 9.1% through the end of 2Q00, as compared
to
the S&P 500, which is down 1.0% during the same time period.  Including the
cash distributions, EOTTs return has been close to 16% so far this year.
