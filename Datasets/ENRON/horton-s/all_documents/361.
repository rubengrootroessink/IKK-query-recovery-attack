stan, i have been out of the office with no access to
e-mail, thus my failure to respond for which i
apologize.  i had previously told louie that i thought
15 mil plus 2 mil per year (which i suspected they
were looking for) exceeded my view of the settlement
value of  the controversy--which, i suppose, comes as
no surprise. i do believe that if we settle, we should
cover our expansions during the term. jim
