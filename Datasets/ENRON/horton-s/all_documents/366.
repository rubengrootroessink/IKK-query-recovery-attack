Larry Ruzow met with the Navajo DOJ (a Jim Fitting, Esq. ) yesterday 
afternoon on another matter.  In the course of the meeting,
Mr. Fitting made clear that the DOJ will oppose any deal that calls for 
disputes to be adjudicated in any
forum other than the Navajo Nation Courts (and that this meant DOJ opposition 
to arbitration as well.)

Larry expressed that we should not expect Ms. Tapahe (who is more militant on 
sovereignty-related
issues) to be willing to compromise on forum issues. 

He did remind me of the Resources Committee process.

At this point we will attempt a meeting regardless and report back on 
progress.
