From an IT perspective Lawrence has a general overview of technology.  With 
Aquila he was involved in the development of the company's integrated risk, 
credit, and cash management systems.  Although I would not consider him to 
have a depth of technology experience he does have a sound understanding of 
how IT and the business need to function together.

Lawrence presented himself professionally and has good interpersonal skills.  
It seems you provided him with a detailed picture of the challenges he would 
face at EOTT, but that did not deter his desire for the opportunity.

I believe he could be successful if given the position with EOTT.

Any other feedback would be most appreciated!
