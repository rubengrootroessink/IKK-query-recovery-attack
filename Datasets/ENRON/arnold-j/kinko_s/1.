Mr. Thompson:

Thank-you for your time this morning as we reviewed progress on the=20
Kinko's/Enron relationship and discussed how we might move forward with the=
=20
appropriate individuals at Kinko's who could help us define "value=20
propositions."
=20
As we mentioned, we would like to have a conference call and/or meeting wit=
h=20
Kinko's "solutions architects" who could work with us on further defining =
=20
broadband and pulp & paper initatives.  If these discussions were held befo=
re=20
the holidays, this would enable us to prepare both for the Experience Enron=
=20
event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent=
=20
executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication=20
transit possibilities with kinkos.com and other broadband-related questions=
=20
would be helpful in this endeavor.  Often, this information comes to us=20
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO.  =20
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the=
=20
CFO) could address the following types of questions regarding Kinko's paper=
=20
usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes fro=
m=20
the October 6th meeting as background information of our discussions.

Thank-you for your help.  I can be reached at:  #(713)-345-6541 and look=20
forward to speaking soon.
