Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.
