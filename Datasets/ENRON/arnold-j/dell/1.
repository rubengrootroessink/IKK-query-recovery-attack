After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works 
for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of 
getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls 
to update the status of the request.

Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos 
was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the 
information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one 
has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 
weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. 
Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we 
should get something by the end of the year.

Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request 
from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated 
that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it 
before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any 
transaction will get done in this calendar year.

Please call if you have any questions.
