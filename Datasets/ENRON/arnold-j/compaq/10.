Jennifer:

Can Alan Engberg have an alternate at the meeting?  Lee Jackson could do a 
great job -- he wrote the recent article on plastics and petrochemicals which 
came out in the last Analyst/Associate Encounter newsletter.

I have a conflict that day - both Doug and I will be in NYC.  Let me know if 
you want an alternate, perhaps Lee Jackson.

Thanks,
Alan

Bruce, Harry, Alan:

Jennifer Stewart Medcalf has asked me to invite you to a meeting with Compaq 
executives from their manufacturing and treasury divisions from 2-3 PM on 
December 14th in 3 Allen Center 11C1.  You would have the opportunity to 
present your business propositions to these senior executives -- about 15 
minutes each.

Please e-mail me your confirmations.  We will have an LCD projector so you 
can bring your presentations on laptop and just hook up at 2PM.  Please feel 
free to bring paper copies of your presentations to hand out at the meeting. 

Thanks.
