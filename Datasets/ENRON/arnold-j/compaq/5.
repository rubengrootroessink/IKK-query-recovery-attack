Jennifer,

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron.  He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.>>

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.
Thanks,

  Michael,

  I left you a voice message today regarding Enron. I'm doing
a presentation and I would like to get the amount ($) of  contracts we
currently have with Enron Services. For example the $97M 5-year contract for
power. I understand that we have contracts in the Northeast and West for
facilities.

  Can you provide me with that kind of data? I would
appreciate it.

  My presentation is on the 14th of December.

  Any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

   Michael,
     Thanks for the update.  I am OK with your decision
not to select Enron (and I also reviewed with Jim Milton).  Given that Enron
chose not to rebid, I certainly think this is a reasonable decision.

     It is very important that I (and the Enron account
team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us
in the loop.

   Regards,
   Jerry

    Jerry,

    As part of our continuing communication with
the Compaq/Enron account team,  below is an overview of a recent bid
analysis for services at Compaq's Novi, MI site.   Enron Building Services
is the current service provider for Office Services related support.  The
proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the
price provided by Enron.  Enron has been given the opportunity to revise
their pricing but has chose not to.  The recommendation is to award the
business to Pitney Bowes.   Please confirm that you concur with our
recommendation.    Thanks.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
    Background: Enron Building Services was
providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help
desk support for Compaq's Novi, MI site.  Compaq recently chose to hire the
facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee.  Enron Building Services
provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.
The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by
Pitney Bowes.  The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing
is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.
They have opted not to lower the price.  The recommendation of both Real
Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.

      Base cost for services was
$190,198.00
