Just FYI, whether it matters or not, but commissions in gas average $3-4 a 
contract.  Not sure about power.

While we are putting this card together I thougth you guys might like to see 
some of the imputed commission numbers.......I thought we would cut it off at 
$100,000 saved. I'm using an average rate of $10 per 10,000 mmbtu gas and 
power equivalent.
