> Key Points:
> 1. Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at
> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
> end of the traditional withdrawal season.
> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
> of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.
> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the "heat" will remain on natural gas
> prices throughout 2001.
> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains
> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the
> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.
