Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to 
Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there 
will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction.  
The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been 
set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg 
has been set.
