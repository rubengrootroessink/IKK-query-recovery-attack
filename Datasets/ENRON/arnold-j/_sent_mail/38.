Good Afternoon, John!

Thanks for agreeing to be one of the Profile articles in the next issue of 
the ENSIDE.  Michelle Vitrella assured me that you would be an interesting 
topic!  Our newsletter is set for publication in February and I am setting my 
interview schedule now.  I would love to sit down and visit with you for 
about 30 minutes in the early part of December.  Please let me know a day and 
time that is convenient for you.

I look forward to hearing from you!
