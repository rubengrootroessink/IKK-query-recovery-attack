So, what is it?   And by the way, don't start with the excuses.   You're 
expected to be a full, gourmet cook.

Kisses, not music, makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

I told you I have a long email address.

I've decided what to prepare for dinner tomorrow.  I hope you aren't
expecting anything extravagant because my culinary skills haven't been
put to use in a while.  My only request is that your stereo works.  Music
makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

Watch the debate if you are home tonight.  I want a report tomorrow...
Jen
