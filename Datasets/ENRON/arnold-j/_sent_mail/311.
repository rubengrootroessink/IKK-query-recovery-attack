Jim:
The list I gave you is a list of brokers that can clear through you, NOT 
brokers that you clear exclusively.  You do not clear any of my brokers 
exclusively.  All trades that clear through you will be done on discretionary 
trade-by trade basis.  You MUST have your floor personnel reverse everything 
they they told my brokers this morning.

I am not happy.

John
