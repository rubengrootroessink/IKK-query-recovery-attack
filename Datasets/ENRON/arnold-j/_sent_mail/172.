Mark:
You've called it right thus far.  

Let's plan to get a drink after work on the 19th.
Thanks,
John

John:
?
I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am 
receiving hourly "9" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one  that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major  
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater  detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me  know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,
?
