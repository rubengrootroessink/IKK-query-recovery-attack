Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.
