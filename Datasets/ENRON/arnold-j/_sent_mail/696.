i think taking a cab is more convenient assuming we can find one on the way 
back.

Kim and I are going from here.  We were debating sharing a cab, or taking the 
bus from Enron Field. Any preference?

Oh, I was going to tell you that your invitation gives you the ability to 
invite a guest so if you wanted to bring Jennifer, you can.  But, I do have 
cute girlfriends going with me, so if you just want to go with us -- that 
will be fun!  I'm planning on leaving here around 6 -- you want to go with 
me??
