Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate 
stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so 
people don't try to click numbers that are old.  

On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a 
very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  

Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.

I asked them to permission on your stack manager this function. You might 
want to have it as a stand alone icon on your desktop in case you can't 
operate stack manager.

When you have a second I'd like to talk about the broker EOL product and ED F 
Man.

Congrats on a big day. Total EOL gas volume was 425BcF (!!).
