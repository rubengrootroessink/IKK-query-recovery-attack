Warren Tashnek called to say that the documents for the credit line will not 
be available until next week.  It seems that all of Soc Gen's Paris office is 
on holiday for the month of August so the  credit proposal for the Enron 
facility is gathering dust on someone's desk until they return.  

Mary Cook is working on t he brokerage agreement between Fimat and Enron.  
That should be done in about a week.
