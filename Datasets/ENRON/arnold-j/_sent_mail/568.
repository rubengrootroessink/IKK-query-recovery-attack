I received this email and they are inquiring as to the new gas 24/7 
electronic trading.  Has this taken off?  Who is managing it and are there 
any positions associated with it?

Thanks,
Frank

The weekly Rick Buy update this week is on Thursday morning, so we will 
report trading results as of and for the 5 days ended Tuesday, March 20th. 
Please prepare comments on your area's positions and P/L - one to two 
sentences - and e-mail them to me, with a copy to Cassandra Schultz, Veronica 
Valdez and Matthew Adams, no later than noon, Houston time, Wednesday, March 
21st (Tomorrow). 


Those of you who have sub-limits not reflected on the consolidated DPR 
(George in Global Products), and also the new gas 24/7 trader, please provide 
trading results on those as well, including the 5-day and YTD P/L and current 
NOP and VaR on George (Products EOL trading) - and also on _____ whatever 
we're calling the EOL NA Gas auto trader.

Thank you,

Esther
