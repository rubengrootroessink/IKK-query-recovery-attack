imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

'Split connect' isn't in my petroleum industry dictionary.  I'm counting
on you for a definition.

Do you have plans tonight?
