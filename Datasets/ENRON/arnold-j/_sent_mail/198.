Hello Vandy Recruiting Team,

Well it is almost time for the corporate presentation on campus (September 
26th at 5:30pm) and the MBA golf tournament (September 30th at 12pm).  I need 
to know as soon as possible the members who are available to participate in 
either of these events.  We only need two participants for the golf 
tournament but we will need at least 6 to 8 members for the presentation.  
Reserve your spot now before its too late!

Thank you and if you have any questions feel free to contact me at x 53214.

Kristin Gandy
Associate Recruiter
