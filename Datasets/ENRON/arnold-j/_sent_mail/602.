very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough 
on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to 
buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents 
when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though 
it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported 
just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of 
the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year.
