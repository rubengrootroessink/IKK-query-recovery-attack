Mike:
Please resend the forms needed although I may have sent the necessary docs 
with the courier that delivered the check.  Do not believe we've seen the 
worst yet.

Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a 
while.  Even with the rally today I do not believe we've seen the worst yet.

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike
