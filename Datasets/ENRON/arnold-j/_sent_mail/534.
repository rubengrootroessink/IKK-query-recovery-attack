Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.
Thanks,
John
