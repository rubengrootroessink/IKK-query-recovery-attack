There is no John Taylor at Ocean, and I don't remember the other name
you mentioned on the phone.  Whoever you were talking to last night was
confused.

I found the article in the Baltimore Sun.  Since when are you VP of natural
gas trading?

I'm meeting the girls at Saba tonight in the event you don't have plans
and want to join us.

Jen
