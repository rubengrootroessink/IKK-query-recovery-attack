Subject: Forward-forward Vol Implementation Plan

Plan of action for implementation of the VaR methodology change related to 
forward-forward volatilities:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk) - Done

2. Testing of the new methodology for the Natural Gas Desk in Excel (Market 
Risk)  - Done

3. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff - by 8/7/00
 
 

 - John Lavorato, any comments on the memo?
 - Would you like to run this by John Sherriff or should I do it?

4. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT) - by 8/14/00

5. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders) - by 8/27/00

6. Migrate into production (Research/IT) - 8/28/00

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.
