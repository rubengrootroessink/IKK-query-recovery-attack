Subject: Forward-forward Vol

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Vlady.
