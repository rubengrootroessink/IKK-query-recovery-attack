I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price.  
I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902.  
Sorry for the confusion.

Hey:
I just want to confirm the trades I have in your book.
Trade #1.  I sell 4000 X @ 4652

Trade #2. I buy 4000 X @ 4652
  I sell 4000 X @ 4902

Trade #3 I buy 4000 X @ 5000
  I sell 4000 F @ 5000


Net result: I have 4000 F in your book @ 4902.
Thanks, 
John
