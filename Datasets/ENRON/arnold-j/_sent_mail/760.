Glad to hear progress is being made.
I went to Vandy but a little later... 1992-5.

Significant progress was recently made between Enron's and Salomon Smith
Barney's counsels.  We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be
used for both original and variation margin.  With these elevated NYMEX
margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some
of the small issues where we both share some exposure.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead
investment banks.  The relationship is so sound, we will work out the
wrinkles.  I'll be in touch.

P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?
