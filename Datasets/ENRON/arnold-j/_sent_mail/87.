Hi,

If you sent a bank wire on Monday then it should take about 2-3 days to
be credited to your account, but sometimes it takes one or two days
longer.  So, if you don't see it today, please give us a call at 888 304
2206 and ask for either Maria or Juliette in the accounts department and
they will assist you.

Thanks,

WSEX
