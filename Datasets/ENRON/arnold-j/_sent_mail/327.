Per:
I've talked to him several times in the past.  I told him that you would call 
because of your experience with setting up funds.  They have two main 
problems.   One is setting up their internal systems.  Second, they have 
credit problems with a BBB+.
Please call and introduce yourself.
Thanks,
john
