Boys:
I'm sorry you were not able to attend last night.  I do appreciate your 
efforts to make this book as successful as it has been.  It's not quite the 
same as being in my company, but take your respective wives, or swap, I don't 
care, out this weekend on me.  Try to keep it under $300 per couple.  Keep up 
the good work,
John
