Savita:
A couple of issues:

1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm 
restricted right now by issue #1.

Please advise,
John
