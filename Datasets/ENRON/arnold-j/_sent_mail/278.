Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, 
it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system 
not supplying us with that info.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

-Andy
