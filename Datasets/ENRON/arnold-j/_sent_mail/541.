Subject: moving on



i ve resigned from global today. it is a difficult decision from the stand 
point
that I have been very happy in the short time I've been here. I wil still be 
in
the energy business doing very much the same as i am doing now. I felt that 
the
oportunity which came up was the best thing for my career and family in the 
long
term. I look forward to speaking to all of you in the future and I'll contact
you as soon as i get set up in the next couple of weeks.
