Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later 
flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the 
market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that 
sucked.

I think I would be a little disappointed after traveling so far.......I guess 
it was nice to see your "buddies".

Sounds as if you went to a better show than I did.  The game was very 
sloppy.  They tied 0-0.  Not too exciting.

Well......IT WAS GREAT!!!!!! Live was actually better than Counting Crows 
(Shocking).  How was the Soccer Game?  I owe you dinner.  Thanks again for 
the tickets.
