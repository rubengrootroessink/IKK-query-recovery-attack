John,
My name is Edie Leschber and I will be your Business Analysis and Reporting 
Contact effective immediately.  I am currently in the process of
verifying team members under your section of the Gas Team.  Attached is a 
file with the current list.  Please confirm that your list is complete and/or
send me changes to it at your earliest convenience.  New cost centers have 
been set up due to the reorganization and we would like to begin using these
as soon as possible.  I look forward to meeting you and working with you very 
soon.  Thank you for your assistance.
