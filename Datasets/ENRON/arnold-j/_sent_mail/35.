Subject: FIMAT loan agreement

John - the FIMAT loan agreeemnt will prohibit ENE from using loan proceeds as 
follows:
No part of the proceeds of any Advance hereunder will be used for 
"purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings 
of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

Do you know whether you engage in purchasing or carrying margin stock?  I 
will check with legal as well.  

Sarah
