Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about 
how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.
