i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.
