As far as lunch, it's a done deal.  I need names of people who should be 
allowed.  It is not for the whole floor, but rather for people who need to 
stay at their desk during the day.  Please advise,
John

Just wanted to say "thank-you" for dinner last night.  It's unfortunate Errol 
and Dutch didn't make it, they are the ones who do all the work for you.

Are you going to hook me up on the lunch police?

Thanks again,

Kori.
