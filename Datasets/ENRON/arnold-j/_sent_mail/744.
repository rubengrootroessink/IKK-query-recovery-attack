Hey:
Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the 
worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can 
come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good 
friend.  Nothing has changed that nor do I think we need to act weird around 
each other going forward.  Something I think we both wanted to try and we 
did.  Maybe best left there though.  
John
