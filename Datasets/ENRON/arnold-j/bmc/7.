Eric, 

Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with Tom Moore and me.  
Attached is the (only) contract which I have received from the EBS 
origination team trying to close a deal with BMC Software.  Steve Morse and 
Chaz Vaughan report to Brad Nebergall (VP, Central Origination, EBS), who 
reports to Jim Crowder (VP, Enterprise Services, EBS).  

Please review, and provide your feedback to me, the EBS origination team 
(Chaz, Steve, and Brad Nebergall), and Tom Moore.  

If there are any other EBS deals/contracts on the table involving BMC, I 
would like to do whatever I could to help them close on this.  Please let me 
know if I can do anything else for you!  You can reach me at (x55968) or Tom 
at (x55552).  The origination team is at (Chaz: x58815, Steve: x37137, Brad: 
x34714).  On a final note, the originators have repeatedly driven home the 
point that they must have this deal closed with BMC by end-of-day this 
Friday, December 15.  I am focused on helping them win the business however I 
can.

Thank you,

Jeff

Chaz,

I assume Jeff is running with this.  The contract needs to be in place by
