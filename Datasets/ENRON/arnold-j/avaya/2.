Jennifer, 

I hope James is getting the treatment he needs to get on the way back to 
normal!

As you can see below from the reply from Serge Minassian's AA, it would 
appear that the note I 
sent to Thad on the 21st hadn't been used to successfully transfer the info 
to Barbara...I will 
now call Kim Godfrey back (I was waiting on this response from Ms. Korp, so I 
could better know 
the Avaya Execs' calendars' status).

I'll talk w/you later...

Jeff

Jeff,

Thanks for the message and especially for letting me know that the meeting
will not be held on December 13th and 14th.  I already reserved the Avaya
Briefing Center, but will be sure to cancel it this morning.

If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

Barbara,

I do not know if you received a "heads-up" on this,
but since you are working with Executive calendars and the
Briefing Center resource, I wanted to make sure you had it.
Better safe than sorry, especially with the recent holidays.

Thad White and I agreed that in order to properly simplify
the communications channels between our organizations,
that he and I should be the primary points of interconnection
for this particular project and these meetings.  I apologize that
I do not have the calendar availability of the various Enron
Broadband Services executives, but given the opportunities
of having meetings in Basking Ridge either:  (for 1.5 days of a
3 day period) December 19 - 21, 2000 or January 9 - 11, 2001;
the (tentative) preference leanings are toward rescheduling
the currently proposed dates of December 13/14 to the
January 2001 dates.

I will keep Thad posted, and he will keep you posted.  I
apologize for any delays or confusion, if any, but I will
periodically check in with you as well, to make sure we're
all on the same path.  My primary communication focus will
be Thad, however, in order to minimize any confusion.

Thank you,

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know
how
many people from Enron will be visiting our headquarters.  I've asked for
the afternoon of December 13th and all day on the 14th.

Barbara, et. al.:

After a flurry of phone calls, in which both Jennifer Stewart
and I have spoken with Serge Minassian, the following dates
look like the most likely targets:  for the 1st day (half-day session),
Wednesday, December 13.  For the 2nd day (full-day session),
Thursday, December 14th.

Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,
on the 13th in the afternoon.  That meeting would be essentially
an executive overview and strategy session for the appropriate
Avaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-
utives.  The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentation
of their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.

The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineering
and development organizations, and possibly marketing; to
have a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.  Both
software/firmware and product platform-type of concepts would
be examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avaya
development folks felt that there were possible synergies for
a solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:

1)  "sell to":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and
2)  "sell through & sell with":  EBS and Avaya possibly
developing a solution for bringing to market in a similar
fashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.

By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking that
they will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,
and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit into
the appropriate calendars.  If there are any Avaya questions
related to development/engineering efforts, I would coordinate
as well, and most likely route to Larry Ciscon, or other EBS
engineering/development executive(s), as appropriate.

Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to the
opportunity!

Jeff & Thad,

I spoke with Serge this afternoon.  He definitely wants to meet with Enron
as soon as possible, but only for a maximum of two hours.  Two members of
his team will participate, Wayne Sam and Edward Chang.  I will coordinate a
date with them and send a message of available days and times.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call or write.
