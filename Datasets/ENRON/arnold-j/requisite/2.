Matt,
I have spoken with Mark who is part of the GSS organization and we are going 
to pursue this after the first of the year.  Mark has a relationship with the 
President of Requisite and we will be having a meeting with him to discuss 
opportunity.

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.
