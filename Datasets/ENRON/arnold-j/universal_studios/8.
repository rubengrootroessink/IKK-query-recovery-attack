Jennifer,
I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard 
to Universal Studios.  He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in 
the range their group would consider for a prospect.  Lee said their main 
clients are chemical companies/producers.  He mentioned a typical usage would 
be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and  5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large 
users.  

I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for 
us.  I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something 
through Alan Engberg beginning next year.

Colleen
