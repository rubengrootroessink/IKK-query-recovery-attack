Sean, how are you?
Here's the requested information:
   The absolute correct person for them to meet and who will make the media
   buying decision would be Ms. Cherie Crane.

Would you like for me to place a call and find out what's going on?  Let me
know.

Dear George,

I hope all is going well for you there.  I need your help.  Listed below is
an email from my contact person at Enron Media Services.  They are planning
to offer media in a trading environment (like a commodity) and need to know
who the "right" contact at SPE would be.  As you can see, they have met with
several people but are unsure who makes the media decisions at SPE.  Can you
please help me direct them to the right person?  If they have already met
with the right person, can you identify them so that I can follow up and
determine SPE's interest in their proposal.  Thanks for the help.

Sincerely,
Sean A. O'Brien
Vice President

Sean,
The following are the contacts that have been made by Enron Media Services
with Enron Picture. The initial meeting, Enron Media Services was
represented by Mike Horning, Edward Ondarza and Steve Crumley.
We met with the following personnel from SPE:

- Allan Dick, VP Corporate Procurement
- Cherie Crane, SVP Media
- Joseph Foley, SVP Marketing
- Kathleen Shane, VP Finance
- Jennie Angelos, Director Business Planning
- Peter LaBrida, Manager Corporate Procurement

Mike has provided Allan with today's one-year fixed price swap for spot TV
media in NY, LA and Houston.  Mike expects feedback from Allan today on the
pricing and the Sony attendees from meeting.  The next meeting that Mike is
having is
11/1 with Allan Dick.

Could you do some investigation and find out what the feel is for the Enron
Media Services product offering and possible communicate to Sony Pictures
that there are revenue opportunities for Sony also.

Please give me a call when you have an opportunity.

Jennifer
