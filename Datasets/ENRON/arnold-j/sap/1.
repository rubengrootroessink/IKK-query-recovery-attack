Looks like we are dead in the water based on this message and the one Glenn 
got. Let's meet to review this morning.

Hello Curtis,

sorry for the late response.
An upgrade from E1 to E3 is not an option for the mentioned locations, for
the foreseeable future.
The 2. proposal is also not an option for us, because we buy bandwidth on
demand and the demands change very dynamically, therefore such a plan would
not fit our requirements.

best regards Dietmar

Dietmar,
   Attached is a message from Enron Broadband Services on sizing the
proposal back to SAP.
Hopefully his attached message is clear in terms of finding a way to
structure it
for growth based on your needs.  This would increase the size of our
arrangement if it
makes good sense for you.  Please get back to me with your thoughts.

Curtis - following our phone call this morning I met with Matt Harris and
our
structuring person (Glenn Surowiec) to review the deal. After some quick
analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.

The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.
The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.

Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).

For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

Please let me know what your thoughts are and let's talk ASAP.
