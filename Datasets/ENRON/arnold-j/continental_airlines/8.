Carrie:

Thanks for facilitating a brief Experience Enron tour for 15 minutes each in 
two areas (30 minutes total):

 a) the gas trading floor on EB 32 with Craig Taylor
 b) Enron Online tour on EB 27

If it becomes necessary to replace b) with a tour of the gas control room, 
we'll follow up with you.

Additionally, thanks for getting us the 4 Enron overview marketing brochures 
for the Continental attendees.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Carrie, we appreciate your working with us on such short notice!
