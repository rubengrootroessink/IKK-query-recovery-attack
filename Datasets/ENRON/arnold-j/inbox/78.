John -

I want to confirm that you received the literature on the UBS PaineWebber
Private Equity Fund III and the Tamarack Fund.  The Private Equity III
literature refers to a December 17 closing date; however, we have extended
that closing, so you may still be able to participate.  Have you reviewed
the material, yet?

Thanks,
