I completely understand and thanks for letting me know.  Maybe when I become a famous rock star and leave Enron you will reconsider.  I don't know if I can make it on Friday.  I am singing in a good friends wedding this weekend and the rehearsal dinner is Friday night.  If you are going to be out any other time this week let me know and if not I can get it next week.  How was your weekend with your friend?  
 
Talk to you soon.

Ok, so I'm an asshole.  Sorry for not responding earlier.  There really were some things I needed to think about. 
As I spend the majority of my life at or around Enron, the majority of the people I know professionally, socially, and romantically have been from Enron.  The further I get professionally, the harder it seems to continue the other two: socially to keep my sanity, and romantically for so many other reasons.  Although I do really like you and am very attracted to you, it is just really tough for me to ask you out right now.  Your only fault in my eyes is your place of employment.  As such, I would prefer to try to be friends for a while.  
I still do have your necklace.  I'll promise to have it Friday at the front porch if you're there.
John
