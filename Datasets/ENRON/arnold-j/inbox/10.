John,

I appreciate your candor.  While I acknowledge my lack
of industry experience, I would have no problem
putting in needed time to gain a full knowledge of the
underlying products.  I'm not too proud or too old to
do my homework.

I would welcome the opportunity to talk with one of
your associates in more depth and am available at your
convenience.  I plan to be in Houston September 25-27
and have a pretty flexible schedule.  I can be reached
by phone at 415.776.3035 or 312.286.8977.

Thanks again for your feedback.

Best Regards,

Alex Pritchartt
