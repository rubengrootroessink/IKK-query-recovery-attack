Dear Amazon.com Customer,

The holiday gift-giving season is almost here, but before you start
making lists and checking them twice, here's an incentive to cross a
few things off your own list--$5 to spend toward a purchase of $50 or
more from your Amazon.com Wish List.

While you're there, it's also an ideal time to get your Wish List up
to date. You can delete any outdated items, add some new items from
the handy list of personal recommendations, and easily send your Wish
List to family and friends to use during the upcoming holiday season.

So grant yourself a wish today--just check your Wish List, add the
items you want to your Shopping Cart, and use the claim code below to
save $5 on your purchase of $50 or more. But don't delay--this offer
expires November 8, 2001.

Sincerely,

Matt Williams
Director (and Avid Wisher)
Amazon.com
