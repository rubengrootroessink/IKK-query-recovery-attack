I agree.  Lavorato has made it official that nothing goes out without his approval, as has all traders.  David Port requested that I continue to monitor option book so that was reason for my request.  No external parties involved.

Can you explain in detail the reasons you need this info.  Not that I don't trust you, but I won't release this data to anybody unless I know the rationale.

Thanks. 
Currently it is for my own purpose.  Lavo wants heads up on everything before it goes external

The problem probably relates to the Exotica add-in.  Do you have that add-in? 
Also, are you looking at the position for your own purposes or is someone asking about them? 
Thanks.

I'm going into Financial trading/position directory and when I open file the macro's crash.  Am I in the right file/directory?
Thanks
