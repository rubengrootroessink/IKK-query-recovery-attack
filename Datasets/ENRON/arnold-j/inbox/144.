we just need to understand the option position - its not for external consumption - just our own
in particular the funding implications of close to expiry options etc.

Frank:
Can you explain in detail the reasons you need this info.  Not that I don't trust you, but I won't release this data to anybody unless I know the rationale.

Currently it is for my own purpose.  Lavo wants heads up on everything before it goes external

The problem probably relates to the Exotica add-in.  Do you have that add-in? 
Also, are you looking at the position for your own purposes or is someone asking about them? 
Thanks. 
John
