Dear Mr. Arnold:

Thank you for your email.
Yes, recruiting season is now in full swing.  I am now waiting to hear from
Ms. Chenee Franklin, hoping to secure an interview.  Eva was very helpful
and informative; through her I learned a good deal about Enron's trading
businesses.
Once scheduled for an interview, I would appreciate it if we could talk over
the phone at your convenience.

Again, thank you, and I will keep you updated.

Sincerely,

Gad Caspy

Just following up to see if the recruiting season has started and to make
sure everything is going okay.  If you need anything, just say the word.

   Gad:
   Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva
   referred
   you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I
   was
   planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't
   know.
   I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program
   in
   addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an
   offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate
   recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk
   via
   phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good
   opportunities here.

      Subject:  Potential employment opportunities with Enron

      Dear Mr. Arnold:

      I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student
   at
      Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring
      potential
      employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am
   interested
      in
      derivatives trading.

      I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
      professional experience has been in a variety of roles within
   financial
      institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk,
   before
      starting my MBA.

      I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of
   your
      colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston
   or
      NYC
      areas in the next few months.

      Thank you for your time and consideration.

      Sincerely,

      Gad Caspy
