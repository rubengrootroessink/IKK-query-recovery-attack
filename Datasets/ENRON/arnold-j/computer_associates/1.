Stephen Down and I met with Computer Associates in Toronto yesterday. Here 
are some of my thoughts on how it went.

We met with Julia in the morning -- went to CA's Toronto office, where we 
made presentation on EBS. Later Julia made a presentation on Computer 
Associates, their Sales manager talked about their "security suit of 
products", we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software, and 
then taken to lunch.  At lunch, we were joined by the President of Worldwide 
Online Corporation (a Canadian startup).

About Computer Associates:
Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders. 
The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing business 
in the world. It offers more then 800 software products. Like other companies 
in their space, their stock has taken a beating this year losing more then 
half its value (Jan 00: ~ $70, now ~$27)

Julia Ruslys, is part of their "Strategic Alliances" team -- their mandate is 
to manage:
Strategic Business Alliances
Development Partner Program
eForce technology unit
Analyst relations

CA's APPROACH
Computer Associates sees EBS as a potential "development partner". Their 
interest seems to be in a long-term alliance with EBS, where they can package 
their software with a bundled network offering (from EBS) for their clients. 
They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a 30% market share of IT 
infrastructure management market. It is a cutting software package that can 
manage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise. With a stunning graphic 
interface, the software can be configured to manage:
All networks within an Enterprise
Each computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored and 
managed remotely (software installation etc.)
Their is a plethora of add-ons to the basic UniCenter package including some 
advanced "Asset Management" tools that can predict future utilization through 
a neural network architecture.

She commented that with UniCenter TNG, our clients have "full control and 
flexibility over their whole network" EXCEPT  THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS.  EBS's 
flexible and intelligent BOS, if integrated with UniCenter TNG, can provide 
an enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptional 
flexibility. Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing and 
expanding their storage solutions.

They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity and 
increasing revenues through increasing the number of "CA certifications" and 
joint selling initiatives. In other words, they would like EBS's network to 
be CA-certified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNet 
Connect. They currently have 1500 partners, including almost all top names in 
IT infrastructure space.

EBS APPROACH CONVEYED
Although I think we have conveyed EBS's approach of "looking at specific 
quick and clear opportunities", CA does not seem like a lean-mean 
organization. Furthermore, the people that we met with, did not seem to have 
an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities 
-- instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of 
their organization. For example, when Steve Dowd talked about financial risk 
management tools, their sales manager started talking about how they help 
enterprises manage risk through their "security software packages."

WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP.
Worldwide Online Corp. is a startup (with less then $2M revenues) that claims 
to have good connections with CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.)  They were in 
contact with Brad Sims' group out of Portland. That group, at some point lost 
interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming 
services. Being a start-up with no credit, it is understandable why they were 
abandoned by us. Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and 
he may give Brad a call. I personally do not see anything for us in the next 
two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports 
broadcast opportunities by CBC.

It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA. Julia went 
out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online. At one point, I 
almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and 
Worldwide online.

NEXT STEPS:
Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some 
specific short to medium-term opportunity with CA. Julia is going to identify 
the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with 
regards to IP connectivity needs of CA (their network infrastructure 
procurement team.)  At the same time, we had to show an interest in bringing 
her team together with our product development people to see if any 
integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect 
BOS/Storage etc.
