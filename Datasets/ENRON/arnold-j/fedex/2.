John, please forward to Ms. Hunter.

Sara-Joy:

Looks like Buck sent us back to Jim Vines.
If you remember, JimVines referred us to the contacts that have already
called you.

Please feel free to e-mail Mr. McGugan for further assistance.

Jim, can you assist me with this customer.  Based on the attached email, we
have not put this customer in touch with the proper person in purchasing.
This is a good account; I need your help to make sure we provide them the
proper contact.

Please have the proper person call Carmen and also let me know they followed
up.

Thx, Buck
