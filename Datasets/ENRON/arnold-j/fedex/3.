Sarah-Joy,

Mike Golden and John Pattillo should be conversing this afternoon.  After 
this call Chris Gant, Mike Golden, Carmen, Gary Stoop (Strategic Sourcing 
Managing Director) and Richard Roberts are to attempt to get together and 
discuss.  Carmen is working on getting names, titles, and phone numbers and 
advising.  I'll advise next steps, after we hear how the conversation went 
with John and Mike.

Thanks for your patience.

Trying to located the rest for you but they are not coming up.  Give me until
this afternoon.

Edith Kelly Green is not coming up at all and Mike Golden shows to be no 
longer
with the company.  I am checking, though.
