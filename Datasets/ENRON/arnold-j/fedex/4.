Thanks, John.  If I'm in when the conference call (subsequent to the internal 
Fedex meeting) is held, I'd like to join you.    Either way, look forward to 
staying in the loop.

Appreciate it.

As of today, Richard Roberts, FedEx Senior Attorney, notified me of the
following:

Billy Mike Golden, Managing Director of Field Facility Management,
received a call from John Patillo.  Mr. Golden was in the process of
returning his call at approximately 2:15 p.m.    Depending on what the
two discussed will determine if FedEx needs to hold a conference call to
discuss this further.

If a conference call is needed, it will occur as soon as possible.  The
attendees will be FedEx employees.  They are as follows:

Carmen Perez, Corporate Account Executive
Billy M. Golden
Gary Stoops, Managing Director of Supply Chain Management
Richard Roberts

After FedEx holds the conference call, it will be determined if FedEx
commercial and legal needs to meet with Enron commercial and legal.

I understand if resolution does not take place prior to December 31,
2000 FedEx may not be Enron's carrier.

Regards,

Carmen Perez
