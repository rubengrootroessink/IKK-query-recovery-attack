Jennifer:

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G.  I had the agenda discussion items and  guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
"message" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides.  

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.  Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

Sarah-Joy,
I would contact Greg Pyle and find out what took place on the conference call.
Have a Happy and safe Christmas!

Jennifer:

In my absence, the only issues I expect to arise are the Fedex and HP deals.

For FEDEX:  (cross sell)  I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, 
Carmen Perez's boss's boss this morning at his office in Chicago.  
847-215-4241.  This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex 
business units which I have received.

(buy side--John Will)  I forwarded John's latest update earlier this week 
then his note below.  First, he had several conference calls with George 
Wasaff to John Pattillo.  John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John 
on Friday (he didn't) with the specifics of ABS' counter offer to FEDEX.  
John's e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back 
from Pattillo.  Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex 
account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex's 
response to lawsuit issue update.  Third, George Wasaff has made himself 
available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will 
help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor.  Fourth, John has been told to 
begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual 
relationship.  I've asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments 
with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex 
account.

HP:  Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine.  Peter G. has asked 
Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron 
wireless team returns from London.  This is in progress.  EFS/Datawarehouse 
equipment meeting set for early Jan.  Spoke with Peter G.

I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the 
opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert 
with the sales force.  My e-mailed question to you was as follows:  Do we 
just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter 
G. message delivered to him on 12/14?


Kinko's:  Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko's CIO via conference call.  That 
enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko's.  Also, connected Ed 
Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing.  He is the initial decision 
maker.  Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of 
Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from 
EIM Pulp & Paper team 9 months ago.  But, the offer was not as competitive as 
the options offered by the Kinko's paper mills.  Ed and Chris have some 
homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing.  
Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau 
on getting to the CFO's office as necessary.  So, both sides are moving 
foward here.

Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F.  on office automation 
(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn't attend the 
meeting.  Ed had some great ideas for the process.


Continental:  Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 
PM as a follow up thank-you.  Meeting minutes sent out.  Will be working with 
Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for 
airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going.  Also, followup up with Tawney, 
Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan.  Plastics will also be coming to 
GSS/BD to give educational overview.

CSC, Sonoco, Instromet followup in Jan. 2001.

Have a great holiday!  I will be checking my work voicemail daily weekdays 
(except Christmas day).

John:

Good Morning!

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.


Appreciate it.

Sarah-Joy
