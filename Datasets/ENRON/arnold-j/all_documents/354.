The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been
but heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny.
Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the
stock price with it.  Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but
I think I just did.
Your long lost buddy,
John

Is this "the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives"?  If so, you
should write me back after you complete your "nine hours and $1 billion in
trades" today!!   Does this mean I have to start calling you "Mr. John"?!
It was great to see you're doing so well....
Your long lost buddy,
Heather
