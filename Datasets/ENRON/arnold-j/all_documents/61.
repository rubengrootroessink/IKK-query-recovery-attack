Jennifer - just wanted to give you a quick SAP update - we have some traction 
still with them. We are going to provide them with a proposal for the 
4-eurpoean cities mentioned during the last conference call. On the low-end 
it is a $2.09M deal with the high-end (lower probability) could be $8M-plus.

We hope to have firms numbers to them late next week. We also had a conf-call 
with Commerce One that did not go well with respect to bandwidth, however we 
are still going to pursue the reseller potential with them for next quarter.
