FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

Per:
I've talked to him several times in the past.  I told him that you would call 
because of your experience with setting up funds.  They have two main 
problems.   One is setting up their internal systems.  Second, they have 
credit problems with a BBB+.
Please call and introduce yourself.
Thanks,
john
