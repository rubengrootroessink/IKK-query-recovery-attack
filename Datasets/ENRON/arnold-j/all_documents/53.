Jennifer,
Due to the Vivendi merger, the Universal deal has taken on a whole new 
scope.  On a lead from Jeff Y., I contacted Kim Monk, Dr. Corp. Alliances, 
who reports to Nebergall.  Kim was interested in discussing this further and 
working on best leveraging BU strategies.  We are to catch up when she 
returns to Houston, but this is what we discussed in our quick phone call 
today:

Vivendi 
Enron delivered an MOU to Vivendi (Kim may forward)
Currently 5-6 initiatives including:
Vivendi overall - bandwidth, co-location, dark fiber, PAN European network, 
cable 
Havas (Viviendi subsidiary) - discussions with Havas CEO for distance 
learning, bandwidth, ASP and streaming initiatives
Initiatives in other subsidiaries including:  Canal Plus, Digitel

Blockbuster
Due to restructuring of Vivendi/Universal, EBS to work on Blockbuster's 
year-end (Phase I) initiatives first and then (Phase II & III) 3Q next year
Cox speaking with Universal in LA as content and distribution partner 
(although this is Blockbuster's obligation, Enron is also working as a third 
party to secure)

Enron-Vivendi Relationship
Vivendi sees Enron as both a competitor and partner depending upon the segment
