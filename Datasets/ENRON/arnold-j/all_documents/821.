Andy:
Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with 
regard to EOL for UK gas.
We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).
Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below. 

Once again, thanks for your help
All the best,

Andy

Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards 


Andy
