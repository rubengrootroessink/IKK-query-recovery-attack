Sarah-Joy,
Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

I spoke to John briefly this morning.  Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week.  John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS.  I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP.  My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon.  Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

John:

Since this message Friday at noon, have you heard anything back from John 
Pattillo?  Please send e-mail updates this week to both me and Jennifer 
Medcalf on points a) through e) noted below.

Thanks.

Sarah-Joy
