Subject: ENA Fileplan Project - Needs your approval

Carolyn Gilley who is a department head in our records management group has 
hired the firm, Millican & Assoicates to come in and compile all of our 
current and archived files into a more suitable fileplan.  Enron has given 
permission for this firm to handle this, but they need further approval from 
each one of you to deal with your backoffice people and with your assistants 
in compiling this information to complete their project.  Below is a more 
detailed letter from the firm explaining their work here.

Please respond to me that I have your approval to give for them to complete 
your project.

Thank You,

Ina Rangel

Subject: ENA Fileplan Project

Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're 
taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.

Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
Thank you.
