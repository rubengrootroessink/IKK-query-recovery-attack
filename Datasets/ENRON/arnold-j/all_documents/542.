Doug:
To confirm the pricing of the LNG dela::

I can show a $3.01 bid for the Nymex portion of 160,000 mmbtu/day for the 
time period Jan 2003-Dec 2014.  The bid on Henry Hub basis for same time 
period is -$.0025 resulting in fix price of $3.0075; the bid on Sonat basis 
is -$.0175 translating into a bid of $2.9925.

Notional volume = 70,128 contracts.
PV volume = 37,658 contracts.
Exposure per $.01 move = $3,760,000

John
