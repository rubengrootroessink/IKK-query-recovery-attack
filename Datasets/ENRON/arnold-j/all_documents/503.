Margaret:
As you can imagine, most information and procedures on the floor are 
extremely confidential.  We look at the gas market uniquely and using 
different tools than anybody else.  It is one of our competitive advantages.  
I'm hesistant to approve the use of any documents for external purposes.  
If you provide more information about what you're trying to show, who the 
target audience is, and what format it will be presented, I may be able to 
help you.
John

John,

Please look over this file and let me know if it is okay for us to use it as 
the screen shot that is on all the monitors in the commercial.  Please 
include Ann on your response, as she will be passing it through legal since 
I'm out of the office.

Ann, 
Once he gets this back to you, please run it by Mark Taylor.  If he is okay 
with it, email the final version back to me, because the crew in Toyko needs 
it ASAP.  

Thanks!  Margaret

Margaret -- It's critical that you get John Arnold's permission before using 
the attached spreadsheet and graphs.  They contain curves through July 12th.  
Also, you may want to get legal permission from Mark Taylor.

Hi Kal,
 Here are some screen shots, let me know if they will work for you.  I think 
we may need to double check with John Arnold- the trader- before using them 
for sure.  But I was told they would be okay.
