Thanks for making me work out yesterday AND making me do sit ups!  And for 
helping me clean up the other day - very nice!!  Anyway, I was going to go 
tonight to prepare for my trip to Mexico BUT, when I called, they said I 
should wait until I get back.  So, I am thinking that Tuesday, may 29th is 
the day!
