Colleen,

Thanks for the heads up on this.  We would be pleased to look into this whe=
n=20
the time is right from your perspective.   Let us know.   Please follow-up=
=20
with Mike Rogala or me.

FYI - there were some conversations with ProStaff earlier this year around=
=20
the same topic and I believe the conclusion was that their bandwidth needs =
to=20
were too small to be interesting.   I would recommend that we get some sizi=
ng=20
info from Corestaff up front so we can determine whether it is worth their=
=20
time and ours. =20

Thanks again,

Brad

Brad,
As you are aware, Enron has recently signed an agreement with Corestaff for=

=20
Corestaff has a contract with MCI for broadband services that will be comin=
g=20
up this year for renegotiation.  In the coming month, we would like to=20
facilitate a meeting with the EBS contacts you determine and the Corestaff =
IT=20
contacts.

Nationally, Corestaff has 100 offices and its parent company, The Corporate=
=20

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=

We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
