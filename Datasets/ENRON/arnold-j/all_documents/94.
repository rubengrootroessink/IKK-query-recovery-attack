Jeff,

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified 
spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing.  Basically, 
we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol 
(monitoring).

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce, 
Corp, and London) are trying to make a joint decision, but the other two 
groups are dragging out their evaluations...



Regards,
Douglas
