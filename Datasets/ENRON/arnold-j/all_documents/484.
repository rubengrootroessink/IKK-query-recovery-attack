Subject: ALS Charity - It's Time to Collect

John,

Thank you for sponsoring me for ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).  I need to turn 
all funds in by Wednesday, July 26.  Please make your check payable to 
"MDA."  (Cash is also accepted.)  Call me when ready and I'll come collect or 
send to EB2801e.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor x31935
