Dave:
Can you modify the code that disallows at choice market.  Sometimes the 
system will allow me to make a choice market by lowering my offer, sometimes 
it won't.  The system will never allow me to raise a bid to make a choice 
market.   I use this feature when 

The sytem should continue to disallow inverted markets, a market where the 
bid is greater than the offer.
