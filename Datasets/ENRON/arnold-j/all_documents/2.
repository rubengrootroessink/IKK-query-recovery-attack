Carrie,

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

We would like to change the date for the Compaq Experience ENRON request I 
submitted online.   Originally the date was 12/13, we would like to 
reschedule for 12/14 for one hour in the afternoon.  Jennifer Stewart Medcalf 
will give you a call with further details.
