Adam:
Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer
