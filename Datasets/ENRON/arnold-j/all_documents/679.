Subject: Fimat (Soc Gen Line)

John - I got a call from Warren Tashnek today.  He is concerned about the 
usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its 
costs.   He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referred 
him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with 
us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please 
address this with him?  

Thanks, Sarah
