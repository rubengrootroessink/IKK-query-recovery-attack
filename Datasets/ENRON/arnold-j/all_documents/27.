Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Colleen

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.
