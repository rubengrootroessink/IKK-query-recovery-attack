John, the matrix that was sent to you includes YTD P&L for all the traders in 
the matrix.  Trader P&L contribution to desk P&L, however, was not backed out 
on that particular matrix.  That matrix effectively shows one trader's 
correlation to all others.  What is does not show is one trader's P&L to the 
desk P&L.  I have included a spreadsheet with each trader's P&L backed out of 
AGG-GAS P&L to demonstrate their relationship.  Please call Frank or myself 
if you have questions.  Thanks.

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?
