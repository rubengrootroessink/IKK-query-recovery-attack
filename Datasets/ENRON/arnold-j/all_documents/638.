Dear  Amazon Customer, 

What's  an  Amazoniversary?  Three years ago this month, you placed your very 
first order (using this  e-mail address) with Amazon.com. To remind you how 
much there is to  experience here, we're offering you free shipping (up to 
$10) on your next  order of $50 or  more.  

So  celebrate any way you like: with a bestselling  book,  a new  DVD  
release, or a  CD  player--it's up to you. But be sure to take advantage of 
this exclusive  free shipping offer before May 31. (See details below.)

We look  forward to all your Amazoniversaries to  come!   

  Sincerely,
