Jim:
I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the 
market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning.  
It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a 
longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen 
again. 
John
