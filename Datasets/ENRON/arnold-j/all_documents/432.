Sarah:
Can you create a spreadsheet summarizing Enron's open futures interest broken 
down by commodity and broker, including maintenance and initial margin for 
all commodities (including rates, currencies, gas, crude, etc).  
Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and 
the rates we pay.
Thanks,
John
