Mark:
Let's keep the present system for the short-term.  I would like to continue 
looking at your work for another couple weeks.  We'll talk later,
John

John:
?
The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? My 
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural 
appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly 
since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be 
using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same 
price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right 
here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral 
stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? 
However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal 
price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.
?
Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.? I certainly  don't want to 
waste your time.? In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something to 
pass along, let me know.? I don't know how often you  check/see your e-mail.? 
Thanks,
?
Mark Sagel
