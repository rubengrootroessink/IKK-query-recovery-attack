Thank you Doug!

I relayed the update verbally to Jennifer Medcalf, here is the written 
version.  Expect a copy on a note I'm going to send EBS.

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - Quest is so far ahead 
technology-wise and cheaper.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate.  I believe Jim 
Ogg wants to evaluate more tools and related design tools before making a 
decision.

Regards,
Douglas
