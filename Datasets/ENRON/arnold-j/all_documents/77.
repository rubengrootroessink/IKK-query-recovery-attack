Gentlemen:

Thank you for your time this morning. Patrick and I feel this call swayed a 
bit
off track, and would like to make some corrections to the messages that were
delivered today.

Enron is looking for a much deeper and more strategic relationship with HP 
than
a quick storage trade. We see  value in working to define a big picture which
both HP and Enron find rewarding. Ravi did a great job explaining our trading
model, so now you understand the role of the trading desk. Our job is to 
uncover
how best to use the trading desk in whatever strategic structure we build
together.

As we are both Fortune 20 companies, we feel there is a world of opportunity 
for
us together. Your internal initiative of "always on", fits well with our
bandwidth and storage on demand initiatives. We look forward to working with 
you
to figure out the best way to put them all together.
