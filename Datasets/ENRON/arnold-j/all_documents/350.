John:

I don't mind cleaning up their books at quarter end.  However,at year end I 
will want to keep the debt off of my books.  As we approach year-end this 
year could you please coordinate with Joe Deffner so that we take advantage 
of the margin lines we have available in order to minimize the debt on our 
books.

Thanks,

Ben

Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities 
as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, 
supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are 
trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30.  
They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did 
this last year as well.   Please advise,
John
