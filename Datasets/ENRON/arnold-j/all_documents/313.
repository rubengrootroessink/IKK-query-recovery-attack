Subject: Substantiation for EOL

Hi, 

I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help 
me substantiate the EOL commercial.  ABC is threatening not to run it if I 
don't prove that "Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities 
Market."  I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time 
with first.  I know we were, but I have to have it in writing.

Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two. 
Thanks, Margaret
