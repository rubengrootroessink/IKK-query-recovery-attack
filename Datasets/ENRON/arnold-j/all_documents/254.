John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

Brian,

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers 
should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies.

John,

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was 
under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me 
know what you need to resolve the problem.

Thanks,
Brian

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming
