Jeff:
Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.
John
