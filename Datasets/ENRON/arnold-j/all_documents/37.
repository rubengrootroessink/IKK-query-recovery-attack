Heidi:

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Thanks,

Craig

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?
