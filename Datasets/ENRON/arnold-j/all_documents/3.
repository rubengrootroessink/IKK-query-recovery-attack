Jennifer, I'm not so territorial that fire hydrants and trees are on my 
priority list, but I thought that I was doing my job OK on this.  If I read 
Crowder's FWD to Kim in a certain "tone", it appears to me that they feel I 
am overstepping.  I'm sure there is a better way for me to coordinate and 
facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a "tone" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK? 

On a lighter note (I hope), I hope your NY trip went well, and I'll see you 
tomorrow!

Thank you,

Jeff

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know how
many people from Enron will be visiting our headquarters.  I've asked for
the afternoon of December 13th and all day on the 14th.
