Tracy:

FYI:  Yet another important milestone in the relationship between Enron and 
Continental.  Specific opportunities to expand the fuel management 
relationship were explored between Jeff Shankman and Larry Kellner this 
afternoon.  Note the details below.  Also, a tour of the Enron trading floor 
was given to our guests.

Thanks again for your help in initially working with us to establish the 
relationship!
