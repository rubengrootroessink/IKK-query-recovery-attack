Hi John,

Destiny's Child is performing at the LiveStock & Rodeo Show on Sunday, Feb. 
18.  I have two little nieces who are huge fans.  I would love to take them 
to the show.

I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great 
seats( 4 to 8)(indivdual or in a suite) I'm more than willing to pay for the 
tickets.  

I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket!

Liz
