I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.
