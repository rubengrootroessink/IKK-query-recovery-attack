Subject: New role

As a recent transfer into the analyst program, I have moved to a new group: 
EnronCredit.com, based
in London but I will be working here.   I will be working mainly with credit 
derivative traders.

I am at the same phone number, 3-3528, and completely enjoyed my role working 
with you
in the Nymex checkout function for the past 1 1/2 years.

Joe Hunter will be taking my place while a replacement is found.

Best wishes to each of you at Enron.

David
