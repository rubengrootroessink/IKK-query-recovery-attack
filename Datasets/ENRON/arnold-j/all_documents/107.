Sarah-Joy...
I just picked up your voice mail...

I am forwarding Byron Gaddis's e-mail in response to your question of who
PCC is working with at EES.

Let me stress that I am not working with anyone other than John (and now
hopefully you) at Enron to get PCC Ball Valves approved for international
use at Enron.

I am providing Byron Gaddis' e-mail address as he is in Portland at Corp HQ=
,
and is familiar with the issue. He may be able to provide a name for you at
EES that PCC is working to conclude an agreement on energy....note that the
activity is covered under a Conf Agreement to protect PCC and its data. In
addition, Byron was curious about your possible need for blades and the
mechanism you go through to acquire them.

As for me... we would like you to fall in love with our world class ball
valves from PCC Ball Valves (hence putting them on the approved supplier
list) AND also love our Emergency Shutdown Systems for pipelines by our
Barber Industries (again, feeling so smitten that they find their way onto
your approved list)... John has the information packages on both companies
and product lines...

For me... signing off from Milan Italy...where I have been living and
breathing these ball valves this week. Shipments of 40" and 48" units going
to Transgaz on a Romanian/ Russian pipeline as well as 36" units for a
Turkish pipeline are going out....

Pete

Sarah-Joy....

The only person I have been working on in Enron about Ball Valves is John
Will.

For Enron to come to PCC Ball Valves outside Milan Italy for a quality audi=
t
(as proposed by John), the correct people to contact are:

Roberto Bartolena - Managing Director  Phone number 39-02-9379-9127 e-mail
robart@pccbv.it

Aldo Bargeri - Sales Mgr Phone number  same as above...  e-mail
abargeri@pccbv.it

I look forward to PCC BV becoming an approved supplier for your
international work....

Pete

I work with John Will in Enron Corporation, Global Strategic Sourcing.  He
asked me to follow up with you regarding WHO you have been working with in
EES on the PCC Ball Valves deal.  Thanks for letting me know!

John....

Since we last met, a  letter of Intent has been signed by PCC with EES
(Enron Energy  Services)....

I have heard that  our=01;Byron Gaddis was trying to reach you=01; about an=
y
ideas you might  have for large structural parts (remember out titanium
casting capability for  jet engine turbine blades as well as generator
turbine  blades)....

In any case... we  definitely want to make sure PCC Ball Valves is your
INTERNATIONAL (non-USA)  Project ball valve supplier for gas pipelines...
How are we doing to  get that distinction?

Pete
