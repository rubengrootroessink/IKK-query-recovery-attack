Ben:
Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities 
as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, 
supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are 
trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30.  
They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did 
this last year as well.   Please advise,
John
