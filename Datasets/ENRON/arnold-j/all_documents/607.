i think thats rite -think curve flattens somewhat.back end the overvalued
part for now. i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage. funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.
  think vol comes in again too.i think it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.
   agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.
  when are you in town next?

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.
