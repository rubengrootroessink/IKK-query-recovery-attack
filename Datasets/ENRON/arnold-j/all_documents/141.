In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer.  some examples are  strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical  analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
  weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just     subscribe to  a weather 
service
  storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
  production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad     commission 
reports)
  end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage.  
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

John, 
Thanks a million for your input.
I was wondering if you could outline some good responses to these questions.

With your interpretation of a good response, or points to consider, this will 
be a great resource for other interviewers.

Thanks again,

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.
