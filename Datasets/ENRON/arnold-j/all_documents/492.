Russell:
My risk group frequently uses the New Counterparty label for internal 
counterparties that do not have a trading book.  This transaction was a hedge 
for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.  I'm not sure 
who the internal group is that did the transaction.  Dutch Quigley should be 
able to help.
John.

John

A trade came across our morning report listed as a 'New Counterparty'.  It 
was about 17BCF Swap from Sep "00  - Aug '07.  Can you give me some details 
on the counterparty.

Thank you,

Russell
