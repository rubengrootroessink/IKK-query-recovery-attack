Douglas,

A HUGE THANK YOU from me to you!  This is exactly what I was hoping for (even 
if the amount of purchase is not what some folks might have been wishing for, 
the reply is critically important)!  I really appreciate your having taken 
the time to help out by providing this information.  

I will check back with you on Thursday, if I haven't heard from you by then, 
to see about the "commitment letter"!

Thank you again,

Jeff
p.s.  I will be forwarding your note to Randy Matson and Bob Martinez, to see 
if it would help them in their efforts.  I'll also copy you on that one.

Jeff,

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified 
spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing.  Basically, 
we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol 
(monitoring).

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce, 
Corp, and London) are trying to make a joint decision, but the other two 
groups are dragging out their evaluations...



Regards,
Douglas
