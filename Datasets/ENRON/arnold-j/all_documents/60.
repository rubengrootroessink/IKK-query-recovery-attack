Hi Tracy,

On Wednesday of this week we had a visit from Jennifer and Peter, and we 
highlighted a number of problem areas that we are experiencing with Amex 
Travel Management.  They suggested we inform you of the problems, in the hope 
that you would be able to take it to a higher level on our behalf.

Up until a year ago American Express were based on the Wilton Site.  They 
migrated to Newcastle (about 50 miles away)  and  migrated again some six 
months later to Edinburgh ( about 120 miles away).  Each time they have moved 
the level of service we have received has deteriorated.

Some six weeks ago we had a meeting with Lisa McKenzie (Area Manager) from 
the Edinburgh office, at which we detailed our concerns to her.  She said 
that she valued our business and promised to take these concerns away and to 
rectify all problems.  In reality nothing improved, to the extent that we had 
another meeting with George Blues (Account manager)  last week, and informed 
him that we had not seen any changes for the better.  We also told him that 
if things did not improve within the next six weeks, we would consider taking 
our business elsewhere.  We have actually made contact with a local company 
and are using them in conjunction with Amex for the next six weeks.

Typical problems are:-

Communications - trying to contact people in Edinburgh is difficult.  
Response when we do contact them is not forthcoming.  Not being able to speak 
to the same person twice.  Promises of return calls do not materialise.

Invoices - difficulty in resolving disputes.

Car Hire - not negotiating the best deal with regards to rates.  We 
negotiated better rates with Avis ourselves.

Hotel Bookings - not using Enrons preferential rates on hotels with reserved 
rooms.

Rail Travel - lack of detail on tickets.

We feel that they are paying lip service to what we are saying and making 
general excuses in the non performance of their obligations.

We hope you can assist us in getting a better level of service than that 
which we are currently receiving.  

Regards

Lesley
