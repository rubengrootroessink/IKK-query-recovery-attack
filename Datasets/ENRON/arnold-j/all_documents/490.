Subject: Give Up Agreements:  Banc One

I have received the executed counterparts of the Give Up Agreements from Banc 
One for our signature contemplating several executing brokers.  It is my 
understanding that trades were recently pulled from Banc One and therefore, 
these agreements may not now be warranted.   John, please advise me regarding 
whether you will want to sign these agreements with Banc One or not.  Thank 
you.  Mary Cook  ENA Legal
