Jennifer,
I gave Mike Horning a call I received his e-mail.   He is following up with 
Cox directly to find out what is happening on the broadband side 
(negotiations with Blockbuster).  

I reviewed Universal's request for a sponsorship (of JPI).  He was also 
asking dollar amounts for the sponsorship.  It looks like Mike is going to 
probe Daphne Harvey (Universal) for the technical knowledge he needs in order 
to make the best pitch to Universal.  It looks like he will also feel out the 
organizational structure to see if his contacts are the right ones.

Colleen, 

As part of my strategy, I want to glean information.    Hopefully it will 
give me an understanding of their process and goals, so that I may be more 
effective in my discussions with their media group.

Following are a few questions I will ask Daphne (I don't expect Daphne to 
have all the answers):

1) Help me understand how Universal wants to save money on advertising?
2) Who at Universal is driving that process?  (Names, Titles, etc.)
3) What are the saving targets? (% or $ amount)
4) Where do they want to save in regards to advertising? (Spot TV, Network 
TV, Cable, Radio, NP, etc.)
5) What is their annual advertising budget?  (Per film? Metric? Per media, 
etc.)
6) How much does she understand about media buying? (GRP's, CPM's, Demos, 
Dayparts, Reach & Frequency, etc.)
7) What is her role in this process?
 
I'm sure I will have a few more questions, as we speak with each other.

Regards,

Michael P. Horning
