Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I 
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

Here's the latest communication to Bruce Smith regarding Control-SA and
Control-M Windows 2000 certification, as well as reporting on the testing.
It's in the document, but to point it out, Control-SA is ready for
certification process on Dec of 2000 and Control-M on March 2001.

> Hi Bruce,
>
> I have attached a document detailing the status of Microsoft
> Certification.  We have also summarized our Windows 2000 development and
> certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach.  The
> most critical phase, which ensures Win2K compatibility and support and
> includes customer testing, has been completed.  The Win2K Agents are GA
> for both Control-M (scheduling) and Control-SA (security).
>
> The next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,
> is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for
> Microsoft Win2K.  This phase follows the Win2K initial release as MS
> Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the
> application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the Control-M
> environment.
>
> Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of
> the application.  It is my understanding that one of the reasons Control-M
> is being considered as a replacement for sys*Admiral is due to the
> problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release.
>
> Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMC's Win2K
> Development Plans.  Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with
> an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more
> detail?
>
> One final note.  I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves,
> reconfirming that Control-M continues to run smoothly since we made the
> database changes.
>
>  Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week.  It seems as we have
