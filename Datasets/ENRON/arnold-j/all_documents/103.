Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

Regards,

Michael P. Horning
