John,

I just wanted to update you on some of the things that you wanted me to do:

1. I have ordered your computer and accessories for home use.  Once it comes 
in Jay Webb and Don Adams of IT and EOL will make sure that everything you 
need will be programmed on your computer.

2. I I have ordered your t.v for the office

3. I am working with telerate department on how you will be able to access it 
from your home.

4. Polycom is installed in your office

5. I am still investigating different cellular phone companies


I will get back to when everything is completed.
 
And one question, do you all ready have DSL or any king of internet service 
at home?  


Ina
