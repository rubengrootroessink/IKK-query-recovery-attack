Good afternoon! I hope everyone had an excellent holiday.  Now, it is
time to prepare for the next. Oh, boy, I am glad that stairmaster is
still working!

As follow-up to our 11-11-00 conference call, Clint Beard provided an
update to Ms. Hunter via telephone today.  The update referenced the
lawsuit avoidance between FedEx and a division of Enron.  Per Ms.
Hunter, she feels satisfied with what information FedEx provided.  A
follow-up conference call is scheduled for December 11, 2000 at 10 a.m.
Complete agenda, attendees and phone number will be announced at a later
date.
