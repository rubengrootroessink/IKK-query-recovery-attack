Hey freak-o!  How have you been?  I'm just taking a study break (finals,
ick!) and thought I would say hello.  What's new?  Have you moved into
your place yet?  Let me know if I can come and see it--I'll be home (in
college station) a week from Tuesday...am making a pit stop in Tahoe on
my way home...just gotta get thru these pesky exams first!

Greetings from la-la-land,
eleanor :-)
