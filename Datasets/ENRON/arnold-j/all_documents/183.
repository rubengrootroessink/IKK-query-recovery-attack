Jim: 
Your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.  I've certainly had some 
troubles this quarter.  I do appreciate your offer but I don't want to take 
away from the amazing year you've had so far.  Maybe you should come trade 
this...
John

Subject: For What It's Worth.

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really 
great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their 
control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could 
have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never 
have done what I've done. 

 Thanks,  
 Jim Schwieger
