your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our
customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell
blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant
see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right
now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at
this level though.
