Dave:
We spend a tremendous amount of resources and money collecting information.  
Further, the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market.   We have 
little interest in distributing this info outside of the building.  I hope 
you understand.   Good luck to your brother.

Subject: options information

I run the structuring group at Azurix, but I am emailing you in reference to 
my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City.  Since 
graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New 
York as a local for the last 8 years.  He trades natural gas options and is 
looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can 
discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring.  If this 
would be of interest or not let me know and I will hook you two up.  Thanks 
for your time.
