don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze 
like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash 
such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it 
might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really 
want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though.   
Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as 
california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find

he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.
so many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it
breaks that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a
sheet with entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of
people would be unemployed.
