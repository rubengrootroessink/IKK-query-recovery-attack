Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week.  It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO.  I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed.  One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies.  I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send.  At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up.  I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

        Happy Holidays,
        
        Roy Hartstein
        Director, Sourcing Portfolio Leader
