Take a look also at some of the hot new releases in Winery Direct. These
limited-production wines come straight from the boutique California wineries
that make them. In this auction we feature Hengehold Family Vineyards Merlot
1999, a new release and a great buy at $25 a bottle. Also offered is Paul
Hobbs Richard Dinner Vineyard Agustina Chardonnay 1997 in
never-before-released 3- and 5-liter bottles. Robert M. Parker Jr. rated
this wine at 92 points and called it "a blockbuster Chardonnay." We also
have Spottswoode Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
Cabernet Sauvignon 1997.

Finally, taste California winemaking history in our Beaulieu Vineyard
Georges de Latour Private Reserve verticals. Admired for more than 50 years
for its grand Cabernet Sauvignons, BV Georges de Latour was one of the first
vineyards in California to make truly great wines. We offer the full range
of Private Reserve vintages from 1958 to 1997. As an example of the life of
this producer's wine, James Laube awarded 98 points to the 1958 vintage and
noted several years ago that "wine doesn't get much better."
