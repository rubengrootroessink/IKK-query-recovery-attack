John,

You suggested that I contact you today to see if you would have an interest
in talking about our retained client's interest in you.  Are you ready?

Adrian

John,

I am the executive recruiter you spoke with today about a new job
opportunity.  Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached
my contact information.  If by Monday you find yourself in a position where
you would be interested in discussing our retained client's interest in you,
please let me know when you are available to talk.  If you have a prepared
resume, please send that to me as well.  Be assured that our discussions
will be completely confidential.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies in North America
enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.

In the meantime, most of our candidates (as you were), come referred to us
by people we have worked with in the past.  If you know any good people in
front, mid or back office positions who may be interested in new job
opportunities, let me know or feel free to pass along my name.  Any
referrals that result in placements will not be forgotten.  Thanks again.
