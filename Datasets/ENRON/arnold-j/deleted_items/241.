GREAT 1997 CABERNET VALUE
RH PHILLIPS Toasted Head CABERNET SAUVIGNON/SYRAH, CALIFORNIA, 1997
12x750ml     $13.99 per bottle (cash)     $154.91 per case (Cash)
A blend of 55% Mendocino County Cabernet Sauvignon with 45% Dunnigan
Hills (Yolo County) Syrah this is a juicy, ripe, well-focused,
flavorful Cabernet-blend that exemplifies the excellent 1997 vintage.
Alive with flavor, it offeres black cherry, blackberry, and black
raspberry fruit along with notes cedar, black pepper, tobacco, and
leather. It has a great medium-weight feel and a supple texture.
It is alive, vibrant, and elegant in the mouth. Not complex but
super delicious. I almost don't want to give it the score it
deserves because I'm afraid no one will believe me; it tastes like
it cost much more and comes from a much fancier appellation.
Excellent. SPEC's Score: 92+ points. (Due to the fact that only
22 cases of this 1997 are available, this item will be sold at
SPEC's 2410 Smith Street Warehouse Store only.)
