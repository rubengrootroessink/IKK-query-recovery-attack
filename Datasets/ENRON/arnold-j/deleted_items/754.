Good afternoon wine lovers,
Over the past three weeks, I  have been monitoring the feedback from those of you who have purchased the  weekly sampler cases.  And it appears that we have found some  winners.  While all the wines have been well-received, the ones below have  gained a serious following in just three short weeks.  To  give the rest of you a chance to see what all the buzz is about, and to help the  regulars re-stock their wine racks after the Thanksgiving feast, I have put  together our most recent sampler.  As always, it comes with a special  price, too.

THE BEST FROM RECENT SAMPLER CASES,  TOGETHER AT LAST (2 BTLS EACH):  

Finca Flichman Cabernet Mendoza Argentina 1999 (full bodied, concentrated  fruit) 87 points  
Finca Flichman Malbec Mendoza Argentina 1998 (intense color, maximum Malbec  expression) 87 points  
Vina Sardasol Cabernet Crianza 1995 (how did they get so much flavor at this  price?!) 88 points  
L'Enclave des Papes Cabernet 2000 (surprising depth, mature fruit  components) 87 points  
Chateau LaCroix Martelle Minervois 1999 (you may remember this, my house  red, serious Syrah) 89 points  
Domaine Capouilleres Ventoux 1998 (so full of blue fruits, loves the spicy  stuff) 87 points  
Let me tell you, this case is already a bargain at $155!!!
LOAD UP, THIS WEEK ONLY (IF THEY LAST THAT LONG) FOR JUST $132  PLUS TAX!!!
Now most of you know that these cases disappear  before the week's end.  So pick up the phone and call us now with your card  number and we will be happy to set as many of these aside as you would  like.  Don't miss out!  This is one heck of a great buy!!!
