Welcome to winebid.com's newest auction, which includes a special
auction of outstanding California Cabernet Sauvignons. Both auctions
begin closing Sunday Oct. 21 at 9 p.m. US Eastern Time.

Cabernet Sauvignon is king in California, and for this special event we have
assembled an extraordinary and deep collection of classic and cult Cabs.
Look for terrific values in this auction. With the holidays right around the
corner now is a great time to restock your cellar with everyone's favorite
elite cabs, including these: Abreu 1994, $250; Beringer Private Reserve
1997, a 6-bottle case, $425; Bryant Family 1997, (100 points from Robert M.
Parker Jr.), $530; Harlan Estate 1997, (another 100 pointer from Parker),
$460; Dalla Valle 1994, $85; Dominus Napanook 1992, $70; Dunn Howell
Mountain 1997, $75; Quintessa 1995, $50; Silver Oak Alexander 1997, $60; and
Spottswoode 1992, $45.

If you'd rather serve Bordeaux for the holidays, we have full cases of 1998
Bordeaux, all of which were recently released and imported directly from
Bordeaux. All earned at least 90 points from Robert M. Parker Jr. and Wine
Spectator. We offer full cases of Ausone, Ducru-Beaucaillou, and
Leoville-Las-Cases.

Other treats include seductive Italians that win rave reviews from the
critics. Here we offer Guado Al Tasso (P. Antinori) 1997. Wine Spectator
rated it at 96 points and placed it No. 12 of the 100 top wines of 2000. How
about Ornellaia (L. Antinori) 1997, Spectator?s No. 9 wine for 2000? And
listen to Wine Spectator rave about Tignanello (P. Antinori) 1997: "A
fabulous Tuscan red, young and racy."
