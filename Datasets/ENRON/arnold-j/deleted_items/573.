Dear U.S. Soccer Family,

As another year comes to a close, we wanted to thank each and every one of you for your support. The last 12 months have been extremely successful for both our senior National Teams and our Youth National Teams and 2002 promises to be exciting on all fronts.

The U.S. Men's National Team qualified for our fourth straight World Cup, setting the stage for an exciting 2002 tournament, while the U.S. Women took their first steps toward the 2003 Women's World Cup by building on the successful launch of the WUSA this past summer. In the year ahead, our men will be focused on the Korea/Japan World Cup, where we will square off against Portugal, South Korea and Poland in June. We are confident that with your support and the right preparation, we will have a successful tournament. For the U.S. Women, our goals are no less tangible, with preparation for the 2003 Women's World Cup qualifying becoming the focus of our activities.

For our youth national teams, we saw our U-17 and U-20 Men's teams qualify for FIFA's bi-annual World Youth Championships in those age brackets. In 2002, our Under-19 Women's National Team will have the opportunity to compete in the first ever FIFA Women's World Youth Championship, with qualifying scheduled for May in Trinidad & Tobago and the actual tournament set for Canada in August. This is real progress for the development of the women's game and we expect our team to successfully qualify and then compete for the title of this first-ever event.

In all of the world championships, we have the opportunity to measure ourselves against the best teams in the world, and that helps to motivate our athletes. But it is the support we receive from our U.S. Soccer family and fans that inspires our players. Again, thank you for your support throughout the year and into the future. We look forward to a successful 2002.

Sincerely,

Bruce Arena                               April Heinrichs
Head Coach & Technical Director           Head Coach & Technical Director
