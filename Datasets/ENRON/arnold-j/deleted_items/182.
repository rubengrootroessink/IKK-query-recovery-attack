today?   I have felt better.  I'm really glad that Teresa's birthday is over.  I think that we have been celebrating since Friday but of course you know that.  I apologize for any strange behavior last night that I might have exhitbited.  (ie...having you make food for me at a very late hour, singing and whatever else)   Just wanted to check on you and make sure that you aren't sleeping at your desk.  Afterall, you only have to say "buy" or "sell" all day.  How difficult could that be?
