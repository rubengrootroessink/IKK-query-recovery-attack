"The 1999 Laurus, an intriguing, explosively scented and flavored blend of equal parts Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in new oak, is a Tuscan fruit bomb.  It possesses a deep purple color, dazzling levels of plum, black cherry, and currant fruit, and a voluptous, opulent, thick, rich personality.  Drink it during its first 6-7 years to take advantage of its exuberance and lavishly fruited qualities."Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!

5. #11466 - Morgante 1999 Don Antonio - $28.99 (Only $23.19 when you buy a case)  
92 Points - Robert Parker
"The finest wine I have ever tasted from the Nero d'Avola grape is Morgante's 1999 Don Antonio, a cuvee of 100% Nero d'Avola aged in 100% new French oak, and bottled without filtration.  Maloactic fermentation was also done in barrel.  This exquisite effort boasts and opaque purple/blue color as well as an extraordinary bouquet of creamy new oak intertwined with blackberry liqueur, flowers, and cassis.  This ripe, full-bodied beauty possesses great intensity, explosive richness, and a finish that lasts for over 35 seconds.  This is a revolutionary example from a varietal indigneous to Sicily.  Moreover, it should drink well for a decade or more.  Wow!"Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!
