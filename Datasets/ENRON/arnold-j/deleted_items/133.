Dear John Arnold,

We recognize that many investors are concerned about their investments
especially in light of recent market fluctuations. As a FOLIOfn
customer, you probably realize that diversification is an important
strategy to minimize your risk over time. And, by keeping your fees,
expenses and taxes under control, you can improve your overall returns.

Because we value you as a customer, we want to help you even more during
the current market conditions. That's why we are offering you a new
pricing plan that actually takes the ups and downs of the market into
account.

It's simple:

- With our new "No Gain? No Pay!" monthly pricing plan, for each month
the S&P 500 market index falls, we will waive your next monthly fee!

That's right - all of our tools, research and premium services,
including your window trades*- FREE!

You can sign up for this new service for a flat-fee of just $39.95 a
month - only $10 more than our basic monthly fee.

With our new "No Gain? No Pay!" pricing plan, you can rest assured that
if the market goes down, you'll get your next month free. This is just
another way we are trying to offer you a little more control and peace
of mind during the current market fluctuations.

Sincerely,

Steve Wallman
