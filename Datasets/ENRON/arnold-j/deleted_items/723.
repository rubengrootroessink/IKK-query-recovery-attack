Hi Lenny,

Don't know if you are involved in this area or not. I think maybe. Anyway, we have a refined lead contract with Hammond. The local buyer for Pottstown, PA is interested in getting information about natural gas for possible future use from ENRON. If you could contact him or direct him to the person that is in a position to help it would be appreciated.  His name is, Joe Stewartz E-MAIL address is jstewartz@hmndgroup.com
telephone number (610) 327-1400 Fax number (610) 327-1255

Thanking you in advance and hope all is well with you.

Regards,
Ron Brown
