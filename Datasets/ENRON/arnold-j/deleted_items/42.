Team
We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to "Exceed the Mark & Expectations."

Quote for this week: "One should always bloom, where one is planted."

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

Cheers
Kirk
