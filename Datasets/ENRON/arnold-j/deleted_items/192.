Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now??  And are you
calling me wacky??  =)

Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with
Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill.  I got a
random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund
here in Boston.  She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a
hold of me to help her start her hedge fund.  She finally got my number from
someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not
sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a
great opportunity it would be to work with her and her "team."

The only person on her "team" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said
that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and
he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently
sold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed
a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said
that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund.
Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot,
I was wondering if it was true.  I would never leave this opportunity, even
if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break
into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.

Does it sound like the same guy?
