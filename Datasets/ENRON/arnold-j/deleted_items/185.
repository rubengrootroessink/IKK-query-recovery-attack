Gad:
Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred
you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was
planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.
I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in
addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an
offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate
recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via
phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good
opportunities here.

   Subject:  Potential employment opportunities with Enron

   Dear Mr. Arnold:

   I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
   Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring
   potential
   employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested
   in
   derivatives trading.

   I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
   professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
   institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
   starting my MBA.

   I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
   colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or
   NYC
   areas in the next few months.

   Thank you for your time and consideration.

   Sincerely,

   Gad Caspy
