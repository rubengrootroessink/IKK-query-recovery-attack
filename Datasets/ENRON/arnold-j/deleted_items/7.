Good afternoon wine lovers,
Before we get to the schedule  of tastings this week, I wanted to thank everyone out there for the great  response to the latest issue of The Houston Press.  Christopher's Wine Warehouse was named the "BEST WINE  STORE" on page 97 of the September 20-26, 2001 issue.  We are  thankful to all our loyal friends and neighbors for this recognition of our hard  work and dedication to bringing the best wines we can find to Houston's wine  lovers.  Thanks again for your continued support.  We will continue to  work hard with our unique selection to, hopefully, be honored again next  year.
As for the schedule this week, I believe we have perfected our  website so that everyone can now view our tastings.  We have two versions  of the site, one in very easy to navigate form, and one that sings and dances if  you have the necessary plug ins.  If you don't want to re configure your  system, just click on the normal site when you visit us at:www.christopherswine.com .
EVERY day this week,  starting tomorrow (Tuesday the 25th), we will be hosting our wine  tastings.  The topics, prices per person, etc, etc, are posted at our site  and include the weekly schedules through October.  REMEMBER: YOU MUST CALL US TO RESERVE AT  713-524-9144.  We look forward to seeing all of you.   
As for this week's sampler case, I decided (based on popular demand) to  extend the fabulous case from last week.  If you missed the details, here  it is again:

Domaine de Fenouillet Beaumes de Venise CDR Villages 1999 (glad my house red  is back!) $21.50 each

As always, please call us to order at 713-524-9144.   This case is one of my best ever, don't miss out!!!
AS FOR SATURDAY, THE 29TH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO  CELEBRATE OUR REVIEW IN THE HOUSTON PRESS!!!
So, from 2-5 PM,  this Saturday, at no charge, come on down and have some fun with us as we host  an amazing tasting of GREAT wines.  I will be showcasing a dozen different  wines and we will pop a few bottles of Champagne to celebrate.  Get here  early for best selection and bring some friends, too.  This Saturday will  be a blast!!!
That's about it for this week.  See y'all  soon.
Your friend in wine,
Christopher
