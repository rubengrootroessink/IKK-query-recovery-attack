Welcome to winebid.com's newest auction, which includes a special auction of
rare wines from Turley Wine Cellars. Both auctions begin closing Sunday,
Nov. 4, at 9 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time.

Turley Wine Cellars makes some of California's most admired wines and we are
pleased to offer new releases and library wines from 1994 - 1998, including
never-before-released magnums. We have Petite Syrah, Zinfandel and 1998
Alban Vineyard Roussanne, a new release made of 100 percent Alban Vineyard
fruit.

If a king-sized bottle of wine fit for a king is what you're looking for,
find the Imperial of Petrus 1982 offered here. It's part of a stunning
collection of wines from California, France and Australia, most of which
earned at least 95 points from critics. Included are many vintages of Petrus
from 1971-1997, including Petrus 1990, a Parker perfect 100-point wine.
Other Parker 100s offered are Lafite- Rothschild 1982 and Bryant Family
Vineyard Cab 1997.

Tuscans are hot. Find them here from the extraordinary 1997 vintage, along
with stars from the Piedmont. This collection of top-ranked Italian 1997
vino rosso includes magnums and doubles of such hedonistic reds as Solaia
(P. Antinori), which Wine Spectator rated 98 points and named the #1 of the
Top 100 wines of 2000.

Petrus. Lynch-Bages. Figeac. Talbot. Haut-Bailly. Palmer. We offer these
Bordeaux from the 1982 vintage, which makes them outstanding wines from an
outstanding vintage. Robert M. Parker Jr. awarded the Petrus 98 points, and
called it "a colossal wine." And about the Talbot, Parker wrote that he
couldn't recall "a more satisfying or complex Talbot than the 1982."
