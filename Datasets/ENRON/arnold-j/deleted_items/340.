5.  #14175 Behrens & Hitchcock 1999 Oakville "Fortuna" Merlot $65.99 (Only $52.79 when you buy a case)  
90-92 Points  Robert Parker 
"(500 cases of 100% Merlot) is a dense, very chewy merlot with oodles of smoky blackberry and cherry fruit. The wine is unctuously-textured, with plenty of glycerin, and a heady, concentrated finish. It will be delicious when released, and age well for at least 10-12 years." Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!

The day after the "Super Tasting" people were calling like crazy for a few wines, however none more then this spectacular wine form Washington State.

"The sea breeze and lemon scented Chablis Cote de Lechet is a fat, ripe, medium to full bodied wine with richly strewn layers of pears, stones, and flint-like flavors.
