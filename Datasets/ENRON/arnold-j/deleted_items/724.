Can you get Enron online on Matthew's laptop?  You could bring it.  Or Bob
will be out of town and you could go over there and trade all you want.  Of
course I would tell him.  Just let me know.  I heard from Uncle Elmer, he
said he has not forgotten about the computer and when he gets back from
Thanksgiving he will somewhere find a box in which to ship it.  Thank you
for your offer to buy me one, but just save your money for now.  I got
tickets for the ballet!  Do you know if you are flying or driving Wed?  See
you soon.  Love you, your Mom
