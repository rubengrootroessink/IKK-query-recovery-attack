Rev up your engines and prepare for an evening built for speed...

The RaceCarClub and QUIERO PISCO invite you to the third annual RaceCarClub
party co-hosted for the first time with the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix,
Friday, October 5, 2001, from 8:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. at the historic Rice
Lofts.

Celebrate Houston's 2001 Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix with the velocity for
which the RaceCarClub is known, as QUIERO PISCO and a revved up roster of
Houston's own social racing hosts steer the RaceCarClub fun at the Rice that
evening.

The Empire Room will feature Houston's own and 2001 Houston Press Best New
Artist nominee Arthur Yoria (www.arthuryoria.com), along with the El Orbits
on the balcony and a plethora of some of downtown's hottest DJ's in the
Crystal Ballroom and five open bars with free flowing bottomless cocktails
featuring Houston hottest new Latin import, QUIERO PISCO.

Fashionable attire is a requisite, along with your all-inclusive entrance
fee ($35 pre-sale on-line or Market Price as available at the door).  To
help those effected by the bearish economy, this year we are offering a
reduced price of $25 for the first 500 tickets sold - so act fast and save a
few bucks.

A portion of the evening's proceeds will be donated to the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.

To make your evening and pocket stretch a little further, this year your
RaceCarClub pass waives the cover charge at the following downtown bars the
evening of the event:

        *  Club 511             *  Grasshopper  *  Prague
        *  410 Shot Bar         *  Mercury Room *  Spy

To buy your tickets or for more information, please visit our web site at
www.racecarclub.net. If you have any questions and/or comments please feel
free to contact Martin Productions, Inc. at info@martinproductions.com or
713-223-9500. Please forward this email along to others that might enjoy the
evening.

RaceCarClub is brought to you by QUIERO PISCO, Houston's newest spirit
imported from Latin America for your partying pleasure.
