Dear customers and friends,

We had intended to send a newsletter out weeks ago but the tragedy that
happened in the eastern United States set us back just like all of
America. We have so many customers in NY and the East Coast including
many who worked at the World Trade Center. Our sincerest regret and
hope go out to all people in this country and the world but especially
those who have family or friends who were victims of the terrorist acts.

One of our dearest employees Ed Campbell grew up in Queens and all of us
at Libation have a strong connection with the people of NYC. As I told
Ed the other day, all Americans are New Yorkers now. We have wanted to
call many of you but feel that this is not the time. If you live in NYC
(or anywhere else) please take the time to drop us a line and let us
know how you are faring. Best wishes to you all.

Now to the wines. It's that time of the year when some of California's
perennial favorites are released. Feel free to give us a call toll free
at 877-LIBATION (877 542-2846).
