As you know, we submitted our bid this past Wednesday.  Lehman did call Marshall late yesterday, and we answered their questions.  They said they were going to get together with Cuba all day Monday, and will make their decision late Monday, and notify the company on Tuesday.  Apparently Lehman's view is that prices are going to $1.50, and then mentioned several times that they would want to hurry up and close, before prices fall further.

They have also called again this am to ask more questions.
