Hi John,

Just started over here at RWE Trading Americas, Inc last Friday.  Not
sure whether or not you've heard of them before but they are the largest
utility in Germany with natural gas, crude and products, power and coal
trading in Europe.  They own 80 % of Consol, which is the largest coal
producer in the world, and 100% of Nukem, which has or is supplying
uranium to all the US nuclear power plants.  They also have
approximately 130 mmcfd of Appalachian gas which, unfortunately, is
under contract with AEP as of this moment.  Additionally, they've
budgeted to make a significant acquisition in the US next year. Overall,
they've got a good story to tell.  Anyway, I just wanted to let you know
the latest and would like to buy you dinner the 16th or 17th of this
month to catch up on things.

Let me know.
