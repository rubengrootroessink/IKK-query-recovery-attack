More than two dozen U.S. states and cities, no longer waiting for the Bush =
administration to seize the initiative against global warming, have begun t=
aking steps to reduce emissions that scientists say are heating the planet.=
=20
From Vermont to Oregon, state and local governments are calling for broader=
 use of energy-saving devices, more energy-efficient building standards, cl=
eaner-burning power plants and more investment in such renewable energy sou=
rces as wind and solar power--all to help reduce greenhouse gases that trap=
 the sun's energy near the Earth's surface.
Many of the strategies being promoted mimic those endorsed in July by 180 n=
ations as part of an international campaign against global warming that the=
 Bush administration declined to join.=20
In August, six New England states and five eastern Canadian provinces signe=
d a pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the agreement, the signa=
tories pledged to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 and by 10% below tha=
t level by 2020. Those cuts are to be followed by even deeper reductions. I=
t is the most ambitious goal set by state governments and it was supported =
by three Republican governors, two Democrats and one Independent from Massa=
chusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.=20
No single state or region can make a substantial reduction in the gases tha=
t contribute to global warming. Moreover, much of the success of state and =
local efforts relies on voluntary compliance from industry.=20
Still, advocates of state and local initiatives are confident that there is=
 enough public support to ensure broad cooperation in the private sector.=
=20
"Public demand for action on climate change increased when the United State=
s was not a part of the [international] agreement. It had a powerful impact=
 on the thinking of all kinds of people, including governors and heads of l=
arge companies," said Tom Peterson, director of domestic policy for the Cen=
ter for Clean Air Policy in Washington.=20
The center was created in 1985 by a bipartisan group of governors to promot=
e economical solutions to air pollution.=20
"This is a way [for states] to distinguish themselves from the Bush adminis=
tration," California Resources Secretary Mary Nichols said. "A lot of pract=
ical, moderate people are recognizing climate change is a reality, not a th=
eory, and they need to take it into account and help move the direction of =
the world by doing something about it."=20
California was an early leader in reducing dependence on fossil fuels that =
release greenhouse gases. Today, 12% of its electrical power comes from ren=
ewable sources, more than any other state.=20
President Bush has sent mixed signals concerning global warming. Shortly af=
ter he took office, he reneged on a campaign promise to cut emissions of ca=
rbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas. He said he rejected the int=
ernational accord, outlined in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and ratified last summ=
er, because it would cost U.S. jobs and did not immediately impose limits o=
n emissions from developing countries, including India and China.=20
Last spring, Bush announced the formation of a task force of Cabinet member=
s to formulate U.S. policy. The work of the task force was slowed by disagr=
eements among its members and by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.=20
In the meantime, several members of Congress, including Sens. James M. Jeff=
ords (I-Vt.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), have=
 begun formulating policy. McCain and Lieberman announced in August that th=
ey would develop legislation to cap greenhouse emissions and reduce them us=
ing a market-based trading mechanism. But that bill, too, has been delayed =
as Congress grapples with the enormous fallout from the attacks on the Worl=
d Trade Center and the Pentagon.=20
Meanwhile, officials of several states say they are making measurable progr=
ess.=20
In New Jersey, officials say they are on track to cut greenhouse gases by 3=
.5% below 1990 levels by 2005. The plan relies on capturing emissions from =
methane--which traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide--from landfills=
, securing voluntary reductions from various industries and preserving open=
 space and trees, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, said=
 Amy Collings, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protec=
tion.=20
New York Gov. George Pataki in June announced a series of measures to impro=
ve energy efficiency and trim greenhouse gases. Specifically, the Republica=
n governor ordered state buildings to get 20% of their electricity from ren=
ewable sources, such as solar or wind power, by 2010.=20
In the Northwest, Seattle City Light, the local electric utility, will offs=
et any carbon dioxide emissions from power generation with wider use of cle=
an-fueled vehicles and other measures.=20
In Oregon, more than 20,000 people have signed up for the "Blue Sky Program=
" by paying an extra $3 per month on their utility bills to ensure that Pac=
ific Power and Light purchases electricity from sources that don't contribu=
te to global warming, said Tim Honadel, sustainability coordinator for Gov.=
 John Kitzhaber.=20
The California Legislature has established a registry to track greenhouse g=
as production. It gives businesses interested in reducing their emissions a=
 place to record their progress. Such progress will be rewarded when the st=
ate, as anticipated, begins to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.=20
There are growing indications that businesses, large and small, do want to =
cooperate, if only to ensure that they have a hand in crafting policies and=
 regulations many see as inevitable.=20
A group of Fortune 500 companies joined with the Philadelphia-based Pew Cha=
ritable Trusts to study and develop market-driven solutions to global warmi=
ng. Among the companies participating in the project are British Petroleum,=
 Boeing Co., Enron, Lockheed Martin Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Internati=
onal Energy Corp.=20
At a carpet mill in Industry, where Interface Inc. employs 500 people, work=
ers are busy producing "climate neutral" carpet for commercial buildings, w=
hich is made without generating greenhouse gases. The company recently inst=
alled a $1-million solar array at its plant so it can make its product with=
out any adverse impact on the Earth's atmosphere, said Jim Hartzfeld, vice =
president of sustainable strategies for the Atlanta-based corporation.=20
"This is about good business," Hartzfeld said. "It's not about philanthropy=
 or altruism. It's about delivering better value."

Many stuck in anti-terror dragnet / Future uncertainfor Houston man, 23, he=
ld and cleared in attacks=20

By DALE LEZON
Staff
Houston Chronicle
On his Web site, Asem Atta was hip and playful, regaling friends with accou=
nts of his social escapades.=20
He had plenty to tell. At 23, Atta had a good job at Enron Corp. and lived =
at one of Houston's trendy midtown addresses. He wrote of sporting events a=
nd fireworks shows. His computer home page featured pictures of himself and=
 his pet and links to Internet sites devoted to the rock bands Jane's Addic=
tion and Red Hot Chili Peppers.=20
He was, he said, living "La Vida Houston."=20
That all changed after Sept. 11, when the Pakistani national was swept up i=
n the government's ever-widening anti-terrorist dragnet.=20
Though federal law-enforcement officials quickly concluded that Atta was no=
t connected to the attacks in New York and near Washington, D.C., he was fo=
und to have an expired visa and apparently was detained by the U.S. Immigra=
tion and Naturalization Service.=20
His co-workers have not seen him since at least Sept. 12, an Enron official=
 said. His friends have not seen him either, and they are worried. His apar=
tment appears vacant. His telephone and the message service at the door to =
his apartment building are disconnected. He did not tell Enron officials he=
 planned to leave.=20
"What on earth is going on?" one of his close friends asked the Chronicle i=
n response to an e-mail message.=20
Atta's plight, similar to that of many Middle Eastern immigrants, has spark=
ed worries among some civil libertarians and congressional leaders. More th=
an 500 people, many of them immigrants held for possible immigration violat=
ions, have been detained so far as possible suspects or material witnesses =
as the government's investigation broadens almost daily.=20
Many were questioned and detained because they had Arabic-sounding names. T=
he Washington Post reported on Sept. 19, for instance, that Atta was sought=
 for questioning because he had the same surname as one of the suspected hi=
jackers, Mohamed Atta.=20
The next day, the FBI said it "has no interest in" Asem Atta, but claimed t=
hat he had overstayed his visa, said FBI spokesman Bob Doguim. An expired v=
isa could lead to deportation. In Atta's case, that could mean being return=
ed to Pakistan, a country that is bracing for possible U.S. attacks on neig=
hboring Afghanistan.=20
Carl Rusnok, an INS spokesman, said he could not comment on individual INS =
cases.=20
Civil rights advocates acknowledge the need to question people to avert pos=
sible terror strikes, but they fear law-enforcement officers may unjustly t=
arget some immigrants simply because they are foreigners.=20
"They're supposed to be looking for terrorists, but unfortunately they are =
picking up a lot of people who haven't done anything wrong or are innocent =
or of Middle Eastern descent," said Bruce Coane, an immigration attorney in=
 Houston and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association=
.=20
Coane said he fears that at least one of his clients, mistakenly hauled in =
during the sweep, had his civil rights violated.=20
He represents a Jordanian legal immigrant who was picked up by the INS on S=
ept. 21. More than a week later, the INS admitted the man had been apprehen=
ded and detained without reason and should be released, Coane said.=20
Coane said he could not identify the man because INS proceedings are not pu=
blic, but said his client had been convicted of two misdemeanors prior to r=
eceiving a green card, a document that allows noncitizens to remain in the =
United States legally.=20
INS can use criminal convictions as grounds for detaining immigrants, somet=
imes indefinitely, or deporting them. But Coane said the INS knew about the=
 misdemeanors before issuing the man a green card.=20
U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, ranking member on the House Subcom=
mittee on Immigration and Claims, said that in the wake of the Sept. 11 att=
acks, the government must give law enforcement powers to protect against po=
ssible terrorist assaults. But it also must safeguard civil liberties for i=
mmigrants, she added.=20
"We want to . . . make sure that people are not brought in unfairly for que=
stioning," she said.=20
Congress is considering measures to broaden anti-terrorist police powers, s=
uch as holding immigrants with possible links to terrorism longer between c=
ourt appearances.=20
Edward Gillett, a Houston immigration attorney, said he does not fault the =
INS for interviewing immigrants to find possible links to the hijackers or =
immigration violations. Had the hijackers' immigration status been reviewed=
 ahead of time, he said, the attacks may have been prevented. Several of th=
e suicide hijackers had immigration violations that were not uncovered unti=
l after the attacks.=20
"I wish they'd done this before it happened and maybe they could have preve=
nted some of it," Gillett said.=20
Efforts to reach Atta or determine his whereabouts last week were unsuccess=
ful.=20
Typically, when a visa is expired, according to the INS, the agency can det=
ain the immigrant but must explain to him within 72 hours why he is being h=
eld and what charges he faces.=20
Soon after that, the immigrant would probably be given a bond hearing to de=
termine if he should be detained while awaiting a hearing on his possible d=
eportation. The INS can hold immigrants indefinitely if they are deemed a f=
light risk or a danger to the community.=20
The deportation hearing may not take place for weeks or months, depending o=
n the immigration judge's work load.=20
To stay in the country legally, Atta, or anyone in his situation, may be ab=
le to obtain a sponsor - a relative or employer who is a U.S. citizen, for =
instance - or could marry a U.S. citizen. He may be able to return to his n=
ative country to apply for another visa. If his visa has been expired for m=
ore than one year and he leaves the country, however, he will be barred fro=
m returning for 10 years.=20
If the visa has expired for 180 days or more, and he leaves the country, he=
 won't be allowed to return for three years.=20
Atta could also apply for political asylum.=20
Sahdi Shalabi, 24, one of Atta's closest friends from high school, said he =
had hoped to see Atta in the next few weeks. But now he is uncertain. He de=
scribed his friend, whom he first met in Kuwait in 1990, as "very playful, =
very easy going." He liked computers and talking to girls.=20
Shalabi said Atta attended an English-style high school in Kuwait and that =
Atta's father worked for the Kuwait Oil Co. Atta moved to the United States=
 after graduating from high school, enrolled at Wichita State University ab=
out 1994 and landed a job at Enron in Houston in 1999.=20
According to his resume, Atta played indoor soccer at college and coached a=
 soccer team for young girls.=20
Shalabi, who works for Nortel Networks in Ontario, Canada, said his friend =
was Muslim but did not practice the religion.=20
"He's totally Westernized," he said.



Enron Close to 5-Yr Contract With Equity Office, Crain's Says
2001-10-07 18:31 (New York)


     Chicago, Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is close to
winning a five-year contract to supply power to Sam Zell's Equity
Office Properties Trust, Crain's Chicago reported, without citing

     Under the agreement, Houston-based Enron would deliver power
to the Chicago-based property company's office buildings in
Chicago, Boston, California and New York, Crain's said.

     Zell's company owns 30 buildings in the Chicago area, 55 in
Boston, six in New York and 309 in California, Crain's said,
citing a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is planning to announce on Monday that it has agreed to sell Portland=
 General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for abo=
ut $1.9 billion in cash and stock, executives close to the deal said yester=
day.=20
The sale is part of Enron's effort to discard lower-margin utility business=
es as it focuses on the more lucrative business of trading electricity and =
gas. The deal would consolidate the two gas and electricity providers in Po=
rtland.
Officials from Enron and Northwest Natural were still considering the detai=
ls of the transaction last night and planned to vote in favor of the deal t=
oday, barring a last-minute delay, the executives said.=20
Enron had reached an agreement to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific f=
or $3.1 billion, but that deal collapsed in late April when Sierra Pacific =
backed out, citing regulatory hurdles.=20
Under the terms of the deal being considered last night, Northwest Natural =
would pay about $1.5 billion in cash, $100 million in common stock and near=
ly $300 million in preferred convertible stock to Enron, the executives sai=
d. Northwest Natural would also assume about $1.1 billion in debt. Enron wo=
uld retain about a 5 percent stake, the executives said. Enron bought Portl=
and General in 1997 for $2.9 billion in stock and debt.=20
Shares of Enron fell $1.37, or 4.1 percent, to $31.73, after Northwest Natu=
ral acknowledged that it was in talks to buy Portland General. Northwest's =
shares fell $2.58, or 9.9 percent, to $23.41.=20
In its effort to sell assets to raise cash, Enron is also in talks to sell =
its 65 percent stake in the Dabhol Power project in India for more than $2.=
1 billion, executives close to the company said. A deal is not yet imminent=
, but Enron has held discussions with India's largest private utility, Tata=
 Power, the executives said.=20
A spokesman for Enron declined to comment.

Northwest Natural Gas Co. is negotiating to buy Portland General Electric f=
rom Houston-based Enron Corp., which has had a for sale sign on the power u=
tility for months. The deal being discussed would be valued between $1.8 bi=
llion and $2 billion, with as much as $1.5 billion in cash and the rest in =
stock, a source familiar with the talks said Friday. In addition, Northwest=
 Natural Gas, based in Portland, Ore., would assume about $1.1 billion in d=
ebt. Also as part of the deal's terms, Enron could end up with a very small=
 stake in Northwest Natural Gas, the person said. The person described the =
talks as highly advanced and said a deal could be announced as soon as Mond=
ay. Northwest Natural Gas, in a brief statement Friday, confirmed it was ta=
lking to Enron. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment. If a dea=
l is announced, it would be the second time Enron struck an agreement to se=
ll Portland General. Nevada- based Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy P=
ortland General in November 1999. It was to pay $2.1 billion, including $2.=
02 billion in cash. It also was to assume about $1 billion in debt and pref=
erred stock. The deal was officially called off in April, although it had b=
een considered dead for months before. Sierra Pacific planned to sell some =
of its Nevada assets to raise cash for the deal, but Nevada's move to elect=
ricity deregulation was delayed, and Sierra couldn't carry out the sales. E=
nergy trader Enron, which as part of a general strategy is shedding certain=
 assets, kept looking for a buyer. "Enron needed some positive news, so thi=
s should help the stock performance," Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudenti=
al Securities in Houston. In a research note Friday, Robert Christensen, an=
 analyst with First Albany Corp. in New York, said benefits to Enron from a=
 sale include "removal of a low single-digit earnings grower" and balance s=
heet improvement. Shares in Enron closed regular trading Friday at $31.73, =
down $1.37. Northwest Natural Gas provides natural gas to more than 500,000=
 residential and business customers throughout Oregon and Vancouver, Wash.,=
 while Portland General has more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon.

Northwest Natural Gas said yesterday it was in talks to buy the Portland Ge=

omment.=20
Houston-based Enron is also trying to dispose of $4.5bn-$5bn in other asset=

NW Natural Gas in talks for Portland General
By Claire Poole in Houston

10/06/2001
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

Portland, Ore.-based utility, Northwest Natural Gas, confirms it is in talk=
s to acquire Portland General Electric from energy trading giant Enron Corp=
.=20
Portland, Ore.-based utility Northwest Natural Gas Co. confirmed Oct. 5 it =
is in talks to acquire Portland General Electric Co. from Houston energy tr=
ading and marketing giant Enron Corp.
In a terse statement, Northwest Natural Gas revealed no details of the nego=
tiations, but warned that a deal was no certainty.=20
"There can be no assurances that any transaction will result from these dis=
cussions," it said. "NW Natural does not intend to make any additional comm=
ents regarding this matter unless and until a formal agreement has been rea=
ched."=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne would not confirm whether the company was tal=
king with Northwest Natural Gas or anyone else about Portland General.=20
"It's our standard corporate policy not to comment on potential acquisition=
s or divestitures," she said.=20
Enron has been trying to shed the utility since April, when its $3.1 billio=
n sale to Reno, Nev., utility Sierra Pacific Resources Corp. fell through i=
n the wake of California's power crisis.=20
In March, Nevada regulators, nervous about power supply problems in neighbo=
ring California, backtracked from a plan to open their state to competition=
, which scuttled Sierra Pacific's plan to sell seven power plants for $1.7 =
billion to help pay for Portland General.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Oregon regulators had already =
approved the sale, which only required U.S. Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion clearance.=20
Talk about another buyer reached a high pitch Sept. 5, when Chairman Kennet=
h Lay said Enron was close to a sale.=20
Several companies have reportedly kicked the tires, including Scottish Powe=
r plc, which already owns another Oregon-based utility, PacifiCorp.; Charlo=
tte, N.C.-based Duke Energy Corp. and Juno Beach, Fla., FPL Group, whose $1=
4 billion acquisition of New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. also fell apart in=
 March over management control and financial disclosure issues.=20
But Northwest Natural Gas has always been the favorite to win the utility. =
Portland General, which serves 725,000 electric customers in northwest Oreg=
on, would fit nicely with Northwest Natural Gas, which serves more than 530=
,000 gas customers in western Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. And its chairman,=
 Richard Reiten, is a former top executive at Portland General.=20
Financing would be the hitch. Northwest Natural Gas had a market capitaliza=
tion of just $593 million as of Friday. Investors sent its stock down 9% on=
 the news of a possible acquisition to $23.62 by mid-afternoon Friday.=20
Enron's wish price is reportedly $3 billion. But the Wall Street Journal, c=
iting sources, reported Friday that the number was $2.8 billion, $1.8 billi=
on in cash and stock plus debt assumption of another $1 billion. The articl=
e also said Enron was considering taking a minority stake in the company, w=
hich could explain the lower price.=20
The newspaper said the two were in "advanced talks" and an announcement cou=
ld come within days. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that Northwe=
st's board still had to vote on the deal but that it could be announced as =
early as Monday.=20
Enron acquired Portland General in July 1997 for stock valued at $2.1 billi=
on in a deal hailed for combining power assets with natural gas pipelines. =
But it decided to dump the business after razor-slim margins and a very pub=
lic clash with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, which blocked its at=
tempts to sell the utility's electricity generating assets, including its h=
ydroelectric facilities, and forced it to cut rates by $80 million.=20
Portland General is not the only asset Enron is trying to shed.=20
The company is working furiously to dump $4 billion to $5 billion worth of =
assets all around the world as it refocuses on "asset-light" businesses, su=
ch as trading and marketing.=20
But the effort hasn't gone well. It announced Oct. 3 it agreed to sell its =
Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. unit to BG Group plc of the U.K. for $388 millio=
n. The unit owns a 30% interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta =
oil and gas fields and almost 63% of the CB-OS/1 exploration license in wes=
tern India.=20
It now looks as if that deal could also come unstuck. Indian media reports =
have suggested that the government wants the operatorship of the assets to =
pass to two of Enron's joint venture partners -- state-owned Oil & Natural =
Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. -- rather than remain with Enron Oil=
 & Gas India.=20
Such a development would render the acquisition unattractive for the U.K. c=
ompany and likely scupper the deal.=20
A BG spokeswoman said the company still has "every confidence" Enron Oil & =
Gas India will retain the operating license for the assets, adding that not=
hing has changed since the deal was announced. Negotiations are continuing =

NW NATURAL WEIGHING PURCHASE OF PGE

PORTLAND -- Four years after buying its way into the Pacific Northwest mark=
et, Texas energy trader Enron Corp. may be ready to sell off Portland Gener=
al Electric to another Oregon utility just down the street.=20
Northwest Natural Gas confirmed Friday it is talking with Enron about buyin=
g Portland General Electric, returning the headquarters of a major business=
 to a state that has seen several big companies head elsewhere after merger=
s or acquisitions.
There was no other comment from the three companies, but some analysts say =
an announcement could come as early as next week.=20
"It's probably a trial balloon," said Mike Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons. "Ei=
ther they wanted to see how the market would take it, or they put up a tria=
l balloon to finalize terms of the deal."=20
"It certainly leads me to believe they're in the very late stages of their =
talks," said Allyson Rodgers of Wells Fargo Van Kasper.=20
Enron started shopping Portland General Electric not long after acquiring t=
he Portland-based utility in 1997 for $3.2 billion.=20
Disappointed by a slower-than-expected pace of deregulation in Oregon, Enro=
n tried to unload PGE to Sierra Pacific Resources, based in Reno, Nev. But =
the deal faltered and was called off in March, about a year and a half afte=
r it was announced in November 1999.=20
A merger with Northwest Natural Gas would be a much better fit for PGE than=
 either Enron or Sierra Pacific, Rodgers said.=20
Northwest Natural and PGE have worked closely together for the past two yea=
rs on various projects, including joint meter-reading and joint trench-digg=
ing projects, because their service areas overlap in the Portland metro are=
a, she said.=20
The downtown headquarters for the two companies are just blocks apart.=20
Heim said Houston-based Enron, the nation's top natural gas trader and the =
leading wholesale electricity marketer, has been trying to tighten up its b=
alance sheet after being punished on Wall Street for the failure to sell PG=
E, fallout from the Pacific Gas & Electric bankruptcy in California, and a =
push into the Internet that took a nosedive along with the rest of the tele=
communications industry.=20
"Enron has stumbled a little bit with their noncore investments," Heim said=
.=20
Bob Valdez, spokesman for the Oregon Public Utility Commission, said commis=
sioners have not been notified of any pending deal, but they would review i=
t as soon as an offer is made. The approval process could take about 10 mon=
ths if a deal is announced, he said.=20
PGE has 730,000 customers in Oregon while Northwest Natural Gas has about 5=
30,000 customers, including some in Southwest Washington.

Enron to Announce Sale of Portland General on Monday, NYT Says

Enron to Announce Sale of Portland General on Monday, NYT Says

     Houston, Oct. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. plans to announce
Monday an agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest
Natural Gas Co. for $3 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt,
the New York Times reported, citing executives close to the
transaction.

     The purchase would combine the electric and gas utilities in
Portland, Oregon. Northwest would pay about $1.5 billion in cash,
$100 million in common stock and almost $300 million in preferred
convertible stock, the Times said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and
Judith Wilkinson, spokeswoman for Northwest, declined to comment.

     Enron bought Portland General in 1997 and has been trying to
sell the utility for about two years, as it sheds slow-growing
businesses to focus on trading of commodities such as electricity,
natural gas and lumber. A planned sale to Sierra Pacific Resources
collapsed about five months ago because of regulatory snags.

     Trading doesn't require ownership of expensive assets such as
power plants and pipelines, and Enron's profit from the business
is growing at about 25 percent a year, analyst Robert Christensen
of First Albany Corp. said. Portland General, while profitable, is
expected to boost earnings by just 1 percent next year, he said.

     Houston-based Enron would retain about a 5 percent stake in
Portland General, the Times said. Enron and Northwest officials
plan to approve the deal today, the paper said. Northwest said
yesterday the companies were in talks, confirming an earlier
report by the Wall Street Journal.

                         Northwest Debt

     Northwest, based in Portland, would assume about
$1.1 billion in Portland General debt, the Times said. Northwest's
shares fell $2.58, or 9.9 percent, yesterday to $23.41, cutting
its market value to about $588 million.

     The company already has about $450 million in debt, said bond-
rating firm Egan Jones, which yesterday lowered its credit rating
on Northwest to ``A-'' from ``A,'' still investment grade.

     Northwest serves more than half a million Oregon and
Washington customers. Richard Reiten, the company's chairman and
chief executive, was president of Portland General from 1989 to
1996.

     The acquisition would make Northwest a bigger gas purchaser,
helping it negotiate lower prices from suppliers, analysts said.
The company also might reduce costs through job cuts and
eliminating duplicate services.

     Enron also is in talks to sell its 65 percent stake in the
Dabhol power project in India for more than $2.1 billion, the
Times said, citing the executives. A deal isn't imminent, the
paper said.

     Enron shares fell $1.37, or 4.1 percent, to $31.73 yesterday.
They have declined 62 percent this year, mostly because of the
resignation of Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, concerns about the
California power market, losses at its bandwidth-trading business
and a contract dispute in India.

     Sierra Pacific, based in Reno, Nevada, canceled its proposed
$3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General on April 26 after
California legislators, worried about a power shortage that had
driven up prices, banned sales of generators serving the state.

     The move blocked Sierra Pacific from the sale of a power-
plant stake needed to win clearance for the Portland General
purchase.

PUC RIGHTLY OPEN TO RECONSIDERING

(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Watching the rapidly cooling -- and now badly shocked -- economy, Oregon bu=
siness leaders and consumer advocates are understandably raising concerns a=
bout the substantial utility rate hikes that went into effect this week.=20
Considering utility costs, the raises can be justified. But the fragile sta=
te of the economy argues powerfully for openness to re- examine rates quick=
ly -- and the Public Utility Commission seems encouragingly open to doing t=
hat.
Boosts ranging from 20 percent for natural gas to 31.5 percent to 53 percen=
t for electricity come at a time when users will have a tougher time absorb=
ing increases. The announcement that Northwest Natural Gas may acquire Port=
land General Electric wouldn't have any impact on current rates. And adjust=
ing rates won't be a simple matter of pleading economic duress.=20
The PUC approved the rate hike, based on the utilities' increased costs and=
 their legal guarantee of a regulated profit. It turned down advocates' app=
eals for a postponement. But properly, it did agree to consider whether it =
would revisit rate cases.=20
That's an unusual step. But it's reasonable given the worsening economy and=
 surrounding uncertainty.=20
Natural gas and electricity prices have fallen recently, below the forward =
contract prices paid by Northwest Natural and PGE. Normally, if utilities' =
costs go down, the drops are reflected in lower prices to users in the futu=
re, or in rebates.=20
If the rate increases could be softened by being phased in, or reviewed mor=
e frequently to take in lower costs, it could greatly help consumers and bu=
sinesses.=20
The PUC has some flexibility and will decide by the end of the month on reo=
pening rate cases. Its openness to the idea is proper and prudent -- and ju=
st a little encouraging.

as not connected to the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., =
he was found to have an expired visa and apparently was detained by the U.S=

Now his future is up in the air and civil rights advocates worry Atta's cas=

 the Houston Chronicle reported in its Sunday editions.=20
"They're supposed to be looking for terrorists, but unfortunately they are =
picking up a lot of people who haven't done anything wrong or are innocent =
or of Middle Eastern descent," said Bruce Coane, an immigration attorney in=
 Houston and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association=
.=20
Sahdi Shalabi, 24, one of Atta's closest friends from high school, describe=
d him as "very playful, very easy going." He liked computers and talking to=
 girls. Atta moved to the United States after graduating from high school i=
n Kuwait, enrolled at Wichita State University about 1994 and landed a job =
at Enron in 1999.=20
Shalabi, who works in Ontario, Canada, said his friend was Muslim but did n=
ot practice the religion.=20
"He's totally Westernized," he said.=20
The Washington Post reported on Sept. 19 that Atta was sought for questioni=

The next day, the FBI said it "has no interest in" Asem Atta, but claimed t=

India: LNG: Ministry willing to pare charter hire rates for Dabhol

NEW DELHI, Oct. 5. THE Ministry of Shipping has expressed its willingness t=
o take a cut in the charter hire rates for the LNG shipping deal for the tr=
oubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in a bid to scale down the shipping costs=
 and salvage the LNG facility planned by Enron.=20
This was indicated by the Shipping Ministry during a meeting held here on T=
hursday between the financial institutions and the Government in which mini=
stries and departments concerned with various aspects of the deal participa=
ted.
The Shipping Ministry controls the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) whic=
h is a 20 per cent equity partner in the joint venture Greenfield Shipping =
Company formed for owning and operating a 137,000 cubic metre capacity tank=
er for transporting LNG from Oman to the Enron-promoted power plant in Maha=
rashtra, now clouded in controversy.=20
While the shipbuilding cost of $220 million is unlikely to be pared down ma=
inly due to the fact that the 137,000 cubic metre tanker is nearing complet=
ion at Japan's Mitsubishi yard, the promoters of LNG Laxmi will have to go =
for a cut in the time charter hire rate of $98,600 per day for 10 years agr=
eed with the DPC, Government sources told Business Line.=20
The Greenfield Shipping Company will have to take possession of the LNG ves=
sel on November 15 when the tanker will be ready for delivery as per the Sh=
ipbuilding Contract (SBC) signed with the Japanese yard.=20
The Godbole Committee set up by the Maharashtra Government to review the En=
ron deal had concluded, among other things, that the time charter hire rate=
 of $98,600 per day agreed between DPC and Greenfield Shipping Company was =
very much on the higher side.=20
A section within the Government even thinks that the contracted shipbuildin=
g cost of $220 million comprising a bare vessel cost of $189 million and fi=
nancing cost of $21 million was higher than the market price prevailing at =
the time by atleast $18,000 to $20,000.=20
With the power project facing trouble, the lenders to the LNG shipping proj=
ect led by ANZ Investment Bank has declared an event of default and suspend=
ed the last trance of the project loan worth $55 million out of a total loa=
n component of $165 million.=20
The three promoters will now have to make up for the gap in the project fun=
ding by putting in additional money in proportion to their equity holding t=
o get the project going.=20
Besides SCI, Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines hold 60 per cent equity while Atlan=
tic Commercial Inc.(an Enron affiliate) has the remaining 20 per cent.=20
However, sources feel that SCI's additional investment in the project along=
with a proposed cut in the charter hire rate (this has to be re-negotiated =
with the new owner of DPC) suggested by the Shipping Ministry, would render=
 SCI's investment in the LNG shipping project unviable.=20
Another spot of bother for the SCI is that the time charter hire rates for =
LNG shipping have gone down substantially from the time when the time chart=
er party was signed with DPC at a rate of $98,600 per day.=20
With the LNG facility of DPC now put on the back- burner and given the fact=
 that the tanker will have to be deployed elsewhere on spot basis upon poss=
ession till the fate of the proposed LNG facility is decided, sources said =
that the viability of the project will not work out in the face of a declin=
ing trend world-wide in the charter hire rates for LNG shipping.=20
The charter hire rates are now ruling about $67,000 per day and are expecte=
d to dip even further to about $50,000 per day. "In such a scenario, SCI's =
investments would fetch only a paltry 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent rate of re=
turn as against the Government norm of 12 per cent for projects involving s=
tate- funding", the sources said.=20

POWER GIANT BUYS ISLAND IN SEARCH FOR GAS PIPELINE
David Fleshler Staff Writer

10/06/2001
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro
1A
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

In an attempt to serve South Florida's surging energy market, an internatio=
nal power company has bought a tiny Bahamas island where it plans to build =
a $1.3 billion complex of electric power and natural gas plants.=20
AES Corp., which owns power plants all over the world, purchased Ocean Cay,=
 a manmade island about 50 miles east of Miami. The 90- acre island, part o=
f the Bimini Islands, is the site of an aragonite mine.
But under a proposal outlined this week to state and Broward County officia=
ls, the island would become an important offshore power supplier to Florida=
. Liquified natural gas would arrive in tankers. A plant would convert it t=
o gaseous form and it would be sent to Port Everglades through a 70-mile un=
dersea pipeline. The company also plans to build a 1,200-megawatt power pla=
nt, with an undersea transmission line to South Florida.=20
"It's a good project to deliver energy into the state of Florida," said Don=
 Bartlett, vice president of AES Coral Inc., the company's Miami subsidiary=
. "It's a very economically doable project."=20
With its proposal, AES has emerged as a rival to Enron Corp. and El Paso Co=
rp. in the race to build an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas =
to the United States.=20
AES Corp., based in Arlington, Va., is one of the biggest energy companies =
in the world. The company owns or holds interests in 180 power plants in Ch=
ina, Sri Lanka, Argentina, Hungary, Brazil and many other countries.=20
It reported revenues of $6.7 billion last year and employs 60,000 people.=
=20
All three companies' proposals will face hard questions from regulators abo=
ut public safety, possible damage to coral reefs and potential harm to othe=
r ocean habitats.=20
Mary Murphy, a state DEP administrator who met with the AES representatives=
, said she told them that they would have to explain how they would cross t=
he bands of coral reefs along the coast.=20
They would have to show how the pipeline would avoid harming wetlands while=
 on land.=20
They would have to show whether the route would go through populated areas =
or heavily trafficked sections of Port Everglades and how they would keep t=
he public safe from accidents.=20
"We're looking at public health and safety, the environment, and we want to=
 know what they're going to do to address these concerns," she said. "We wa=
nt to know if they're going through residential areas, if they're going thr=
ough commercial areas. What kinds of reef are you impacting? Are you going =
to drag your pipes along the reefs? They need to look at the other uses -- =
beach renourishment, cables, treasure salvage leases, possible archaeologic=
al sites."=20
Bartlett said the company would work with environmental officials to find a=
 route that minimizes environmental harm. The company plans to drill a rout=
e under the reefs, using the technique of horizontal drilling, which should=
 leave the reefs undisturbed, he said.=20
"Our objective is to not have any environmental impact at all, and that's w=
hat we're trying to achieve," he said.=20
By building a power plant offshore, AES would avoid the local opposition th=
at doomed two power plant proposals in South Florida this year.=20
"The advantage to Broward County and the state of Florida is that 1,200 meg=
awatts will come ashore without siting a power plant in Broward County," Ba=
rtlett said. "Siting plants in South Florida is pretty tough."=20
In addition to directly supplying electricity, the project would deliver na=
tural gas to the region's power plants.=20
Demand for natural gas has surged in the United States. The vast majority o=
f new electric power plants use it for fuel because it generates far less p=
ollution than coal or oil.=20
Two power plants proposed for Deerfield Beach would both use natural gas, a=
lthough one would use diesel oil as a backup fuel in case the natural gas s=
upply was interrupted.=20
But the AES proposal faces competition from two Houston energy companies. E=
l Paso Corp. has proposed a natural gas pipeline from Grand Bahama Island t=
o a point near the Port of Palm Beach, where it would hook up with the stat=
e's gas transmission system. Enron Corp. has filed applications for permits=
 to construct a pipeline from Grand Bahama to Port Everglades.=20
The decision on who gets to build the pipeline could ultimately be up to th=
e Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which governs the distribution of n=
atural gas throughout the country. Enron has moved the furthest in the appr=
oval process, having filed applications with the commission, the state Depa=
rtment of Environmental Protection and other agencies.=20
It is unclear whether all three pipeline projects could go forward, since t=
hey would be seeking to sell natural gas to many of the same customers. Enr=
on spokesman John Ambler said the state's demand for energy could support m=
ore than one new source of supply.=20
"I think it's clear that Florida needs more gas," he said. "A diversity of =
sources of supply is probably a good thing. I don't know if we need all of =
the proposals that are being speculated about. But the demand projection ov=
er the next 10 years is that Florida is going to need another 12,000 megawa=
tts of power, and that means a lot of gas is going to be needed."

DIESEL BAN MAY SWAY OPPONENTS OF POWER PLANT
Jeremy Milarsky Staff Writer

South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro
1B
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

A deal in the works between top officials at City Hall and a Houston-based =
power company may remove a critical sticking point for people who oppose pl=
ans for a 510-megawatt energy plant here.=20
Deerfield Beach Mayor Al Capellini said representatives of Enron Corp. last=
 month asked to make minor changes to their financial agreement with the ci=
ty. In exchange, Capellini wants the company to abandon plans to use diesel=
 fuel as a backup power source for their proposed power plant on Green Road=
 just east of Florida's Turnpike.
That's an important condition for government officials in Coral Springs and=
 other North Broward cities, who fear that diesel fuel emissions would poll=
ute the air in the region. Enron's plans call for the plant to be fueled pr=
imarily by natural gas, which is relatively clean, but they want to be able=
 to use diesel fuel in case the gas runs out.=20
"If they want to open up their [financial] agreement, they would have to re=
move the diesel fuel part of their plant," Capellini said.=20
The financial agreement calls for Enron to pay the city $1.5 million in fee=
s before they build the plant, and at least $1.7 million in property taxes =
annually. Enron last week paid the first $500,000 of the fees, but they hav=
e asked for a different payment schedule, Capellini said.=20
Enron officials want to be able to burn diesel fuel as a backup power sourc=
e because currently, only one natural gas pipeline operates in Florida. But=
 two other pipelines -- one coming across the Gulf of Mexico and the other =
coming from the Bahamas -- are in the works.=20
Enron might be willing to drop their plans for diesel fuel, but only if "on=
e or both" of those pipelines works by the time they build their plant, sai=
d Eric Thode, a company spokesman.=20
"Functionally, the plant is an ambulance service," Thode said. "It has to b=
e able to be used at a moment's notice."=20
If Capellini were to convince Enron Corp. to drop the diesel fuel portion o=
f their plans, it would represent a political victory for him and his city.=
 That's because the mayor of Coral Springs, one of the cities that has chal=
lenged the state's intention to give Enron an air-quality permit, has said =
that he will back off if they drop their plans to burn diesel fuel.=20
So far, Coral Springs has declined to take as aggressive a stance as neighb=
oring Coconut Creek, where government attorneys sued Deerfield Beach on Jul=
y 13. Coconut Creek attorneys argue that a conflict in zoning laws made it =
illegal for Deerfield Beach city officials to approve the Enron plant the w=
ay they did.=20
Broward Circuit Judge Leonard Stafford dismissed the lawsuit last month bec=
ause he said Coconut Creek had not followed proper procedure, but allowed t=

aid Mitch Bernstein, an attorney for Coconut Creek.=20
"The claims are essentially the same, but they are more thoroughly supporte=
d by the events that took place in Deerfield Beach when they considered Enr=
on's application," Bernstein said.=20
Capellini said Tuesday evening there were numerous parts of Coconut Creek's=
 lawsuit that are inaccurate.=20

Enron Offshoot Leads Texas Complaints for Unauthorized Electric Accounts

AUSTIN, Texas--An offshoot company of Houston-based Enron led the state in =
"slamming" complaints on allegations of attempting to sign up electric cust=
omers without their consent, state records show.=20
The Texas Public Utility Commission has received at least 14 complaints aga=
inst the Enron-created NewPower Co. and one each against providers Green Mo=
untain, Reliant, First Choice and Shell, according to documents filed with =
state regulators.
The Texas electric deregulation law prohibits the practice and sets penalti=
es of up to $5,000 per day, per customer, but the PUC has taken no official=
 enforcement action against any of the companies.=20
"Slamming" is slang for changing customers' utility providers without their=
 permission.=20
A NewPower spokeswoman said the company is aware of the complaints and has =
begun an investigation.=20
"NewPower has a zero tolerance policy towards slamming," said company spoke=
swoman Terri Cohen. "We have more than 50,000 Texans who have chosen to swi=
tch to NewPower. Even a fraction of a percent of slamming complaints -- whi=
ch is what this is -- is not acceptable to us."=20
Under the state's new deregulation law, companies such as NewPower can offe=
r lower prices and different service plans to lure customers away from the =
state's utility companies.=20
A pilot project that began this year allows companies to compete for up to =
5 percent of customers. Most of the Texas market will open Jan. 1.=20
The process is overseen by the PUC and a nonprofit corporation that manages=
 the state's electric power grid.=20
Under the Texas Open Records Act, the Star-Telegram obtained information on=
 68 complaints about the pilot project filed between March 1 and Sept. 27. =
Other complaints involved billing, customer frustrations over delays in the=
 pilot project, customer service and deceptive trade practices.=20
James Pittman, 52, of Houston, said he switched to NewPower after a telepho=
ne marketer told him he would have to choose a new electric company -- or t=
he state would choose one for him.=20
Pittman said the telemarketer incorrectly told him he would have to pay fee=
s for a forced switch but could switch to NewPower for no charge.=20
"I just flat out told her that I just got out of the hospital from a heart =
attack, and I didn't feel like I was up to any of this," Pittman said.=20
"She told me that I had to change (electric service), or the state would ch=
ange it for me. She said it wouldn't be our choice. It would be whatever th=
e state decided."=20
Pittman said he then had difficulty switching back to Reliant.=20
Several Texas residents, including some TXU customers in North Texas, also =
reported receiving switch notifications even though they had not requested =
new service.=20
PUC spokesman Terry Hadley said some of the slamming complaints may have be=
en prompted by computer glitches at the power grid. Others may have been ca=
used by confusion by marketers and the public over the new deregulation law=
.=20
Hadley said regulators will continue to monitor complaints, although it is =
premature for the PUC to take enforcement actions.=20
"It's early in the game and we would expect that as education increases, we=
 might not see the so-called complaints in the future," Hadley said.=20
He said lawmakers had inserted strong anti-slamming language into the dereg=
ulation law after witnessing similar problems with the deregulation of long=
-distance telephone service. The PUC received 5,700 such complaints in one =
year alone, he said.=20
But Reggie James, director of the Austin office of the Consumers Union, sai=
d the PUC should have done a better job of educating consumers about their =
rights under the new law.=20
He said a $12 million customer-education campaign by the PUC has focused fo=
r the most part on "happy talk" to defend deregulation.=20
"If deregulation is going to work, it will require the confidence of all co=
nsumers," said James. "And if people think they're going to get ripped off =
by the companies that are competing, it will hurt all the competitors."=20
Complaints about slamming and other problems can be lodged with the PUC by =
calling (888) 782-8477.
