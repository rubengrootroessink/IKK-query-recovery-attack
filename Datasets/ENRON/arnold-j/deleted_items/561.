Please populate the attached worksheets for Stack Manager & Website Access.  I have added the Gas product types and a drop down for each user/product type  to populate with READ, EXECUTE or NONE.  For READ ONLY Website ID's, additional population is NOT necessary.  Please add or remove names as necessary and return to me once complete.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 
Thank you,
