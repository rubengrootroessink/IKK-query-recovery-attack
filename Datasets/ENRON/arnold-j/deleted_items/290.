OCTOBER 2001 TWELVE-UNDER-$12
STERLING Sauvignon Blanc, North Coast (California), 2000
12x750ML	$10.21	$112.42   Here's a well-balanced, medium-weight
Sauvignon Blanc offering classic grass, pear, melon, and lemon-drop
aromas and flavor and a nice bit of malo-lactic richness (but has
ample fruit and acidity to keep it fresh and lively). Long in the
mouth with good Sauvignon fruit to the end. Clean  and refreshing -
quite tasty. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

LOUIS LATOUR Pinot Noir, Bourgogne Rouge, 1999
12x750ML	$7.87 	$86.58   Here's a super, bargain-priced Burgundy
featuring lots of juicy dark-cherry fruit with hints of cola and
chocolate and good earth notes. Long and focused, it really lasts
in the mouth. It has enough tannin to offer some weight and
chewiness but not so much that it overwhelms the wine. Serve
cool (55-60?). Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

TOAD HOLLOW Chardonnay, California, 2000
12x750ML	$10.99 	$121.08   A blend of 50% Sonoma County Chardonnay
and 50% Mendocino County Chardonnay all grown in cooler areas and
fermented in stainless steel tanks with full malolactic
fermentations, the result is a lovely, balanced, pure, juicy,
ripe Chardonnay offering lots of fruit in the banana and pear range
with good richness and no "splinters" (of oak). Finishes fresh and
clean. Fine. SPEC's Score: 89 points.

GOATS DO ROAM Red, Western Cape (South Africa), NV
12x750ML	$7.61 	$83.78   A blend of 33% Pinotage, 22% Syrah,
13% Cinsault, 13% Grenache 10% Carignan, 5% Gamay, and
4% Mourvedre, this Cotes du Rhone-style (get it?) red shows good
richness and plenty of dark grapy fruit with notes of spice and
pepper. The texture is nicely chewy with good weight in the mouth
and a good feel. This is a solidly enjoyable, quite versatile,
everyday drinking red. Very Good+. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

LA VIS Pinot Nero, Trentino (Italy), 2000
12x750ML	$10.71 	$117.30   Unusual fresh, lively, red-berry and
red-cherry fruit-oriented Pinot Noir (Nero) from the Trentino
region of northeastern Italy featuring a hint of cola and fresh
crushed berry tannins. Spicy and alive with flavor and character.
Medium weight with just a touch of chewiness. Moves toward black
cherry as it develops in the glass. Quite refreshing.  Serve
cool (50-55?). Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87 points.

PIERRE BONIFACE Rousette de Savoie "les Rocailles" (France), 2000
12x750ml	$9.41	$104.26   This delightful, off-the-beaten-path,
balanced, super-fruity, fresh, dry white features a nose that is
initially a little closed but the palate reveals plenty of mixed
tree fruit (peach, yellow cherry, etc.) and wildflower perfume.
It has a lovely refreshing texture and feel in the mouth with a
thrilling balance. The super-long finish hints at lemon drops at
the end. Wonderful as an aperitif. Delicious and Excellent. SPEC's
Score: 91 Points. (This was an email special in July that got such
a great response we decided to buy more so that we could offer it
in the Twelve-Under-$12)

PAOLO SARACCO  Moscato d'Asti (Italy), 2000
12x750ML	$11.82 	$130.90   This delicious, half-sparkling, juicy,
ripe, naturally low-alcohol (7%), white is bursting with aromatic
fruit in the classic Muscat range: lemon drop, honeysuckle, cirtus
zest, and apricot. The palate is light, thrilling, and super
refreshing and offers pure pleasure. Lasts and lasts in the
mouth; finishes tingly clean. Excellent. SPEC's Score: 91 points.

LE FAUX FROG Chardonnay, Limoux - Vin de Pays d'Oc (France), 1999
12x750ML	$6.76 	$74.46   Also from Todd Williams of Sonoma County?s
Toad Hollow, this is a juicy, low-acid, pineapple fruit oriented
Chardonnay made in the style of a clean Aussie Chard.  It has a
good balance and feel with a nice richness but is not tarted up
with oak chips and sugar like so many "value-priced" (cheap)
Chardonnays. Finishes dry and clean. Very Good.
SPEC's Score: 86+ points.

FOREST GLEN Merlot, California, 1999
12x750ML	$6.88 	$76.61   Here's a balanced, juicy, ripe cherry
fruit-oriented Merlot with a fine medium-weight style and a nice
texture. Dry and mouth-filling with hints of earth and wood that
compliment and round out the juicy fruit. Very Good.
SPEC's Score: 86 points.

PENFOLD's Koonunga Hill Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon, South Australia,
1999   12x750ML	$8.46 	$93.11   This blend of 74% Syrah and
26% Cabernet Sauvignon features lots of ripe, earthy, black
raspberry and blackberry fruit with plenty of white pepper
character, a nice note of cassis, and a touch of tobacco. Quite
spicy in the mouth. Fine length. Very Good+.
SPEC's Score: 87 points.

ALAMOS RIDGE Cabernet Sauvignon, Mendoza (Argentina), 1999
12x750ML	$9.27	$101.57   Quite tasty, very juicy, classically
Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon with lots of blackberry fruit layerd
over a core of dusty oak and earthy terroir. It has a somewhat
rustic character with a nicely chewy texture. Long and dry with
a fine, perfumed berry note that really lingers. Fine.
SPEC's Score: 88+ points.

JEWEL Viognier, California, 200O
12x750ML	$10.23	$113.33   Lovely, aromatic, juicy Viognier with
crisp fruit in the peach-apricot-and-ripe-pear range with a
solid honeysuckle note and a hint of Gewurztraminer-like hops
character. Fresh, refreshing, and lively but with a soft texture.
Long, perfumed finish. A real deal on a Viognier this good. Fine.
SPEC's Score: 88+ points.
