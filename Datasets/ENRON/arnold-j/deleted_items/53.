6.  #16171 - Chat St. Michelle 1998 Reserve Syrah - $28.99 a bottle -   (comes to $23.19 when you buy a case!) 
93 Points - Wine Spectator
This wine comes in 6-pack cases
"Chateau Ste. Michelle and its sister winery, Columbia Crest, have been fine-tuning their approaches to Syrah since 1995, and plans are to dive into production of this varietal in a big way. A ripe 1998 vintage produced a gorgeous example of what's possible in Washington with Syrah. This wine is rich and fragrant, a supple and yummy mouthful of plum, blackberry and cherry fruit that mingles on the creamy finish with hints of vanilla and exotic spices. It's beautifully made, and packed with enough flavor to develop with cellaring. Drink now through 2008. "Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
7.  #15935 - Beringer 1999 Sbragia Chardonnay - $49.99 a bottle - (comes to $39.99 when you buy a case!) 
94 Points - Robert Parker
"... reveals more structure than previous vintages (due to the cool growing season).  Dense and thick, with an unctuous texture as well as fine underlying acidity, smoky oak, rich, leesy, hazelnut married with copious quantities of tropical fruit, and a flamboyant personality, this sensational Chardonnay should drink well for 4-5 years"Have your own tasting notes?

95 Points - Wine Spectator
This wine comes in 6-pack cases
You heard it here first!  Our own Gary Vaynerchuk also gave this wine his own 95+ rating back on June 8th!  
"Glorious blackberries, currants and berries.  Full-bodied and incredibly classy, with a solid palate and ultrafine tannins.  Goes on and on.  One of the most underrated producers in the business.  Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.  Best after 2006" - The Wine Spectator - "The Seraselva is 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is a full-bodied with good tannic structure. Seraselva displays aromas of cedar, cigar-box, and deep, dark fruit. The wine has powerful flavors of black currant, licorice and with strong impressions of oak. The extracted and tannic structure of this wine could benefit from bottle aging.The Seraselva was scored 93 Points by the Wine Spectator last year,this is clearly a far superior wine." - 95+ Points - Gary Vaynerchuk (June 8, 2001)Have your own tasting notes?

1.  #14740 - Chateau Pavie Macquin 1998 - $84.99 a bottle - On Sale 
95 Points - Robert Parker
"Nearly exaggerated levels of intensity, extract, and richness are apparent in this opaque blue/purple-colored wine. Sumptuous aromas of blueberries, blackberries, and cherries combine with smoke, licorice, vanillin, and truffles to create a compelling aromatic explosion. The wine is fabulously dense, full-bodied, and layered, with multiple dimensions, gorgeous purity, and superbly integrated acidity as well as tannin. One of the most concentrated wines of the vintage, it possesses immense potential, but patience is requires. Anticipated maturity: 2006-2030" Have your own tasting notes?

2.  #14793 - Chateau Quinault L`Enclos 1998  - $74.99 a bottle -  On Sale 
94 Points - Robert Parker
"An elegant as well as powerful effort, this dense ruby/purple-colored 1998 reveals notes of plums, black raspberries, vanillin, minerals, licorice, and spice. Exceptionally rich with an outstanding texture, this medium to full-bodied wine possesses a distinctive, individualistic style, largely because of its floral, blueberry fruit flavors. Although accessible, it will age for two decades. Anticipated maturity: 2002-2020." Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
3.  #16109 - Antinori 1997 Badia A Passignano Chianti Classico Riserva - $37.99 a bottle - On Sale 
92 Points - Robert Parker
"One of the treasures of the Piero Antinori empire. The dense ruby/purple-colored 1997 Chianti Classico Riserva is the finest wine I have tasted from this relatively new estate...medium to full-bodied and concentrated, with low acidity and ripe tannin, it is a voluptuous, pure, super-concentrated yet accessible 1997 Chianti Classico."
