Registration is free for hedge fund investors and money managers, but hurry, space is limited - the last conference was "sold out" and many investors had to be turned away.

Zurich Capital Markets
Gruss Arbitrage Partners
Halcyon
Schafer Cullen Small Cap L.P.
Bookbinder Capital Management
Starview Partners Fund
Life Science Group Management LLC
and other well known hedge fund managers!

All of whom can be viewed in HedgeFund.Net's HedgePlus section.

Time will be reserved to allow attendees to meet with each manager and to network with other investors and market participants. Continental breakfast and beverages will be served.  The conclusion of the conference will offer additional manager discussion sessions as well as a light luncheon.

Seating is limited, so please click below to register or call HedgeFund.net at (212) 888-1805 with any questions http://www.hedgefund.net/login_conf.php3
