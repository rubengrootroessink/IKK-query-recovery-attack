Dear WineCommune Member,

The WineCommune community has grown over the past three years from an informal message board for buying and selling wine, to an impressive worldwide exchange with a user base of over 10,000 members. Since 1999, we have been proud to offer you free membership and no-cost usership. WineCommune now has the second largest membership base and it is the third largest Internet wine auction company by volume. We have built a business that is secure and reputable, with a client base of loyal users whose participation and feedback have helped us become what we are today.

We want to go further and provide you with an even better place on the Internet to buy and sell wine. We want to add more features, make the site faster, and make it more secure. In order to do that, however, we have to begin charging a modest commission. Beginning with lots posted on Monday, November 5, 2001, sellers will be charged a 3% commission for all successful auctions. Bidding and buying will remain free - fees only apply to the seller. The new fees are the lowest in the wine auction industry - online or offline. Other wine auctions charge as much as 12% to the buyer AND 12% to the seller.

What are we going to do with the commission?  Over the next several months look for the following new services:

1. Increased advertising to attract new members
2. Enhanced customer service
3. Platinum Seller Program - a way to reward sellers with proven track records
4. Greater protection for buyers
5. New ways to buy and sell

We believe the new charge to sellers is competitive and fair, and hope you agree. With this change, we are committed to providing you with the fastest and easiest method for selling and buying wine. Please continue to provide us with comments and suggestions on ways of enhancing our service. We value your membership and are grateful for your continued patronage and support. Thank you for helping us make WineCommune the #1 wine auction community.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at contact@winecommune.com.
