The 2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final will crown a new champion on Saturday, October 27, at Titan Stadium in Fullerton, Calif. The championship final will be televised live at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET) on Fox Sports World and Fox Sports World Espa?ol.

Clavijo, 45, became the head coach of the New England Revolution before the 2000 season, guiding the team to its most successful season ever and leading the side to its first-ever playoff victory during the 2000 season. Clavijo had a stellar career as a player for both club and country, earning 61 caps with the United States. A part of the World Cup roster in 1994, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the USA's historic 2-1 win against Colombia. A 12-time All-Star, he was named the player of the 80's for the Major Indoor Soccer League.

Dating back to 1914, the 88-year-old U.S. Open Cup is the oldest soccer cup competition in the United States and is among the oldest in the world.  In Saturday's match, the Galaxy will play in their third championship game of the year having previously claimed the CONCACAF Championship in January before losing 2-1 in overtime to the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2001 MLS Cup. Los Angeles is the first U.S. team to play in a Regional Championship, a Division I Championship and the U.S. Open Cup Final in the same calendar year.  The New England Revolution, after going winless in two previous tournament appearances, will now play their first-ever tournament final in club history.
