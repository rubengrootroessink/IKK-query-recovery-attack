 The Good News Is There's No Bad news  By:Adam Martin  Stocks are in a rang=

M and Intel are scheduled to report in after the close.  Till then, traders=
 seem to be a bit wary after weeks of gains and nothing really positive in =
terms of trading impetus.  There were neither major earnings shocks today n=
or lowering of guidance, and that alone is enough to apply some upward pres=
sure on the heels of yesterday's late surge.  It doesn't take much to creat=
e a sense of optimism, as any shred of good news is expected to bring the b=

ysts feel that over the next two quarters economic weakness will be dissipa=
ting, and there will be a rebound in earnings by the second quarter of 2002=
.  It may be a choppy road ahead, however, as Wall Street continues to feel=
