 continue to soar as the trading day continues as both the DJIA and the NAS=
DAQ are adding on substantial gains to yesterday's rally one month after th=
e terrorist attacks on Washington DC and New York.  The good news from corp=
orate America continues to trickle in, as does reports of success on this f=
ifth day of bombing raids on Afghanistan.  Traders liked what they heard fr=
om companies such as Etrade and Genentech, and although Yahoo! made some gl=
oomy comments about the market and announced layoffs, they did meet Wall St=
reet expectations for earnings.  Traders also like the economic stimulus pr=
ogram in the works, and seem confident that steps being taken will help bri=
ng recovery sooner rather than later.  After a substantial decline in the w=
ake of the tragedy on September 11th, stocks have made their way back to le=
vels approaching pre-attack prices.  Still, some analysts remain cautious t=
hat we're not out of the woods just yet, and some discouraging earnings new=
s may yet dampen traders spirits in the coming sessions. - - - - -MORE Brea=
