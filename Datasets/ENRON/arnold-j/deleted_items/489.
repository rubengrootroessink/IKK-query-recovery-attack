1. #16309 - Sassicaia 1998 - $139.99 On Sale  
95 Points - Wine Spectator
"Lovely, subtle yet complex aromas of rants, sage and green olives lead to a full-bodied red with a solid core of fruit and well-integrated tannins.  Still very reserved on the finish, but those who are patient should be rewarded.  Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.  Best after 2005"Have your own tasting notes?

2. #16193 - Snowden 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon - $59.99 On Sale  
93 Points - Wine Spectator
"A dark, rich and firmly tannic mouthful of currant, anise, cedar, tar and herbal flavors, this deeply concentrated Cabernet is one for the cellar. An immense wine that reminds me of a barrel sample; patience required. Best from 2004 through 2010. "Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
3. #11408 - I Giusti & Zanza 1999 Belcore- $24.99 (Only $19.99 when you buy a case)  
91 Points - Robert Parker
"The 1999 Belcore is a 3,000 plus-case cuvee of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot aged in large, 300 liter barrels.  Its dense purple color is followed by a sexy, open-knit nose offering explosive aromas of pain grille, blackberry, and cherry liqueur intermixed with currants.  Spicy, fleshy, full-bodied, rope, and seductive, it will drink well for 5-6 years."Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
4. #16394 - Sportoletti 1998 Bianco - $29.99 (Only $23.99 when you buy a case)  
93+ Points - Gary Vaynerchuk - Wine Library
"This may be the best effort for an Italian white wine I have had in a long,long time.The complexity that this wine shows is almost stunning. If you enjoy great White Burgundies then this is your Italian counterpart ! This wine is also straw colored with crisp apple and lemon aromas. Medium bodied with fresh acidity, finishes with hints of vanilla.A blend of Grechetto & Chardonnay this is the white version to the Rosso that just scored 96 points Robert Parker.Have your own tasting notes?

5. #11885 - Paul Jaboulet 1999 Hermitage "La Chapelle" - $96.99 On Sale  
93-95 Points - Stephen Tanzer
"Saturated medium ruby. Deep, highly concentrated aroma of black fruits, bitter chocolate, shoe polish and humus. Thick but bright on entry, then quite full and consistent through to the very long whiplash of a finish. Really stuffed with fruit, and beautifully balanced. Dense flavors of cassis, violet, bitter chocolate and Cuban tobacco. Substantial ripe tannins are thoroughly buffered by the wine fat. A great showing today. Jaboulet used helicopters to dry the fruit after the showers, then picked quickly." Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
6. #16407 - Le Corti 1998 Don Tommaso Chianti - $21.99 (Only $17.59 when you buy a case)  
91 Points - Wine Spectator
"Intense aromas of berries, cherries and tobacco. Full-bodied, with loads of fruit, velvety tannins and a long, flavorful finish. Drink now through 2006." Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
7. #11121 - La Viarte 1999 Pinot Grigio - $13.99 On Sale  
91 Points - Wine Library
This is the best Pinot Grigio we have ever tasted, period ! The La Viarte is the most interesting Pinot Grigio this staff has ever tasted, big massive ripe fruit and soft complex fruit flavors dominate the wines inner core.La Viarte is also a wine that can be drank with food or by itself.If you are a fan of complex white wines this is for you !!!!!Have your own tasting notes?

8. #15581 - Terriccio Tassinaia 1997 - $47.99 On Sale  
92 Points - Wine Library
Massive fruit and complexity on the finish is the 2 key components to this wine. 1997 as many of you know is one of the greatest vintages in Italian red wine history. Terriccio is a great producer of wines and the Tassinaia is a great example of the quality of the vintage. If you are looking for that last great 1997, this is it !Have your own tasting notes?
