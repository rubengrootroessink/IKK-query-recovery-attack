Your point was well taken with regards to the current situation over there. I hope you understand that my mind is always thinking in terms of how to make a trade out of a need.... i.e. swap to futures then its evolution to TAS...etc.
  
I had no prior knowledge of how credit issues were resolved by counterparties...and didn't mean to circumvent the process.
