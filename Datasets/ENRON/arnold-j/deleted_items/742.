1. #16583 - Beaucastel 1999 Chateauneuf Du Pape Red - $45.99 On Sale =20
91-95 Points - Robert Parker
"In 1999, Beaucastel`s red wine yields were average, a small 25 hectoliters=
 per hectare.  The 1999 Beaucastel Chateauneuf du Pape is a profoundly rich=
, concentrated, classic vin de garde.  Made from 30% Grenache, 30% Mourvedr=
e, 10% Syrah, 10% Counoise, and the remainder a blend of other varietals, i=
t is one of the blackest, most opaque-colored Beaucastels of the last decad=
e.  The bouquet offers aromas of licorice, roasted meats, black cherry and =
blackberry fruit, and a truffle-like earthy note.  Broodingly backward, for=
midable endowed, powerful, and extremely tannic, it will require 8-10 years=
 of cellaring, and should age effortlessly for three decades or more.  Fran=
cois Perrin compares it to the thrilling 1990, but at this stage, it appear=
s to me to be more structured and closed than the 1990 was at a similar age=
.  In any event, it is a great wine, but readers older than 55 should think=
 twice before investing in such a backward vintage."Have your own tasting n=

2. #12285 - Beaucastel 1999 Chateauneuf Du Pape White - $47.99 On Sale =20
91 Points - Robert Parker
"Beaucastel`s 1999 Chateauneuf de Pape blanc is a terrific success, not sur=
prising in view of the fact that all recent vintages have been gorgeous.  I=
t is made from 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc, fermented in 80% cuves=
 and 20% barrels, of which 10% are new, and bottled with minimal clarificat=
ion.  Like a top Hermitage, the Perrins subscribe to the theory (and I tend=
 to agree) that this is a wine to drink during its first 2-4 years of life,=
 or forget it for at least a decade.  It takes on an oxidized mid-life cris=
is between 5-10 years of age, and re-emerges as a completely different anim=
al around age ten.  Of course, each vintage has its own track record, but i=
t is a fascinating wine to drink young, as well as an impressive one to hav=
e after ten years.  The light gold-colored 1999 reveals intense marmalade a=
nd rose petal, honeyed richness with a touch of spice and toast.  Thick and=
 unctuously-textured, but supported by excellent acidity, it can be drunk o=
ver the next 4! -5 years, and then ignored for a decade.  It will keep for =
20 years."Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on=

93 Points - Wine Spectator
Limit 4 bottles per customer please!
"Most of Robert Foley's debut 1998 Claret perished in a warehouse fire a ye=
ar ago, so he is calling this wine his second first-release. The winemaker =
for Pride Mountain Vineyards made a delicious 1998 vintage, but due to its =
loss, I never printed a formal review. As only a few bottles survived the f=
ire, the 1999 vintage will be the first wine people taste and it's a dandy.=
 Made from grapes grown at Pride, it's a sleek, plush, tightly focused wine=
, loaded with spicy herb-laced cherry, plum and currant fruit flavors, and =
showing a long, persistent finish. The wine is a blend of Cabernet and Merl=
ot, chosen from the best lots of wine made from Pride Mountain Vineyard." -=
