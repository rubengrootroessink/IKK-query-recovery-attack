93 Points - Wine Spectator
This wine comes in 6-pack cases
"Spicy, floral and perfumed Cabernet, a late-release from the '96 vintage, showing off earthy, cedary black cherry and blackberry flavors, and pretty, toast- and vanilla-scented notes. Unusually supple and polished version of this wine. Drink now through 2007. 4,300 cases made. (4300 cases produced) " Have your own tasting notes?

1. #13936 -Pio Cesare 1997 Barolo - $44.99 On Sale  
95 Points - Wine Spectator
"Unbelievable quality.  Glorious aromas of crushed flowers, prunes, cedar and cigars.  Full-bodied, thick and tannic, yet ripe and round, with a sleek, caressing finish.  A classic Barolo that is well-priced.  Made in serious quantity.  Best after 2005"Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
2. #16371 - Richard Partridge 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon - $89.99 (Comes to $71.99 when you buy a case)  
94+ Points - Wine Library
After scoring 94 points for the 1998, Richard Partridge has become a hot new winery in California. The 1999 Partridge is a over the top superstar. From the winemaker who brought us David Arthur, this wine may turn out to be one of the great California wines made.  Huge black fruit and a dark, almost to big, mid-palate.  If you are a fan of hot new California wines that ARE worth the money, this is for you.Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
3. #13189 - Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1996 - $179.99 On Sale  
This may be your last chance to get a first growth under $200!!!!
94 Points - Robert Parker
Limit one case per customer
"This estate's staff believes that the 1996 Mouton-Rothschild is very complex.  I agree that among the first-growths, this wine is showing surprising forwardness and complexity in its aromatics.  It possesses an exuberant, flamboyant bouquet of roasted coffee, cassis, smoky oak, and soy sauce.  The impressive 1996 Mouton-Rothschild offers impressive aromas of black currants, framboise, coffee, and new saddle leather.  This full-bodied, ripe, rich, concentrated, superbly balanced wine is paradoxical in the sense that the aromatics suggest a far more evolved wine than the flavors reveal.  Anticipated maturity: 2007-2030.  By the way, the 1996 blend consists of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc."Have your own tasting notes?

4. #11869 - Joel Gott 2000 Zinfandel - $14.99 (Comes to $11.99 when you buy a case)  
This lush fruit driven red explodes on the palate, ripe bright raspberries and subtle cherry flavors come forth right from the beginning. Slight hints of pepper and spice intermingle on the palate. A true pleasure to drink, try this with your holiday meals. This also has a lasting finish that really rounds out this wonderful wine. Have your own tasting notes?

5. #16067 - The Fifteen Grenache VDP 2000 - $11.99 On Sale  
90 Points - Robert Parker
"An amazing offering for $15.00, this selection of low-yielding, old-vine Grenache (yields averaged 26 hectoliters per hectare) is a 5,000 case cuvee assembled by importer Dan Kravitz. It is a dead ringer for a top-notch southern Rhone wine, even though it comes from the Mediterranean city of Roussillon. It boasts a deep ruby/purple color as well as a big, thick nose of kirsch liqueur intermixed with pepper, spice, earth, and black fruits. There is excellent density, full body, and a whoppingly rich, concentrated finish. The 15% alcohol is well-hidden by the wine`s abundant fruit. It should evolve and drink well for 5-6 years, perhaps longer." Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
6. #13840 - Domaine de Boire 1999 Macon Villages V.V. "Boirie" - $8.99 On Sale  
This is the Chardonnay deal of the year! The 1999 Boire Macon is a massive wine without all the butter and oak that make so many Chardonnay's awful. This wines complexity, boldness, and even crisp finish, make it the perfect dinner wine.  If you have been a fan of Louis Latour Montagny and Jadot Pouilly-Fussie give this wine a try and save lots of $$$.Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
7. #10052 - Manzano 1998 Podre Fontarca Chardonnay - $14.99 On Sale  
Our initial shipment of this wine blew off the shelves before many had the opportunity to try it. Now, it's back and once again, it's a wine you can't afford to miss. ". . . the predominantly Chardonnay Podere Fontarca already rivals Tuscany's best." - Oz Clarke Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
8. #14349 - Dignus 1997 Navarra - $9.99 On Sale 
This unreal Spanish wine is at its prime.  A huge, massive, ripe and even more balanced.  The Dignus is also one of the best wines to serve with a variety of different foods.  If you are a fan of Bordeaux, you may find this as a great example of that type of wine for a much better price.  If you have been drinking wines like Falesco, Apollonio and others then you will flip for this super steal!Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
9. #14223 - Cosecha Particular 1996 Navarra - $14.99 (Comes to $11.99 when you buy a case)  
A more serious version of the Dignus, this Navarra is almost to good to be true.  Particular is a great producer of wine for the money and this may be his best effort to date.  The 1996 Particular is massive with cherry, cassis, black currant, ruby fruit and even a hint of mint.  The mid-palate is explosive and bold with an almost velvety feel to it. This wines finish is almost overwhelming with a serious explosion of cherry fruit.Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com!
