Hi John,
 
We are not moving forward with the external offers at this point and only concentrating on internal.   However, I have adivsed them I would keep in touch with them - should this change I will give you a call and give you an update.
 
Thanks,
 
Karen.

Did we hear a response from the guy who works on the floor of the Nymex?

<<Trading Track Rotations November 9th.xls>> 


All, 

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks, 


Karen B.
