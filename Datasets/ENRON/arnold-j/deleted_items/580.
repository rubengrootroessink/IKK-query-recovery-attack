Winebid.com's current auction begins closing Sunday, Dec. 30, at 9 p.m. US
Eastern Time. That gives you plenty of time to bid on these hot lots without
bids.

Our extremely rare and historic 19th century Lafite-Rothschild vintages are
still available for those who'd like to savor a taste of history. These
wines have been reviewed in recent years by Robert M. Parker Jr., Wine
Spectator and Michael Broadbent, and they earned top scores. These noble
Lafites are in their original bottles, but were re-corked at the chateau
before being included in a connoisseur's cellar in the U.S. Please take a
look. This is an unusual opportunity:
