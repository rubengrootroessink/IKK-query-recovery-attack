John:

Natural is overbought on a short-term basis but my analysis has not produced
any daily strength patterns, which normally indicates the rally has more to
go.  I will not see a daily strength pattern until Monday at the earliest.
Potential for Nov. gas to see 249 - 258 into next week.  Look for market to
continue higher for awhile longer.
