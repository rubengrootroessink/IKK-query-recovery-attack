Subject: GREAT Thanksgiving wines, extremely limited Italian  collectable, =
this week's schedule
A fabulous good morning wine lovers,
Well, it is that time  of year again.  I hope all of you have been watching=
 your food intake like  I have, because I certainly intend to eat my fair s=
hare of the Thanksgiving  feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked qu=
estion from last weekend,  "Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, wha=
t will YOU be drinking on  Thanksgiving?"  Before I reveal my T-day sampler=
 case, I wanted to let you  know what types of food we will pairing these w=
ines with.  We usually start  with some type of shellfish, some mild, some =
spicy.  For my family and  friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer so=
me traditional stuff such as the  best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (tha=
nks to Martha, don't you know), and  assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then c=
omes the main course: TUR-DUC-KEN  (always from our friends at La Boucherie=
), with all the 'fixins': jalepeno  cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffin=
g with sage, and a pile of different  veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepa=
red, but we usually stick to pretty  simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin=
 pie or pumpkin something.  This is  where the Riesling from the sampler ca=
se comes in.  It is also amazing with  the shellfish.  To make this meal a =
smashing success, I have selected the  following sampler case of 12 bottles=
:
