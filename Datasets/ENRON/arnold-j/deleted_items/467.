Enron Names Jeff McMahon Chief Financial Officer

HOUSTON, Oct 24, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) announced today that it has named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer. McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was Enron's treasurer.
