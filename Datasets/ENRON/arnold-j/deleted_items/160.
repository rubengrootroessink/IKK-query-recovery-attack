PRACTICES

1. Discipline above all else!

Now that technological advances and the globalization of the economy have
assured virtual teaming a place of permanence in today's business world, the
task at hand is to make this brand of teamwork as effective as possible.
Authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith emphasize discipline as the key to
virtual team success. This article outlines a number of helpful suggestions
from their latest book, "The Discipline of Teams," including establishing
clear goals, setting measurable objectives, and agreeing upon specific work
rules.

2. Officing Alternatives Getting a Second Look in the Aftermath

"Necessity is the mother of invention." It may also be the mother of
acceptance-prompting people who might otherwise disregard the new or the
different to give it a try when there are few other alternatives. While
Telework and other Alternative Office concepts are not new by any means, many
employers and employees alike, affected by world-changing events like the
terrible tragedies of September 11th are looking for creative strategies to
get people back to work until they can get back to their offices.

3. Should Employees Pay to Work from Home?

For employers who make the commitment to develop and deploy a Telework
program for their employees, the costs associated with adequately equipping
remote workers may be slightly higher than for their in-office counterparts.
However, in contrast to the costs of providing office space, these expenses
are truly insignificant. This article is an example of how Siemen's decided
to disburse home office allowances.

4.  Think Global

In Fortune Magazine's Sept. 3rd Edition, IDRC presented an in-depth look at
the value of an "integrated workplace"; one that supports technology,
services and people, in a changing economy. Check out this feature to learn
more, and to see results from Kinetic Workplace's State of the Industry
survey.

DESIGN

5. RSI: Politicians argue, "Is there a link to computer use?"

As politicians continue the battle over federal ergonomic regulations in the
workplace, scientists are waging their own fight over the cause of the
repetitive stress injuries (RSI), whose incidence such regulations are aimed
at reducing. Some researchers argue that, contrary to popular belief, there
is not a link between heavy computer use and RSI, particularly carpal tunnel
syndrome. Other researchers point to a large body of research documenting
such a link. This article reviews evidence on both sides of the issue.

6.  Is "Big Brother" such a bad thing when it comes to home safety?

While many companies that allow telework focus on the safety and security of
their networks and data, the issue of the worker's physical safety in the
home office is often overlooked. The lines of responsibility are not clear,
leaving workers uncertain about what they need to do and companies fearful of
being perceived as being "Big Brother" if they intrude too much into their
worker's homes.

Jeff Zbar points out the need to ensure that your Home Office is safe and
secure, and provides a security check list for the home office, and a short
questionnaire to test your home office's security and safety. These three
articles underscore the need for teleworkers to have a formalized policy that
clearly outlines both their and their employer's responsibilities in
providing a safe and secure home office. Addressing these issues up front and
in writing eliminates any uncertainty.

TECHNOLOGY

7. Free High-Speed Wireless Net Access?
With the demise of Ricochet, the high-speed wireless access carrier, some
bandwidth junkies have turned to free wireless networks. These "freenets" are
set up by users via the Wi-Fi standard and cable or DSL modem sharing. Cable
carriers call them illegal, while users say it's a solution to the last mile
problem.

8. More Trouble for DSL
With the demise of several providers, the DSL equipment market is shrinking,
pushing users towards lower cost cable modems provided by more stable
companies. This may impact which DSL equipment provider you choose for your
remote access solution, as there may be other vendors exiting the market
should the downturn continue.

9. Tech talk for your home office

This article takes a look at the types of technologies companies are
providing their teleworkers in order to create a high tech office at home.
Check out this article for the cost implications of outfitting home offices
and discover some of the pros and cons of tools, dial-up services and
security solutions.
