2.  #15427 - Corzano 1998 "I Tre Borri" Chianti - $30.99 a bottle - (Only $24.79 when you buy a case) 
93 Points - Gary Vaynerchuk - Wine Library
This wine comes in 6-pack cases
"This wine could go down as 1 of the top 5 wines I have had this year. I have always been impressed by this winery and the Reserva Chianti is amoung the best ever produced. The Riserva is 100% Sangiovese, from the oldest vines, with the best exposure. Vinfied in barrel, this silky, explosively aromatic Chianti is the best wine Corzano e Paterno has ever produced. Aljosha feels it best represents the wonderful vineyards of Corzano e Paterno. "Gary V - Wine Library Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
3.  #13554 - Babcock 1999 Black Label Syrah - $54.99 a bottle - (Only $43.99 when you buy a case) 
This wine comes in 6-pack cases
This wine is huge in every respect. It really typifies one of Babcock's favorite themes in winemaking-- the integration of amplitude and balance. In contrast to the 1997 Black Label Cuvee, this wine is a little more compact, achieving the same riveting intensity, but at a lower finished alcohol. The result-- a concentrated, teeth-staining wine, with elegance. Parker has now put this wine on the map,and Babcock has taken it to even a higher level with this massive effort !

Featured in last week's Wall Street Journal!  Limited Supply Avail!
"An outstanding effort . . . this 98 from Pomerol displays a brilliant nose and a deep, dark color. The fruit just seems to last and last throughout the palate leading you to a tremendously smooth finish. Limited Supply! "Have your own tasting notes?

5.  #15875 - Bollini 2000 Pinot Grigio - $8.99 a bottle - (Only $7.19 when you buy a case) 
"Clear, yellowish-straw color, with fresh white grape aromas and a distinct floral fruit found typical of Pinot Grigio. Citric acidity and crisp flavors, full-bodied and round, clean and fresh. If you like Santa Margherita you will never drink it again after tasting this wine!"Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 
6.  #16144 - Manzone 2000 Dolcetto D'Alba - $11.99 a bottle - (Only $9.59 when you buy a case) 
Manzone is one of Piedmonte's superstars. The 2000 version of this Dolcetto is a very explosive wine and an outstanding value. The dark fruit and complexity on both the finish and the mid-palate is very exciting. If you are looking for a wine to drink with a steak or lamb I couldn't think of a better combo than this.

7.  #11869 - Joel Gott 2000 Zinfandel - $14.99 a bottle - (Only $11.99 when you buy a case)  
90 Points - Rob Hunter - Wine Library
This lush fruit driven red explodes on the palate, ripe bright raspberries and subtle cherry flavors come forth right from the beginning. Slight hints of pepper and spice intermingle on the palate. A true pleasure to drink,  try this with your holiday meals. This also has a lasting finish that really rounds out this wonderful wine. Have your own tasting notes?

8.  #13003 - Cline 1999 California Syrah - $8.79 a bottle - On Sale  
Dollar for dollar this may be the best value in the shop ! Cline has always made great wine and this 1999 Syrah is an explosive fruit bomb. If you have been a fan of the Shiraz grape from Australia you will find this to be an amazing wine. Cherry is the dominate flavor in this wine and the finish is almost overwhelming.
