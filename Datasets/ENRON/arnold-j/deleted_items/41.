U.S. Soccer Fans,
We've added lots of new features to ussoccerfan.com as part of our
recent redesign of the U.S. Soccer online community. In order to take
advantage of these new offerings, please visit
http://www.ussoccerfan.com/ and update your user preferences using the
registration form.

Here is an overview of some of the exciting new features:
* Wallpaper - Decorate your desktop with images from U.S. Soccer events.
Show off the pride you have in your National Teams.
* E-Postcards - ussoccerfan.com members can send e-postcards of the U.S.
National Teams to their friends and family.
* Special Promotions / Ticket Offers - As a member, you'll have
exclusive opportunities to buy tickets for select matches before they go
on sale to the general public and win prizes from us and our partners.
* Live Chat - This is the place where we give our fans the opportunity
to interact with their favorite U.S. Soccer personalities.
* Center Circle - Center Circle is U.S. Soccer's brand new monthly
e-zine giving fans a look at the personalities that make up your
National Teams.

As a member, you'll have access to more information on your favorite
U.S. National Teams than ever before and if you sign up to our
ussoccerfan.com news subscriptions, the latest news will be delivered
directly to you via e-mail. With a click of your mouse, you can register
to receive regular updates and news regarding the national teams of your
choice.

The following U.S. Soccer News Services are available for
ussoccerfan.com members to receive via e-mail:
* General News - Our weekly U.S. Soccer Wire overviews what has been
happening in and around U.S. Soccer and what to keep your eye out for in
the upcoming weeks.
* Open Cup News - Keep up-to-date on the latest happenings in U.S.
Soccer Federation's National Championship tournament.
* TV Announcements - We'll let you know when to "Turn U.S. On" for
national television broadcasts of the U.S. National Teams and other U.S.
Soccer events, including our affiliated leagues and partners.
* MNT News - Follow the Men's National Team with schedule announcements,
rosters, training camp notes and match reports.
* WNT News - Find out which players April Heinrichs has her eye on as
she prepares the Women's National Team to defend its Women's World Cup
title in China in 2003.
* YNT News - Catch a glimpse at the future stars of U.S. Soccer as they
work their way up the ranks with the Youth National Teams.
* State-Specific Announcements - Occasionally we'll have something
special to offer to fans who live in a specific part of the country. For
example, at last month's Nike U.S. Women's Cup match in Chicago, fans
from Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan had the opportunity to
win a "Weekend with the Team" from a Chicago radio station.

All of the members will be contacted via e-mail when we have a
ussoccerfan.com feature to introduce - a guest being scheduled for a
Live Chat session, a special ticket offer, a promotion from one of our
partners, the latest issue of Center Circle - or any other special
opportunity that we don't want you to miss out on.

You'll need to go to the http://www.ussoccerfan.com/ registration form
to update your preferences, reserve a chat alias, and let us know which
of the newsletters you'd like to receive. After your registration is
complete, you'll also gain access to the members-only areas of
ussoccerfan.com.

Our ultimate goal is to bring fans together as part of our soccer
family, and to bring them closer to the teams and personalities they
love. We're always looking for feedback from our fans so feel free to
share your thoughts with us using the feedback form on the web site -
