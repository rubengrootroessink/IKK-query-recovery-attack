Quick Research Tips for Discovering Your Family Story:
START WITH WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
=================================================================

When you're first starting out, collecting information about your
ancestors may seem like an enormous task. But you may already know
much of the information about your close relatives.

TO GET STARTED:
1. The best place to start collecting information is with the most
recent generation. This may be you, your children, or perhaps your
grandchildren.

2. Record the basic genealogical information that you know about
your close relatives:
     *Full names
     *Birth dates and birthplaces
     *Marriage dates and marriage places
     *Death dates and death places, if applicable

3. Take these facts and enter them into your family tree software or
other documentation source.

4. When you have collected information about yourself and any younger
generations, then start working backwards with your parents,
grandparents, and so on, as far back as you can remember.
