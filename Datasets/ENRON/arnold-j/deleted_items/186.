johnny hope all is well. is ok here. new york a little stranger than normal
for obvious reasons.. wwe're trying to get back to normal. pretty stressful
cupla weeks. business has been pretty good(trading anyway) in natgas and
oil. certainly have been some changes in natgas fundamentals but too littl
too late im afraid to get bullish . market sucks and the newest shock to
macr economics im starting to think are mitigating what mite have been some
postive bullish changes like gas/oil relationship and gas shut ins. looks
shitty i think. im not as short as ive been but starting to think this witer
is waaay too high priced. just funtction timing i guess. i sold a few march
aprils again. just doesnt fit the curve and i think 80% probabitly we end
march with over 1.3 tcf in the ground. wud keep things ugle for awhile.
  anyway curious your thots as always. also wanted to say hi.have a good
weekend
