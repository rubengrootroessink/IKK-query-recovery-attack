Welcome to Winebid.com's newest auction, which begins closing Sunday,
Dec. 30, at 9 p.m., US Eastern Time.

Rarely do 19th-century wines from top producers become available. So we
are pleased in this auction to offer Lafite-Rothschild 1864, 1865, 1870
and 1900. Robert M. Parker Jr. has tasted the first three and rated them
between 92 and 98 pts. Michael Broadbent gave the 1900 5 stars. Taste a
bit of history. Find them here:

From "perfect" 100-point Margaux 1990 to "perfect" 100-point Barbaresco
Sori Tildin (Gaja) 1990, this classy collection includes remarkable
wines from France, Italy, Australia, California and Spain. Looking for
more "perfect" wines? How about Harlan Estate 1997 in a magnum, Robert
M. Parker Jr. 100 pts, and Chateauneuf du Pape Reserve des Celestins
(Henri Bonneau) 1990, Parker 100 pts. Find them here:

For "perfect" Bordeaux, may we suggest Beausejour (Duffau-Lagarrosse)
1990, a Robert M. Parker Jr. 100 pt wine. Wine Spectator called it
"liquid cashmere." We offer too Haut-Brion 1989, Parker 100 pts. Wine
Spectator gave the same wine 97 pts and called it "Superb. Great
Future." Find them here:

The greatest Shiraz ever produced in Australia? Robert M. Parker Jr.
thinks Three Rivers Shiraz 1995 may be just that. He gave the wine 99
pts and called it "A virtually perfect wine of splendid concentration,
symmetry, and length (nearly a minute). This may be the greatest Shiraz
produced in Australia." It is part of an extraordinary Three Rivers
Shiraz Vertical 1989 - 1995. Find it here:
