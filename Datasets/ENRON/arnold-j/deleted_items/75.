o positive territory.  It's hard to say exactly what the upward impetus is,=
 but analysts have mentioned the positive guidance by tech companies such a=
s Cisco and others and a possible relief rally as occurred after previous m=
ilitary actions, and the notion that after months of declines and a dip due=
 to the attacks of 9/11, stocks are well oversold.  Still, the gains so far=
 have been tenuous, and downward pressure remains in the form of investor f=
ears about the cost and duration of the war against terrorism in light of t=
he weekend's attacks on Afghanistan and renewed threats of terrorist retali=
ation.  Added to existing concerns as Wall Street faces what could be the w=
orst earnings season in what has been a very bleak year, and it's hard to s=
