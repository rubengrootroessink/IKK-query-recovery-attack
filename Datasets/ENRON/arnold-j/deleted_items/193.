Dear Mr. Arnold:

I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring potential
employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested in
derivatives trading.

I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
starting my MBA.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or NYC
areas in the next few months.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Gad Caspy
