Mike,

Hello.  My name is Adrian Clark and I am an executive recruiter in the
energy industry.  One of my industry sources told me you are a successful
Gas Options Trader.  My firm, First Call Associates, is currently doing a
search for some clients of ours, one of which is retained, which are looking
to hire high-quality Gas Options Traders.  If you, or someone you know, has
an interest in learning more about these opportunities, please contact me.
If the timing is not right for you at this time, I've included my contact
information for future reference.

You can find more information about us at www.firstcallassociates.com.  The
founders of our firm came from the energy business themselves, having spent
more than 10 years trading energy (both gas and power).  Because of their
experience, we have been able to form relationships with some of the leading
energy companies in the country enabling us to present qualified employees
for their consideration.

Be assured that any information we discuss will be completely confidential.
My apologies for sending this to your email at work but I have not been able
to get you by telephone during business hours.
