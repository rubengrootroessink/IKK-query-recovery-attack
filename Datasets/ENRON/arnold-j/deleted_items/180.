What about this one? Do you find it helpful or interesting? It focuses more=
 on Policy, so it might not apply as much...MSA

BPA and Kaiser Reach Agreement on Power (IB)
Kaiser Aluminum and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) reached an ag=
reement on a five-year power delivery deal that has been the source of conf=
lict between the two parties for almost a year. Kaiser Aluminum closed its =
smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to rese=
ll contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spoke=
sman Review, "Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales." Other a=
luminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring=
 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep=
 smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agre=
ed, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 =
per megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than =
BPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha=
t negates a "take-or-pay" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f=
ederal power whether used or not. BPA said, "Under the agreement signed tod=
ay, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take=
 all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are no=
t going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference," Clearing Up reported. =
As a concession for the elimination of the "take-or-pay" clause, Kaiser wil=
l receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Ka=
iser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was =
using the money it had gained reselling power "to pay down long-term debt, =
rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuse=
s," rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off,=
 the BPA, and building generation, AP reported. More... <https://www2.enron=

CA Power Authority Names CEO (IB)
The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority named La=
ura Doll its new chief executive officer on 5 October. Texan Doll "had prev=
iously worked for several communications and consulting firms," and will be=
 receiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to =
the San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will =
retain his post. Freeman said he will "handle fewer administrative duties,"=
 and will "be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups s=
uch as the Legislature and consumer groups," The Chronicle reported. Accord=
ing to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, b=
usinesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the po=
wer authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of pow=
er by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was =
created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can i=
ssue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through =
financing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said th=
at businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates=
 could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of=
 green power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The =
state's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's p=
lanned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Ke=
eley. Keeley said "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in=
 a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law," =
the Register reported. More... <https://www2.enronforum.com/content?content=

FERC Refunds Ordered (IB)
On 5 October, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered four =
power marketers to provide refunds for July sales that exceeded a federally=
 mandated price limit. Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Relia=
nt Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC o=
rder, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the v=
olatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charg=
ing in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the mon=
th in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October =
order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all =
were rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but d=
id not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Altho=
ugh FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent Syste=
m Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, =
The Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the reject=
ion of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mira=
nt and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were "untimely =
and...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transact=
ions," according to the document. Reliant's filing was "not consistent with=
 the requirements of the June 19 Order," and Willams "did not provide any c=
ost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the=
 commission's pricing methodology," the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spoke=
sman told Reuters that "his company was ordered to refund $33,800," while a=
 Williams spokesman told the LA Times "$30,000 worth of electricity sales a=
re subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July." More... <https://www=
