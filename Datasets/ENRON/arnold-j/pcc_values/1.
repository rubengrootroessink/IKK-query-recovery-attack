Sarah-Joy....

The only person I have been working on in Enron about Ball Valves is John
Will.

For Enron to come to PCC Ball Valves outside Milan Italy for a quality audi=
t
(as proposed by John), the correct people to contact are:

Roberto Bartolena - Managing Director  Phone number 39-02-9379-9127 e-mail
robart@pccbv.it

Aldo Bargeri - Sales Mgr Phone number  same as above...  e-mail
abargeri@pccbv.it

I look forward to PCC BV becoming an approved supplier for your
international work....

Pete

John....

Since we last met, a  letter of Intent has been signed by PCC with EES
(Enron Energy  Services)....

I have heard that  our=01;Byron Gaddis was trying to reach you=01; about an=
y
ideas you might  have for large structural parts (remember out titanium
casting capability for  jet engine turbine blades as well as generator
turbine  blades)....

In any case... we  definitely want to make sure PCC Ball Valves is your
INTERNATIONAL (non-USA)  Project ball valve supplier for gas pipelines...
How are we doing to  get that distinction?

Pete
