John,

Thanks for getting back with me...and according to the article in the
Houston Chronicle you are the #1 guy there, so I can see why there would
not be a need to look...how does the merger with Dynegy affect you
guys...is there going to be a shakeout ?  Also if you could take a guess
are there allot of companies in Houston aggressively hiring experienced
traders now or has it slowed...?

Thanks again and continued success....
