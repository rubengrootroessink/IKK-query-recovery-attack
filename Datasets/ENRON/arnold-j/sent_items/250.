I have no good thoughts about the market.  everybody wants it to go down to 2.80 so I covered my short at 310-5.  cash very strong at these lower levels with some gen load.  should act to flatten curve as good producer selling in back.  playing range and selling vol.  think aga may surprise lower than expectations.
