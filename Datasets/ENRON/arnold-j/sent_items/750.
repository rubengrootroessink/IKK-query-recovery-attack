Do you have a second?  I would like to come up there and make sure I understand clearly what you are talking about.  Hey, I might want to short the stock if it's publicly traded.   Sarah

We are going to repay their loan tomorrow based on the notice we received from them that they were cancelling their line to us as of 11/5/2001.
