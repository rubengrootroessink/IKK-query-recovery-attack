schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out.

Hello Mr. Arnold,

Thank you for speaking with me today with Kenneth Parkhill.  Unfortunately,
none of my teammates are available to meet with you today.  Would you please
review our questionnaire and reply back to me with your comments about the
questionnaire and answers to any questions that apply to your work.

We will follow up with you later this week if we have questions.  Thank you
for your help.
