me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick.

i took macroecon also.  i'm not a proponent of open market interventions.  i
am merely saying that its on the ecb radar screen and that measures will be
taken to remedy a weak euro.  further, everything is psychological, a
signalling effect to move the market up is fine by me.  i think overall YOU
have been extremely ineffective (just kidding, pooks).

I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas
market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts
is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short
term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and
transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they
are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the
futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some
point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall
market interventions have been extremely ineffective.
