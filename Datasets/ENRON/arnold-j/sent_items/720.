Talk to Geoff Storey.  He is handling a transaction that will reduce the majority of exposure to us Wednesday morning.

Louise,

I spoke to our contact at BMO and they confirmed the $11.25MM is due to us by the end of day Wed. Also mentioned they were awaiting to have off-setting discussions with John Arnold.  Let me know if I need to put another call into them Wed.
