Jon, can't say it on the desk in front of  Matt.  I had nothing to do with that trade.  I cover your line so I  had to make the call.  I am not out here taking garbage about Enron or  anything like that.  That's why I called Brian in London to call you.   Please beleive me.  That was arranged between them.  I work neither  Phibro or EKoch.
