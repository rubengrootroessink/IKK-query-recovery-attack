i think i've got yahoo somewhere on my computer.  i'll try to find it.  expecting 110 today.  still think we're not at fundamental equilibrium but scared that, as much as i hate technicals, the wave 3 is over and we can do some serious chop here.  if we didnt have expiry in 4 days i'd be worried about a short covering rally.  however, i think the market is going to have a hard time placing the baseload gas this month.  the storage guys are all above their targets right now and expect them to back off relative to last month.
