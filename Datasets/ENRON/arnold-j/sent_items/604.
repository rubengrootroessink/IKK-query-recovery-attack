Although I love you, that's not appropriate for any 3 way sleeves.  EFS should be billed normally.

Along the lines of our conversation a few weeks back...we don't want to take advantage of the situation Enron is in.  By default you were billed on the sell side of each transaction.  If that is not appropriate please let me know and we will zero out the commission.
