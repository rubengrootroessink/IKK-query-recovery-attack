I want my, I want my EOL 

I want my, I want my EOL 

I want my, I want my EOL 

I want my, I want my EOL 



Now look at them market makers's, that's the way you do it 

You buy the nat gas on that EOL 

That ain't tradin', that's the way you do it 

Buying for nothin' and your commissions for free 


Now that ain't tradin', that's the way you do it 

Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb 

Maybe get a blister on your index finger 

Maybe get carpal tunnel 



We got keep the spreads real tight 

Nationwide delivieries. 

We got to move these molecules 

We got to move these electricities 



The Enron trader with the fifteen flat screens 

Yeah, buying sellin', he don't care 

That Enron trader got his own jet airplane 

That Enron trader he's a millionaire 





We got keep the spreads real tight 

Nationwide delivieries. 

We got to move these molecules 

We got to move these electricities. 



I shoulda learned to get out on the web 

I shoulda learned, they have it hyped in the press 

Look at that volume, they are the market share leader 

I can't understand why the stock's under distress 

And he's 50000 up there, what's that, no nymex noises 

Every one wants one, even Dynegy. 

Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it 

Buyin' for nothin' get your commissions forf ree 



I want my, I want my EOL 

I want my, I want my EOL 

I want my, I want my EOL
