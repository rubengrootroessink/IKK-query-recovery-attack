i've been selling.  was long 500 and selling out.  everybody will  be expecting the crude draws.  they dont matter.  think this is tremendously bearish all energy demand.  supply shocks are the only question, but I dont think US will end up fighting a war against the middle east.  Who cares if we nuke afghanistan?
