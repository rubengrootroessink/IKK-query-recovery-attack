        May 28, 2001  TIME Magazine Topping Out In Houston Again  BY CATHY =
BOOTH THOMAS/DALLAS  Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be power=
less and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to t=
he oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in "bidness." The energy giants=
 in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction pla=
ns. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Joh=
nson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much constr=
uction activity by the energy sector.  Leading the parade, ironically, is E=
nron, an old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trad=
ing firm dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In f=
act, its new 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronte=
d by a seven-story "podium"--or shorter building--to house what Enron is ca=
lling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world.  This envir=
onment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become=
 home this August to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Ol=
d World (crude oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emissio=
n credits and derivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are =
even moving from their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they ca=
n peer down into the pit.  When the bigger 40-story structure is finished i=
n December, Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston si=
nce 1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp=
., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in California, wil=
l move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun o=
ff this month from its Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated e=
lectricity market, has signed on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.  Wha=
t's fueling the high-rise fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's first-quart=
er revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net income were each=
 up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the =
company more than $300 million.  After a decade of contraction in the busin=
ess, with companies having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, dereg=
ulation and new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. "E=
nron is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there =
were no trading floors," points out Stephen Brown, senior economist with th=
e Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant will also have t=
rading operations in their new offices.  Though Houston no longer relies so=
 heavily on the energy business (down to 48% of the local economy from 82% =
in 1982) the turnaround sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,00=
0 energy-sector jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Inst=
itute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained =
those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith: "The current boom is what's keeping=
 Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering."  None of this =
matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're just interested in bragg=
ing rights. After a bad decade, they're beginning to sound like the biggest=
 and the best in Texas again. "Boomlet?" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman a=
t Enron. "It's more than a mini-boom. It's a boom."         =09

INDIA: WRAPUP 1-Indian state questions power deals, cites Enron.

BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - India's ambitious plans to throw open its cash-s=
trapped power sector to the private sector, already wracked by controversy =
involving Enron , received a further setback after Karnataka state said it =
would reopen sealed deals with 11 power firms.=20
The technology-friendly southern state of Karnataka said late on Monday tha=
t it was re-opening power deals with 11 private sector firms which together=
 were due to meet half the state's demand over the next 10 years.
"Enron is a lesson for all of us. Now, it (electricity) cannot be at any co=
st," V.P. Baligar, chairman and managing director, Karnataka State Power Tr=
ansmission Corp (KPTCL), the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reute=
rs in an interview late on Monday.=20
The 11 power projects are based on the Enron model and involve a total of 2=
,000 megawatts (MW). None of the 11 projects have started generation.=20
Analysts fear that Karnataka's move, coming amidst the raging controversy o=
ver Enron's giant power project, will scare away badly needed private inves=
tment from the country's inefficient power sector.=20
India needs to add 100,000 MW of power over the next 10-15 years to meet gr=
owing demand and is hoping to get this through investment from private and =
foreign companies.=20
But investment has been hampered by a slow-moving bureaucracy, legal hassle=
s and loss-making utilities who are frequently unable to pay for the power =
purchased.=20
ENRON IMBROGLIO=20
Last week, Enron's Dabhol Power Company moved to break a contract to sell p=
ower to Maharashtra state, peeved over payment defaults by the state utilit=
y Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). This is widely seen as leadin=
g to a pull out.=20
MSEB and Dabhol have been at loggerheads for over six months over payments =
due to DPC by the state utility. The project has been marred by controversy=
 since its inception in 1991, with critics charging that it was charging to=
o much for the power it produced.=20
MSEB, which DPC says owes it $48 million, is planning to retaliate by slapp=
ing a penalty of 4.0 billion rupees ($85.2 million) on DPC for failing to r=
amp up capacity.=20
"We will issue the penalty as soon as the bill for May is received," the of=
ficial, who did not want to be quoted, told Reuters on Tuesday.=20
MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying=
 its plant could not be ramped upto full capacity within three hours from a=
 cold start. DPC officials refused to comment on the issue.=20
The Enron project was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old refo=
rm programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling.=
=20
The project involves the setting up of a 2,184 MW power project costing $2.=
9 billion in two phases. The first, of 740 MW, is up and running while the =
second, of 1,444 MW, is due to be commissioned next month.=20

Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters

HOUSTON (AP) - Executives of Enron Corp. say they are withdrawing from a la=
rge natural gas project off Qatar, partly because the venture doesn't fit w=
ith the energy company's focus.=20
Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with E=
lf, a subsidiary of France's Total Fina, and the United Arab Emirates Offse=
ts Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Fi=
eld.
But the company pulled out, believing there are better places to invest its=
 money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London.=20
He said the project doesn't fit with Enron's current focus of emphasizing b=
usinesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those =
for natural gas and electricity and broadband.=20
Those involved with the project said last year it could end up requiring in=
vestments of up to dlrs 10 billion over six or seven years.=20
Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project=
 to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it=
 had started negotiating with other international players to become stakeho=
lders.=20
With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent=
 of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released.=20
Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates =
Offsets Group that were "in line with our core business activities."=20
M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, sa=
id Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international ass=
ets that generate low returns.

GERMANY: Enron says Lampertheim hub attracting interest.

DUESSELDORF, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. trader Enron said on tuesday there was=
 growing support for the south west German Lampterheim gas hub it had been =
actively promoting since early April.=20
"Liquidity is growing slowly, it is not (Belgian hub) Zeebrugge, but custom=
ers are posting orders and are coming forward with surplus amounts," sales =
chief Helge-Juergen Beil of the company's German division in Frankfurt told=
 Reuters during a Euroforum industry conference.
"Our main strength is that we both sell and buy for various periods."=20
Beil said a number of deals had been done, but would not quantify them.=20
Enron on its trading platform enrononline.com currently quotes Lampertheim =
gas sales and purchases in parcels of 20 megawatt hours in euros for the sp=
ot market and the year ahead.=20
The town, near Heidelberg on the border of the Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg=
 states, complements border hubs such as Bunde-Oude, Aachen, Baumgarten, Wa=
idhaus and Oberkappel.=20
Beil also said Enron was supplying eight local and regional utilities and i=
ndustrial gas customers in central and southern Germany with a total four t=
erawatt hours of annual demand.=20
Enron's share of total requirements in each case varied between 20 and 94 p=
ercent of their annual purchases.=20
He said non-discriminatory access to the German pipeline grid had not been =
achieved by newcomers to the market.=20
In order to help create fair rules for access and their montoring, Enron, l=
ike other newcomers, was demanding a state-installed arbiter to supervise t=
he liberalisation process.=20
Other speakers at the conference said the success of newcomers was still ha=
mpered by the long distribution chain and an enforced need for hourly, rath=
er than longer term, balancing, which could cause exorbitant penalties paya=
ble to incumbents.=20
But some gas grid owners had turned out to be co-operative, customers were =
queueing up, and there were prospects that existing surplus gas volumes fro=
m international take-or-pay contracts could be freed up and eventually trad=
