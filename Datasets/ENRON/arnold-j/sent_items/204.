Here is your two week notice for Belize...

I'm on Continental flight 1231, departing July 4 at 1:25 PM, seat 15D,
returning Sunday, July 8.  I hope you decide to take the later flight
out Saturday.

I talked to the hotel and they have rooms and a scuba instructor available
to dive with us.  Let me know your flights so that I can arrange the
air transfers between Belize City and Placencia and dive lessons through
the hotel.  I haven't booked it yet since they require a non-refundable
deposit.

Call me with any questions - or if you change your mind so that I can
make alternate plans.

Jen
