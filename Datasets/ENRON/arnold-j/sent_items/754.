Jeff,
My mom said that you would email me a few questions that are standard in an
interview.  I was wondering if you could do that for me please?  I am very
nervous and need all of the help I can get.  Thanks for telling mom that I
needed a suit.  I told her but she didn't believe me.  If you have any other
advice feel free to give it to me.  I have a project that I did in a problem
solving class that my teacher told me to take into my job interviews.
Should I take it to my internship interviews?  The project was looking at
statistics of accidents that occured in a certain hospital, evaluating the
correlations over a few years, making suggestions on how to improve and
explaining why certain things were happening.  I am not sure if that will
help in an internship.  What department in a company would that have to do
with?  I think I might be interested in that.
Thanks,
Sarah
