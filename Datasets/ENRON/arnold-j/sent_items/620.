Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?
