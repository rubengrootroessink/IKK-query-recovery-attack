Please call me in the morning so I can 3-way with an EOL technical rep to find out happened.  One looked at it this afternoon, and according to his preliminary analysis, the order was placed at 10:57 and never canceled.  Obviously that is counter to your knowledge of the transaction.  Let's straighten this out first thing in the morning.
John

John,

As per our phone conversation, I do not recognize the sale of half a day of
Cal03 NYMEX at 3.3775 on EOL. I had put in an order at that level but
canceled
it immediately.
Furthermore, the EOL log I get says that the order was valid until 10:57:13
whereas the execution timestamp is 11:00:29

Regards,

Panagiotis.
