Sorry for the delay.  Unfotunately I don't have any openings in my group right now.  If I hear of any positions open I'll give you a shout.  Can you remind me what title you have now.   
John

John,

Hello and good Monday morning to you.  I briefly meet you while talking to Paul Racicot on Friday at Front Porch Pub.  With Matt working here in Freight you probably already know we are not well off these days.  Next on the chopping block is never a good place to be.  

This is a forward question but what the hell.  I was wondering if you knew of any positions available in your area.  If you can believe it I am not ready to leave Enron behind yet.  Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Kristin Gandy
