If we are going on a family vacation this year, we need to start planning.
Now it may be that we all have over expended this year, me on the kitchen,
MBA on the house, JDA on the furniture is has bought, is buying or will
but, and we may only be able to go to the Woodlands, Fredericksburg, or
someplace.  Anyway, we need to do some planning or we will be out of luck.
August is looking bad for me.  September?  Love, Your Mom
