The oil hedging business is poised to take another step up the evolutionary=
 ladder, after the upstart IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) confirmed plans to=
 offer clearing services for its over-the-counter contracts from the fourth=
 quarter of this year. With similar moves also planned by the New York Merc=
antile Exchange (Nymex), OTC contracts such as swaps are increasingly movin=
g into the mainstream. Long regarded as the wild cousins of regulated futur=
es, OTC oil contracts were distinguished by their fuzzy legal status, lack =
of standardization, and absence of clearing services. Changes in USlaw and =
the spread of electronic trade have pretty much eroded the first two differ=
ences, and the ICE initiative will deal with the third. The main difference=
s now lie in regulation and settlement (40#02-06). ICE'sclearing services w=
ill be provided by the London Clearing House (LCH) - the clearinghouse for =
London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which was taken over by IC=
E last month. ICE will now be able to offer a one-stop hedging shop for cle=
ared futures and derivative contracts, allowing traders to use a single loc=
ation to conduct full hedging strategies and to pool their risk. One advant=
age is that it will allow net margining between IPE Brent futures and other=
 ICE products, such as West Texas Intermediate swaps. Clearinghouses offer =
financial risk protection, acting as a central party to shield traders agai=
nst counterparty default. Derivatives trade at ICE is currently conducted b=
etween companies on the basis of bilateral credit agreements.=20
ICE'sinitiative in part reflects its increasingly fierce competition with N=
ymex. The New Yorkexchange will this week launch its new Brent crude future=
s and options contracts, as a direct challenge to the merged ICE-IPE (40#35=
-04). In return, ICE will first introduce clearing services for two activel=
y traded USproducts, involving West Texas Intermediate crude oil swaps and =
Henry Hub natural gas swaps. These swaps are the planned centerpiece for Ny=
mex'slong-delayed internet platform, eNymex(40#04-05). They also pose a pot=
ential challenge to Nymex'stwo core futures contracts, if trade migrates to=
 swaps. Some traders view swaps as more effective hedging tools. Calendar-m=
onth WTI swaps, for example, are widely used to hedge against producer or r=
efiner supply contracts, which use average prices during calendar rather th=
an contract months.=20
The evolution of swaps is also part of a deeper market trend, which has bee=
n actively encouraged by the USgovernment and some big energy companies. Th=
e UShas been working to give derivatives a stronger legal framework since t=
he late 1990s, after Russiadefaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital =
Management hedge fund came to the brink of collapse. That effort culminated=
 in legislation late last year giving derivatives a stronger legal footing,=
 thus eliminating the chance that parties might renege on unfavorable contr=
acts by claiming they were really unauthorized futures deals. The spread of=
 electronic trade - particularly on ICE - has accelerated the change, by en=
couraging liquid trade in standardized products. This is no accident. In an=
 interview with PIW a year ago, John Browne, chief executive of BP - one of=
 ICE'sfounders - said that the platform had been set up in an attempt to cr=
eate "a real exchange market for swaps, rather than simply one-off, over-th=
e-counter activity." This would make hedging more transparent and efficient=
, while eroding the role of intermediaries, he said. Browne drew parallels =
with the earlier evolution of interest-rate swaps in financial markets, int=
o "a standardized business." (39#27-08).Last week, ICE Chief Executive Jeff=
rey Sprechersaid the exchange wants "to try to change the way the market wo=
rks."
