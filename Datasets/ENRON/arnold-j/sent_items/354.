Dear John,

Your subscription to the Wall Street Journal is due for renewal.  The cost of the subscription with the corporate discount is $175.00.

If you are interested in continuing to receive this publication, please send me your Company and Cost Center numbers and an update of your building location if it has changed since last year.

Thank you,
Stephanie E. Taylor
