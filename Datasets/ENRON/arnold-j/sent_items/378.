Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

Dear Mr. Arnold:

I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring potential
employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested in
derivatives trading.

I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
starting my MBA.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or NYC
areas in the next few months.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Gad Caspy
