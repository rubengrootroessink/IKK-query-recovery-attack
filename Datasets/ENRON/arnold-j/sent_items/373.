Scary how we have the same sense of humor.  Havent told anybody yet.  So I have a favor to ask: whether we never talk again, just become good friends, or grow old together with 6 kids, please never,ever refer to me as the energy guy.  You can refer to him as that, just not me.  
Officially tired of watching the news.  Actually there is very little new about it.  Channel 12: the local viewpoint.  CNN: the national viewpoint.  CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  Pat Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts.
Just found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that.  
So let's talk about something better.  We'll start shallow.  What kind of music do you like?  
John

Subject:	RE: Match.com - You've Got Mail:

Thanks for understanding my special little e-mail pal. That's cute. Yeah,
it's funny when I re-read the e-mail about the not being funny as me
comment. I feel like such a loser for being mean especially with all the
things going on right now. I actually have one really good friend that I
broke down and told about our little "internet encounter" and I was telling
her about the "not as funny as me" comment and she was cracking up saying
that I have told her that many times in not so many words. My life is a
Seinfeld episode. She reminded me of an incident when energy guy met some of
my friends from work and every time he started to control the conversation,
I would talk over him because I was embarrassed of what he might say. I'm
seriously going to he@@. How mean am I? Anyway, we share the same viewpoint
on relationships. I KNOW I get pickier as I get older. Not only do you know
more about what you want, you know a hell of a lot more about what you don't
want and what you are and are not able to tolerate. I'm so different than I
was at 20. It's hilarious how much you put up with when your really young.
Relationships should be easy. ESPECIALLY in the first year. That's why I
know I need to do something about my situation soon. We have way too many
issues for 3 and a half months. Are you kidding me?!

Family. One brother (26) and goes to U of H. Not graduate school. He's still
working on a bachelor degree. He's a whole conversation in itself. I love
him to death but he still has so much growing up to do. He acts like he's 16
instead of 26. Mom and Dad still live down in Lake Jackson. Dad's remarried
and Mom just got her second divorce. Ask me why I'm scared of being in bad
relationships? Ha. The grandparents of whom I'm incredible close to live in
LJ as well. I usually make it down there every other Sunday as there health
is fading and it breaks my heart. They are touch old birds though. Cute as
hell and have been married 65 years. I know!! Amazing.

Well, let's see. Oh, no way you are funnier than me. :) We'll see. I will
write your cell down. I'm kind of panicking because I cant find my cell
phone this morning. Not good considering I have every number imaginable
programed in there. Not too smart. I think I may have left it at the nail
shop yesterday. I call it. It rings but not in my place or car. Not good.

Hey, have a good day and I'll talk with you soon. I'll send you some more
pictures. Some are pretty old. I had really short hair last year but I was
still cute. Kidding. A little.

Later,

d
