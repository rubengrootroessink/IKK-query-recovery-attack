I don't remember him but it is my understanding nobody has been heard from that worked in the Carr office in the wtc.

Do you remember Jim Paul from Carr?  He kept calling me about setting up a margin line for you to trade on and eventually we decided that it was not a good idea for Enron.  He visited me in Houston with a large team of people on the subject.  I called Credit Agricole (owner of Carr) in Houston and sadly it is feared that he did not make it out from the World Trade Center.
