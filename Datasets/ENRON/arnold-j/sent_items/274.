> okay, seriously.  you make good points on the intervention front.  however, i
do believe that the euro has suffered from public neglect from the ecb.  that
said, i'm unsure what form an intervention would take.

money flow. i agree that there has been good money flow into us from Japan,
Japan (through Europe), and Europe.  usd is a good safe haven, because if we
have troubles US should outperform, and the EU is untested.  this is why i am
uninterested in shorting the dollar.

the euro has also suffered from a japanese overhang.  when the euro was first
released, japanese bot up the euro with the expectation that other countries
would convert some of their reserves into the euro.  this has not been the case
and japan has been puking out their position.  however, there is a belief that
the selling is over.  (though, i'm not sure when this played out, or how to
check this story.  haven't found measure for money flow.  oh, bloomberg, how i
miss thee.)

so, i guess i still like it.  but who knows, i'm probably the mullet retail
investor that gets run over.  the currency market is very efficient.
