Only took me 3 weeks to respond.  That's pretty good for me.  I think things started collapsing the day I got your original email.  Obviously not an opportune time to come take the tour right now.  Not so impressive when the building is 80% empty.  If/when we get the operation started again, I'll bring you up for a tour.

John-
Was lovely meeting  you this weekend. Sorry I was...less then effusive by Sullivan's. It wasn't  the company -- I assure you.
 
And what about this  white elepha...trading floor? I want to get it while it  lasts.
 
look forward to  it
 
-Kelly
