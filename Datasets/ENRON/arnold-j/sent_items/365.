John,

I'm trying to put together the proposal for the exchange.  Who should I work with to nail down the Specialist structure.  We can handle the technical structure.  Attached is the draft proposal that I put together to begin developing a term sheet.  The Specialist requirements and incentives were my initial thoughts.
