wrong assumption--he intends to come out as a big bull at this year's october conference --sees production treadmill scenario again--expects tightness to rear its head in h2-02. they have reduced their dwgom numbers in 03-05. he is still bearish this year thats it--he thinks time to get long is at 2.00$-----
