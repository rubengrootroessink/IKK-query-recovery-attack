Sounds good.  I have cash.  I work at the old Enron building.  Just give me a call when you're close and I'll meet you on the street right in front of the building.

I get off work at 3:00 so I could bring them by your office at say 3:30 if
you could meet me at the ground floor (I'm assuming you work at one of the
Enron buildings).  I'm new to this whole Ebay thing so I'm not sure what all
the payment options are, but I'm thinking the easiest would be cash, but if
you want to put it on credit card through Billpoint on Ebay that is fine
also.

Good luck on catching the million dollar ball.

Hello:
Wondering if we can meet to pick up the tix.  I work and live in
downtown.  Please advise or call me at 713-557-3330.
