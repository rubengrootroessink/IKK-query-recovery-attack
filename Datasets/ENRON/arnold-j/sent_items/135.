seeing very little buying from end users.  some longer term selling from producers.  have had one guy who sold about 300 month cal 2,3,4.  just gets soaked up in the market though.  some buying is from more generation guys.  duke bot 10,000+ lots of cal 7-13 last week.  also think some guys buying cal 3 so they can sell more in the front.  el paso sold delta equivalent of probably 12-15 a day yesterday.  got soaked right up.  mar/apr way overvalued but so hard to bring in.   just a function of cal 2.  cal 2 been weak as seen a lot of m/m q/q v/v spreads recently, guys trying to buy the front.  hard to believe m/m is flat.  just goes to show how overpriced cal 2 is in my mind...

totlly agree on expiration-reason why im not bullsprd the june july . i
covered a little flat px on june est erday but satying short oct delta. sold
some mar/apr as well thinking the curve rolls down. this distillate mkt
getting way too hyped i think as well. ive been long but going a little
short now shudnt be relevant to the natgas fundamentals until 1st q(bullish
then natgas but too late think we'll be full) .
   we not seeing much on the customer side. you? end users getting scared
and longer than normal/stoped buying.hearing all the pipelines still
packed.just wondering if/when the winter strip gets hit-will make mar/apr
come into line.also buying jan/feb vs mar/apr decent condor i think

i think i've got yahoo somewhere on my computer.  i'll try to find it.
expecting 110 today.  still think we're not at fundamental equilibrium but
scared that, as much as i hate technicals, the wave 3 is over and we can do
some serious chop here.  if we didnt have expiry in 4 days i'd be worried
about a short covering rally.  however, i think the market is going to have
a hard time placing the baseload gas this month.  the storage guys are all
above their targets right now and expect them to back off relative to last
month.
