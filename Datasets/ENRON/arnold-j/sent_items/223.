John -

I realize you don't have "fresh money" now, but if you happen to come across
fresh money in the next month, I want you to be aware of a new crossover
fund.  The fund seeks to invest up to 50% (may exceed 50% under certain
circumstances) of the portfolio into late-stage venture capital companies
through relationships that Putnam and Thomas H. Lee Partners (great name in
private equity) have with various participants in the capital markets.  The
remainder of the fund will be in small- and mid-sized publicly traded
companies managed by Putnam's Specialty Growth team.

Let me know if you're interested, and I'll send a kit over.  So far, nice
trade on the ENE GJs.
