John,
Thank you very much for your time Wednesday afternoon ,we appreciate it. Your feedback is very important to us as we continue to define the end product. As discussed we too only see the value in the product  if we have mutiple "customers" participating and as I told you we have had many hedge funds and CTA's request a similar service. Over the next 2/3 weeks we will be presenting to a number of these interested parties and would be happy to keep you updated on progress. I anticipate more aggressive "marketing" of the product from September onwards as we are still stuck in the summer vacation schedule and it is making serious "roadshowing" difficult.
Again thank you for your time and please dont hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have or any further feedback you may want to provide (either to Deutsche or Campbell ).
Regards,
Kevin
