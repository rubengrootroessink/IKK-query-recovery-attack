I'm sure he'll come down whenever we ask.  Should I tell him to get his butt down here and show us the love?

that was pretty funny. Do not still have the double date thing.

I need a favor in return for interviewing your boys.  Remember Mark Findsen.  He's looking to get back into the business, possibly from the trading side.  I actually think he might make a better orig guy.  He has been in the crude and products markets for 10+ years.  Has no experiece in trading energy but has been day trading equities for past year.  He asked if he could get a round of interviews at Enron.  Could you set up a round for him?
