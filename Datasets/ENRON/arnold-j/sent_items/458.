maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter.  we'll worry about that problem next september.  
novy expiry can go anywhere.  Too early to say.   Probably around $2 though as I cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the US is a net injector the first 1-2 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing.

so where does this leave you with rearg to nov expiry----higher than where we are today? dec, jan too? sub 2 or above 2
also if you dont take down the curve and demand stays anemic....where does all the gas go?

i think cash gets much stronger over the coming weeks relative to nov.  first inclination when cash comes up is that futures go up.  however, there is an 80 cent spread between cash and december.  cash can easily go up without dec moving.
