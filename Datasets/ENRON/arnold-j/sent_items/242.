Here is my analysis of my guys:
Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he ha=
s run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the y=
ear and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you=
 get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sol=
d 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed b=
y gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july =
have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first =
half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations=
.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little =
too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money =
in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curv=
e shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicap=
ped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Re=
quired to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griff=
ith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often =
has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs =
to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' e=
lses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot f=
unction without one of us on the desk. =20
Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.
