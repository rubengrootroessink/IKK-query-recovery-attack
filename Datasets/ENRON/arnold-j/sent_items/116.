John -- 

I don't think we've met, but I'm Vance Meyer, a media relations director for Enron.  Tomorrow, Jeff Skilling and some other key players are interviewing for a story on eCommerce with Vijay Vaitheeswaran, a reporter with the Economist.  Vijay this morning asked if you would be available as well.  I can send you more detail once I have your availability.  Understanding your limited time during trading hours, do you have a late afternoon availability?  If not, would you rather do it in the late morning?

If you can and will do the interview, please let me know.

Thanks

Vance Meyer
