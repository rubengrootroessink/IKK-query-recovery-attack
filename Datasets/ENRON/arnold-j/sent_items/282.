I'm still at work and very hungry-that is what is up with me.  what is up with you?
 
We have been doing 10k (i think) for them to sign the retention agreement.  We sh/d be consistent.  I will verify number w/Karen Buckley and have legal produce the doc.  When are you thinking of having him move over?

just kidding.  we're bringing him onto the desk in an analytical role assuming his reviews are a-okay.  can you get me a 3 month evergreen doc with his name on it for if we do hire him.  the question was whether to bring him into the trading track.  we're gonna bring him on and if he does well, just merge him into it.
