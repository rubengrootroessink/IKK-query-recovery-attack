Hi John,

I assumed you knew the details but just realized from talking to Jay that you probably were not aware that Greg Whalley wanted us to put this on hold for North America until some FERC and CFTC issues were resolved. John Lavorato however wanted to go ahead and have an internal only version and we needed an extra week to program the internal only restricted version. Given that we have an intenal only version we don't need to conduct the test we had spoken about before. Let me know if you need further information. Thanks.

Savita

Can I assume we are ready to test the limit orders?
