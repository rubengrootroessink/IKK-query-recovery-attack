Have you had the chance to speak to Louise about individuals trading on EOL?

I think Dutch Quigley spoke to you about an individual who is trying to get set up with EOL for his personal account.  The person is Tony Annunziata from the Smith Barney AAA fund.  He meets the suitability tests as far as net worth and knowledgable investor.  He is also willing to post via LC or wire.  I gave him your number.  I would appreciate if you could expedite his credit application.

Thanks,
John
