Margaret Allen would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss the Corp. Marketing Initiative on Wednesday, July 25.  We have an outside agency coming in to do an audit and your opinions are extremely important in the success of this project.  The meeting will last approximately 30 minutes.  If you see where you can be in attendance, please forward me the time of your choice between 9am and 3pm.  We will also be sending you a brief via email that is going to cover topics of the discussion.  Your participation is greatly appreciated.  Thank you
