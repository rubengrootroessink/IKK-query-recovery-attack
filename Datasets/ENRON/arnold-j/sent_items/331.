hard to say odds on a revision.  don't think aga would make a revision, but an individual stg field could.  another option is that a stg field that realizes they fucked up just fades the number over the next several weeks such that each number going forward is bigger than expected.

the other thing in the back of my mind-if there is a revision of 20 bcf or
more and an injection of 80 ish-i think they kill this thing. what you think
are the odds of a revision? 10-15% i say. not sure when tho

With skilling gone I move up one spot...from 147th to 146th.

This market sucks!!  Right back where we were before the # last week.  I
have so little interest right now.  just glad i held onto the short
straddle position.  wish i had something intelligent to say but i don't.
