Hey John:
 
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you,  I was out of the office last week.  This is someone that I used to work for, who was trying to get me to work for her again.  I am still here,  and intend on staying here.  Your friend has a good reading of the situation,  exageration has always been this woman's strong suit.

Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now??  And are you

calling me wacky??  =)

Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with

Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill.  I got a

random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund

here in Boston.  She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a

hold of me to help her start her hedge fund.  She finally got my number from

someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not

sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a

great opportunity it would be to work with her and her "team."

The only person on her "team" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said

that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and

he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently

sold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed

a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said

that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund.

Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot,

I was wondering if it was true.  I would never leave this opportunity, even

if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break

into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.

Does it sound like the same guy?
