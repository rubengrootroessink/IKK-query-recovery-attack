John,

Would you be willing to interview with Kathy for Enron's ENSDE magazine?  She has been wanting you to interview with her since the end of last year.  Let me know.

Hi Ina!

Are you still working with John Arnold?  If so, I wondered if his schedule had calmed down enough that he would agree to be interviewed for the next ENSIDE. I just need about 30 minutes.

Please ask him and let me know!

Thanks,
