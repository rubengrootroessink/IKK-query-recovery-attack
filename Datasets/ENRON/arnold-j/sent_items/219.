Kevin,
I'm following up with you on e-mail  below I sent you, Craig Breslau,Wade  Hicks,Kevin Presto,Joe Gold,Don Schroeder,Phil Clifford, and  Alan Engbergto determine  who amongst you would be best  suited for a discussion on below topic.
We are actively engaged with VP-leveland Director-levelexecutives of Energy and Commodities Trading at companies such as DukeEnergy, ReliantEnergy, Williams Energy,  Entergy/Koch, Cargill,  and others.
Our team is in Houston 3 days a week. We could either  arrange a face-2-face or a conference call to  discuss?
I  look forward to your reply.
Thanks,
Enzo

 Kevin, 
 
ReliantEnergy, DukeEnergy, Entergy-Kochand many othertrading  firms claim to miss outon 75-80% of the arbitrage trading opportunities. We're areextensivelyworking with them tohelp spot those  lucrative spreads.
iSpheres provides  enabling software for deploying meta applications around composite event  management. We are working to enableevent management for traders. Enabling  traders to define composite events around online marketplaces,  weather, generation, transmission, and other information. The  issue weaddressis enabling traders to synthesize all the  information and detect what is actionable. Huge opportunity and payback.  
I'd loveto discussour capabilities,understand what problems types you are  working on, and where we might be of value.I'dlike  to arrange a 30 minute  introductory conference callwith you and  other appropriate folks at Enron.
I have attached an Energy Use Case.
Thanks,
