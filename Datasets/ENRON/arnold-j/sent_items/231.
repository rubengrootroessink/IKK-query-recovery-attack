just calling to see if you have anything ingenious to say about this market.  i've covered most of the shorts starting 3.40 all the way down.  agree market probably not at equilibrium just dont really want to press it right now.  the easy money's been made.  want to have a few bullets just in case hot weather or storm takes this thing up to $3.50.  selling some upside calls just in case that never happens i'll still make money.  been an incredible run so far.  have half a mind to pack things up and go on vacation for the rest of year.  however, i'm just doing it for a week and a half starting tomorrow.  will talk to you when i get back and we'll figure out what to do then.

on  vacation my man. but will be on cell phone and email all week. work is  212-836-5030
cell-917-374-6760(if i dont pick up lv a message).  still short jsut wondering how much bouncing around i have to take until we get  to 2.50 or less. certainly the r/r changing a little as we fall but upside like  to be more limited as shorts cover and inventories build. 
   hows ogoing there? whats on your mind.  feel free to call cell this week
