We just finished doing the xpit that they asked for.  They have agreed to send the money immediately after that was done.  We should be getting the money very soon.  Hold off on the letter right now.

Legal drafted a letter demanding that EDF return the $25 million they withheld this morning.  I want to send it to EDF to preserve our rights under the customer agreement and to discourage them from this behaviour in the future.  

Did you ever hear back whether EDF was going to send this to you if you moved the short 1660 May 2002 futures positions?  If you have already resolved the matter and gotten EDF to agree to return the money, I might hold off on sending this.  Sarah
