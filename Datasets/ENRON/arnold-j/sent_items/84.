John, I have just arrived in Houston, and will be running the LNG Trading & Shipping business. I worked for Louise for many years, and took over the European Gas business from her when she came over here a few years ago. I'd like to meet you and discuss a few issues. Do you have any time over the next few days? 

Thanks,
Jonathan
