The reason I asked is, this sounds bad, but right now the cheaper you are the easier time I'll have finding you a job.

John,

Thanks for the note back.  My title is Specialist so I am the little man on the trading floor, but since I have been here I have been kicking ass.  I enjoy trading and really didn't get the chance to dig into it deep.  Anyway, take care and have a Happy Holiday.
