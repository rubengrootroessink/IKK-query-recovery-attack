Mark:
I know you must be very busy right now.  I do have a important favor to ask.  I am worried about the reaction should the names and numbers of the trading retention pool be made public.  If you get notice of if and when that is to happen, advanced warning would be very helpful.  If I cannot be reached at the office, my cell phone number is 713-557-3330.  
Thanks,
John
