John,

We finally heard from Bo.  Looks like we may be getting together soon to discuss our proposal.  I would like to get back together with you concerning the specialist requirements and incentives when you can.  I've attached my draft for you to look at.

I also received a call from Mark B. Fisher.  Apparently Mark caught wind that Bo talked to us.  Mark is excited about the opportunity of the locals getting access to EnronOnline numbers.  Mark wants to clear the local trades on EnronOnline and enymex.

Let me know how you want to proceed. Thanks

Bob

Bo,

I hope all is well for you, your family, friends and associates. 

I'm sure you and your team are working 24 hours a day to keep the
exchange open.  We would like to share some ideas with you when you have
some time.  Please give me a call.
