Because of the tragedy in New York, all accounts are being handled out of
Chicago.
Please direct any questions to Mike Heffner, Rob Vujtech and I here in
Chicago at 312-762-1010 or 800-326-5493. We are attempting to contact every
customer today.
Any one who receives this email and dealt with our New York office, I will
need your telephone numbers.
Thank you for your help in this matter.
Scott
