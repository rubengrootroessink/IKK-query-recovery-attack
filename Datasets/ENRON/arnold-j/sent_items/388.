I apologize for the mass email, but I thought this was a simple, yet
powerful idea... especially as the opening bell on Wall Street just rang.

I pray that each of you are safe and sound.  Please note my contact info
below, especially if we haven't kept in touch as well as we should.  I'm
sure we're all feeling the need to connect with old friends...

Take care of yourselves,
Heather

We CAN help America TODAY

No doubt you have heard dire predictions about the financial devastation
that will occur when the US stock market re-opens. This will be a second
devastating attack on America if we allow it to happen.

We DON'T have to allow it to happen. Here's what YOU can do to help
prevent
it...

When the markets re-open, in a show of support and solidarity, BUY at
least one share of stock in a U.S. company.

Open your minds to imagine what a SLAP in the face of terrorism it would
be if the American  markets actually RISE instead of PLUNGE when they
re-open!

Can you think of a STRONGER message we could send to those who would
seek to destroy our way of life?

This e-mail is sponsored by noone, so if you also have a
suggestion for people without stock accounts, please add that information
before you forward this e-mail.

If we all participate in a massive stock selloff, then we are BOWING
to terrorism. We do NOT have to do that. We have a choice.

People by the hundreds of thousands are lining up to donate one pint
of blood. Think of the effect  we can have if we line up in the same way
to contribute to the American economy!

For very little money you can DO something to show would-be terrorists
that they will NOT win.

                         YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

Take part in this revolution and forward this e-mail to everyone on your
mailing list. We can reverse the tide of the finanical carnage throughout
the world just by doing that.

Do you want to show support for America? Then show support for American
companies.

WHEN THE US MARKETS RE-OPEN, BUY AT LEAST ONE SHARE OF STOCK IN A U.S
COMPANY.

Imagine the headlines we will read when we all make this happen...

"US Financial Victory -- Of the People, By the People, and For the
People."
