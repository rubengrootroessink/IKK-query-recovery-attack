> Nuclear power production is about to reach a peak and then drop off
> dramatically through the course of 2002.  Record levels of nuclear power
> production have offset the need for gas-fired electric production to the
> tune of an estimated 1.5 to 2.5 bcf/d over the past six months and should
> peak at about 3.5 bcf/d late this fall.  However, nuclear power fleet
> utilization is expected to drop to under 91% heading into summer 2002,
> down from a historic high of nearly 97% this past summer. What does this
> mean to gas demand for the balance of 2002? Based on our work, we see the
> Y-O-Y return of between 1.0 to 1.5 bcf/day of natural gas demand when
> nuclear production hits the production cliff next spring.  While we have
> generally been cautious short term on gas prices the past few months, we
> have begun to identify or fill in some portion of the gas demand quotient
> for next summer. Unlike this summer, next year is shaping up to be a far
> more bullish year for gas, based on the need for gas-fired electric
> production to pick up the slack.
