Open Presentation
Monday, October 2nd - 6:00 PM
Alumni Hall, room 203

Please meet in the lobby of the hotel at 5:15 PM or at the room by 5:30 PM so 
we can set up and finalize the game plan.
After the presentation we are going to have a dinner for targeted candidates 
and also a reception for the people who came to the presentation.  You will 
be informed about where you need to participate on Monday; for now just keep 
the time open.
