Hey:
So I was thinking about your NY problem...I might have an answer.  The site 
http://www.bestfares.com/internet_charts/hotel_internet.htm
lists cheap hotel specials.  The problem is they won't list them until the 
Wednesday before the weekend.  Check it out though.  They have some 
reasonable deals.
John
