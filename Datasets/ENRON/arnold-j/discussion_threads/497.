Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner
