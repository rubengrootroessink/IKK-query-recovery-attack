Dear  Amazon Customer, 

What's  an  Amazoniversary?  Three years ago this month, you placed your very 
first order (using this  e-mail address) with Amazon.com. To remind you how 
much there is to  experience here, we're offering you free shipping (up to 
$10) on your next  order of $50 or  more.  

So  celebrate any way you like: with a bestselling  book,  a new  DVD  
release, or a  CD  player--it's up to you. But be sure to take advantage of 
this exclusive  free shipping offer before May 31. (See details below.)

We look  forward to all your Amazoniversaries to  come!   

  Sincerely,

David  Risher 
Senior VP and Amazon Customer of Five Years (and Counting)
