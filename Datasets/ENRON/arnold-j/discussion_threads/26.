Dave:
A couple of issues:

1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit 
exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, 
Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they 
blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 
minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need 
the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.

2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message 
describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the 
counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same 
error message
