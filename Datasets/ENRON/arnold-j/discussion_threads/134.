Subject: Executive Reports Viewer: NEW LOCATION  




As of midnight, Saturday, October 7th, the Executive Reports Viewer will no 
longer be accessible at its current location, due to IT modifications.  The 
system has been redesigned to allow access via Internet Explorer (you cannot 
use Netscape).  The new location is http://ersys.corp.enron.com. 
This change will ONLY affect the viewing of the reports; it will NOT impact 
the publishing of the reports.

A shortcut icon can be created by dragging the Internet Explorer Logo 
(located in the address field next to the URL) to the desktop.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call Kristin Walsh at 
3-9510 or myself at 3-9307.

Thank you for your understanding,
Christa Winfrey
