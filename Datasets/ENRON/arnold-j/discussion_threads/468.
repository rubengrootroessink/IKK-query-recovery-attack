John, 
Attached is a Bloomberg contract for Scott Neal, it will have to be executed 
by your department as our legal department cant sign off under this name.
I am still waiting for Bloomberg to send the paperwork to transfer yours.  

If you would like for these contracts to be sent to someone else in the 
future please let me know.

Thanks,
Julie
