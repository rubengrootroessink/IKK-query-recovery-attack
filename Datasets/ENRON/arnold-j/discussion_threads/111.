John:   John Nowlan, Dave Botchlett, Jim Goughray and several others met with 
Mario last week.  They were all favorably impressed.   Jeff Shankman had 
asked to meet with him, and their appointment is scheduled for Thursday, 
9/28, at 1:30 pm.   Jeff had also asked that you spend some time with him so 
that a decision could be made as to whether or not to make him an offer.    
Would you have some time available on Thursday afternoon to see Mario?

Thanks,
Molly
