John:
?
I'm not really sure what happened between us.? I was  under the impression 
after my visit to Houston that we were about to enter into  a trial agreement 
for my advisory work.? Somehow,?this never  occurred.? Did I say or do 
something wrong to screw this  up???
?
I don't know if you've blown this whole thing off, but I still  hope you are 
interested in trying?to create an arrangement.? As a  courtesy, here is my 
report from this past weekend.? If you are no longer  interested in my work, 
please tell me so.??Best wishes,
?
