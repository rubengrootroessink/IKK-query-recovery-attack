Hello,
Bill Perkins of Small Ventures USA is having a party this Saturday at the 
Mercantile bar downtown.  He has rented out the place, has a band, open 
bar...  usually pretty fun.  He asked me to give both of you an invite in 
appreciation of the work you've done for him.   If you have interest, ccmail 
me with whether you need one or two invites each.
John
