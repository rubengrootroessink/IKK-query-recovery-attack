We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference.  We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past.  
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in.  We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
for your participation.
