To "Outstanding" Analysts and Associates:
I  am writing to inform of a possible opening on the natural gas derivatives 
trading desk.  It is an opportunity to work on one of the most profitable and 
demanding groups within Enron, as well as one of the largest financial 
commodity trading desks worldwide.  I envision the role as performing 
analysis initially, to grasp an understanding of gas fundamentals and become 
more familiar with the trading environment, and leading to a junior trading 
role.  Upside potential is limitless for the right person.

Candidates for the role need to possess the following qualities:
1. Have been ranked as outstanding on previous yearend reviews.
2. Excellent math and quantitative skills.  Candidates should have 700+ math 
SAT and/or 700+ GMAT
3. Basic understanding of economics including pricing differences under 
monopolistic and competitive market scenarios.
4. Ability to work under intense pressure.  

If you are interested please email with interest and attach a resume.  Do not 
call.

John Arnold
Vice President of Gas Derivatives Trading
