Tom:
My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an 
extra seat on the jet to Tampa. 

My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New 
York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas 
derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we 
could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights 
would get us back in time.  

Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my 
contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now 
hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if 
your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me 
if the plane were leaving after the game.  

Please advise,
John
