John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

Alan:
I received your email.  I'll make sure it goes through the proper channels.
It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron
is such a big place, it will help focus the resume to the right people.
