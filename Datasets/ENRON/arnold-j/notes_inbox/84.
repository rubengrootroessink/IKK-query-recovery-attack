Arnold,

John Grass and myself would be happy to update you on the status of Enron's 
Producer One deals.  In addition to the three deals listed below, we have a 
substantial "pipeline" of transactions that are being evaluated and are in 
different stages.  Besides John Grass, our distribution channels for producer 
ecommerce deals are driven by Producer Services (Gary Bryan, Jill Zivley, 
Linda Roberts and Jennifer Martinez), Nelson Ferries, Production Offshore as 
well as ECR.  Enron has just recently completed a nine city road show 
targeting the producer community.  

John Grass is also managing the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha
