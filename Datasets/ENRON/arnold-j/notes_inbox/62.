thank you for the beautiful flowers!? They arrived late Friday and Vic 
emptied the refrigerator and stored them in there.? There were very fresh 
this morning.? The aroma is so strong that you smell them upon just entering 
my office.? It's those lilies that they used.? It really is a very pretty 
arrangement.? Thank you so much.

Uncle Elmer & Rosa are not coming this week as they have an illness in the 
family.? 

I am busy emptying the kitchen...they start Wed. morning.

See you Saturday!? Love, Your Mom
