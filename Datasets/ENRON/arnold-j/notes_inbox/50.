 Hi,


  Following the e-mail you have received yesterday concerning
the new WTI bullet swap contracts, we would like to summarize what we have
done on the ICE system yesterday evening:

  -Deleted WTI monthly time spreads
  -Deleted WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with
legging)
  -Deleted 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with
legging)

  -Added WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with NO
legging)
  -Added 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with NO
legging)

 Unfortunately the WTI/Brent and the 1% NYH Fuel Oil Crack contracts
(with the legging functionality) have been removed from your portfolios. You
will need to add  the first four nearby months' contracts to your
portfolios by going to Admin / Manage Portfolios / Edit your portfolio....

 Please do not hesitate to contact us is you have any question:
