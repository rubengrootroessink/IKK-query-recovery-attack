Hope you did ok today. As I said yesterday, the poor close  Monday should 
lead to additional market weakness, which we saw  today.

know if you have the mailing address, so here it  is:

Speak to you soon.? I'll call when I have?the next  decent set-up on my work 
for natural.? Feel free to buzz me  anytime.
