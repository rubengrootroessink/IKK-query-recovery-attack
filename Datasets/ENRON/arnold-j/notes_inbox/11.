I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you 
to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came.  If not, 
in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the 
new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here.

I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David 
Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable.  I'll fax 
through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool.

Thanks for all you help always,
Caroline
