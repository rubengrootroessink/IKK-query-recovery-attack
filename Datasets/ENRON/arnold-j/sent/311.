I think you're cheating trying to get a fixed amount.... I'll give $1 per 
pin.  
Good luck,
John

John,
Please a flat amount.  Don't hold me to pins.  Everyone is giving a flat 
amount.  I'm NOT a bowler.

Enron/MDA 
Beach Bowl 2000
To Benefit ALS Research

I'm bowling to help "strike out" ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).  If you have not 
sponsored someone else, I would very much like for you to sponsor me.  The 
event takes place on July 29.  I will need all donations by July 26.

Any donation is greatly appreciated and matched by Enron.

Many Thanks,

Liz
