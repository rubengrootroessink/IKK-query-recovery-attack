I'm actually trying to go through all my email from the week.  What a pain in 
the ass.  As soon as I finish one, another appears in my inbox.  So how's 
life at ucla?

I think Yelena put a hit out on me all the way from Chicago
for sending those pictures!  I had no idea they would open
right away--they were supposed to be attachments.  Oops.  I
thought they were quite cute.

How are ya?  And what are you doing at work--I thought you
gas guys all left at 3!
