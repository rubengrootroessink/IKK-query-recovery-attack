Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So 
around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's 
conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as 
large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front 
frequently.

This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They 
concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking 
for liquidity and want to know:

1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like?
2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for 
the front month on swaps and options?
3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone?

They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this
Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded.

I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these 
inquiries.

Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and 
JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the 
trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit 
exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.

Thanks,
CA
