Yeah yeah I know....

The roll out for phase II EOL is (for now) 8/28/00. Options are qeued next 
after that. Unfortu ately I wish I could give you a hard date, but it is out 
of my hands and in Jay Webb's shop. I am pushing as hard as I can but Louise 
has set phase II as the priority. I know this sounds like a lame excuse, but 
I don't know what else to say. The application is built, it just needs to be 
tested. Please don't get too frustrated and keep the pressure up on us.

Andy
