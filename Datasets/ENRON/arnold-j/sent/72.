Hum, as much as I would love to be insulted by you for several hours straight 
tomorrow night, I have plans...actually, it's an Enron thing. A bunch of 
people are going to the Continental Club to hear the El Orbits, which happens 
to be my favorite band.  You should come. 

What are your plans tonight, since I'm being nosey?!  

Trade them up Johnny, Margarita
