Subject: Adam Resources

I talked to Jay Surles and Kenny Policano at Adams Resources and concerning 
CATDADDY and POWERTRADE.  I informed Jay that it was in violation of their 
agreement to "sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or 
indirectly,any portion of the content of the Website to any third party."   
They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New 
England.  They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for 
a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the 
company.  After all the bull they agreed to have them shut down and they 
would refrain from doing it again.
