And since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas=

While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a=

cities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20
Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20

Hoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=

About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=

Now, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with=

ENRON PROVIDES TRADING SERVICES TO MANX ELECTRICITY UNDER NETA
2001-03-08 08:43 (New York)


     (The following is a reformatted version of a press release issued
by Enron and received via electronic mail. The release was not confirmed
by the sender.)

ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT

     London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA). Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.
     The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world.
     "The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us
under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and
we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this" said Mike
Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.
     "Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal."
     Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron,
commented: "This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well
into Enron's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements."

Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent, WSJ Says
2001-03-08 06:47 (New York)


     Kansas City, March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The growth of energy
trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
     Weather affects commodities trading and determines
electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and
UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
$60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
     Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
     Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.
