he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.  so 
many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it breaks 
that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with 
entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of people would be 
unemployed.
