Hi:
The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much 
pressure...what happens if we screw up?

I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of 
characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it?
John

Hey John,

Did you check out the new spots?!!!  They are posted on the Intranet 
(home.enron.com).  Let me know what you think!  Hope all is well down there 
on the 'big money making' floor.

Have a good one, Margaret
