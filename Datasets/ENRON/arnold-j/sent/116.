Hey Buster John,

Despite the X's you received last night for your ill behavior, I wanted to 
thank you for dinner because I had a great time.  Although, I do take 
personal offense to being flipped off at least 5 times in the course of 
dinner. Watch your manners when your with a lady!

I hope you have a great Friday and today is one of your top 5 too!

MSA
