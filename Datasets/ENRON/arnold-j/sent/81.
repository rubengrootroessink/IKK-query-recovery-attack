Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time.  Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday.  We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

Andy:
I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed 
the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when 
EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would 
be appreciated.
John
