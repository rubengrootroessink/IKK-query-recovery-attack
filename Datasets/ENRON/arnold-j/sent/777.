Well, never got to NY to enjoy New Years and the blizzard.? However, by 
staying in Dallas, did experience a white New Year's eve.? Never made it to 
Addison Cafe for New Year's eve dinner (back up plans), roads were just too 
bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. 

Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in 
Sidney, now was it) and brought in the new year with a bang!

Have a happy, healthy and much more prosperous 2001!? I wish only the best 
for you.? Love you much, your Mom
