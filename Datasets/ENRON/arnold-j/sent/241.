"You can't turn away for a minute or you get picked  off."? Damn!!? I'm 
minding my own business sitting on the dooker  reading Time, and sure enough 
i get picked off!? Sheeeeeeeeeet.?  Friggin celebrities.? Can I have your 
autograph?? :)?

Nice work, dood.

Fellas, I believe the new job is almost here--i was  told yesterday that I 
got the job and am just waiting for the phone offer  (supposed to happen this 
afternoon).? If it comes through, I'll be covering  the internet--should be 
pretty solid.? Who knows, if EnronOnline gets spun  off (obv, not gonna 
happen) I might even get to cover it...? what a  mock!? Anyway, thought I'd 
drop you two a line.? Hope things are going  well...
?
can't wait for football...? lemme know when  you boys come back out here...
