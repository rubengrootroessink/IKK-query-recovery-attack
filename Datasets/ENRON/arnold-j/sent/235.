Rahil:
I have never commented favorably nor unfavorably about Kase's newsletter.   I 
think publishing independent market evaluations could be beneficial.  The 
more interesting content that is published, the better.

Hey John,

We'd briefly spoken on the phone last week, but I haven't been able to come 
by and talk to you like I'd promised.  Louise had mentioned you did not like 
Cynthia Kase's newsletter and may not want us to put Cynthia's weekly 
summaries on EnronOnline.

Since Fred (Lagrasta) and his group think publishing her summaries on 
EnronOnline will attract more of the smaller customers, would you have any 
objection over us publishing the Kase newsletters.

Pls. let me know ASAP so we can proceed with this further.

Regds.,
Rahil
