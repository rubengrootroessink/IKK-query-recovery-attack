John - do you mind sharing your Fimat line with the crude traders?  Current 
usage is about $6 million.  Also Warren thought that he might be able to 
change the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.  This change 
would allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they have 
a good rate.)  Warren is going to call you about it.  Sarah
