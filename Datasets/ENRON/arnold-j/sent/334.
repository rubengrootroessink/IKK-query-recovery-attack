Sorry...I was on vacation last week and fell behind my email.   Anytime you 
want to talk is fine.  I'll be around today if it works for you.

Subject: options and other stuff

john,
I'd like the chance to review some assumptions re: options manager ( yes, we 
are still on schedule) with you as well as discuss some other issues related 
to putting Enron's prices on other platforms. some time on monday would work 
best for me. Let me know.
andy
