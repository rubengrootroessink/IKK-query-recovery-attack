Dear  John,

First of all, congratulations. You have made headlines in Brazil.
Whenever you come to our country, let me know, so I can provide you with
assitance.

When convenient, please let me know Jeff Shenkman's(Enron Global Markets)
email, so I can get in contact.

All the best,

Cacio Carvalho

Dear Jeff,
After reading a series of reports on Enron Global Markets,  I decided to get
in contact.
I live in Brazil and had a chance to meet Jim Ballantine whom was(until
recently) heading Enron's operations in Brazil.
Currently, I work as an Strategic Planning Manager at Copergas, a Natural
Gas Distributor located in Northeast Brazil (partly owned by Enron).
Jim once mentioned that EOL intends to come to Brazil. According to the
press, Enron Global Markets will be responsable for expanding the EOL
platform worldwide.
I want you to know that my professional background includes IT, Government,
Marketing and Business Development. When Enron Global Markets decides to
expand into Brazil, let me know.  I will be more than happy to join such an
outstanding team.
My best  and a SUPER 2001,
Cacio Carvalho
