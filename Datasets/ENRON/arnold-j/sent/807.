Dutch requested a meeting with me today and I gave him the scoop on the 
promotion.  I will follow-up with him after our meeting the first week of 
Jan.  He was ok with everything.  let me know if you need anything else.

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Unfortunately, I cannot make that change for you.
