All,

Sorry for the lengthy thread.  A service request has been opened with 
Microsoft on the IE5 issues and her application.

Brian,

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Regards,

-jkc

John,

I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with 
IE 5.0.  Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5.  This is an extremely 
important program that all of the traders will be using.  If you need 
additional resources, I can arrange for this.  Just let me know what you 
need.  

These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version.

Thanks,
Brian
