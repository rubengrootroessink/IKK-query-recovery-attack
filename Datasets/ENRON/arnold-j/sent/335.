Steve:
Good hearing from you.  Hope all is going well.  I gave your name to Per 
Sekse in our New York office.  He deals with a couple hedge funds we 
currently do business with and has addressed some of the obstacles that we 
face with other counterparties.  He is on vacation this week but will call 
next week.  If you have any problems or concerns, feel free to call.  
John
