Glad to see you're having so much fun with this.  I've been here 5.5 years 
with nothing and then in one week I'm in Fortune and Time.  Pretty funny.  
Things are going well here .  The big E just chugging along, bringing the 
stock price with it.  Wish I could tell you everything new in my life, but I 
think I just did.   
Your long lost buddy,
John

Is this "the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives"?  If so, you
should write me back after you complete your "nine hours and $1 billion in
trades" today!!   Does this mean I have to start calling you "Mr. John"?!
It was great to see you're doing so well....
Your long lost buddy,
Heather
