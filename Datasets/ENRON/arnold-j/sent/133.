J. Arnold-

Hey - It's me!  Any luck with the tickets?????  Just curious if there any way 
I can get four tickets instead of two?  I know I'm asking alot but I really 
appreciate it.  You know how much I love the Counting Crows and last time 
they were in town someone was going to take me but the plans fell 
through..........Thanks!!!!!!!

Jennifer
