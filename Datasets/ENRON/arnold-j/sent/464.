Arnold,

I am trying to talk via MSN messenger service and it will not accept 
jarnold@enron.com or any other reasonable email path.  What is your official 
email path?  I am assuming that you are using Outlook.  I am here at work 
trying to close a deal.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout 
of the floor.  I will end up having spots on five and six.  Also,  Nelson 
Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the 
Wellhead/Ecommerce effort.  And yes, John will need room to grow. 

What did you think of the article?  

Mrha

Jean:
I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The 
area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, 
long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need 
to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf 
group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas 
trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and 
the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....
thanks for the article. 
john
