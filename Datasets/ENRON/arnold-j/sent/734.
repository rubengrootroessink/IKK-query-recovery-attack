John,

The guy from Nymex can not come until next week, Thursday  2/8/01 at 4:00.   
It will last at a minimum of three hours and a maximum of 4 hours (which is 
unlikely).
 There is nothing on your calendar for that day.  Will this day and time work 
for you?  Let me know and then I will send an email out to the desk to make 
arrangements to attend the meeting that day.

-Ina
