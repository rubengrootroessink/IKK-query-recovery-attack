i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to 
put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i 
had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it 
better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like 
to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the 
weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that 
could happen.

was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday?
