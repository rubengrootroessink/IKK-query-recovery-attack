I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,
John

Thanks for the inquiry.  I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up.  
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here.  He is very valuable to me and ENA.  Please let me 
know.  
Ed

Ed:
I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks.  As we discussed earlier, I 
don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, 
such as when I'm out of the office.  As such, I'd like to bring in John 
Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with 
your permission.  
John
