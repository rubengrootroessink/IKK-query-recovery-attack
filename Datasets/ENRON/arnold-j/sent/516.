I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in 
Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA 
certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in 
the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it 
may not be doable.  

Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few 
years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their 
own boat.

I will keep you posted -
