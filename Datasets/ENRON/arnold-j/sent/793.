Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

PS I am coming back on the 6th. Once I finish up the week, I am off to Berlin 
for New Year's Eve and then a little trip over to Prague.

PPS If there is any other info you need let me know. By Jan 15, I should have 
about 15 analysts and be able to devote some to special projects.
