As long as I own Enron stock, the desks are my colleagues.  Feel free to 
share the info with Hunter and Chris.

John-

My name is Clayton Vernon, and I am the Manager for Models and Forecasts for 
East Power Trading, reporting to Lloyd Will.

I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for 
EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product 
helpful for you.

In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively 
avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your 
colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are 
between Enron desks.

Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact?

Clayton Vernon
