Don't even think you're getting out of this with the "for a while" crap.  
Just for that you can add a star to the place we're going.

Hum, while it would be very interesting to see how you act on a date I think 
I'll have to pass.  My time could be spent in better ways (believe it or 
not!).  The El Orbits did play at Satellite Lounge alot so I'm sure that's 
where you've heard them or of them. 

Since I wouldn't want to play second fiddle, we'll have to postpone it for a 
while.  Have a good one, Margaret

Hum, as much as I would love to be insulted by you for several hours straight 
tomorrow night, I have plans...actually, it's an Enron thing. A bunch of 
people are going to the Continental Club to hear the El Orbits, which happens 
to be my favorite band.  You should come. 

What are your plans tonight, since I'm being nosey?!  

Trade them up Johnny, Margarita
