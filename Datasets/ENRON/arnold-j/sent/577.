There will be a corporate lounge for you to congregate in.  Does that sound 
good?  No problem on the thrity tickets.  I will hold them for you.  Let me 
know if you don't think yo uwill be needing all of them. I can also get you 
the formal invitations to send out if you would like.

On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
customers get lost in the crowd?
Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret
