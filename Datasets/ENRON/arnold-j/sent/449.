your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer 
biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among 
the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see 
straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now 
i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this 
level though.
