Dear Dr. Leerburger,

Thank you for your response.  As I wrote in my earlier note, I am seeking a career change into intelligence analysis. My work the last eleven years probably has a similar skill set - I basically process a great deal of information each day in order to arrive at decisions positioning a large commodity portfolio for my company.  As you may see from my resume and cover letter, I also have several years of military experience in the Navy's aviation and intelligence communities

Given the serious nature of this career change, I wish to speak to someone currently working in this field (I read your biography on the AMU website ).  My questions include:

 - Do you find the work to be rewarding?  What are the attractions and frustrations of the work?
 - Does my current background make me an attractive candidate for a mid-level position in the intelligence community?
 - If my background is currently lacking in some respects, would a graduate level program (I'm applying to both the DIA JMIC      program and Georgetown's Security Studies MA program) be a good choice?  How do these programs rate within the intelligence community?

If convenient, I would like to speak with you concerning these questions.  I thank you for any assistance you may provide.

Sincerely,



Lawrence May
