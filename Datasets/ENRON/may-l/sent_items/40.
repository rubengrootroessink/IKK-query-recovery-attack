Dear Dr. Lucas,

I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr. Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston, Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events of the last two weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate any time you may spare.

Sincerely,


Lawrence J. May
