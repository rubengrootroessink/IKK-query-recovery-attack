Dan,

I wanted to let you know that we are working on the problem that we are having with the straddle deals being booked into Tagg. I also wanted to bring to your attention that these deals tested correctly in Tagg Stage, so we are trying to sort out what is happening in Production.  I am working with Tagg IT to resolve the issue.  I will keep you posted.  Thanks TARA
