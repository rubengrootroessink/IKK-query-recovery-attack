Dear Dr. Lockwood,

I had discussed with you an extension for RC502 and I would like to propose finishing the course in January of 2002.   I am currently enrolled in RC520 and will finish this course as per the regular schedule.  The reason for my extension request is due to an unexpected increase in workload from my current job, my desire to focus on the Analytic methods course and my decision to apply to the DIA JMIC Graduate training program (I wish to spend a good deal of time time on the application).  Please let me know if this meets with your approval.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May
