me a time within that timeframe and I'll be here at 302 Stuart Hall, 2013 G

of Thursday Jan 24th and would like to know if you would be available for a
few minutes.  Also, you had mentioned you may be able to pass on my resume so
I am attaching a cover letter and resume (the cover letter better explains the
relevance my business and military experience to an intelligence position).
Ljmay1.doc is the cover letter and ljmay2.doc is the resume.  Thank you for
your consideration.
