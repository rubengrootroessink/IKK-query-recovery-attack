Tom,
Here are two more suggestions.  Mr. Berg represented CBS in a couple of
defamation claims but generally does plaintiff's work.  Mr. Franklin, I am
told, also has a very good reputation and recently obtained a five million
dollar verdict in a case.  Please let me know I can be of further
assistance.
