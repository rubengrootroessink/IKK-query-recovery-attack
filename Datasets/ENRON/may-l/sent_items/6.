Hi Larry!
 
How are you?  A little time has passed since I was last on the trading floor of what was Enron.  Hope you're hanging in there okay.  =)  I'd just been enjoying the holidays and the time off up until last week when I started really hitting the job hunt.  I talked to you about a month ago at the Front Porch about a publishing contact you had in New York and was wondering if you would pass that information along?  And if you know of anyone who's looking for analyst help, I hope you will keep me in mind and pass my name along.
Thanks so much, Larry.  My best to you and your family for the New Year.
 
Regards,
