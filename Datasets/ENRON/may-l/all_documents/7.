Subject: New Reports from PIRA


To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, "BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market," focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, "THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access," focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to
us at PIRA that the energy marketplace will be forever changed by the demand
for, and creation of, substantial broadband.  What is NOT clear to us at
this time is how we can best assist our clients that are looking to
participate in these developments.  In light of that, we ask that you take a
moment to complete the brief survey that is also attached to this email.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Dr. Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive Officer
