Subject: A Two States Model For Power

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.  


Thanks,
Frank
