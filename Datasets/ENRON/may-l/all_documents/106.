sounds like a good idea.... id like to know where the author of this lives,  
however, cause its more like $2.00 a gallon here in san diego....  and  
besides, it really is fairly cheap compared to european countries because 
our  
govt subsidizes the entire automobile industry... gas, cars, roadways etc.   
realistically, you should be paying way more than what you currently do.   
maybe its time to start thinking more into alternative sources of  
transportation other that the individual automobile... i can go on with this  
subject regarding all the various societal impacts but i'll cut myself off  
there.  food for thought... 
By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap. Me  
too! As it is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies 
and  
the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of  
gas is CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response.  
With  
the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take  
action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we  
don't buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have  
come to rely on our cars.  But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all  
act together. 
Here's the idea - 
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest  
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If they are not selling, 
they  
should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their prices 
the  
other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to reach literally  
millions of users. 
But it's doable!  I am sending this note to 42 people. If each of you send 
it  
to at least 10 more ... and those 10 send it to at least 10 more and so on 
by  
the time the message reaches the sixth iteration we will have reached over  
one million consumers. Acting together we can make a difference. If this  
makes sense to you, please pass this message on, or one you compose, to at  
least 10 more E-mail addresses. 
**** PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO BELOW $1.28 
-- $1.29 AND KEEP THEM DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK. 
If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention!
