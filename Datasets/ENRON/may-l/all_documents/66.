This past weekend was the MS 150 bike tour from Houston to Austin.  This was 
my third year riding in the event, and it keeps getting better every year.  

We started out bright and early on Saturday morning with some 9,500 other 
riders eager to make the 175 mile trip to Austin.  Team Enron was first out 
of the gate again this year.  The course was more congested than last year 
because of the huge increase in ridership.  The event has been growing 20 
percent each year.  The crowd started to thin out after about 15 miles, and 
it was smooth sailing until lunch in Bellville.  After a quick sandwich, I 
was on my way again to LaGrange.  There were a few more hills this year than 
last, and the wind started to pick up towards the end.  Visions of a cold 
Miller Lite and a relaxing message inspired me onward.  I arrived in LaGrange 
about 1:15, plenty of time to shower and relax in the tent before Enron's 
famous barbecue dinner.

The next morning, we awoke bright and early to the call to the MS Society's 
pancake breakfast.  Getting up at 5am and back on your bike after having 
ridden 100 miles the previous day was no fun task, but everything was fine 
after about 10 miles.  Sunday morning was fairly uneventful until the 
infamous Bastrop State Park with its killer hills.  After the park was lunch, 
then the homestretch to Austin.  This year we had a nice tailwind to help us 
along.    

Last year, with the support of people like you, the Texas MS society raised 
over $3.5 million for multiple sclerosis research.  This year, we will 
certainly break through that goal. Each of us probably know at least one 
person touched by this terrible disease, and this money goes a long way 
towards finding a cure.  

If I haven't already collected your pledge, I'd appreciate it if you'd drop 
it by.  For those of you not on 45, I'll stop by your floor sometime next 
week.  Thank you for your support!  


Brian
