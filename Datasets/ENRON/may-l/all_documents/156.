Dear AMU Student:

Thank you registering for classes at AMU.  This e-mail is your
confirmation that we have received your registration and that you are
enrolled in one or more courses.  We wish you the best of luck in your
class.

To ensure that you are properly prepared for your course, there are three
(3) more quick things you need to do:

Step 1: If Eligible, Get Tuition Assistance

If you have not already done so, you will need to go to your Education
Center or Human Resource Office to get completed Tuition Assistance (TA)
paperwork.   In order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or
HR professional and accepted by AMU, the following information must be
correct:

- Course Number and Title

- Course Start and End dates

- The amount per credit hour ($250 per semester hour).

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not
provide access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid
Office has received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be
faxed to 703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the
semester.  If you encounter any problems with your TA paperwork please
immediately send an e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398
ext 117.

Step 2: Order Your Books

In order to provide the best possible customer service and to allow
students to track the status of their book shipments, AMU changed its book
ordering process effective April 9, 2001.  It is now requested that
student contact MSB directly to order books.

Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

Call 1-800-325-3252

Give Customer Service your name, and the AMU course(s) you=01,re taking.

Step 3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you=01,re done.

After MBS has confirmed your book order, you will be issued a UPS tracking
number that you can use to check to the status of your book(s).  If you
encounter any problems with your book shipment, or if your book(s) do not
arrive, you will need to contact MBS at the number listed above (please
note that APO/FPO shipping times generally take longer than regular CONUS
mail so please order your books as soon possible).

MBS can be reached toll free 1-800-325-3252 during the following hours
(Central Time):

Monday - Thursday 7 am - 10 PM

Friday 7 am - 6 PM

Saturday 8 am  - 5 PM

Sunday  12pm - 4 PM

All foreign or APO/FPO students may want to use the MBS commercial number
which is (573) 441-9179.

Graduate students are required to purchase their books.  You may order
books from our preferred provider, MBS Direct,  by going to
http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.  If you order your books on-line, MBS
discounts the UPS shipping charges by 20%.  You can also call MBS
toll-free at: 800-325-3252.  For more information on shipping charges to
foreign addresses, you can contact MBS at 573-446-5299.  Please know that
the standard shipping time for books is 5 business days so please remember
to order your books as soon as possible before the start of your class.

Step 3: Maintain Your Student ID and Password

Your Student ID and password are your keys to access the Electronic
Classroom.  If you have do not remember or if you have lost your Student
ID and password, please immediately send an e-mail to
techsupport@amunet.edu.

Complete these 3 steps and you'll be on your way to success.  If you have
any questions or need any assistance, please contact the registrar at
(703) 330-5398 ext 104.

Best of luck to you in your courses!

Sincerely,

AMU Office of Student Services & Technology

* if you were a student prior to February 1999, and were allowed to
continue under the old tuition rate, you must still purchase your own book
either through MBS or another book vendor as the AMU Book Grant will not
cover the cost your books.
