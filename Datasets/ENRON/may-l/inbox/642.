While the energy suppliers are generating "unconscionable profits," the question remains "whether they are illegal profits," says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business.
Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. "I would love to personally escort [Enron </pj/q-quote.cgi?sym=ene&type=company> Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' " adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market.
