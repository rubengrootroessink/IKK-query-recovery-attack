Dear PIRA Retainer Client,
To those of you who attended last  week's Annual Retainer Client Seminar, thank you for making the trip to New York  and for helping us make the Seminar an unqualified success.  I think PIRA consultants and clients  alike were reassured by the robust turnout and the overall enthusiasm that  accompanied the event.
As a further service to you, as well  as to those clients who could not attend in person, please note that the 2001  Seminar material (data tables and slide presentations) is available to you in  electronic format via PIRA Online. The direct link is http://www.pira.com/seminar/seminar.htm .  By end-week, we intend for the audio portion of the presentations to also be  available online.
I look forward to seeing you at next  year's seminar (tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10, 2001), if not sooner during  my travels.
Sincerely
Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive  Officer
PIRA Energy Group
