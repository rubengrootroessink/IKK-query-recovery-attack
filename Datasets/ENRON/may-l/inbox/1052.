Dear Larry,

I'm Tom's fiance. I know we didn't meet yet, but I
need to ask you and Nancy a small favor. I'm preparing
a small book which I will give a copy to each person.
Tom doesn't know anything about that. One part will be
for Family and Friends. So, what I need is some words
that you want say to Tom or to the both of us on this
special day. If it is possivle for next weekend I will
appreciate it. Just send it by e-mail.

Thanks and best regards,

Verena
