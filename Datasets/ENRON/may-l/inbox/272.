Registration is open for courses starting in January and February. 
AMU now has courses starting every month!   There are 200 graduate courses to choose from!   We offer 4-Week, 8-Week and 15-Week courses to accommodate your busy schedule!
We have also upgraded our audit option to offer a "Knowledge Only" program were students also have the opportunity to earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs).  This type of credit is useful to professionals who are interested in acquiring or maintaining educational proficiency within their respective work discipline.  There are 2 CEU options:  Full and Partial.  Students earning CEU's can get an official transcript to reflect their CEU credits.   To find out more about this program, click <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp > 
to go to your online student Handbook under "Student Enrollment Status." 
We have a new revised comprehensive student Handbook online in your 
electronic campus <http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp > and in 
our Visitor Center <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp >.  
The Handbook includes information on all AMU policy, tuition assistance, Classroom Instructions, and processes like extending a course.
We have a new registration process that's easier than ever!  Students can register from inside the 
electronic campus <http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp >, 
or right from the Course Bulletin <http://www.amunet.edu/Graduate/gcourses.asp >!  
So, use your student ID and password to log on and register now for the Spring 2002 semester!  
Or, if you do not wish to attend AMU at this time, please pass this information on to a friend or colleague that may benefit from AMU's programs.
Please note:  If you have not completed a course in the since Fall of 2000 or before (and are not on approved Leave of Absence), you may be disenrolled in January.  AMU students must maintain satisfactory academic progress by completing two courses within four consecutive semesters.  Disenrollment has no negative effect on your academic standing.  If you are unable to take a course in January or February, you will need to contact us when you are ready to return.  We will review your record and work to reinstate you as an active student under the most current degree plan and administrative processes.  You will also be given "orientation" materials, just as a new student would, so that you can be aware of any changes that have taken place at AMU since your last course with us.  If we do not hear from you by January 15, 2002, we will understand that you cannot attend AMU at this time and you will be disenrolled. 
Have a safe and beautiful holiday!
