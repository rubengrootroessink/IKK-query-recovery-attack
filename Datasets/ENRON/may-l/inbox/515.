Join Enron employees at Friendly Haven, a housing assistance program supported by AFH (AIDS Foundation Houston), for a volunteer project designed to celebrate Mother's Day.  Approximately 40 single mothers comprise Friendly Haven's residents and we would like to make the day special for both them and their children.  

Enron volunteers are needed to facilitate a children's craft activity for Mother's Day presents and also serve a special brunch to all of the mothers in the program.  This project can be utilized as a team building opportunity for a department with 15 - 25 employees or individual volunteers may sign up by contacting Janice Riedel at x37507  - for more information on AFH, visit http://www.aidshelp.org/programs/housing.htm.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.
