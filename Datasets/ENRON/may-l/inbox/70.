Enron has consented to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search the Enron Building and to interview employees regarding allegations of document destruction.  The company encourages all employees to fully cooperate with the FBI.

The company has retained Michael Levy and his law firm Swidler, Berlin, Shereff, Friedman, to advise any employee regarding this matter and to be present with them during any interviews by government investigators.  If you would like to speak with an attorney, please contact Ned Crady of the Legal Department at 3-4558 or contact Michael Levy's office in Washington, D.C. at 202-295-8414 and they will direct you to him here in Houston.
