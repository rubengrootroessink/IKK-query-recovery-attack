BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets 
In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage.

The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at 212 702 3920.
