On April 23rd, Enron Houston employees will be invited to celebrate the Topping-Out of Enron Center South. This exciting day will be a celebration for all Enron employees, our contractors and construction crew and for the city of Houston.

Enron Center South is the first high-rise office tower to be erected in downtown Houston in more than 10 years. We are proud to continue our efforts keeping Houston a world-class city by creating this innovative new building designed by world-renowned architect Cesar Pelli.

All Enron Houston employees will have an opportunity to play a part in the Topping-Out celebration by signing their name to the last beam before it is hoisted atop the new building. Beginning April 16th, please take the time to sign your name on the beam located in the Enron Building lobby.
