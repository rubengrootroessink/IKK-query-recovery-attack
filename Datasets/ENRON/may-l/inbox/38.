Hi Larry,
 
Just wanted to write you a quick note to let you know that John Daly asked me to come back for an interview with Cinergy's VP of Trading and Origination, Bruce Sukaly.  Whoo hoo!  =)  Thank you again for giving John your recommendation last week.  I'll keep you posted.
 
Best,
Sheila  Chang
