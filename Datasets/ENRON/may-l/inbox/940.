Hi Larry;

I would be happy to talk with you about government positions, but also recommend that you check
out the home pages of each organization you are interested in, sending in your application directly
to the agencies. Most agencies are currently hiring good nubmers of qualified applicants in various
fields.

I will happily take a look at your resume, and pass that to folks, if warranted. Feel free to contact me.
My email is drmahl@erols.com
