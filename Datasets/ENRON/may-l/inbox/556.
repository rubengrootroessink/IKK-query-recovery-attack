Special Afternoon Workshop - 3:30pm to 5:30pm
"The Painting Experience" with Mr. Stewart Cubley 
You do not have to be an artist... no training or knowledge of art is required....  simply participate in a unique, 
supportive environment where you can explore the "process" of creativity and risk-taking completely free from the 
barriers of comparison, evaluation, judgment, success, failure or awards.  The only prerequisite is a spirit of inquiry.  
There is no fee for this class.  Please RSVP to Jessica at x31918 - space is limited.

Word of the Day
