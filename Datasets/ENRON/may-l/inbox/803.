Larry:
Hope all is ok with your current situation.  I hope you know you can take a=
ny time off necessary to deal with the matter. =20
=20
Congrats on the great deal Monday and I appreciate the heads up before tran=
sacting that size deal.
=20
I'm sorry you missed the mtg monday afternoon.  I want to sum up what my th=
oughts are and what I've learned over the past couple days.  First of all, =
I'm very disappointed in some of the current but mostly former employees of=
 this company.  I think we, in gas trading, have made great efforts to crea=
te a very strong and profitable franchise without ever compromising our int=
egrity.=20
While I do not believe any fraud nor illegal activity has occurred, I do be=
lieve Enron pushed the gray area more than was necessary in some of these d=
ealings.  And while I don't believe Fastow acted unethically or inappropria=
tely in these dealings (and I may be wrong), I do think the presence of a c=
onflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety should have precluded=
 him from these entering into these transactions.  There is a reason why En=
ron employees are not allowed to trade energy commodities for their own acc=
ount.  It is not because Enron does not trust its employees to do the right=
 thing; it is an effort to prevent even the slightest allegation that an em=
ployee's first and foremost responsibility is not to the company.  That is =
where, in my opinion, Fastow errored. =20
I think employee morale has been damaged for 3 reasons over the past year. =
 First, we are tired of bad business deals: India, South American assets, A=
zurix, broadband, etc.  Second, over this period of poor business judgment,=
 some of the same individuals who made these decisions were very well compe=
nsated.  Third, I think there is a concern about the integrity of the organ=
ization and the top managers.  Rather than worry about the past, I prefer t=
o look at the organization going forward.  The truth about the LJM matter w=
ill be brought forward through one or more of the following : legal courtro=
om, SEC investigation, internal Enron investigation, court of public opinio=
n, court of Enron employees' opinion, and investigative journalism.  If any=
 officers of the company acted inappropriately at any time, I can almost gu=
arantee they will not have a future at this company.  I say that because I =
do believe in the current management.  The question you, as well as other e=
mployees need to be asking themselves, is twofold.  First, will the current=
 problems affect the organization's abililty to conduct business in the fut=
ure?  And second, has the culture of the organization changed over the past=
 several years whereby these probems will not happen again?   As long as we=
 can maintain our credit rating, which I believe we can, I believe this wil=
l have minimal effect to the trading business and little effect on Enron's =
business.  Our desire to conserve capital at this point to shore up the bal=
ance sheet means we won't be buying any hundred million dollar+ assets in t=
he near future, which is probably a good thing.  The second question is jus=
t as important.  I will tell you honestly that had the management of this c=
ompany of 2 years ago be in place today, I would not currently be an employ=
ee here.  Over the past couple years, the management turnover has been extr=
emely beneficial.  Gone are  Pai, Hannon, Rice, Skilling, Sutton, etc. that=
 had, with the exception of Skilling, limited intellectual ability, integri=
ty, and drive.  The new management of Whalley, Lavorato, Sheriff, Fallon, a=
nd Delainey, in my opinion, is one of the most capable management teams in =
business today.  These are people that will make the right business decisio=
ns and are not afraid to act as individuals.  I do believe in this team and=
, so long Enron treats the trading organization well at the end of the year=
 which I have no reason to believe otherwise, intend to continue our missio=
n to create the most dominant energy trading franchise around. =20
We all want to yell at someone for the debacle that has been created.  Unfo=
rtunatley, most of those people arent at the company anymore.  I do encoura=
ge you to go to the employee mtg tomorrow regardless of market conditions. =
 Enron values and needs your contributions, and thus it is important to me =
that you are comfortable with the organization going forward.  I think it i=
s benficial to hear Enron's side of the story as well as what we read in th=
e paper. =20
