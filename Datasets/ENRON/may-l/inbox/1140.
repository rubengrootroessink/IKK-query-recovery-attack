> November 13, 2001 09:52  Jesse Jackson Says Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wants
> Role in Enron-Dynegy Deal By Nelson Antosh, Houston Chronicle  Nov.
> 13--Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a
> part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy
> deal.  The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in
> several other large Houston-based energy firms.  "Dynegy needs our
> participation to get approval," Jackson said Monday.  The organization's
> interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority
> inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and
> EEOC rulings.  Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit
> conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street
> Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown.  Those
> companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch
> with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity
> although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political
> spectrum.  Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would
> have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement
> last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said.  The coalition
> opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go
> to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said.  Protests and
> boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau
> chief here.  The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an
> interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his
> appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year.
> Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level
> management and contracts, Jackson said.  Jackson lamented the lack of
> emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to
> terrorists and anthrax. He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to
> criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top
> down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of
> billions of dollars.  "It must be bottom up," Jackson said.  One-third of
> Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers,
> worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months.  This would help
> employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the
> holiday season, he said.  -----  To see more of the Houston Chronicle, or
