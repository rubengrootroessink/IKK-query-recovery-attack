Dear AMU Student;

You may have encountered Network difficulties this weekend.
We regret the inconvenience and difficulty this service disruption may have caused.

All problems have been corrected with our service provider.
It seems that some major road and business construction may have contributed to the phone companies' difficulties.


	If you were unable to register for a Fall 2001 course but were not able to do so,
	you may log on and register now:
	 http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp.


Thank you for your patience and understanding.
Please contact me if you have any difficulties registering for the upcoming Fall 2001 semester.


Best Regards,
Kathie Ferrette
Dean of Students, AMU
