Dear AMU Graduate Student,

We are looking forward to seeing you in classes in the Fall 2001 semester.  If you've already registered, you may disregard this email and get back to having a terrific weekend.

If you have not registered for a course in the Fall 2001 semester, please read the very important information below.

There's still time to register:
If you've not had a chance to register in our Fall 2001 November semester, please log on with your ID and password and do so now at <http://www.amunet.edu/campus/default.asp>!  As I am sure you know, we've added tons of new courses and new programs so there's a course for every student at AMU in Fall 2001!

***If you have skipped a semester:
If your last course was taken in Fall of 2000 (or prior) and you are NOT on a Leave of Absence, please note that you are in danger of disenrollment.  AMU Students are required to complete one course each year in order to remain active.  Those students who do not complete the required courses are disenrolled.  Disenrollment has no negative consequence academically.  It does mean, however, that you need to contact AMU to be re-admitted when you return.  We will assign you a new Student ID and verify all your admission & contact information.

Best Regards,
Kathie Ferrette
Dean of Students, AMU
