Further to our conversation yesterday, I have spoken with the Nation Autistic Society (NAS) regarding schooling options within London- they are sending through a current listing. I have also been in touch with the local education authorities of Kensington & Chelsea and Westminsterwhich governthe areas close to the Enron office - both special needs departments will be calling me back next week.
 
I have attached our homesearchquestionnaire which I should be grateful if you could complete at some stage and return to me so that we have all your details on file.
 
I will speak with you soon.
