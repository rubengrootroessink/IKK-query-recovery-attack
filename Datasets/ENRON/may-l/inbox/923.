Terrorism in America?
I don't believe that any of us could ever have been prepared for the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

"What can I do to help?"
American Military University's (AMU) answer is to do what we do best...teach.  Chancellor and founder Jim Etter states, "AMU is proud to be in a position to help America prepare for the challenges that confront our great nation."

AMU offers 30+ courses directly relevant to homeland security and the current challenge we are facing.    These courses range in breadth from a historical perspective on war in Afghanistan, to introduction to Islamic culture, to global terrorism.

We have also added a 4-week long course titled "Introduction to Homeland Security" that covers the mission, defense policies, management structures and organizations associated with the new homeland security paradigm in the United States.

Getting Informed
Americans have been accused of being uninformed about global affairs.  It's time to change that perception.  AMU's Homeland Security topics are significant to military personnel, civilians, and the friends and family of both.  Every American should do whatever she or he can to be prepared for the military and political challenges that may exist in our future.  Please click here <http://www.amunet.edu/Degrees/AMUCourses.asp> to view the topics covered and descriptions of courses available at AMU.

What if I am called for Duty?
If you are already in Fall 2001 courses, please know that with so many service-members at AMU, our staff and faculty's main concern is (and has always been) to help our students achieve their academic goals.  During these trying times, we will do whatever is necessary to support our students who are called to duty.

Please review your degree program to see if one of these courses will not only benefit you in our current state of affairs, but also help you to progress toward your academic goals.

Anytime, Anywhere-for Everyone
If you have friends, colleagues, or family members who would like to learn more about Homeland Security or other AMU programs, please tell them to visit American Military University at www.amunet.edu <http://www.amunet.edu>.  Send them this email and let them know that American Military University is their choice for a nationally accredited, state-licensed, online university that is ready anytime, anywhere to help all Americans and supporters of the United States learn all they can about Homeland Security.  Our next semester begins on November 5, 2001.  There's plenty of time to enroll online, register online, and get books.

We also have 10 Undergraduate and 12 Graduate programs in a wide variety of study areas.  There is no fee for admission and all courses are online so they can be taken from locations all over the world in every time zone.  Those interested should visit the site (www.amunet.edu <http://www.amunet.edu>), email us (info@amunet.edu <mailto:info@amunet.edu>), or call us at 1-877-GoTo-AMU.
