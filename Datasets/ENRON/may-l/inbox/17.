Dear Nancy and Larry...
 
Just wanted to send this to you now....  Shows  the wetland on the lot, and conservation easement.  This section of your  lot will basically be a wildlife preserve where you cannot build or change the  lay of the land or flow of water.
 
I went to the lot, but it was too wooded to see  much without walking all the way back.  It was getting really cloudy and I  didn't want to get caught in a rain, so I did not walk to the back... but I did  get several plats which answer questions.  Garrett usually charges an  additional $5,000 for a walkout basement... but I have not received an answer as  to whether they can positively accommodate a walk out basement on that  lot.
 
I got the contract and all pertinent info from  Valerie's office.  Everything looks good, including the agency disclosure I  was asking about.  I do want a release from Garrett for that lot from the  previous purchaser so there's no doubt about their consent.  I'll talk to  Valerie about it.
 
Will talk to you soon....
Tracey :-)
