Dear PIRA Client:

Our U.S., Europe, Japan, and World Economy presentations on PIRA Online
have recently been updated with the latest available data. These charts
and tables illustrate trends in key regional economic indicators. They
are maintained on PIRA Online as a courtesy to our retainer clients.

You can access any of these presentations via PIRA Online (www.pira.com)
by logging in and, from the Client Home page, choosing a topic from the
"Macro Data"* drop-down menu at the top of the screen.

(*If you don't see the "Macro Data" menu items when you log in, go to
the FAQ page on PIRA Online and click on question number 4.)

If you need a user name and password for PIRA Online, or if you need
help logging in, please contact Dyana Rothman at (212) 686-6808, email:
support@pira.com.
