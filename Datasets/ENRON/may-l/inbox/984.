Dear AMU Student,

Please, if you have not done so already, take a moment to review the

					AMU Newsletter for September 2001.
					http://www.amunet.edu/newsletters/Newsletter.asp

Please also note:  Due to the multiple number of computer viruses circulating,

ALWAYS put your name and student ID in the SUBJECT line of emails you send to us.

We are being extremely careful with incoming emails and we want to make sure that we recognize you as a student so that we can quickly assist you.

Thank you so much!


Best Regards,
Kathie Ferrette
Dean of Students, AMU
