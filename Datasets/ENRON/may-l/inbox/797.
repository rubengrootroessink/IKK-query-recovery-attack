Dr.Lockwood,

Due to a family crisis concerning my son's health I am requesting an
extension on completing the mid-term exam for IN520 until  11/7/01.  I
realize the deadline had already passed but between work and my son's
condition I was delayed in sending this e-mail.  I appreciate any help
you can provide in this extension.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May
