Dear AMU Student,

We have made changes to the proctored Final Exam process this year.  Many of you are aware of the current online proctored-exam process, but I wanted to send a quick note to all of our students containing a brief overview of the online Exam/Proctor process.  This information will be updated over the next few weeks in your online student "Handbook" (see the toolbar inside your electronic campus).

1.  All aspects of the exam process are coordinated and orchestrated between the professor, student, and proctor.

2.  When the semester begins, all students should check the Student Course Guide inside their classrooms to see if they have an online proctored-exam in their course(s).

If there is a proctored exam, the student will need to locate a proctor.  General guidelines on proctors can be found in the Handbook via this link: <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp#106>   The student will need to agree upon a scheduled date to take the exam with the proctor.

3.  As of Summer 2001, the proctor will need an email address.  The proctor will also need to provide the student access to a computer for up to 3-4 hours (the length of your exam time).  If this is absolutely impossible, the student and the professor may be able to determine alternative options-i.e. having the proctor print out the exam for the student to take & then mailing it to the professor, having the proctor closely monitor the student as s/he takes it on a laptop & then sends it to the professor via email, or some other solution agreed to by all parties involved.

4.  At some point during the semester, the professor will post the final exams in the online classroom.  Students will be able to see this because when they click on "EXAMS" inside the classroom, the will see a title appearing under FINAL EXAM.  When the student cannot see a title for the Final Exam, the professor has not posted the exam yet.

5.  After the professor has posted the exam, the student will be able to nominate a proctor using these instructions located inside the Handbook: <http://www.amunet.edu/GeneralInformation/studenthandbook.asp#33.5>

6.  The professor will see when a student has nominated a proctor and s/he will send a "password" to the proctor via email.  The proctor simply needs to save this password until the day of the exam.  Either s/he can save the email in a file, or print it out if their office's procedures are more "hardcopy."

7.  Prior to exam day, it is a good idea for the student to contact the proctor to verify that a password has been received.  If it has not, the student needs to contact the professor and ask that it be sent (or re-sent, as the case may be).

8.  On Exam day, the student arrives, logs on to the electronic campus, and enters the classroom for the exam.  The student clicks EXAMS, and the final exam and will see a page with a textbox appear.  The proctor will enter the password sent by the professor in the textbox and the student will gain access to the Exam.  The student will finish the exam inside the classroom.  The professor will be able to see instantly when the student finishes the exam and it is ready to be graded.

Two weeks after the end date of the course (provided no extension agreements have been made) the professor will post the student's final grade in the course.

So, it's as easy as that!  Thank you for taking the time to review this email.  If you have questions about the exam process, please let me know.

Best Regards,
Kathie Ferrette
