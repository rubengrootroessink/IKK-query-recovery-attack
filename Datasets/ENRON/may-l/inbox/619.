Dear AMU Student:

Thank you for applying to AMU and congratulations on your provisional
acceptance into the Master of Arts program!  Please read this entire mail as
it contains important information and instructions you need to know in order
to register and pay for classes.  We have identified 10 Easy Steps you need
to take for success.  Each are outlined below:

Step 1: Find Your Student ID and Password

By now you should have received an e-mail providing you with your Student ID
and Password.  Your Student ID and password are the keys to access the
Electronic Classroom and you will need them in order to register for
classes.  If you have not yet received these, please immediately send an
e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398 ext 117.

Step 2: Login to the Electronic Classroom and Complete Student Orientation

Clicking on the Electronic Campus button found on the AMU toolbar will take
you to our campus login page.  After entering your Student ID and password
you will encounter the Electronic Campus homepage.  This page provide is
your gateway to the Online Classroom, Student Orientation, and My Academic
Progress features.  As a new student the first thing you will want to do is
complete Student Orientation.  This module has been designed especially for
you and will explain many of the features of the AMU campus and our
processes.  The Orientation uses Flash technology in the beginning, if your
computer has an older web browser, you can either download the Flash plug in
or just click on the "Skip Intro" button to participate in the rest of the
orientation (don't worry you will not miss any important information and the
orientation is not that long).

Step 3: Know Your First Course

order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or HR professional
and accepted by AMU, the following information must be correct:
*	Course Number and Title

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not provide
access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid Office has
received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be faxed to
703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the semester.

Step 6: Order Your Books


Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

1.	Call 1-800-325-3252

taking.
	3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you're done.

Books can be ordered from MBS Direct at http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.

more information on shipping charges to foreign addresses, you may contact

	Sunday ...12pm - 4 PM


Step 7: Become Fully Enrolled

When you first enroll at AMU, we grant you "provisional acceptance."  This
provisional acceptance means you can register for classes and apply for
transfer credit.  To become fully accepted to AMU, Graduate applicants need
to submit official documentation  showing where you obtained your Bachelor
of Arts.  This may include (but is not limited to) official high school
transcripts, official college transcripts, official civilian or military
certification reflecting the above.  If you have attended more than one
college, official transcripts from all colleges/universities attended are
required.  You need to submit this documentation within your first semester
at AMU.

Step 8: Apply for Transfer Credit

You have the option of submitting a Transfer Credit Evaluation (TCE) packet
to AMU.  Complete information on how to request a TCE is available at
http://www.amunet.edu/Content/TransferCreditEvaluation/TCEInstructions.asp.
Transfer Credit Evaluation is optional - you do not have to submit a TCE if
you do not think you will receive credit for previous experiences.  Most
people have credits they can transfer so it is always worth you while to at
least explore this option.

Step 9: Access Your Student Course Guide

Logon the Electronic Campus at www.amunet.edu.  Once you are in the
Electronic Campus, you will see buttons for Enter Classroom,  Orientation,
Register for Classes, and My Academic Progress.  .

Select Enter Classroom, once you have entered the classroom your course
profile(s) will be displayed.  If the course(s) is not displayed please be
sure that your student account is up to date. Enter the course by Click
Here, you will now enter your classroom.  On the left is the navigation bar
from which you select Student Course Guide.  To complete the process you
will download your course syllabus, you will only need to complete this
process once.

Step 10:  Keep in Contact

Student-Professor Contact
Every semester, students must contact their professors a minimum of 4 times
by e-mail or phone.  Contact/interaction should occur on a more frequent
basis.  The first contact is especially important as this is your
opportunity to establish a relationship with your professor and to have any
questions answered about course requirements.

Student Contact Information
It is the student's responsibility to keep their personal information
current.  Students are contacted via the personal email address they provide
and it is necessary to keep personal information current.  Once inside the
electronic campus, please select the Personal Information button located
along the top of your screen and make any necessary changes.

Classroom E-mail
Students are assigned an email address to be used when in a class.  The
email address assigned while in the electronic classroom is to be used
strictly for professor and student contact.  As this mail may become part of
your student record, please remember to always remain professional in
sending any correspondence.

That's It - 10 Easy Steps!

On behalf of our staff and faculty, I would like to welcome you to the
University and congratulate you on your decision to pursue your educational
goals with us.  We look forward to working with you and pledge to provide a
quality academic experience.
