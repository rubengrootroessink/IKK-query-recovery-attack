Hello everyone, 

We are trying to setup proper access to one of the excel sheet we build for Vol Smile. Please provide us your NT Login Id and "_pc" Database Id. Once we have it, we will setup the access appropriately.

Let me ( x5-3361) or Margie Nguyen (x 5-3706) know if you have any questions.

Thanks
Sanjeev
