TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A radio broadcaster known as "Dave the Dwarf" has s=
ued to overturn Florida's ban on "dwarf tossing," saying he should be allow=
ed to decide for himself whether to participate in the barroom contests.  "=
Dwarf tossing" is a contest in which dwarfs don harnesses and allow bar pat=
rons to hurl them through the air onto mattresses.  Florida banned it in 19=
89 amid intense lobbying from the advocacy group Little People of America, =
which said the contests were demeaning and encouraged people to treat dwarf=
s as objects. Bars that allow the contests can be stripped of their liquor =
licenses.  David Flood, a dwarf who is 38 inches (96.5 cm) tall, filed suit=
 on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, challenging the ban as uncon=
stitutional. He said it illegally singles out people with dwarfism.  "As so=
on as you have a physical handicap ... all of the sudden they treat you lik=
e you don't have a mind of your own," Flood told the Tampa Tribune. "Just b=
ecause I'm 3-foot-2 doesn't mean I can't make decisions."  Flood, 37, works=
 as "Dave the Dwarf" on the morning radio show on Tampa station WFLZ. =09=
