Dear PIRA Client,

PIRA has created a new slide presentation on the U.S. economy. You can
access this presentation via PIRA Online (www.pira.com) by logging in and
choosing "US Economy" from the new "Macro Data" drop-down menu at the top of
the screen. The table of contents is listed below.

Given the overall importance of U.S. economic trends and their impact on
local and international energy markets, PIRA maintains and analyzes a
database of key economic indicators. This effort supports our ongoing
analyses of energy supply/demand fundamentals and the associated market
forecasts. This slide presentation - which will be updated as new data
become available - is being made available complimentarily to all PIRA
clients to support their own analyses.

Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive Officer
PIRA Energy Group
