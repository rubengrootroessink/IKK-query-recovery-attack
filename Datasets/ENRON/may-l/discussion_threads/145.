Dear Student,

What classes are you registered for?

NOTE: The classrooms are now open for Summer Session A.  If you are having
difficulty entering a class you are registered for make sure you have turned
in all of your tuition assistance forms. For further information on tuition
assistance contact finaid@amunet.edu.

Thanks
TechSupport
