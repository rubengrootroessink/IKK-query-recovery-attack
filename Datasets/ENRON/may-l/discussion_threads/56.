John,

VCM is not an eligible swap counterparty.  Until established, we could 
possibly face FERC audit if we opened them up prematurly.  We consider the 
issue a high priority and will let you know when the guaranty comes in.

thanks
brant

We (Brant) are currently working on a parental guarantee to provide credit 
support for this counterparty.  Until this process is complete we will be 
unable to set up this customer as a trading entity.
