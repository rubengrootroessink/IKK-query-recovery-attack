This explains a lot.  Lets talk at 9 on what the status of the case is--find 
some trade press articles first thing mon. AM and don't bug Janet quite yet.  
Sounds like Bill has arranged a briefing by the NB people for our benefit  
(and probably an argument about whether we should intervene).  Thanks.  DF
