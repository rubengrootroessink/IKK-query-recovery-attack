Great.  I've put in a couple of minor changes--pls crank out a clean (non 
redlined) copy and email it back to me.  For now, lets take out the sentence 
indicating Sempra's agreement.  Also, delete the privilege header.  I want 
Georgetta to have a clean copy she can circulate internally in her shop.  In 
my cover email to her I'll suggest the sentence I'd like to be able to 
include.  MKM and others--please let me know if I'm good to go on sending 
this to Georgetta.  Thanks.  df

Subject: New Revised Draft Answer - Ignore Previous Draft.


 <<4%M3RED.DOC>> In my haste to get the draft out, I omitted a couple of 
changes in the last few paragraphs.  Please ignore the previous draft.  
Thanks.
