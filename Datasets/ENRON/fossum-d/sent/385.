I need to be in DC on Thursday next week, so any time in Denver that allows 
me to get to DC is ok.  DF

Subject: Postponed- Caithness Corp. meeting 7/11/00

I got a call at 10:30 a.m. from George Briden indicating that his client's 
plans were changed over the weekend and they will not be available to come to 
Houston for tomorrow's meeting.  They will be in their Denver offices all 
next week and suggested that we might meet up with them there.  Drew has 
indicated his willingness to meet with them in Denver next week.     
Given this change in events, I'd suggest that we pack-up a small contingent 
to go to Denver and meet with them.  I'm thinking Terry or Ron, plus Steve 
Harris (if available) and myself.  I don't have any dates/times yet.  I'll 
call George and get his thoughts.  Will you EMail me back and let me know 
what days/times will work for you next week?  Thanks.

See attached note.  I'm thinking that for a preliminary discussion with this 
[potential] customer, we should high grade the meeting as well as limit the 
number of meeting participants to no more than 5-6 from our side.  Bear in 
mind that Drew has a relationship with George Briden already and he will be 
here in Houston for this meeting.  In addition to Drew, I'd like to see 
representatives from TW Commercial, marketing services, and facility 
planning/engineering involved.  If you feel I've missed a function here that 
should be included, please advise.  Let me know your availability and/or the 
availability of your designee.  

Audrey, will you secure a conference room for us on that date/time:  1:30 - 
3:30 p.m, Tues. July 11th.   Plan on about 8 people.  Can we get a 
coffee/soft drink/snack set-up also?  Thanks.

George,
Thanks.  Let's plan on about 1:30 p.m. CDT on July 11th here in Houston at 
Transwestern's office in the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street.  Just check 
in at the security desk, ask for me and they'll direct you to the elevators 
leading to our (41st) floor.  I don't think we'll need the whole afternoon, 
particularly at this stage, but I'll plan on at least a couple of hours.  

I'll ask a couple of reps from our engineering/operations group to join us 
and be prepared to answer questions about TW, its operation, as well as the 
estimate and underlying engineering of the lateral pipeline.  I'll forward 
this to Drew so that he can make his arrangements to join us also.

I look forward to meeting you and your client in person.  Call me if you have 
any questions.
