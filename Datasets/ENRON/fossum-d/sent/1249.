I could see accruing $100,000 for legal fees on the ONeOk arbitration--which 
will be concluded in May.  We could also reserve against OneOk's 
counterclaim--which is about $4 million.  We expect a final arbitration 
decision 15 days after close of the hearing which should be well within the 
2d quarter.  We may decide to use post-hearing briefs, however, which might 
push the decision into the third quarter.  Let me know if either of these is 
worth pursuing.  DF

Subject: First Quarter Forecast - March Actuals
Importance: High

We reviewed the forecast with Stan this afternoon, and Stan requested that we 
do everything possible to accrue as much expense in March as we can (to the 
benefit of 2nd and 3rd quarters).  I recommend that you focus on larger 
amounts.


Please send your projections to Vera as soon as possible.

Lou,  Are there any environmental or PCB reimbursements that we could 
legitimately accrue in March?

Thanks for your help!
Elaine

Subject: First Quarter Forecast

 	


It appears today that ETS will end the first Quarter with at least $25 
Million additional dollars due to improved Revenue Margins.   This assumes 
that Operations will end the Quarter Flat with Plan.   If we end up under 
Plan, then it adds to this amount, and of course if we end up over it 
subtracts.

It is imperative that we provide to Vera an accurate projection of where we 
will end this quarter, asap, but no later than Thursday of this week.

Our preference would be to push as much of this $25 million into the second 
or third quarter.

We should make every effort to project our spending for March, compare our 
actuals to plan for January and February and provide Vera this projection.

We should also look to the outer quarters to see if we know of any major 
payments we have to make during these quarters and accrue for them.   We 
should also get with all our AP clerks and make sure that we have paid all 
the bills we possibly can before the end of this week, including working 
Saturday, if we have to.

Shirley Jo - please make sure that we have properly received everything 
through the system that can be properly accounted for.

Thanks,

mb
