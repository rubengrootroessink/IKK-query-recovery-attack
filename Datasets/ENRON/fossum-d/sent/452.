Attached for your review is Jim Peters' rough draft. Jim tried to design it 
in such a way as to be as generic as possible, with the idea that factual 
differences between the parties would be put in the footnotes.  I am 
concerned he may be overreaching with regard to the legal objection, where he 
refers to TW/Northern as a "nonresident", given that (as I understand it) 
Northern and/or TW have facilities in Oklahoma.  There are also some 
grammatical changes that I would make.

I wonder if I could get ya'll to take a look at this and have you participate 
with me in a telephone conference with Jim later this afternoon?  If Drew, 
Jim or Bob could let me know what time would be convenient, I'll get it set 
up.  Many thanks.

       B.K.D.
