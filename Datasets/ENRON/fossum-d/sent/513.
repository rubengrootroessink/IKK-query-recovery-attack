Per my voice mail yesterday--I'm getting more curious about what's going on 
with every garbled answer I get.  DF

$2.5MM SAP accrual which I will use to offset the increase in the Corp 
charges for this year instead of charging to the pipelines.

$5.0 -$6.0MM I hope to be able to carry over to next year.  It depends on the 
$ some costs really come in at.  We did some things in the second quarter to 
hold income back.  I can't  really reverse this year.  If our GPG target does 
go up to $401MM, I will have a $35 MM hole at my level.

I wrote off business development projects and some other things.

The inventory deal is still up in the air.  Rod will know more tomorrow.

At this point in time, even if it happens higher, we will still have a hole.

Maybe they can try the structured products???

Tracy

Tracy,

Can you tell me what the ($10.2) for Enron Pipeline Company is in the 3CE 
(primarily in Q1 & Q2)?  That seems to be creating the remaining GPG hole for 
the year.

Our officers had been counting on having more reserves to carry into 2001 to 
help fill the NNG and TW gaps.  I also heard from Bob that the inventory deal 
may still be viable at a higher amount - more like $20MM.  Do you have any 
updates on that?

Thanks,  Elaine
