Outstanding.  I'll  bring em and I'll call you guys in a week or so to get 
the details nailed down.  Did you know that Bienawski (sp?), the Sofregaz 
guy, is at Enron?  He's got a storage development group or some damn thing.  
I'm going to look him up and see what the heck he thinks he's doing.  DF

Yea, but what are they going to do with all that salt!  Merrilee's ditching
us that week, so I'll be in Houston.  Any day would work for me and yes -
bring the sticks.  We've got a new greg norman course out on Katy.
