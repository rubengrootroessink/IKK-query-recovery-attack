Subject: TW COMPRESSOR MONETIZATION

Attached is the updated summary sheet for TW's compressor monetization based 
on the criteria decided on in todays meeting.  The 5% COS reduction 
translates to  $149,000 benefit to TW's customers each year.  The sales price 
of $14.8MM will yeild a gain of approximately $3.2MM before tax and after the 
deduction for employee termination expenses estimated at $160,000.
