No wonder you are oblivious to our meager organizational changes up in 
Omaha!  You are out doing zillion dollar deals for EBS!!!  
Congratulations--sounds like a very cool deal!  Lets get together soon down 
in Houston and debrief--that is if rock star Frank can take time away from 
the 50th floor crowd to hang with mere mortals!  DF
