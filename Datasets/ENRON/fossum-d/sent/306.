Subject: Satellite Phone

Want to thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the satellite phone 
for our usage.  It was a very short notice and you were able to come through 
and with no hesitation on your parts.  It is so nice to have good people to 
work with and you were so helpful and professional during the whole 
situation.  I was a novice at this phone thing and you were helpful ever step 
of the way.

Again, thank you.


Martha Benner
