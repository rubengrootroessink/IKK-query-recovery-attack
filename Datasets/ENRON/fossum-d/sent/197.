Hey, it worked great--I replicated several sets of messages without a 
problem.  Then, on Sunday, I did something and now can't get the computer to 
load up windows.  It stalls out on the "Property of ET&S" screen right after 
I turn it on.  Please make it happy again and ship it back up.  (I don't know 
if this would cause such a problem, but I may have shut off the computer off 
on saturday before I got the message saying "it is now safe to shut off your 
computer."  )  Thanks. DF
