These look good to me. My only question relates to Susan Scott and the 
suggestion that she sometimes bends over too far to satisfy her clients and 
thus might lose here effectiveness as the lawyer. This point is not 
mentioned. If you plan to cover this in the sitdown that is fine. I think it 
is a point that deserves mentioning to her.
