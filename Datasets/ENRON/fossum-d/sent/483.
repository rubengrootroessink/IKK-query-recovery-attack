Thanks.  Unfortunately, I think the answers are yes and yes.

Well, I'm not sure how responsive Dot's response was to your initial 
communication, but I agree that there is a 10 year retention policy on 
contracts and agreements and their backup.  This to me would only apply to 
all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage, most of which are 
probably close to the end of the 10 years.  Litigation workpapers, which to 
me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, 
depositions, etc., have a six year retention.  The other documents we pulled 
from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old 
files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different 
retention policies depending upon their content.

2 questions :

- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been 
destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper 
retention policy? 

-Do you think documents from the first trial have to "start over" and be kept 
for another 6 years?
