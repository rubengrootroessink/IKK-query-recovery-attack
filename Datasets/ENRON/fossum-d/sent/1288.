Dave, I've had a technical conference come up at FERC on the 20th in a matt=
er=20
that I'm responsible for.  Bill strongly suggested that I go to DC.  Now, I=
=20
may not be a rocket scientist, but I see pretty clearly the wisdom of=20
following Bill's advice.  I've let Mike Moran know and at Bill's suggestion=
,=20
asked him if he'd like a substitute to stand in for me (maybe Lou Soldano?)=
. =20
Judging from the list of participants in this PRC, I assume I was partly an=
=20
ET&S representative and partly a GPG law representative.   I note that ET&S=

is already pretty well represented with Neubauer,  Julia and Mike Nelson. =
=20
Without me, there is noone from law, but our people have already been PRC'd=

anyway.  I'll leave it to you and Mike to decide if my spot needs to be=20
filled with someone from GPG law.  Sorry about this--just one more bit of=
=20
evidence that I "have issues."  DF

Subject: Mid-Year PRC Process for Managers

Ladies and Gentlemen:

As you know, GPG=01,s Manager Performance Review Committee (PRC), of which =
you=20
are members, is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon, July 20, in EB49C2 fr=
om=20
1:30 to approximately 5:30 PM. You=01,ll note that our membership has expan=
ded=20
to include Jim Prentice and Steve Hotte, who will represent managers in Enr=
on=20
Clean Fuels and IT, respectively.

By July 20, each manager should have a pre-rating in the Performance=20
Evaluation Program (PEP) system.  Our task as a committee will be to=20
determine a final mid-year rating for each manager and achieve appropriate=
=20
distribution of performance levels across GPG.  The PRC=01,s results will b=
e=20
reviewed at the GPG Management Committee=01,s PRC the following day.

The attachment below lists the employees we are reviewing and identifies=20
which of them you are expected to represent.  Please be prepared to discuss=
=20
their performance, including both their strengths and areas that need=20
improvement.=20

You=01,ll note that not all of you have specific managers assigned.  That=
=01,s okay=20
your insights regarding the performance of managers with whom you have=20
interacted during the year will be valuable to the process.  Furthermore, P=
RC=20
members who have a large group of mangers for whom you are responsible shou=
ld=20
feel free to ask another committee member with fewer or no managers for hel=
p=20
in gathering the necessary performance feedback.

Finally, for your information Mary Ellen Coombe of EOTT Energy will be=20
joining us on the 20th as an observer.  EOTT expects to implement its own=
=20
version of the PRC process shortly.

Please let me know if you need additional information.
