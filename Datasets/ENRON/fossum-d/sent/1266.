Hey I'm watching your fair city on the tube--I suppose you are at the NCAA 
final.  I'm stuck down here in Houston again--been down here at least 3 days 
every week for a month.  Sandra digs it--at least I'm out of her face.  She 
was down here last week with me for 3 days looking at schools and houses with 
the 3 girls.  That car was full of bitching, whining and crying.  And the 
kids got a little cranky too.  Gonna come and visit us???  We'll probably 
move in August--bring your dad's pickup and you can help!  What a great time 
to move when its 200 degrees and the fire ants and poisonous lizards are in 
full frenzy.  Ugh.  We've gotta hook up with you guys before then.  We're out 
for Easter week, but we'll need a quick road trip eventually.  It would also 
be cool if you guys want to come down--Omaha would seem like Cancun after the 
winter you've had!  Take care dude. DF
