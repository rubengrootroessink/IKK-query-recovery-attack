Subject: Candle

I've left a small glass candle on your desk. It was to be given to you and 
your spouse after our Holiday Open House last evening, but since you were 
kind enough to call with regrets, I delivered it to your office. If you 
choose to light it over the holidays, please think of the Dan Reedy family. 
Thanks, and have a great holiday.
