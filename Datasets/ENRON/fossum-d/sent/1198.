Barbara:  in case my voice mails didn't make sense, see the final section of 
Shelley's paper on valuation.  ETS is working through INGAA to push in a 
direction that is inconsistent with where Paul and Mark were hoping BLM will 
go.  DF

Attached is a paper that I prepared for INGAA on federal and Tribal lands 
issues.  On the ROW valuation issue, I know we face similar trends for state 
granted ROW.
