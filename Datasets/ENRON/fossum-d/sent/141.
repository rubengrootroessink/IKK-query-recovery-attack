A map could be generated depicting the area within an estimated 8 to 12 hr. 
period.  This would include pipe and sizes, not pressures.
The data utilized to generate the map would be taken from our annual FERC 
map.  We can start at any time just let us know.

Thanks, Frank

Frank,

I had trouble getting the FAX to go but you should have it by now.  After you 
get it reviewed can you answer Drew's question regarding time you would like 
to have (ie couple of weeks vs the 2 days given)?

Drew,

Frank is in charge of Engineering Records for ET&S et al and will provide the 
maps you deem necessary.  We do not give out pressure information (even for 
these subpoena's as I understand it), is that a problem?

Charlie

I understand that the FTC subpoena I sent to Julia and Mike Nelson yesterday 
has found its way to you.  Please give me a call with your thoughts on who is 
best situated to help prepare the response and how long it would take.  Mike 
Moran and I plan to call the FTC back this PM to discuss so your input would 
be helpful.  Thanks for your assistance.  DF
