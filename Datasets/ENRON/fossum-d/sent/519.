 Good idea--its good to get Martha out of town now and then so the rest of us 
can get some rest!  DF

Subject: Request - Martha

My Contract Administration staff is having a meeting on October 6th to 
discuss our document control process and have requested that Martha Benner 
attend this meeting.   Since it would be more effective if she were in 
Houston for this meeting (rather than on the telephone), would you approve 
for her to travel?  I'm sure that she could arrange to spend some of her time 
with the Houston law department as well.

Rick
