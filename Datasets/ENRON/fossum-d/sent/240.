Glad to help--concocting market based rates for storage facilities that 
probably don't deserve them is one of the few things I know how to do.  DF

Subject: Market-Based Storage

ENA is pursuing a gas storage project.  One assumption of their project 
development is the ability to attain market-based pricing for the facility.  
Tom Shelton called  looking for a primer on how to apply for market-based 
rates.   I gave him the 10,000 ft story of how any regulated entity can apply 
for market-based rates under the Alternatives to Traditional Ratemaking 
policy statement, but that to date only storage facilities have been 
successful in willing market-based rate treatment.  I think his client is 
looking for more of a procedural look at what needs to be done.  Do you care 
if I send  them  a copy of the market-based storage testimony from the last 
NNG rate case?    Sorry, but I mentioned that you forged market based storage 
services for Market Hub Partners in your former life.  So, don't be surprised 
if you hear from Tom Shelton or his client John Allario.
