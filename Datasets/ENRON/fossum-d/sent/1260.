This sounds great--I take it that they are still seeking interconnects with 
us and El Paso, but it sounds like an FT agreement for most or all of their 
MDQ may be likely.  Super.  df

Subject: Big Sandy Project

Kirk,
Great to hear that the project is moving forward.  I think TW feels it's 
emotionally vested at this point!  I will ask the Facility Planning folks to 
get started on providing a more detailed "budget quality" estimate of the 
cost to construct the interconnect and metering station.  With recent changes 
in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery 
points, TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a 
FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past.  

Therefore, the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put 
together the estimate, as well as the documentation we'll need in order to 
implement a new delivery point on the system.  To this end, I see the 
following documents:

 1.  Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the 
budget quality estimate.  This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to 
reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls 
out of the project.
 2.  A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the 
reimbursement by Big Sandy for TW's construction of the tap and/or metering 
station.  This agreement would also provide for TW's operation of the 
metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to 
avoid the CIAC.
 3.  An Operator Balancing Agreement (OBA), a standard tariff form agreement 
defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the 
disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month.

From a timeline standpoint, we can be in the position to get these documents 
completed within a relatively short time (30 - 60 days?) depending on whether 
there are any sticking points in our negotiations.  By the way, the only 
agreement that may take some time to work through is no. 2 on the list, 
although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system 
this past year, we've already done a lot of the "lawyering" spade work.

Not that I'm especially found of meetings, but it's been a while since we've 
met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities.  Moreover, we've 
got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction 
groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project 
side.  May I suggest a face-to-face meeting where I can bring our planners 
and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project?  
We can meet anywhere its convenient for you guys.  

I look forward to working with you on this project.

Jeff-
Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy
Project, and I want to move forward based on our last
conversation/e-mail.

Specifically, I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect
(MSA/tap) study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy.  I also want
to obtain from you a timeline, including all the necessary
documents/agreements, based on a projected Big Sandy online date of
8/1/03.

At this point, I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if
not all of its' natural gas requirements, and thus, the pressure
integration issue is not relevant.
We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure, and a TW
constructed MSA.
I understand the CIAC issue, and as such, the Project may elect to
construct the MSA per TW specs, to mitigate the tax implications.

Please let me know what additional information require to support this
activity.
Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to
commercialization.

Kirk
