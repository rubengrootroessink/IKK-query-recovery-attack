Subject: DC Reservations


Mary Kay is taking the 4:10 pm flight to DC on Monday arriving at 7:30 pm, 
returning on the 7th on the 7:59 pm flight.  Let me know if you want to take 
these same flights and I will have Sharon make the reservations.

If not I am waiting for info from TAP on other flights that are available.

Martha
