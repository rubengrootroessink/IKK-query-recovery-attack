Is that point the receipt point Sempra would have to use to take the base gas 
volumes away from Cunningham?  Thanks.  DF

If someone tries to nominate POI 61243 they will receive a message saying 
"Invalid point".  The market service rep will then notify me because they 
cannot nominate on the point.  I will then notify Jan.  Jan and I will notify 
Sue, Morgan, Kent and yourself.  Let me know if we need to change anything.

Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas 
deal if it has "gone physical" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for 
delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they 
have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market 
Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in 
any missing details.  Thanks, Dari

They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a 
counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee 
issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF

addition to my first reply:

Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.
