Thanks Craig!  I'll look forward to seeing your smilin' face more 
frequently!  [Actually that will be tough since I currently see it at least 
twice a day on a life size billboard in the Omaha office lobby!!]  df

WAY TO GO DREW!!!

It's really refreshing to see someone who works hard (and works smart) get 
recognized.  Well done...
Congratulations,

Craig Buehler


Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.
