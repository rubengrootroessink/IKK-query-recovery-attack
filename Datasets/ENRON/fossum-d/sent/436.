Subject: Preliminary 2001-2003 Business Plan and Assumptions

Attached are the preliminary 2001 - 2003 Business Plan and Assumption 
schedules for NNG and TW.  Please review and update these schedules for the 
2001 - 2003 Operating and Strategic Plan.  Keep in mind that these are the 
preliminary assumptions that we will discuss in more detail during the 
meeting on August 11th.  Please note that the attached Business Plan is a 
high level version of the Focus Areas included in the detailed ET&S Business 
Plan that was approved by the officers back in March.  Please provide us with 
any updates/revisions by Wednesday, August 9th.  If you have any questions, 
please give Henry Baker a call at (713) 853-4797 or Elaine Concklin at (713) 
853-5521.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
