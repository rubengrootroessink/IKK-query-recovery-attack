Subject: Update on Marketing affiliate Conference


As you know, the marketing affiliate conference is still set for January 31.  
The Alliance of Energy Suppliers (EEI's generation arm) has filed a letter to 
postpone to conference.  The Commission hasn't acted on this request, so at 
this point the conference is still on.  Interestingly, the FERC hasn't issued 
a notice of the panel participants yet.  Bob Flanders of FERC says not to 
expect the notice before Monday -- so maybe there is some hope of this being 
canceled yet.  

In the meantime, INGAA is moving forward to prepare for the conference.   
Speakers friendly to our cause include INGAA - Joan Dreskin, AGA, Williams - 
Scott Turkington, and ENA.  Dominion is a mixed bag.  They oppose more strict 
rules -- but since they have already been applied in their merger, they may 
also say that such conditions should be applied to all.  

Joan Dreskin's comments will be very generic in opposition to rule changes 
and WIlliams will be fairly negative.  I'm afraid they come off as a bit too 
defensive.   So, basically the best case will likely be made by Leslie Lawner 
of ENA.   She knows the % capacity that ENA holds on our pipes.  She is aware 
of transactional data that is out there.  She has been briefed on the 
Dominion merger conditions (extension of the rules of all affiliates, logs of 
affiliate communications and visits, etc).  

I know that you probably already read Jan's summary of comments.  If you are 
interested, here are INGAA's working papers.

 - marketing affiliate comments 1-09-01.doc
 - Questions.doc

Please let me know next week if there is any specific point or argument (e.g. 
Drew's Funny Money email) that we would like to ask Joan or Leslie to 
raise.   Otherwise, I expect that we will have the opportunity to file a 
detailed reply after the conference.
