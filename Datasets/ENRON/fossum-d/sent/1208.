Subject: Start date for Martha on new job


Did Bill Cordes talk to you yesterday about the start date for me to move to 
his area?  He had mentioned to me about training with Virginia this week and 
possibly starting next week but that was before he talked with you.  Bill did 
not mention to Virginia what was decided on this and she just called me to 
see what I know.  I told her I would talk with you about it as Bill's is out 
of town for two days.

Thanks...........
Martha Benner
