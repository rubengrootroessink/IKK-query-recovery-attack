Subject: More on El Paso Protest of ENA Purchased Capacity



Marathon and Phillips Join Protest

    Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their
joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess
capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have
joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The
protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity
assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks
ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case
settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell
part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than
PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to
protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at
other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point,
the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis
differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large.
Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis
differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the
excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California.

Speculators Reduce Long Ratio

    Speculators have reduced the size of their bets on rising NYMEX crude oil
futures during the two weeks ending last year. Speculator long positions now
outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two
weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a
post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at
$25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds
and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from
44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions
doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish
about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much
more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of
longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural
gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They
had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a
lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high.
The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil,
heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

Contract    Date    Long            Short       L - S

EPRI Launches Customized Technical Support Services Subsidiary

   A new subsidiary of the Electric Power Research Institute will offer
customized technical support services to both members and non-members of its
research program. EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten
the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of
collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers
to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their
particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff
of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For
example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex.
can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses
before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in
Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and
maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such
integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt
and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for
load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market
management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting
as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource
data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line
monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants.
EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing
subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to
conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain
rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this
activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized
technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work
lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission
and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary.

HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN!

    Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last
month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will
prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City
over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under
those conditions, they have since 1993. Call it ?Rader?s Stupid Frozen Turkey
Theory? or call it storage fundamentals, but be prepared in case this silly
theory comes true one more year. For an in-depth, wellhead to burnertip study
of the natural gas industry, following is the winter schedule for the
original Natural Gas 101? training courses. Or call to set up an in-house
course at your convenience.

Oxy and EOG Swap Properties

    Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources have exchanged oil and natural gas
fields to cut costs and boost production. Oxy received fields in California
that produce about 12 MMcf per day and mineral rights to more than 700,000
acres of land in the state. It also received properties in the western Gulf
that produce 26 MMcfe per day, adjacent to fields Oxy already owns. EOG
received properties in eastern Texas that are next to fields it owns and
which produce 33 MMcf per day and 3,000 barrels of oil a day. It also
acquired exploration rights on 312,000 acres in the Oklahoma panhandle.

Callon Natural Gas Blowout

    Callon Petroleum had a natural gas blowout while drilling a test well in
the Gulf of Mexico and a fire is burning from a portion of the well. There
were no injuries at the  at South Marsh Island Block 261 well, about 60 miles
south of Lafayette, Louisiana. The fire is burning from a portion of the well
casing about 20 feet above sea level. Wild Well Control, a well-blowout
specialty company, is making preparations to bring the well under control.
