Here is the latest on timetable on Gallup.  Susan, please get your edits on 
the draft to Donna and me by tomorrow.  (call me if you need more guidance on 
what I have in mind).   Donna or Keith, please let me know what additioonal 
information you are waiting on and what the likely timetable for filing is.  
Also, Keith, what was the answer from ops/planning on whether unloading the 
20,000 of fuel from the San Juan would help with more flexibility or 
capacity?  If you haven't been able to get a meaningful answer, let me know 
who to call and I'll try.

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were 
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take 
the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't 
be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC 
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request 
for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite 
things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to 
avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral.  
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional 
horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional 
capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything 
possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional capacity 
out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts too..  I would 
like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to get 30 to 50 
MMCF/D. 

Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am 
willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.
