Excellent idea!!  There is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot 
air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for 
him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and 
customers to pour money into a hole in the ground!

I was in Houston Wednesday and got a chance to catch up a little with the 
hooker&cooker tandem.  You may know that David has started into a new venture 
selling either compressed air or energy from compressed air (he's not sure 
which yet).  We agreed that his only concern is that you might want to enter 
the market because with all your hot air, the market would be saturated!
