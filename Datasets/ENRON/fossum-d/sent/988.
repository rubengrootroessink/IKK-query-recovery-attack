Drew -- I have you scheduled to get a Compaq M300 laptop -- very light.  Your 
laptop can be a "Legal Group" laptop.   Thanks.  Jean

When you guys give me a new computer, can I get a (smaller) laptop with some 
kind of docking station???  I don't need a desktop if I get a good laptop.. 
I'd suggest we keep the IBM laptop as the department's roving laptop if it is 
upgradable to Windows 2000.  Thanks.  DF
