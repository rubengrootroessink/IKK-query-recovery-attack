This list looks much better than the other one.  Please make sure that we are 
clear with the FERC people that this is a list of AA projects related to CWIP 
and not a list of everything under the sun that AA does for us.  I want to 
avoid any appearance that we misled the FERC people.  Thanks. DF

Here's the list, which is limited to CWIP, that we would send to the FERC 
auditors.  I'll await Drew's OK before sending. Thanks, Gary.

Gary -

Revised to include SAP projects related to property.  Let me know if you have 
any changes.
