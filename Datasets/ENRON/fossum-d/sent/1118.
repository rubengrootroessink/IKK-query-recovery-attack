Colleen has some useful expertise because of her work on the Clifton Machine 
Shop project (i.e., setting up a new business entity within the ETS 
organization).  Tony and Lee have some time if Colleen's plate is full.  
Either one of them, relying on Colleen for "best practices" input as needed, 
might be a good team.  DF

We will also need someone from legal working on the structure/deals.
Mike:    Who should we be adding to the group looking at this stuff?

I would like to get someone from the Financial Review team involved with this 
project as it is getting off the ground on how one would financially 
structure such a "business".  I do not want this to get too far along without 
this type of input so that if and when it is presented for approval all 
financial i's and t's have been dotted and crossed.  Who would this be in 
your group?   Thanks...cvb
