Jean,

I have removed Drew from the CMS routing system.  You are free to go ahead 
and update his PC to Outlook and Windows 2000!

Thanks

Linda

I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish 
that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end 
end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on 
their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that 
allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df
