Please see attached notes of the last meeting with PGE on Topock pcb 
problem.  Lou will be coordinating development of a litigation strategy in 
case PGE cuts our deliveries below 250 mm/d or pursues decon. of the Topock 
compressor (with the expectation that we will pay for the work under the 
operating agreement indemnity).  I volunteered your services, and my own, to 
assist with this work.  I believe the next step is for Lou to set up a 
meeting to discuss.  Thanks.  DF

Mike - please see the redlined changes. As you can see my skills in 
manipulating a table are limited.   Thx.
