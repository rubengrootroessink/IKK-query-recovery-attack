I don't see anything controversial in Leslie's outline.  We've done  a lot of 
thinking about Dynegy's "funny money" argument and I volunteer Maria to work 
with you and Leslie on making sure ENA's comments are consistent with ours on 
this and all related issues.  DF

FYI - Attached are ENA's preliminary thoughts on comments for the marketing 
affiliate conference.  They are not certain yet whether they want to sponsor 
a participant at the discussion table.
