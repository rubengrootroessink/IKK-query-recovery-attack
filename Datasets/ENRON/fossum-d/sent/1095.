I've just been invited to a couple of meetings on Friday PM--the kind of 
meetings where the word "invited" is used humorously.  I think I'm still 
clear after 4:00 pm Omaha time so could be dialed in after then if it would 
be useful.  Sorry to be such a pain inthe ass but getting fired would be a 
real inconvenience right now so I'd better post at these meetings.  I'll have 
Martha coordinate with you guys.
