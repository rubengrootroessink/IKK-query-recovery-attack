Bummer--it would have been a hoot.  Drinking and guns go together like ham 
and eggs.  I'm in a meeting from 8:15 til 9 but then free for awhile--give me 
a buzz whenever its convenient. DF

Drewski:   I'm not going to be able to make it.  Bad timing unfortunately.
I call you this morning with the skinny.

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys
so he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot
at the rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out
to fast and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that
wouldn't be a problem.
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from
Omaha)
$$:       $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle
to less than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if
some of you can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per
room+ $25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due
around this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4,
right?  Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone
else that's interested other than the folks that have already been invited,
let me know as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have
around 10.  Talk to you.  DF
