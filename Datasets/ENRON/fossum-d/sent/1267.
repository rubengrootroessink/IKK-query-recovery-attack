Subject: Your Law Conference RSVP Form

Drew, just a FYI....I signed you up for golf at the Law Conference for 
Thursday afternoon....you were out of pocket and Martha said you like 
golf....I can change it to Skeet shooting or rafting on the Guadalupe if 
you'd rather do that.....!!!!! Seriously, let me know if you want me to 
change it....

Emily
