 I don't think the new policy helps us, but it would help an intrastate 
pipeline that wanted to interconnect with us.  DF

I assume this does nothing for our intrastate situation???

we probably ought to circle back together sometime next week to see where we 
are.  Eric, Tony and I will be in a data room tomorrow.  I wander off to see 
the Navajos on Monday and will not be back until late morning Tuesday.

Since I'm going to spend a fun filled Wednesday and Thursday with our PG&E 
friends - What does Tuesday afternoon look like????

Jan - can you follow up with everyone??  thx


Subject: FERC Announces New Pipeline Interconnect Policy Today

Please read the attached memo regarding the significant shift in the 
Commission's policy.   The policy sets out new interconnection criteria, but 
announces that a pipeline may not deny an interconnection on economic grounds.
