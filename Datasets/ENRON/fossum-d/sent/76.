I'm heading to KC tomorrow for a meeting with Langley and Tino on some goofy 
project.  Funny thing is, now that he is sitting on $100 mm, I take 
everything he says pretty damn seriously!   If word gets out, expect another 
huge dive in ENE price.  DF

Not a good day for the market in general.... Good thing I pay so little
attention to it (not).  By the way, I sent my application back to KU last
week.  I was going to send you a copy of what I mailed in, but who knows
whether I'll ever get that done.  Don't be surprised if they give you a
call....  drh

See ENE today?  Glad I didn't quit my day job.  DF

I wish.  As to your complaint about my failure to tip you off, there were
two primary reasons:  (1) if I told you and got caught I'd go to prison,
and, more importantly, (2) I had no clue. DF  (its better to be lucky than
good!)

Yeah, I've noticed it.  Particularly the run-up yesterday.  Hell no, I
don't own any ENE.  Why didn't you tell me this was going to happen?
Between ENE and our good old EMC, you really are closing in on
retirement.....

Check out ENE over the last 30 days.  I'm a few more weeks away from
retirement.  Do you own any?  DF
