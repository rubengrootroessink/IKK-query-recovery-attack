Lou--could you cover the Derrick meeting on the 12th if Dot is stuck on a 
hanging jury?    Again, I expect to be on the phone from Cal., but would like 
one of you guys on also in Houston in case of telecom screwups (which follow 
me whereever I go).  Thanks.  df

 Drew- 

 Staff meeting on Monday the 9th -- no problem.  I would be glad to cover the 
Derrick meeting on April 12; however, 
 I have jury duty that day (yuck)!

Yes, lets continue to have the pre-meetings formerly known as Mike's every 
Mon. at 8:30 (pls put on my calendar Emily).  
I'll be in Houston this Monday so just come to my office at 8:30 if you are 
both here.  Dot, pls cover the staff meeting on 
Monday, April 9 as I'll be on vacation.  Also, pls cover the Derrick large GC 
meeting at 9:00 am on April 12 as I'll be at NN's Keyex meeting in Cal.  (I 
may be able to call in to this but would like you to cover anyway in case 
something goes haywire). Thanks df

 If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for 
pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just 
 call Drew?   When?
