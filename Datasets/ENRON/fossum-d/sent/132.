STEAKS?  We got em--stay at our joint and eat big meat 3 times daily.  I've 
got the grill set up so I can flip steaks while sitting in the hot tub 
drinking beer--its sort of like that Yahoo TV commercial where the sad eskimo 
family radically changes their lifestyle by ordering the grill and hot tub 
off the web.  DF

If I come to Omaha, I'll need more 'an pics. I'll need a big steak. Find
