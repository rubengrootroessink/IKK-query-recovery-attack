Attached is my analysis based on a sales price of $14.2MM and $14.8MM with a 
buy back in the 7th year.  The loan structure for Hanover assumes that the 
difference between the sales price and TW's buy back price would be amortized 
over the contract term.  The remaining balance of the loan is assumed to be a 
balloon payment at the end of the finance term.

I will put together some analysis on a 9 year term and forward this on to you 
when it is completed.
