You probably need to look at this.This only addresses expenditure approval 
and does not address "execution" authority. Sometimes non VPs believe that if 
they can approve the expenditure then they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure even in the absence of a power of attorney. Accordingly 
it might be wise to expand the "Delegation" section of this policy.

FYI, based on comments received, attached is the draft which will be 
distributed to Stan's direct reports for comments. We plan to have the policy 
in place before the end of March.
