Darrell and Dale, below are the dates and hours last year for each month that 
Tri-State's system peak occurred.  In your estimation, during these peak 
times, could TW have turned down Gallup and avoided peak demand charges 
without impacting system volume and demand?

June 22  7pm
July 7  4pm
Aug 14  9pm
Sept 5  9pm

Notice the evening hour trend here?  Let me know what you find out.  Thanks

I will be available anytime Thursday after 9:30am. I am not sure what dollar 
amount because no one has told me what we lost. Yes, we are negotiating with 
them on some other deals that Lindy is working through at this time.

I've got a meeting set up with Knippa at 10:00 on Thursday .  Susan, please 
join me as Nemec will be there and he and you had most of the back and forth 
on the confidentiality issue.  Either Steve or Kevin need to give me some 
sense of our  authority .  Any thoughts on that??  Is the number still 
$200,000?  What would we be willing to settle for?  Is a renegotiation of the 
existing deal in the works anyway as part of the expansion scenarios?  I'll 
have martha set up a meeting Thur. am to discuss before we talk to Knippa.
