Paul Bieniawski's phone number is 713-345-8641.  Go ahead and give him a call 
just as a courtesy  to let him what you guys are looking at at Bushton and 
let him know I put you up to it.  If he has some useful off the cuff 
insights, great.  If not, that's fine also.  I don't expect you to send him 
any material or get him deeply involved--just give him a heads up.  DF
