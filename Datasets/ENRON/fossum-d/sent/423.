I'm not sure I understand MKM's comment.  We've all approved this deal so its 
not urgent, but lets talk about it in our meeting today.  df

This may have been the case in others, but the IOS does say that it bid, if 
less than max is not available.  If Drew and Susan are ok to sign off, I can 
go with that and we do need to be specfic as to what we are going to include 
in the contract in the IOS package.  Lets hope it doesn't come back to bite 
us, assuming Drew and Susan sign off.  MK

Mary Kay -  In all of Transwestern's previous Interactive Open Seasons, the 
only capacity which Transwestern had posted for bid purposes was the primary 
capacity - no associated alternate flexibility was ever posted as being 
available to the bidders.  We have traditionally relied on verbal 
communication, only if asked by the shipper,  of any potential alternate 
rights associated with the primary capacity being auctioned.  I do not feel 
that in this recent IOS process that any shipper had possibly NOT increased 
their bid due to the impression that there was no additional flexibility 
beyond  the primary path rights of the capacity being auctioned.  However,  I 
do think that the TW commercial group should discuss how we communicate to 
any interested party those alternate rights  associated with future IOS bids 
or EnronOnline bids.   Thank you for your comment, please contact me if you 
need any additional feedback.

I understand that this capacity is what was posted on the IOS, however,  
these alternate point rights were not included in the posting as available, 
is there a concern that not all were aware of this and therefore they could 
have bid differently ?  MK
