Subject: Vacation Carry Over

I will need to have any exception requests for vacation carry over (beyond 40 
hours) no later than February 15.  Any request you submit should have 
appropriate justification (i.e., what were the extenuating circumstances that 
prevented the employee from being able to take his/her vacation during the 
year).  Since carry-over reports can no longer be run by Payroll, timekeepers 
should be able to access year-end  vacation balances.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.
