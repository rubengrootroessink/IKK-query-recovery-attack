Drew, 
Not sure about gear sites for kid crash hats.?  Could try www.rei.com.? You 
could just get  them hockey goaly helmets for multi-use and just hanging 
around the house  wailing on each other.? Haven't been to Terry downhill 
skiing in a while  but went x-country last weekend with the doggies and 
there's a?LOT of  snow.? Brad and Jen are coming this weekend so we plan to 
check?Terry  out.? Should still be decent in a couple weeks.? We'll let you  
know.? Made it up to Hanna creek today fly fishing and cought a couple  
wopping 4 inchers.? Wound up augered into snow up to my waist.? Bring  your 
fishing gear in case the skiing sucks.? Definately bring your  x-country 
gear.? Maybe we could get out for a quick morning at Eagle Cliff  and still 
make it to Terry to meet up with everyone else by noon.
See you later, got to go walk  hounds
