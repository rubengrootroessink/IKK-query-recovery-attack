John,
I am forwarding the Level B estimate for the Gallup modification. This 
involves increasing the horsepower output (from 12,000  to 15,000 HP drive)at 
the station
with a consequent flow increase of 10mmcfd.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
thanks
ben

THERE WERE CHANGES IN DOLLARS DUE TO THE TESTING COMPLETED LAST WEEK. THE 
COMPRESSOR WHEEL 
IS ADEQUATE FOR CONDITIONS BUT IF PRESSURE CHANGES   WHEEL OR CASE MAY 
REQUIRE ATTENTION AT THAT TIME. 
THE DRIVE NEEDS TO DEVELOP 13,000 H.P.  AND WITH A SERVICE FACTOR OF 1.2, A 
15,OOO H.P. DRIVE IS RECOMMENDED.
