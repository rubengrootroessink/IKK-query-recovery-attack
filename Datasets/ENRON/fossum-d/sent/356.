I love this--even more so because it is being circulated by one of our

> Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
> said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
> provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout
> and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy
> monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.
> Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
> eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
> require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
> willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
> like the way they do business."
>
> A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
> together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
> both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
> retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
> millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades'
> high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make
> it a
> very attractive energy portfolio addition.
>
> Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
> approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
> growth rates over the last two thousand years. Enron is one of the world's
> leading energy and communications companies. The company owns
> approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron
> ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For if
> You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and is
> among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers
> with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.
