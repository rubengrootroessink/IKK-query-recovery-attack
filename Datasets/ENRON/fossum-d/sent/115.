Note new cost limits for building laterals within our existing blanket 
authorization (i.e., without seeking a specific certificate).  The $$ is 
probably still not high enough to give us ability to build the whole project, 
but it may give us some flexibility.  Thanks MKM.  
Also, has any one heard from Tino or Dennis in the last week or so?  I left 
Tino some voicemails on a question he had left for me, and the name of the 
Enron windmill guy, but haven't heard back.  Do we need to schedule a 
follow-up meeting with them to talk about turbine availability and regulatory 
options, etc? DF
