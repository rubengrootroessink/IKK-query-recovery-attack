Subject: Monthly Report on SLA Activity

Attached please find the February 2001 report showing current month activity 
in the System Levelized Account (SLA).  Information for this report comes 
from data provided by Gas Accounting Department.  Several items to note for 
this, the first distribution:
All non-shaded information on this report reflects the same data as shown on 
Exhibit No. 7 which has been provided to Northern's shippers in conjunction 
with Docket No. RP01-76-000 data requests.  (Only January data has been given 
to the shippers at this time.)
Columns (j) and (k) serve to highlight the segregation of the SLA account 
into its two components - cash and future liability.  The two columns add 
together to equal the total amount of the SLA account on the books (Column 
(i)). 
Column (j) reflects the cash portion of the SLA account, i.e. the actual 
amount of cash spent/(received) in maintaining Northern's operational storage.
Column (k) reflects the future liability portion of the SLA account, i.e. the 
future amount of cash to be spent/(received) in clearing the Dollar Valued 
Volume short/(long) position.  It is computed by multiplying the month-end 
Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position by the respective month's MIP. 

This file contains both the January and February report.  To print each 
month's report, simply click on the respective tab.

Call me with any questions.
