Subject: Latest Version of Segmentation Brief

Attached is the latest version of the Segmentation Brief.  You should note 
that it contains three new sections-III A (drafted by Mark Cook) and III C & 
D (drafted by Ken Driver).  I received some comments on the prior versions of 
these new sections, but did not incorporate them.  If your comments/concerns 
are not addressed in the new sections, let me know.

We hope to circulate tomorrow the title page and signature block.  The next 
version of the brief which will be circulated on Friday, March 30th, will 
contain table of contents, table of authorities and will be completely cite 
checked.  In the meantime, you will notice that there are several incomplete 
cites or record references.  We could use help completing these, if you have 
the information.
