This shouldn't impact ET&S since it is limited to Louisiana, but I've routed 
it to our commercial people for a quick double check.  If you don't hear from 
me by Monday, ET&S is OK.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: LRC Joint Venture

Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between 
Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline 
assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would 
restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business 
opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive 
with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include: 

(i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by 
American Electric Power Co. Inc.), 
(iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.); 
and 
(v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently 
ultimately owned by Koch Industries).  

In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation 
that you have no objection to the non-compete provisions in this 
transaction.  Please feel free to call Lance Schuler, Hal Bertram or me if 
you have any questions.

Regards,
Brian
