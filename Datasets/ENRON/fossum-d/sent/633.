Congratulations on the move!  Its great to see a reorg that actually seems to 
make so much sense!  Thanks again to you and Terry for watching the three 
stooges on Saturday night.  It was great seeing you guys again and getting 
the kids a chance to play for a while.  We'd love to return the favor next 
time you come up to Omaha--the weather is getting real nice right about 
now!!  DF

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.
