Subject: Need any law help?

A friend of a friend (Petula Workman) is looking for a part time legal 
position.
She is a great lawyer -- was on law review, people who worked with her love
her, but she just wants a part time gig since she is a mom with kid
responsibilities.

She wants to work part-time (20-24 hours/week) preferably employment 
litigation, but commercial litigation would work too.

If you have need or know of someone who does, let me know and I'll get her 
resume for you.

thanks
kevin hyatt
