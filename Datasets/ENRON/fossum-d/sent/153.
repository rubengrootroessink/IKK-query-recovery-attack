Maria, please take a look at this list of "Reference Entities" and the 
attached memo.  I doubt we have any reason to knock out any of the listed 
entities based on legal controversies, etc., but its worth a check .  From 
the attached memo, it looks like a more likely reason to disqualify an entity 
would be credit problems or some other commercial issue.  I'm in a bind today 
and out the rest of the week so it would be helpful if you could pick this 
ball up in my absence.   Please get back to me and Mike with the results of 
your analysis.  Thanks.  DF

As we discussed, attached is the new list of proposed reference entities.  I
