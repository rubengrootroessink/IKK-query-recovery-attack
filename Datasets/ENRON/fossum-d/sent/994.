I have been typing in his name and letting the computer address it.  I've now 
added his "@enron.com" address to my address book, so lets see if that does 
the trick.  Thanks!  DF

Drew:
Thank you for your note.  I saw an email in Danny's box yesterday from you 
with the same return mail, host unknown...

Do you have Danny listed in personal address book?   We experienced some past 
issues with his email address but, resolved it with new email address, 
dmccarty@enron.com
Are you selecting from the address books or typing in his name.  Please 
advise and I will look into the issue.
I will leave Danny a voice mail message and have forwarded your message to 
him.  It is currently in his email box.

Julie--pls forward to Danny.  I've had trouble the last couple of days 
getting emails to go through to him.  Am I doing something wrong?

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil
and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking
etc.  We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary
on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on,
there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may
get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I
talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or
two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup
if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d
project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.
