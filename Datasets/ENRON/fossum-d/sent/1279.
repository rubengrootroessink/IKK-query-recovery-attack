Subject: Kent Miller Promotion

Earlier this week, the Office of the Chairman announced that Kent Miller ha=
s=20
been elected a vice president of Enron.

Kent is the first (of what I hope will be several) such promotion(s) under=
=20
Enron=01,s new Performance Review Committee (PRC) process.  He and the othe=
r=20
individuals selected for promotion to vice president and managing director=
=20
were elected based on their track records.

In Kent=01,s case, he earned his appointment by demonstrating exceptional=
=20
leadership, innovation and excellent earnings performance in developing NNG=
=01,s=20
storage transactions, as well as in his other marketing responsibilities.

This round of promotions is noteworthy because it is the first based solely=
=20
on outstanding accomplishments, rather than on the availability of open=20
hierarchical positions.  As a result, while performance expectations contin=
ue=20
to increase, there will be far greater opportunity for advancement througho=
ut=20
the corporation.

Please join me in congratulating Kent on this achievement.
