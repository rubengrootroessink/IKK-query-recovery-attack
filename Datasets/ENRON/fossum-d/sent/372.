We won our motion yesterday to depose Conoco on the Rensvold documents 
questions so it sounds like they will also depose Steve Gilbert about the 
Imperial plant.  We're deposing the Enerfin rep today - hopefully we'll get 
him to tie the terminated contracts to the wells that were under those 
contracts (Conoco is now saying, "Well, how were they supposed to know what 
wells were tied to what contracts" - duh) and possibly when Conoco took over 
the accounting for the plant - we still haven't been able to locate an 
invoice earlier than Jan. 1990.  Anyway, HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!!!!!  Try 
a frozen margarita for a sore throat.  Works every time.
