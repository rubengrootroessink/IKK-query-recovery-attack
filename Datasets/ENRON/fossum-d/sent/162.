Reed and Lana, thanks again for a great stay in the hills!  We all had a 
blast and I'm happy to report that Britt and Tina are bragging to their 
little classmates about their newfound skiing prowess!  Next thing you know 
they'll be starring in a Warren Miller video!  Have a great time in BC and 
say hi to Brad and Jen for us.  DF
