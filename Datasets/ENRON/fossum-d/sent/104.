Jim - 
Great job on the Oelwein Incident presentation at the Safety Coordinators 
Workshop. I believe we all recognize that there is some legal risk in taking 
this proactive posture; I believe the risk to our employees is greater if we 
don't present lessons learned in a clear and prompt  manner. The comments I 
heard were very favorable, and many could relate this incident to ones they 
had been involved in. 

I love your standard opening of an open invite for an attorney joke, but of 
course am shocked that we would have field employees who have a joke ready!

Again, this sharing of information at this stage of the game adds 
considerable integrity to all of management.

Thanks again
Mike
