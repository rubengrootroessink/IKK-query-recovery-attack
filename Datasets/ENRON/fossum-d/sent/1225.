The author was obviously not aware that the Enron pipelines pride themselves 
in having standardized our "operational nuisances" !!  df

Subject: RE: Section 5 Argument of Segmentation Brief


 This brief is not very well written -- many legal mistakes and grammar is 
also really poor.  Here are my questions and 
 comments.  I did, however, enjoy reading about "the unique operational 
nuisances of every interstate pipeline".

Subject: Section 5 Argument of Segmentation Brief

Attached is the initial draft of the NGA Section 5 argument for the pipeline 
petitioners' joint brief opposing segmentation.

I have attached the document in both Word and WordPerfect.  The document was 
converted into WordPerfect from Word, which should explain any WordPerfect 
formatting problems.

The Statement of the Case for the segmentation brief will be circulated on 
Tuesday morning.
