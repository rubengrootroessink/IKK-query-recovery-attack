As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
our capacity posting squared away.  DF

Drew,
        Placement of a demarc delivery package on EOL necessarily means it 
was approved.  An after the fact note from Linda will suffice.

Subject: Request 39833, EOL Deal

Tenaska Marketing Ventures accepted a package on EOL yesterday that delivers 
to demarc.  Although EOL deals are pre-approved the CMS system is coded to 
route demarc deals to the president level.  In order to expedite the 
activation of this request and since it was a pre-approved EOL deal, I 
approved the route for each of you in CMS per a request from marketing.  

Please let me know if this process will not be agreeable on future EOL deals 
that include demarc.

Thanks

Linda
