Subject: USGT East - East Capacity deal  

Except for a small amount of capacity we're managing on a short-term basis 
[owing to the Topock lateral problem with PG&E], our West flow capacity is 
sold-out.  Therefore, there is really no means to compare the USGT alt. flow 
rights with an opportunity cost for unsubscribed firm capacity.  Moreover, 
the receipt points under the USGT deal are not on the San Juan Lateral, so 
any alt. West flow transportation will be marked against a Permian - Cal. 
Border price spread.  However, your instincts are probably correct regarding 
the practical use of the capacity -- if there is a market shift resulting is 
a significant widening of the East - West spread, then we'd likely see FTS-1 
shippers with primary rights more fully utilizing their firm capacity, 
thereby frustrating any USGT attempt to access Cal. Border capacity.

 Steve, Kevin, and Jeff: If what I heard this morning is correct and the San 
Juan-Cal. basis is up to about 25 cents, I trust that we will be selling our 
Cal Border capacity with primary point rights at rates significantly higher 
than the $.04 available to USGT/Aquila under this deal.  In other words, it 
is very unlikely that USGT will be able to move significant volumes to 
California under the $.04 part of this deal, right?  With that understanding, 
I'm OK on the deal.  Thanks. DF
