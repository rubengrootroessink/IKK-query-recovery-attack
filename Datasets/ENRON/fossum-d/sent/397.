Subject: Updating your profile information in the GIS system

As the Global VP/MD mid-year PRC draws closer, I want to take the opportunity 
to stress to you the importance of  updating your profile information in the 
GIS system.  Details on your current responsibilities, employment history, 
skills and education should have been updated by 7 July 2000.   For those of 
you that have not opened your profile in GIS, I urge you to do so as soon as 
possible to ensure that your profiles are current and complete.  

GIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  You may go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the GIS link, or just type eglobal.enron.com on 
the command line of the browser. 

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,
