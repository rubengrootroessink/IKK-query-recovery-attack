Subject: Draft May 9 Project Why Presentation

FYI.  Attached is a copy of the Project Why status presentation that will be 
made next week at Stan's May 9 staff meeting.  The purpose of the 
presentation was to present a list of brainstorming ideas from an Apr. 16 
offsite session to GPG management & get some preliminary feedback on the 
kinds of ideas they would like to see proceed.  It was never meant to be a 
definitive plan for implementing those ideas.  I always envisioned the 
individual commercial groups picking up on which ideas they liked and wanted 
to implement & developing their own detailed plans for implementing.
