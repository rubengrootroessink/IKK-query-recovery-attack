Per your request to ask AA where the chokepoint might be on renegotiating t=
he=20
electricity contract at Cunningham to backload the payments and expense the=
=20
payments as made; the response is attached below.

First, it was difficult to point them in exactly the right direction withou=
t=20
tipping them off as to exactly what you had in mind.

However, they thought I might be talking about the TW compressor monetizati=
on=20
project...and even though I denied it...that is what they were thinking whe=
n=20
they did the research.   To make a long story short, they indicate that=20
straight line amortization of the total contract payments is the way it=20
should be booked unless there are circumstances to the contrary that would=
=20
indicate a different allocation over time. =20

I don't believe we'll be able to get any good feedback from them on the=20
chokepoint issue.  It boils down to how blatantly you want to skew the=20
payments and whether they or FERC compliance auditors ever stumble across i=
t=20
in an audit.  If Accounting is not aware of such a contract with skewed=20
payments, then we would not be in a position to accrue expense on an=20
appropriate straight line basis over the life of the contract. =20

As to the issue of whether or not ENA should be a party to the transaction,=
 I=20
did not seek AA advice on this issue, but I do believe that use of ENA as t=
he=20
counterparty would double the chances for having the issue brought up in an=
=20
AA audit, since the issue could also surface in conjunction with AA's audit=
=20
of ENA.

Bob -

I left you a brief message on this, so I thought I'd send you a copy of the=
=20
guidance I was referring to.  In a nut shell, there is no pain threshold fo=
r=20
front end or back end loading the payments under a contract.  Generally, we=
=20
believe you would need to straight line the expense but I can't say for=20
certain without the details.

The below is from AA Interpretations and Examples "Accounting for Leases,=
=20
Interpretations of FASB Statements 13, 27, 28, and 98" - I've bolded the=20
applicable section.  Call me if you have any additional questions.=20

1-12. Facility Management Arrangements
In a typical facilities management arrangement, the vendor purchases from a=
=20
company ("customer") its existing data processing equipment and hires all o=
r=20
some of the customer's data processing personnel. The vendor is then engage=
d=20
to provide information technology services to the customer for an extended=
=20
period of time (typically 5 to 10 years).

Company's Obligation Under the Service Contract
Obligations under executory agreements that are contingent upon services to=
=20
be rendered in the future are not liabilities and should not be recorded=20
except to the extent losses are inherent in such commitments. No liability=
=20
should be recognized for a customer's future obligation under an informatio=
n=20
technology services contract unless it becomes probable that the customer=
=20
will incur a penalty or loss from termination of the contract.

An issue arises as to whether the sale of existing data processing equipmen=
t=20
or facilities to a vendor that uses the purchased property to provide=20
information technology services to the seller is, in substance, a sale and=
=20
leaseback transaction that should be accounted for separately under SFAS No=
s.=20
13, 28 and 98. An information technology services contract typically can be=
=20
distinguished from a lease for the following reasons:

The vendor is responsible for the financing and operation of the data=20
processing equipment and facilities.
Data processing personnel are employees of the vendor.
The vendor is not required to use the equipment purchased from the customer=
=20
to provide service to that customer and may use the equipment to serve othe=
r=20
customers.
The vendor provides guarantees regarding performance and retains risks=20
related to the operating costs.
The vendor is not entitled to payment unless the required services are=20
provided to the customer in accordance with specified standards.

As a result, generally we believe the sale of data processing equipment or=
=20
facilities pursuant to a facilities management arrangement should not be=20
unbundled and accounted for separately as a sale and leaseback transaction.=
=20
However, because of the customer's continuing involvement with the equipmen=
t=20
of facilities sold, we believe any gain or loss on the sale should be=20
recognized in a manner consistent with the guidance prescribed in paragraph=
=20
33  of SFAS No. 13 for sale-leaseback transactions.

Some outsourcing arrangements may involve dedicated equipment (so called,=
=20
"exclusive use equipment") that is physically located on the company's=20
premises and cannot be used by the vendor to service other customers. For=
=20
example, a significant amount of the equipment may consist of terminals or=
=20
work-stations operated by the company's personnel, such as point-of-sale=20
registers in a department store or design terminals in an architectural fir=
m,=20
and the vendor may have only limited ability to replace or remove that=20
dedicated equipment because of contractual provisions or practical=20
considerations. In these situations, the customer effectively contracts to=
=20
use the terminals or workstations for a specified period =01* a lease. Such=
=20
dedicated equipment should be unbundled from the information technology=20
services contract and accounted for separately as a sale and leaseback=20
transaction. In unbundling the equipment from the information technology=20
services contract, the portion of the fee paid to the vendor applicable to=
=20
the equipment lease should be estimated using whatever means are appropriat=
e=20
in the circumstances and the lease accounted for separately according to it=
s=20
classification (capital or operating)

If significant, the customer should consider disclosing its commitment unde=
r=20
the outsourcing arrangement. The disclosures required for any portion of th=
e=20
arrangement determined by the customer to be a lease are set forth in=20
paragraph 16  of SFAS No. 13.

Gain or Loss on Sale of Equipment or Facilities
Because of the interdependence of terms, there is no practicable and=20
objective way to separate the sale of data processing equipment, software,=
=20
facilities or "know how" from the service contract. For that reason, we=20
believe any gain or loss from the sale of data processing equipment,=20
software, facilities or "know how" pursuant to a facilities management=20
arrangement should be recognized similar to a sale and operating leaseback=
=20
transaction as prescribed in paragraph 33  of SFAS No. 13. That is, gain fr=
om=20
the sale should be recognized currently only to the extent such gain exceed=
s=20
the present value of the minimum payments due over the term of the service=
=20
contract, discounted using the seller's incremental borrowing rate. Any gai=
n=20
not recognized at the inception of the contract should be deferred and=20
amortized ratably over the term of the service contract as an adjustment to=
=20
the minimum annual fees expensed in each period. Further, if the fair value=
=20
of the property at the time of the transaction is less than its undepreciat=
ed=20
cost, a loss should be recognized immediately for the difference between th=
e=20
undepreciated cost and fair value, regardless of the amount actually receiv=
ed=20
from the vendor for the property transferred.

Expense Recognition
Payment terms may include fixed annual fees that increase or decrease over=
=20
the term of the service contract. These payment terms may be structured in =
a=20
high-to-low pattern (that is, to recognize the favorable price/performance=
=20
curve of data processing equipment/capabilities) or a low-to-high pattern=
=20
(that is, to recognize the estimated effects of inflation on future costs).=
=20
Further, there may be payment escalation provisions in the service contract=
=20
indexed to inflation and/or the volume of transactions processed by the=20
vendor. We believe total minimum fees to be paid pursuant to an information=
=20
technology services contract should be charged to expense on a straight-lin=
e=20
basis over the term of the contract unless the level of service performed b=
y=20
the vendor is not uniform over the term of the contract. If the level of=20
service is not uniform over the term of the contract, the amount of fees=20
attributable to the additional services to be rendered by the vendor should=
=20
be expensed ratably over the time periods the additional services are=20
provided by the vendor. The amount of fees attributable to the additional=
=20
services should be based on their relative fair value, as determined at the=
=20
inception of the contract, to the fair value of all services to be provided=
=20
by the vendor over the term of the contract.

The "term" of the information technology services contract includes the fix=
ed=20
non-cancelable term of the contract plus all periods, if any, for which=20
failure to renew the contract imposes a "penalty" on the customer in such a=
n=20
amount that a renewal appears, at the inception of the contract, to be=20
reasonably assured. The expression "penalty" should be interpreted broadly =
to=20
include requirements that can be imposed on the customer (a) by the vendor=
=20
(for example, a monetary penalty for not renewing the contract) or (b) by=
=20
factors outside the contract to disburse cash, forego an economic benefit o=
r=20
suffer an economic detriment. Factors to consider in determining if an=20
economic detriment may be incurred include the uniqueness of the equipment =
or=20
software, the "know how" of the vendor, the availability of comparable=20
replacement systems and data processing personnel or vendors, the disruptio=
n=20
to the company's business or service to its customers if the contract were=
=20
not renewed and the willingness of the customer to bear the cost associated=
=20
with replacing the vendor (either by bringing the functions in-house or by=
=20
engaging another vendor). The term of the contract should also include all=
=20
periods, if any, (a) covered by bargain renewal options, (b) preceding the=
=20
date at which the customer can exercise a bargain purchase option to=20
reacquire the equipment, software, facilities or data processing personnel=
=20
(see Interpretation 5(d)-3, "Bargain Purchase Option 'as Encumbered' by Fix=
ed=20
Price Renewals "), and (c) during which a loan from the customer to the=20
vendor or a guarantee of the vendor's debt, directly or indirectly related =
to=20
the leased property, is expected to be outstanding or in effect.

Future fee increases that depend upon a factor that exists at the inception=
=20
of the agreement, such as the consumer price index or the volume of=20
transactions processed by the vendor, should be included in the computation=
=20
of fixed fees to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of th=
e=20
contract based on the factor at the inception of the agreement. Increases o=
r=20
decreases in fees that result from changes occurring subsequent to the=20
inception of the agreement should be included in the determination of incom=
e=20
as they accrue.

Incentives Offered by the Vendor
A facilities management arrangement may include incentives for the customer=
=20
to sign the service contract. For example, an incentive implicit in a=20
facility management arrangement may be the vendor's assumption of the=20
severance liability for existing data processing personnel not retained by=
=20
the vendor. Other types of incentives include up-front cash payments by the=
=20
vendor, below market financing, excessive rental paid to lease space from t=
he=20
customer, equity transactions (purchase or sales/grants) with the customer =
at=20
off-market terms, and so forth.

The fact that the vendor "assumes" a loss or cost does not negate the=20
customer's need to immediately recognize the loss or expense. The amount of=
=20
the loss or cost assumed by the vendor should be estimated by the customer=
=20
using whatever means makes sense in the particular facts and circumstances.=
=20
The customer should recognize the loss immediately by a charge to income an=
d=20
the offsetting deferred credit (incentive) should be recognized ratably ove=
r=20
the term of the service contract in proportion to the fixed contractual fee=
s=20
expensed in each period. Similarly, incentives that result in the recogniti=
on=20
of an asset or a deferred charge should be reported on the balance sheet at=
=20
the amount received or fair value, and the offsetting credit (incentive)=20
recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.
