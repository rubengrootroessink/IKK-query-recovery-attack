...So it would not have to be disclosed in our Form 2.  This was at Rod 
Hayslett's request (via Tracy Geaccone.)

Don't know why I didn't think to look in Secretariat:

http://home.enron.com:84/secretariat/CDS12547.htm


It's currently a sub of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Is this the best 
positioning for legal/regulatory purposes?  I liked your idea, Drew, of 
having it be a sub of Enron Pipeline Company.

If it's a sub of TW, it'll get disclosed in the TW Form 2.  I don't know 
whether that's a concern for you.
