Lisa, as the pipelines are very interested, I will be covering Monday's 
technical conference on the Producers' petition for a temporary restraining 
order to prevent SoNat from shutting in natural gas supply upstream of the 
Toca processing plants in Louisiana.  

I am happy to send you a copy of my summary of that conference.  If you have 
particular interests outside of the general legal arguments and Staff 
position, let me know and I will listen for your issues as well.

-Nancy
