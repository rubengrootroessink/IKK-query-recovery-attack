Drew - Just wanted to follow up on our discussion on Monday about new 
services, especially hourly firm.   As we discussed
our team does not see a need to create or offer this service at this time.   
However, we did not get a chance to discuss the merits of going forward 
anyway to act on the receptivity of FERC to these services.   Please give me 
a call or let me know when we can stop by to discuss briefly.  I would like 
Tim to participate in the discussion as well.  He is out today meeting w/
GRE and will be back on Friday.

Thanks.  John 

PS - I could give you a quick update on Hubbard at that time also.
