Apparently, someone has told Stan that they can make some changes to the 
horsepower and some of the piping and increase thruput by 30 to 50 MMcf/d.  
Steve Harris told Drew that the theory had not been proven as of yet.  Steve 
was surprised with the announcement.  I'm told that Stan believes that 
operationaly we can be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2001.  
Apparently Stan has talked with someone at FERC about expidited treatment (I 
do not have confirmation on this. It is all hear say.).  Terry Galasinni and 
I have a meeting tomorrow (12/21/00 in the PM) to discuss what is happening 
and how we are to get the information quicker.

Donna is continuing to work on the 10 MMcf/d expansion.  Once we know exactly 
what is happening we will modify our filing to match.

An update on the possibility of moving 20 MMcf/d off the San Juan Lateral and 
the cleaning of the lateral.  I have talked with planning and they have 
confirmed that if we only flow 850 MMcf/d on the lateral and by cleaning the 
line they can increase the suction to the Gallup compressor to 775 psig, the 
existing equipment will work to gain the incremental 10 MMcf/d from east of 
Thoreau to the California border.  We are going to meet with Bob McChane 
today to discuss.

Keith

Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting 
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval 
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.
