Drew, I have reviewed your performance review and action plan.  Just a couple 
of suggestions:  I would add any constructive feedback you have received from 
the clients.  I do not want her to perceive this review as only "what Drew 
thinks".  In the 'Performance Improvement Plan' I would add a time line to 
these expected improvements.  She must show significant improvement in the 
following areas during this next:  six months, 30 days, 60 days (whatever you 
deem appropriate).  I would also suggest one more action item.

"Lee must improve on collaboration efforts on projects.  She needs to take 
the initiative to seek expertise, assistance and direction from peers/clients 
to effectively complete projects.  This can be accomplished by openly 
communicating the status of projects with management and clients."

Attached is a first draft of a performance management plan for Lee.  I also 
attach my draft review form.  Please give me your thoughts on anything else 
to add to the plan.   I'm obviously struggling a little.
