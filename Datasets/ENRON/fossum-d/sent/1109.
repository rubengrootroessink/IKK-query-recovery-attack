No, but MKM apparently thought this issue did impact the idea of uniformity 
of approach among the pipelines, which is Shelley's turf.  df

Drew, do I now have to run all tariff filings by Shelley too?
I am not complaining, because she always has good input, but I don't want to 
be in a TW Options situation ever again.  Please advise.

Here is a slightly revised version of a tariff filing to allow TW to allocate 
alternate firm by price.
I know everyone has been busy, but please try to get comments to me next 
week.  Thanks.

Please see the attached.  As you can see, there are a couple of issues we 
probably need to discuss.  Please let me know your comments and questions.  

(We do not have a target filing date yet; after we reach a consensus on what 
this is going to look like, how rates will be calculated, etc., Ramona will 
be better able to determine how much time will be needed to make the 
necessary system changes.)
