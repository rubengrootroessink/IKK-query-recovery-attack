Subject: Draft GPG Presentation for Sept. 19 Conference


Attached is a draft set of slides and notes for Dave Neubauer's remarks at 
the Sept. 19 FERC Technical conference.  The presentation is built around 
Dave's outline of the six elements of making pipeline capacity "tradeable" 
that he described at the last regulatory roundtable. {Look at powerpoint 
presentation in notes view to see the text}

As you'll see, we are not  advocating for specific regulatory changes in the 
presentation.   Our message is that the Commission does not need to force 
segmentation and one-size-fits-all policies to make capacity trading a 
reality.   Rather,  some minor adjustments, together with growing industry 
acceptance of capacity trading are all that is necessary to make it happen.




Dave's Other Panelists:
Altra will also be on Dave' panel and will talk about trading (most likely 
why their exchange model is superior to EOL). 
Jeff Holligan of Amoco will likely speak about the need for forced pipeline 
capacity auctions as a means to eliminate marketing affiliate concerns and 
the need for standardization to promote liquidity.  
Diane McViker of Salt River Project will talk about why pipelines should be 
willing to keep supplier records for shippers as part of the recent GISB 
cross-contract ranking 
Robert Levin of NY Mercantile Exchange will talk about factors that improve 
liquidity and whether gas markets are liquid today.
Jon Wilems of the Wisc. Distributor group will also speak about greater 
commodization of capacity to develop trading of capacity.
