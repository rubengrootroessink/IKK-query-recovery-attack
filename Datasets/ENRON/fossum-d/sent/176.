Thanks for keeping me in the loop on this.  I've known Briden for years and 
would be happy to help out if it would be useful.  DF

Subject: Estimates for potential new IPP Loads

Marketing needs an "order of magnitude" estimate for two IPP projects that 
are being developed-  one is NW Arizona, the other off the Panhandle 
lateral.  These estimates are for purposes of preliminary scoping of the 
project(s).  The Caithness Sandy Project is a little farther along in the 
development process. 

I know we've considered the Wikiup location before as being a possible "first 
drop-off" point for the Panda lateral, but for purposes of this analysis, 
let's look at the Caithness (Wikiup) as a stand alone project.  

With respect to the Panhandle lateral project, do we even have enough flowing 
gas supply to handle this load consistently?  Can we meet the pressure 
requirement?

Since we're probably looking at Timberline-type estimates I'm assuming this 
isn't too long a putt for you guys.  Can you give me a time frame to get back 
to me with something, first on Caithness, then on Panhandle?  Thanks.
