Dear Energy Bar Association-Houston Chapter Member:

Attached is a notice of our first EBA Houston Chapter luncheon of 2001,
scheduled for Wednesday, February 14th.  We are pleased to have Brent
Bailey, General Counsel of Duke Energy North America, and Jeff Dasovich,
Director of Regulatory Affairs for Enron's California operations, joining us
to share their perspectives on the energy crisis in California.  This should
be an interesting and timely discussion.

Please print out and return the attached notice to confirm your seat for the
luncheon at the Hyatt Regency-Downtown.  The notice will be distributed by

See you there!
