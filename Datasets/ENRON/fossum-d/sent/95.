  I just received this from David and have not had a chance to review but, 
thought we should get it to you as soon as possible.  David is completing a 
thorough review of the proposal and will be forwarding to us by end of this 
week.  If you see anything in this that cause you immediate concern please 
let Drew, David and I know.  I will forward David's review when he completes 
it.  Thanks.  John D.
