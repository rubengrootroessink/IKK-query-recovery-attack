Sack, lets see you try this with United flight #1292 from Memphis to Peoria.  
Hope all goes well in the airline bidness and hope to see you soon.  It won't 
be on one of your flights, however, as I've instructed my travel staff to 
avoid United just in case I get you and you decide to try out your old top 
gun moves on a DC10 or whatever the hell you fly!  DF
