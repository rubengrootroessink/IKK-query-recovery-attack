     Dear Ms. Miller:

          In order for the Commission staff to fully evaluate the
     request for emergency relief, we require information in addition
     to that which was submitted by San Diego Gas & Electric Company
     in its petition and the intervenors in their comments and
     protests.  Pursuant to section 14(a) of the Natural Gas Act, 15
     U.S.C. =0F5 717m(a)(1994), please respond to the attached data
     requests no later than January 16, 2001.  Response(s) should be

     intervening parties in the proceeding.  In addition, please
     provide a copy of the response(s) to James A. Pederson (Room 72-
     27). =20

          To the extent you believe privileged treatment is
     appropriate, section 388.112 of the Commission's regulations sets
     forth the procedures for requesting such treatment for some or
     all of any information submitted to the Commission.  The
     Secretary of the Commission will place documents for which
     privileged treatment is sought (in accordance with section
     388.112) in a nonpublic file while the request for privileged
     treatment, or any challenge to such request, is pending before
     the Commission.
