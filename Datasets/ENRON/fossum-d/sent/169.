Subject: First Quarter Forecast

Please review the attached forecast package and send any questions or 
comments to me by 2:30 PM on Friday, March 10th in lieu of an officer review.

A few items to note:  The first quarter is up from our last forecast by 
$5.1MM primarily due to timing of O&M expenses and margins.  The total year 
is flat to Plan.  I have left the upside in the 1st quarter until we meet 
with Rod on Monday to assess where GPG or Corporate need us to be.  We can 
shift some of the upside to 2nd quarter if needed.  We have also collapsed 
the variance explanations to show the changes to date from Plan.

Base gas has been increased by a net of $10MM from Plan, made up of an 
increase in the gain of 11.4 in the 2nd qtr. less SBA fees of (1.2) in 3rd & 
4th qtrs. and legal fees of (.2) in O&M in 3rd qtr.

All of the updates included in the mini-current estimate have also been 
incorporated.  Margin and O&M detail sheets include only the first quarter.

When you open the excel file, you will be asked whether you want to update 
linked information.  Please choose NO.  Once the file is opened, click on 
"file," "print," and then click "entire workbook" and then "OK."  You should 
have a cover sheet with 9 pages behind it.  The graph is in a separate file 
and is only one page.

Please let me know if you have any trouble printing, and we can fax you a 
copy.

Thanks,  Elaine
