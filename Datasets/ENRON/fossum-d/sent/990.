Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the 
higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the 
line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 
10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 
775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF

Drew, the information below is the same as Terry Galassinni gave me.  It 
looks though as the HP is still short, but I maybe reading it wrong.

Subject: Gallup Horsepower

The following is information requested by Terry Galassini:

Operating Points 1A and 1B have a 750 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 1A and 80 Degrees F for 
1B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup; however, 
Rolls would have to agree to a faster spin of the current compressor wheel as 
explained in the cases.  Without approval from Rolls, a new aero, $125,000, 
would be required.The motor horsepower is the crital component.  Mr 
Eisenstein will have to comment on motor capability.
 
Operating Point #1A

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 12,442 Feet
Acfm = 10,827 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,300 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 13,369 ?Hp/9,970 KW *)?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,456 @ 79% (Required Power to Motor = 13,539 ?Hp/10,100 KW *)?* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Two options exist for this case.??The first is to increase the compressor wheel speed from its current maximum ?continuous 9,450 Rpm speed to 9,922 Rpm (+5%).  The wheel was shop tested to ?10,868 Rpm (+15%).  Rolls would have to advise the warranty and saftey ?considerations.  If agreed to by Rolls, the current wheel would need to ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 9,625 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,528 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 102.11 Ft3/Sec
Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 102 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
Problems.

The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,625 Rpm 
suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
less than 1,528 as calculated above.  Again, Mr. Eisenstein would have to 
comment on motor capability.


Operating Point #1B

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure

Operating Points 2A and 2B have a 775 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 2A and 80 Degrees F for 
2B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup at the 
current speed limit.  Whether or not the current motor at the site is capable 
of meeting the 2A and 2B conditions without modifications is left up to Mr. 
Eisenstein.  

Operating Point #2A

775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 10,841 Feet

The current wheel would ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 8,900 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,413 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 98.57 Ft3/Sec
