This weekend on Tony Dean's Outdoors (the guy from Pierre) they featured a 
farm near Kennebec.? It is just South of where we were last year.? They 
appear a bit more organized with dogs and real guides.? I thought you might 
like their site.? I would guess that they are way more expensive than our 
guy, reinforcing our sense that we got a good deal.
