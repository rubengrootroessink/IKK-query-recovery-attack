Come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets 
whacked.  What a weird deal that is.  Anyway, when do you think the new IMacs 
will be out in stores?  I still havent' got around to buying Sandra her IMac 
and now she thinks she wants the IMac notebook so its a good thing I didn't 
do this last month.  Do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or 
should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old 
ones out?  DF
