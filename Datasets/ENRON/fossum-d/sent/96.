Well, there you have it.  We waited and we blew it.  What a bunch of 
dummies.  Next time someone calls and gives me a special deal thats only 
available for a limited time, I'll jump on it!   Kevin, please let me know 
what Steve, Bill, and Stan ultimately decide to do on this.  Thanks. DF

Subject: TW Gallup - Gas Conversion Pricing



Now given the close of business today and the concern regarding price movement
since Monday I have requested new pricing information again.  The appearance 
is
that the numbers have moved.  I suspect that we have missed the upward price 
movement
associated with the "Winter of 2000" the last few days.  

I hope we can get a defined process to capture a short term price movement or 
we may 
be faced with gas prices between March and April (which is the in-service 
targeted) that 
we don't even want to mention.  

Let me know.
