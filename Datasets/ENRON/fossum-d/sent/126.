Sorry, I forgot to answer your last question.  I think its fine to send the 
documents out to Hanover.  Even if some of the blanks are not filled in, we 
can get their lawyers looking at the structure.  DF

Drew - Do I need some kind of confidentiality agreement? An attorney present 
to discuss at first meeting?

MKM - One questions Jim Gill had was how do we get around FERC requirements - 
someone from Regulatory available to discuss at first meeting or.....?

Although we believe the operating agreement and other details are in order, I 
hadn't just planned to send them as is to Hanover. Some counseling may be in 
order here, as I'm moving into new territory for me......

Mike,

Talked to Jim Gill at 4:30 pm.  They are very interested.  He proposed the 
following steps:

1)  Send him an equipment list.  I think the Description and Location 
Schedule 1.1 from the P&S Agreement would more than suffice.

2)  He would like to visit the stations with the Hanover V.P. of Operations 
and one other person.  (He indicated 3 total.)  A quasi due diligence look at 
the condition of the facilities.  He would like access to records etc. during 
his visit.

3)  We could set down and talk "financials" after that.

He did not seemed surprised that I did not have good station plot plans to 
supplement the equipment list.  I will get a package together tomorrow.  
[Forgot to get his address. dah!]

I conjectured that you would want to discuss this with him further tomorrow.  
He said he would be in all day.

Charlie
