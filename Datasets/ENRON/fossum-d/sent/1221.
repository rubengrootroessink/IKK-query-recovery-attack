 You will need to add Drew FOssum to the list on officers on several

Going forward, I would appreciate your informing me of any change affecting 
the slates of the Directors and Officers of ETS entities.  As the liaison 
between this office and the Corporate Services office, I'm frequently 
questioned about these changes.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Bill
