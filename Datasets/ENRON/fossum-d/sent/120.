Lets defer to MKM's group on whether to seek a waiver on this.  I don't see 
any real value to us of solving Mewbourne's problems for them.  DF

Subject: TW/Mewbourne

Earlier this afternoon, Mike Sheppard, the attorney for Mewbourne, called 
requesting that we file for a waiver for Mewbourne's two projects.  He passed 
on how he had talked with FERC, Lee Huber and Shelley Corman about the new 
Landowner notification for both projects.  He now realizes that TW is 
required to do Landowner notification, but has the ability to file for a 
"Waiver" from FERC.  He wants TW to file for the Waiver to reduce the number 
of days before Mewbourne can flow gas.  It is my understanding that the OGC 
was open to granting a waiver expediently in the event there is no ground 
disturbance.

Mewbourne - Two Projects:

Hemphill Co. Interconnect - 
Mike S. asked why we couldn't move ahead on filing for the Waiver for the 
Hemphill project.  I told him that before we could move ahead we will need 
additional information.  First, we would need the legal description of the 
location, line number of the line the interconnect was to be connected to and 
who is the landowner(s)  that would be impacted.  He said that he would 
forward the landowner's name to me.  The one question that I did not have an 
answer for are environmental clearances required?  Because we are to have the 
environmental approved dates prior to work commencing (required for Blanket 
projects).  Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to activate the valve 
does TW need to cross other private properties reach the site?"
Information needed for the waiver:

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 

SE New Mexico - 
 On this project Mike S. was not aware that TW had to excavate to make the 
connection to Mewbourne.  In this project, TW must inspect the valve and 
operator (tie-in point) for damage.  Environmental must review to see if 
clearances are required for the required digging.  Because there is ground 
disturbance, the landowner(s) will need to sign a waiver for the 30 day 
notice.  This waiver by the landowner would be filed with FERC.  Another 
question that Mike was unable to answer "is this project on Tribal lands?"  
Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to excavate the valve does TW 
need to cross other private properties reach the site?"  

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 Landowner "Waiver Consent"


Michele, earlier had a conversation with Shelley on how filing for waiver may 
help the overall outcome of Landowner Notification ruling.  By showing FERC 
how the rule is affecting not only the pipeline, but how it affects producers 
and landowners may help in changing the rules.

Please review and give me you input.  If we are to file for a Waiver, 
Certificates will all of the above information.  Mike Sheppard is a 
persistent person and wants to flow gas as many of you already know.

Thanks

Keith
