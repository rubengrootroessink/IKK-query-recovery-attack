Subject: RC Reports - Salary Allocations to Work Orders

To: Distribution
From: Eric Benson

In doing some research for Dorothy regarding salaries charged to work orders, 
I was advised by Judy Lin and James Weitekamp with accounting, that we need 
to provide Judy Lin with a payroll fixed percentage distribution by 
employee.  For example:

RC - 0237 Eric Benson .10 Navajo Work Order (work order number)
    .90 salary charged to RC

The report to Judy should be for each employee within your respective RC's.  
I have the allocation or percentages for Lou's RC but do not have the 
percentages for Drew and Dorothy.  If you like, please provide this 
information to me and I will be happy to send the request on to Judy Lin in 
accounting who will make all necessary corrections for January and February 
payroll.

Eric
