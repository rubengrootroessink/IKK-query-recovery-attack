Drew,

Congratulations!  I can think of no better person for the job!  I look 
forward to seeing you in the hallways of the Enron Building!  I hope you and 
your family will love living in Houston as John and I do.  See you soon, Kim.

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.
