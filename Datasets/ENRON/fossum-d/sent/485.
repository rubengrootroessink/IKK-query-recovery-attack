Great!  L.D. is sending around a new slightly modified term sheet--lets talk 
tomorrow.  I want to get Lee into this also.  Thanks.  DF

Drew, thanks so much for your messages yesterday.  Received the e-mail and 
look forward to discussing it with you - I definitely think I can fit it in 
with my other work (at least I would like to give it a shot).  You know how 
things go...  everything is supposed to happen at once but it never does.  Kim
