Mr. Fossum,

Just today I discovered that Enron NNG recently advertised an attorney job
vacancy in Omaha.  My wife and I are native "Omahans" and wish to return to
the area.  Out of hope that you have not yet filled the position, I am
attaching a cover letter and a resume for your consideration.

Thank you for any consideration you might extend me.
