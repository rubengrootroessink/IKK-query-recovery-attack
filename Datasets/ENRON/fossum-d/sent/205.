Subject: Mastio Survey

Attached below are the Mastio Survey presentations for TW, NNG and NBPL which 
are to be reviewed with Stan and his direct reports on March 30. I want to 
thank everyone for their time and effort in reviewing the findings and 
recommendations for the Action Plans for each pipeline. The next steps will 
be to make sure we focus on addressing the areas stated in the Actions Plans. 

I also want to take the time to thank Tammy Lee-Jaquet for all her efforts in 
pulling this information together for TW & NNG. In addition, Kirsten Hand was 
instrumental in analyzing our information.  We could not have done this 
project without them. GREAT JOB!!

This is only the first phase of this project which means we now have the task 
to ensure we address the areas of the Action Plans. More to come!!

Thanks again everyone. Julia
