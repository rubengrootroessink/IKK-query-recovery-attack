Subject: Meeting with Sheila Tweed

Drew, Sheila's assistant called me and said Sheila is on vacation tomorrow 
and will be back in the office Thursday.  He did leave her a voice mail also 
in case she could arrange a meeting with you after 1:30 and/or before 4:00 
tomorrow...I'll let you know when I hear something....
