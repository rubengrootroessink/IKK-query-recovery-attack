I'd drop the dash in "rate-bid" but otherwise am OK.  Thanks. DF

We have modified the last sentence of the rate paragraph on p. 3 and have 
added another sentence as follows:  The one-part rate bid shall be inclusive 
of all applicable reservation, commodity, and surcharges, and exclusive of 
applicable fuel.  The shipper with the accepted bid will be billed the 
product of the rate-bid and the total contract quantity for the term of the 
agreement."  

Pls. provide any comments to me ASAP.  Thanks, Maria
