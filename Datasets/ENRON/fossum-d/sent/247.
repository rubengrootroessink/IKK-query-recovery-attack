Mike, I hadn't seen your email when we talked today.  I'm fine with whatever 
approach you want to take with the documents.  I'll call in for the meeting 
with Stan tomorrow.  I have the phone number.  Sorry we got cut off on the 
MOPS issue today.  I'm a little communication impaired up here, but I'll call 
on Wed. or Thur. on MOPS.  in the mean time, please grab whoever you need 
from my group to get the thinking underway on the new strategy.  Thanks.  DF

These look fine to me. My sense is that Stan will go over Northern's offer in 
the initial phone call with Ted Davis; therefore it may make sense to just 
combine the two for Stan's purpose but keep the 2nd one seperate as the basis 
for a document to fax to Davis after the phone call.
