seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will 
escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to 
north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization.

All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential 
approval
