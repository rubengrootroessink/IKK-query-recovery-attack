I spoke to Kim Watson today re the following  1. They will be kicking off the 
science part of the system on August 23  ET&S Marketing and other invitees  
2. Matt Johnson from PROS called Kim yesterday to tell her that some pipeline 
has purchased PROS' storage product  and he asked how we were coming along.  
Kim said we had moved off in a different direction but that we would be 
interested in seeing their product, which we are trying to set up for the day 
before or after August 23.  3.  Since we seem to be rolling along on the 
dashboard and starting the science piece, we plan to get Stuart Ford (V&E) 
over here during the week of August 14th  to make sure we are doing all the 
right things to make sure this being protected as an Enron product which if 
it is sucessful  we will be able to sell to third parties.  OK with you??
