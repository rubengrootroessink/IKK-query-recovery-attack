Many apologies comrade!  By the way, "organization" is spelled with a "z" not 
an "s" in American English.  Or do you write in English American now?  DF

Subject:  Government Affairs Organizational Changes


FYI:  Attached is a memo from Rick Shapiro outlining organizational changes
in the Government Affairs group, most significantly the appointment of a
new head of the Washington office.

This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this
requires us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting
things done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet
the needs of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as
a group within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals
within the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government
Affairs strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.
The below mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1.   Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2.   The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3.   Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4.   Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5.   Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6.   Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

     With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am
     pleased to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on
     November 6, 2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume
     responsibility for leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our
     Washington office.  Linda was a Congressional staffer and
     partner/principal in two Washington law firms prior to spending the
     last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury, the last five
     as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public Liaison, for
     Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific background, both
     in energy and financial services, and is a welcome addition to our
     team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs
     groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs
     group under Joe Hartsoe's direction will also report to Linda.  Joe
     Hartsoe will also retain primary responsibility for NERC activities,
     although Charles Yeung and Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line
     reporting relationship to Jim Steffes in his capacity of directing our
     activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be transferring from his current
     role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1st quarter of 2001 and
     will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporting to Joe
     Hartsoe.

     On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant
     contributions that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his
     eighteen years of service.  Joe's work ethic, intellect, and integrity
     have established Enron as a company that is respected throughout
     Washington.  I will have more to say about this as Joe's retirement
     draws closer, but I look to him to be a vital part of the leadership
     transition in our Washington office that will occur over the next days
     and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure
that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business
strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,
most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can
contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis.
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government
Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

   In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of
   the EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the
   rates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.
   This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services
   throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of
   expertise over the next months to some of the new markets that the
   company has and will soon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris
   will join this organization and report to Harry.
   Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane
   Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role
   supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto
   Levy will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also
   report to Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an
   outstanding job in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business
   Rules) process over the last year and his current leadership of the
   Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO efforts for Enron will be critical to the
   development of well functioning wholesale electric markets in the U.S.
   It is also my hope that Steve Walton will play an increased leadership
   role across North America on wholesale electric market issues.  The
   incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possesses of the electric
   industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will provide much
   needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts across
   North America.
   Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in
   supporting the company's efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be
   an organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation
   interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has
   recently joined Steve's group from Azurix and will be primarily
   assisting Howard Fromer in New York.
   Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS.  Scott Bolton and
   Donald Lassere, while reporting to Sue, will continue to provide
   leadership on telecommunications issues.  Scott and Donald have done
   outstanding work and will continue to be integral to our efforts in this
   area.
   Finally, the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process, beginning 1/1/01,
   will be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America,
   including Federal Government Affairs and Mexico.  The RCR Committee,
   beginning immediately, will be expanded and will consist of Harry
   Kingerski, Sue Nord,  Linda Roberston, Jim Steffes, Lisa Yoho & myself.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thank you
