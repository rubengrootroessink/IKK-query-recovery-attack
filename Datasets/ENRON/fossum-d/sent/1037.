Has anyone checked on whether there are any IT contracts and if so what the 
contract # is?  
If not, I will...just let me know.

Subject: PG&E

Attached is a draft letter requesting that PG&E provide Transwestern with 
assurance of creditworthiness under Section 13 of TW's tariff.  Shelley and 
Mike have reviewed this already and wanted to get input from the rest of you 
as soon as possible.  Note that there are a couple of questions for us to 
answer before we send it out.  I would like to  have this ready for Shelley 
and Rod to run by Rick Buy, Steve Kean, and others as necessary by COB.  
Thanks.  DF
