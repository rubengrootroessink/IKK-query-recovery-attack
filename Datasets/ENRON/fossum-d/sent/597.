Sorry you weren't able to join my hunting boondoggle in SoDak!  It was epic.  
Lots of birds (the wild variety, not pen raised and tied down like at 
Pheasant Haven!)  We saw literally 1500-2000 birds over three days of 
hunting, and limited out every day.  Got my first double--two shots, two 
birds, nothun' but net.  You gonna be at the mgt conf?  I'd love to get 
caught up with you and share some new tales of woe from the pipeline 
group.    PS, I met Angie Green yesterday--very sharp young lady.  She said 
to say hi to you and Nicole.  Adios.  DF
