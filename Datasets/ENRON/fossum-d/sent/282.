Shoot.  Due to a conflict on Monday, I'm now scheduled to arrive in Houston 
on Tuesday at 10 am.  I return to Omaha at 8 PM  on Wednesday.  If there is 
anything on Mark's schedule consistent with those constraints, please let me 
know.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Meeting with Mark Schroeder

Mark has asked me to email you, to find out a suitable time to meet him.
He is pretty booked up for both days, but asked, either 05/15/00 for dinner, 
or early 05/16/00 for breakfast.
Can you let myself, or Sandra (who will be back tomorrow) know so that we can 
schedule it for him.

Thank you
Sharna
