NGPL has filed an application requesting approval to sell its interest in 
certain offshore facilities to Green Canyon and is also requesting 
non-jurisdictional status of the subject facilities.  Northern owns an 
undivided interest in certain of the facilities being sold by NGPL.    The 
Commission has issued a data request to Northern regarding its interest in 
the subject offshore facilities.  I just became aware of this data request 
this morning.  

The FERC has requested that Northern provide the following:

"Northern is requested to present formally its views to the Commission on the 
jurisdictional status of its fractional ownership interest in these 
facilities.  These submissions should include specific information regarding 
the current classification of the facilities, for purposes of accounting and 
rate treatment. " 

Because Northern's response is due on Thursday, November 9th, I have taken 
the liberty of drafting a response for your review.  This response is similar 
to Northern's previous responses in other dockets.  Please  provide your 
comments by noon, Wednesday, November 8 as Northern must send its response to 
Washington in overnigth mail for filing on 
Thursday.  Thanks MW

Subject: FERC Data Requests issued 11-6-00 in CP00-369-000 & CP00-379-000


I have sent you this e-mail to inform you that FERC data requests were
issued yesterday, 11-6-00, to  your company (see company name and the
individuals listed below) which require written responses by your company
within 3 days of the date of the data request or by Thursday, 11-9-00 in the
captioned dockets.  As you may recall, in those dockets (a copy of the
applications were originally sent you in which your company also had some
imput), NGPL requested authority to abandon, by sale to Green Canyon Pipe
Line Company, L.L.C. (Green Canyon) and East Breaks Gathering Company,
L.L.C. (East Breaks), certain currently operational and previously abandoned
and retired in place wholly and jointly owned laterals, meter, field
compressors and appurtenances located offshore Louisiana and Texas.  NGPL
also requested that FERC declare these facilities to be nonjurisdictional
upon abandonment and tranfer to Green Canyon and East Breaks.  The above
data requests require your company to submit its views on the jurisdictional
status of your fractional ownership interests in the facilities (of NGPL
also has an interest which NGPL is requesting to abandon in the above
dockets) and request that your submission include specific information
regarding the current classification of the facilities for purposes of
accounting and rate treatment.  I would call your attention Attachment 4 to
the applications in both dockets which show the facilities in question and
the related ownership interests that FERC is referring to.  For your
conveniance I have attached Excel spreadsheets of Attachment 4 to both of
the applications for your review.  The data requests themselves can be
downloaded on CIPS in the captioned dockets (I have attached below for your
convenience the data request sent to Koch as an example as the wording in
these requests is identical except for the company and the addressee --
these requests are in Wordperfect format).  Your attention to these data
requests is greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your help.
