The Commission accepted and suspended Northern's SLA filing to be effective 
December 1, subject to refund and other conditions, including Northern's 
providing additional documentation.  Specifically, the Commission denied the 
requests for rejection of Northern's filing and request for consolidation 
with Northern's Order No. 637 proceeding.  However, the Commission concluded 
that  Northern's filing lacked adequate documentation and is requesting 
Northern to provide the following documentation within 21 days of the Order:

1.  A narrative explanation and work papers containing detailed calculations 
supporting the derivation of all numerical values included in the attachments 
to its filing, including rates, allocations, load factor calculations and 
billing determinants.

2.  A narrative explanation and all calculations which Northern needs to 
recalculate the rate impact of the return and tax components associated with 
the SLA .

3.  Documentation including commodity prices and accounting entries for both 
the SLA and the cash imbalance mechanism showing how the SLA balance changed 
each month during the 2nd adjustment period (period ending March 31, 2000) as 
a result of activity related to the cash imbalance mechanism and how each 
monthly value of the cash imbalance mechanism was determined. 

The parties have 21 days to comment on Northern's additional data.  The 
Commission anticipates that with such additional documentation, the issues 
raised in this proceeding could be resolved on the merits without the need 
for additional administrative procedures.  The Commission further stated that 
Northern need not provide information related to the SLA balance for the 
period after March 31, 2000.  

I will forward a copy of the Order as soon as I receive it.  thanks, Maria
