Lon, thanks for including me on the following distribution.  Both Greek Rice 
and I have received phone calls from the Coastal (Great Lakes) corporate 
legal officer informing us of the outcome on the day of the decision.  He 
expects the State to appeal, and we will be watching this very closely.

We have had a series of meetings with the Minn DOR on behalf of NNG, 
discussing not only the compressor fuel issue but the Industrial Processing 
tactic in general, and were on hold by the DOR until this case with Great 
Lakes was decided.  

If you would like to have further details, please let me know and we will be 
gald to furnish them to you.

Thanks again.

As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.
