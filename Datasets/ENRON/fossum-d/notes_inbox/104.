   GOOD MORNING, 

I ask that you please attend one of these scheduled Safety Meetings.

The video is meant to be an emotional reminder to all of us on the importance 
of safety, and the critical nature of 100% of our employees supporting our 
safety program 100% of the time.  This would mean everyone in the Omaha 
office, as well as those in the field.

Safety is something that none of us can take for granted.  The 'Testament to 
Safety' video will certainly be a reminder of that fact. 

Again, I urge you to put it on your calendar.
 
Mike Nelson

Subject: "TESTAMENT TO SAFETY" PROGRAM


The "Testament to Safety" video was developed to make us all realize that we 
work in a potentially dangerous environment each and every day.  The video is 
very personal, emotional and poignant.  You will hear from three Enron 
employees who experienced life altering injuries.  The program will last 
about 45 minutes and will be presented in Room #149 at the following times:

   Thursday, December 7   Friday, December 8
      9 a.m.       9 a.m.
    10 a.m.     10 a.m.
      2 p.m.       2 p.m.
      3 p.m.       3 p.m.

Please attend the session that is the most convenient for you.  Other 
sessions will be scheduled and presented until every employee has had the 
opportunity to see this video.

A memorial poster has been placed next to your signed "Declaration of 
Inter-Dependence" in each floor's kitchen area.
