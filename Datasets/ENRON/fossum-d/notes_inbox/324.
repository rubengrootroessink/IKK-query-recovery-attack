Last saturday at Genie's service in Concordia, KS, I talked with Dave and, 
since he planned to spend most of this week in KC,  agreed to meet in KC for 
talk and lunch.  (He's in KC to support daughter Angie and to be there on 
friday when she goes in for an ultrasound.  Keep your fingers crossed - she 
prefers a girl.)
I went down yesterday morning and returned in the afternoon.  Really a swell, 
if not at times tough, day.  We met and chatted for about 2 hours at his 
hotel before going to pick up Angie for a 1 - 1 1/2 hour lunch - nice little 
Italian place, Cafe Italia  :)  :)
Obviously, the day was a roller coaster ride of emotions.  However, they both 
are doing well - Dave perhaps better than Angie - but both are fine.  At 
times, Dave was his usual "irreverent" self and we enjoyed many chuckles - 
love to listen to the guy go off.  At other times - perhaps we reminesced too 
deeply.
Dave's latest plans are to return to Houston on Saturday.  He mentioned to 
Angie at lunch that Dana and Robert have requested that he stay with them for 
awhile and he will do so.  Angie will follow Dave shortly to help him with 
matters in Houston.  I don't know when she will travel to Houston.
He also brought up the subject of a memorial service in Omaha.  He was 
struggling with his emotions - not wanting to hurt any feelings in Omaha but 
also wanting to get on with the healing process.  He (Angie agreed)  finally 
decided to forego a service in Omaha - relieved I'm sure.
