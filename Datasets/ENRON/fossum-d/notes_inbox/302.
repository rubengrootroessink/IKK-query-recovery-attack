Currently I have 2 machines (one on 41, one on 47) plus a laptop.
Jean McFarland contacted me a couple of months ago with this idea.  Basically 
we would be replacing 3 computers with one laptop.  I will probably want to 
get a regular sized monitor for my work station on 41 (I do not know if this 
is included in the "docking station" entry).
If you like, I can get Jean to do the math on how much we would be saving, if 
anything.  My machine on 47 is really out of date.  Someone else can use my 
brand new computer on 41 though.

What's the basis--do you currently use a laptop?
