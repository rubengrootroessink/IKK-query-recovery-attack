EEI's State Restructuring Service Web Site was just launched last month and 
recorded over 11,000 hits in October.  We think that if you are at all 
interested in what's going in restructuring states in response to 
California's ongoing demand/supply imbalance, market problems in several 
other states, you would be interested in EEI's new Web site.

The State Restructuring Service includes:

o  News and analyses of noteworthy legislative, regulatory and judicial 
decisions as they occur
o  Implementation decisions in restructuring states
o  Noteworthy restructuring-related actions in other states, even if not of 
comprehensive scope
o  E-mail notification of all noteworthy restructuring and related actions
o  E-mails are posted to the Web site's Action Alerts section within 24 hours
o  Site's Action Alerts are browsable and fully searchable
o  Hyperlinks to all Web posted source documents are provided
o  Policy overviews and analyses of all comprehensive restructuring laws and 
regulatory decisions

The service includes e-mail notification of breaking restructuring actions, 
as well as full access to the Web site.  For those who just need a heads up 
about noteworthy state policy actions, the e-mail service is available as a 
separate stand-alone service (free to members) or for half the price of the 
full Web service.  We cover all aspects of restructuring the electric utility 
industry and the implementation of retail electricity competition at the 
state level from the comprehensive laws, to regulatory and judicial decisions.
