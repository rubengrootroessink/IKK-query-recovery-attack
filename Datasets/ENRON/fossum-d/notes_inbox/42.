A prehearing conference was held last Friday in Phase II of Wisconsin Gas 
Company's proposal to build a 35-mile lateral to connect to the new Guardian 
pipeline.  The schedule and issues list adopted is detailed below.  It 
assumes issuance by mid-January of the final FERC EIS on the project.  

I would appreciate as soon as possible your feedback on whether or not 
Northern has any issues that should be addressed through the filing of 
testimony in this phase.  

Schedule

Jan. 25  --  Possible scheduling conference if FERC EIS has been delayed.  
10:30 a.m.

Feb. 20 -- Prefiled direct testimony due "in-hand" to all parties by noon.

Mar. 8   -- Prefiled rebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 13 -- Prefiled surrebuttal testimony due in-hand to all parties by noon.

Mar. 19 -- Full week set aside for landowner hearings in the field - likely 
locations are Germantown and Oconomowoc.

Mar. 26 --Full week set aside for technical hearings in Madison.

Issues List

The formal issues list for Phase II will be included in the ALJ's prehearing 
order.  Subject to refinement of final wording it will look something like 
this:

---Physical aspects to the lateral and possible effects on landowners & the 
environment.

---FERC EIS & applicable WI statutes, including the Wisconsin Environmental 
Protection Act (WEPA).

---Engineering and safety

---Alternate routes

---Environmental implications including economic value and economic impact

---Landowner and land use implications/ Farmland productivity & economic 
effects on particular landowners.
