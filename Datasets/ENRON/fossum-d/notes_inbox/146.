Back by popular demand, here are the current travel alternatives to Shadow 
Ridge C.C., the site of this year's NPNG Holiday Party:


Pacific Street  

There are currently no road projects that would block access to the club's 
main enterance at 187th - this is the recommended route.
    
The work that had Pacific out of commission from 190th to 204th has been 
completed.  However, the intersection at 204th is still somewhat a mess - no 
street lights, no traffic lights, unmarked roads, no street signs, etc.  
Also, Pacific is now closed west of 204th.

Center Street  

Center Street is open.  However, you currently cannot directly access 180th 
Street (North or South) from Center or cross Center on 180th.  

There is an unmarked detour that can get you to from Center to 180th around 
the Lakeside Complex and through the Western Springs subdivision.  But it 
would be difficult to explain on paper how to do it.

You can turn on to 192nd from Center (the Lanoha corner), go North on 192nd 
to Pacific and go East to 187th to get to the club.  But be careful if you 
take this route to go from the club back to Center - turning from 192nd on to 
Center going East can be a problem at times (cars on Center do travel at 
fairly high speeds and they do not expect people to be coming on to Center at 
this location at this time of night).  Watch out for wildlife in this area as 
well.
    
West Dodge Road

Dodge is a mess from 160th to 180th Street.  There are some lane changes in 
this area that can be hard to navigate when it is dark.  Also, there is no 
way to gain access to 168th from Dodge or cross Dodge at 168th.

If you feel up to handling the construction, you can get off of Dodge at 
180th Street.  But be sure to recognize that 180th is an abnormal 
intersection - it is like an interchange without an overpass (going west, 
you'll need to take an unmarked exit lane that goes off to the right at about 
179th, turn on to 180th, and cross Dodge at  the intersection - left turns 
directly off of Dodge are not permitted).

Also, be aware that there is an unmarked deer crossing area that goes from 
about 180th to 186th Street on Dodge and a few blocks South of Dodge at 180th 
- there is a creek that serves as crossing point for such wildlife.  I have 
seen a number of cars that have hit deer in this area.


Bottom line, taking Pacific is the best route.
