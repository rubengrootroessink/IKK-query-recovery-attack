I just got back after spending the day at jury duty.  I was one of 60 that 
had to go through voir dire.  They picked up to juror 43 but I do not think 
they would have gotten to me.  I am sure that I was struck by the defense 
counsel.  This was a criminal case and it appears that their would be some 
type of mental capacity test.  The defense attorney asked the 60 of us if the 
government should provide mental health services for those who could not pay 
for them.  This immediately rankled my Republican blood and I raised my 
hand.  I was the only one who did that.  Call me heartless but I am now in my 
office instead of hearing how the devil made him do it.

No word on the Supremes.  I think the longer they take the worse it looks for 
Gore.  If they knew that they were going to find for Gore they would have at 
least lifted the stay with some parameters on how to recount.  The longer it 
takes the less like The Goreinch will not be able to steal our Christmas.

We are freezing our butts off down here.  It is in the 30s and we may have 
some sleet or freezing rain tonight.  That is enough to shut down this city 
for a week.  Nothing what you are used to up there.  We enjoyed having you 
over the other night.  Mary and I were glad that you put us on the list for 
your traveling circus.  Tell Sandra to come on down.  It is really not that 
bad.  And the stock price is back in the high 70s.  We have money again!

stock price instantly, if it comes out right.  df
