With the amount of e mail traffic within the last couple of days concerning 
the GTB E&C project and the fact we are close to contract execution, I would 
suggest we have a meeting to be sure everyone is on the same page.  I have 
scheduled this meeting for Monday, March 12 at 1:00 pm in conference room 
3AC31c1.

If there are questions are conflicts of schedule, please let me know.
