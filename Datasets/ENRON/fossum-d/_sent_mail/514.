Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of 
guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin 
Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure what 
Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what we're 
doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't think 
I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.  Adios, DF.

Drew;
Congratulations on your new job.? I didn't realize that you had joined  the 
pipelines.
I've got a client interested in developing a power plant in Arizona off  
Transwestern.? Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern?
Regards,
George Briden
