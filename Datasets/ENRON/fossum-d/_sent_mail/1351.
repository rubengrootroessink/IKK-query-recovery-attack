Hey, great talking to you.  I appreciate your willingness to talk to David =
about the DOE situation.  He's a great guy and one of the best substantive =
lawyers I've met.  Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law sc=
hool.  He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag committe=
e--I can't remember which.  Big time federalist society member and knows al=
l those ultra-right winger types.  He was my partner at Wiley Rein and Fiel=
ding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among the y=
ounger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type (he k=
ept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that now).=
  Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my clie=
nt stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley.  He also =
did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead lawyers f=
or Penn. Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 complianc=
e filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access restructurings).   He's=
 a Missouri native and got tired of the DC law firm rat race and moved to K=
C.  Currently a partner at Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin--does a lot of Ut=
ilicorp/Aquila stuff as you'd expect.  Dave's direct dial at work is 816-98=
3-8385 and his home number is 816-407-9026. =20

Mark--anything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at =
DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered fo=
r the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have d=
one some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone =
out there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to d=
iscuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df
