What would we have to do to get rid of the Demarc deal approval requirement 
(requiring President level approval for all Demarc delivery deals)? Can Danny 
revoke the policy, just like Bill created it?  DF

As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
our capacity posting squared away.  DF

Drew,
        Placement of a demarc delivery package on EOL necessarily means it 
was approved.  An after the fact note from Linda will suffice.

Tenaska Marketing Ventures accepted a package on EOL yesterday that delivers 
to demarc.  Although EOL deals are pre-approved the CMS system is coded to 
route demarc deals to the president level.  In order to expedite the 
activation of this request and since it was a pre-approved EOL deal, I 
approved the route for each of you in CMS per a request from marketing.  

Please let me know if this process will not be agreeable on future EOL deals 
that include demarc.

Thanks

Linda
