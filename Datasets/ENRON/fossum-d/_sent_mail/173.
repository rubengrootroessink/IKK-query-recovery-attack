Subject: HHI Calculations

There is a discussion of HHI's in a FTC guideline called the 1992 Horizontal 
Merger Guideline, which can be found on the FTC's website.  I have tried to 
create a hotspot for you here www.ftc.gov.  The discussion of HHI's starts at 
1.5.

HHI means Herfindahl - Hirschman Index.  

Enjoy!
