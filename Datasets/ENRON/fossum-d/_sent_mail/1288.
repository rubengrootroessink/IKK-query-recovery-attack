Sorry, I read the other email first--you guys have me covered quite well.  I think the staff meeting formerly known as Mikes is on Tuesday Mar. 3, right Emily??  I didn't have anything on my calendar on the 12th.  Emily, you might want to send an email around reminding everyone of the Mar. 3 all-lawyers meeting and the secretary meeting just in case some people are assuming I'll schedule mine at different times.  Thanks all.

Drew - I have you covered for the 12th.

Em - you might cancel the Mike Moran staff meeting for 11:00 on the 12th.  I'd cover for Drew but, if I were him, I would not let me conduct his first official staff mtg with the lawyers....especially if Dot is anot availble to keep me in line..

	Drew- 

	Staff meeting on Monday the 9th -- no problem.  I would be glad to cover the Derrick meeting on April 12; however, 
	I have jury duty that day (yuck)!

	--Dot

Yes, lets continue to have the pre-meetings formerly known as Mike's every Mon. at 8:30 (pls put on my calendar Emily).  
I'll be in Houston this Monday so just come to my office at 8:30 if you are both here.  Dot, pls cover the staff meeting on 
Monday, April 9 as I'll be on vacation.  Also, pls cover the Derrick large GC meeting at 9:00 am on April 12 as I'll be at NN's Keyex meeting in Cal.  (I may be able to call in to this but would like you to cover anyway in case something goes haywire). Thanks df

	If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just 
	call Drew?   When?
