Hey, great talking to you.  I appreciate your willingness to talk to David 
about the DOE situation.  He's a great guy and one of the best substantive 
lawyers I've met.  Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law 
school.  He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag 
committee--I can't remember which.  Big time federalist society member and 
knows all those ultra-right winger types.  He was my partner at Wiley Rein 
and Fielding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among 
the younger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type 
(he kept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that 
now).  Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my 
client stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley.  He 
also did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead 
lawyers for Penn. Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 
compliance filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access 
restructurings).   He's a Missouri native and got tired of the DC law firm 
rat race and moved to KC.  Currently a partner at Blackwell Sanders Peper 
Martin--does a lot of Utilicorp/Aquila stuff as you'd expect.  Dave's direct 
dial at work is 816-983-8385 and his home number is 816-407-9026.  

Mark--anything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at 
DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered for 
the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have done 
some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone out 
there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to 
discuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df
