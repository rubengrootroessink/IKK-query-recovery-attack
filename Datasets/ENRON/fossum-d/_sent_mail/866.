I think I beat your deadline for internal distribution, but we need a bit 
more time to make sure this approach will work.  In particular, Julia and 
Rick need to take a quick look at the true up mechanism and  I need to go 
back through it one more time to make sure I haven't forgotten something and 
to clean it up.  I look forward to your comments.  DF

I would agree with Paul, unless Drew thinks we can get the agreement out of 
here in the next 30-40 minutes.

Subject: P G & E Credit Assurance

 In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )

 Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.

 Thanks and Regards.
