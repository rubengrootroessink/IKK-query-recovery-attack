Hello Drew, I wanted to touch base with you regarding your temporary housing situation.  Deb Cappiello called me this morning and informed me that the Marketing apartment is fully available to you starting on Monday, March 26.  Deb mentioned that they would still receive the invoices in Omaha, but could code the invoice to a Legal cost center if you decided to go with this apartment.  

Debra Kallus in the relocation department is available any time to discuss alternative temporary housing with you as well.  She has offered to have a representative personally show you corporate housing close to downtown if you are interested.  Let me know if we need to proceed with Debra further or go with the Marketing apartment.  My extension is 3-6609 and cell number 713-410-3058 if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.
