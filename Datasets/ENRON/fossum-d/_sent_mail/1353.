Subject:	Monthly Report on SLA Activity

Attached please find the February 2001 report showing current month activity in the System Levelized Account (SLA).  Information for this report comes from data provided by Gas Accounting Department.  Several items to note for this, the first distribution:
All non-shaded information on this report reflects the same data as shown on Exhibit No. 7 which has been provided to Northern's shippers in conjunction with Docket No. RP01-76-000 data requests.  (Only January data has been given to the shippers at this time.)
Columns (j) and (k) serve to highlight the segregation of the SLA account into its two components - cash and future liability.  The two columns add together to equal the total amount of the SLA account on the books (Column (i)). 
Column (j) reflects the cash portion of the SLA account, i.e. the actual amount of cash spent/(received) in maintaining Northern's operational storage.
Column (k) reflects the future liability portion of the SLA account, i.e. the future amount of cash to be spent/(received) in clearing the Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position.  It is computed by multiplying the month-end Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position by the respective month's MIP. 

This file contains both the January and February report.  To print each month's report, simply click on the respective tab.
