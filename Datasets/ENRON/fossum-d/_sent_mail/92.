Subject: GTC/TFX/RFS Document

Drew/Mark,

Further to conversation this morning with Drew, it appears that it would be=
=20
helpful to include the Request for Service (TFX) form in the GTC, as this i=
s=20
the form which FERC has approved for use when a customer requests pipeline=
=20
capacity.

This would mean inserted something like the following into the Long=20
Description: "Customer agrees that this transaction will be governed by the=
=20
terms contained within the online General Terms and Conditions (GTC)."

Which would make the final long description:


US Gas NNG Capacity     Perm1 to Perm 1       Nov00-Dec00    USD/MMBtu

A transaction with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) under which NNG will=
=20
transport, on a firm basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu per day=
)=20
equal to the volume identified on the web site. Customer agrees that this=
=20
transaction will be governed by the terms contained within the online Gener=
al=20
Terms and Conditions (GTC).The Term of the Transaction shall be from the=20
Effective Date of 01 Nov 2000 to the Termination Date of 31 Dec 2000. This=
=20
transaction provides firm pipeline transportation capacity with the primary=
=20
receipt and delivery point of the Permian Pool (POI 54009).  The posted rat=
e,=20
stated in USD/MMBtu on the web site, is the daily reservation rate, which i=
s=20
also applicable for all alternate receipt and delivery points in MIDS 1-7,=
=20
with the exception of Argus Zone points and Field Area TBS=01,s.  In additi=
on,=20
the following charges apply: the maximum commodity charge; all applicable=
=20
surcharges; and fuel use and unaccounted for.=20


The text contained within the GTC could then appear as follows:



Please let me know if you think this works and are happy with it.

Thanks,

Dave
