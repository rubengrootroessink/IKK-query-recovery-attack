I wish.  As to your complaint about my failure to tip you off, there were two 
primary reasons:  (1) if I told you and got caught I'd go to prison, and, 
more importantly, (2) I had no clue. DF  (its better to be lucky than good!)

Yeah, I've noticed it.  Particularly the run-up yesterday.  Hell no, I
don't own any ENE.  Why didn't you tell me this was going to happen?
Between ENE and our good old EMC, you really are closing in on
retirement.....

Check out ENE over the last 30 days.  I'm a few more weeks away from
retirement.  Do you own any?  DF
