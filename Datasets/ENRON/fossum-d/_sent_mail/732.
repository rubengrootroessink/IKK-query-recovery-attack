Subject: EOL Webtext - - Day to day firm

Attached is the revised webtext for the day to day versions of the R+C, RMn 
and RMx sustainable products, reflecting comments received this week. The 
format has been changed to be consistent with the revised format of the 
sustainable products. I would appreciate receiving your comments by noon, 
Wednesday, March 14.
