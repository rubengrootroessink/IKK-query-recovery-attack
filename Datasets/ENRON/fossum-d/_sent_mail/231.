No, we are paying them $3 mm in addition to handing them the Hobbs line and 
giving them the option on the Eldo-Spraberry line.  I haven't really thought 
about it, but I guess the transfer price for the Hobbs line should be some 
nominal amount--$10 or something.  I'll give you and Louie a call in a bit to 
discuss.  Thanks.  DF

Drew, thanks for the fax.  Quick question... is the purchase price a flat 
3,000,000 without any adjustments for line pack... Since we are going to sign 
and close same day, we won't need adjustments for cap ex.  I am putting 
together a draft PSA now.  THanks.  Kim
