Subject:	Draft Transwestern Response to FERC Order

 <<4%#@01!.DOC>> Attached is a draft of the Transwestern Answer to the FERC's order issued March 28, 2001, and reflects the thoughts of myself and Robin Nuschler.  There are a few questions we pose in the draft that we'd like to discuss with Transwestern after the appropriate peoplle have had the chance to review the draft.  We also took the liberty of drafting a supporting affidavit to be signed by the appropriate Sempra representative.

I didn't email a copy of this to Drew Fossum or Susan Scott because I don't have their email address.  Could you either forward this draft on to the appropriate people or send me a list of the individuals and their email addresses?

Thanks.
