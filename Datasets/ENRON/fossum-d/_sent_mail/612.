You have received an e-mail from Virginia O=01,Neill scheduling the=20
Stategy/Business Planning Meeting for next Tuesday.  Mike McGowan and I wil=
l=20
be facilitating the meeting with Bill Cordes.

As most of you are aware, ET&S maintained a high-level Business Plan in 199=
9=20
which summarized the major areas of focus for Company activities and=20
enumerated many of the underlying specific initiatives.  It was intended an=
d=20
understood that individual task force, team, or project activities would be=
=20
undertaken in support of the key focus items included in the plan.  The=20
intent has been to review and update the plan and the support activities on=
 a=20
quarterly basis.  The most recent version of the plan is attached.

It is ET&S=01, goal to update the plan at the same level of detail in the f=
irst=20
quarter of 2000 and to again use it as a focal point for quarterly planning=
=20
discussions.  The meeting next Tuesday is intended to provide the discussio=
n=20
base and general consensus on the key business issues to incorporate into t=
he=20
next update.

Bill Cordes has asked that each of the participants provide input to the=20
meeting by determining, prior to the discussion, a list of the 3 areas of=
=20
ET&S focus which they believe are the most critical to the shaping of the=
=20
Company direction in the years 2000 and 2001.  The individual lists will be=
=20
consolidated and utilized as a basis for the Tuesday meeting.  In order for=
=20
that consolidation to take place, please provide me with your individual=20
lists of the 3 critical areas by e-mail no later than noon on Monday, Janua=
ry=20
17th.

Thank you for your participation, and I will look forward to meeting with y=
ou=20
on Tuesday.
