Subject: Market Affiliate Presentation

Did you attend the Market Affiliate presentation?   If you didn't have the 
opportunity to make it to one of the sessions held in Houston or Omaha, Dari 
Dornan is planning to hold a make-up session for the officers.  The video 
conference room has been reserved for February 10 beginning at 2:00 PM.  Tthe 
meeting will last approximatel 35 - 40 minutes.

Please let me know if you plan to attend.   If there only a few of you who 
have't attended, I'll schedule the meeting accordingly.  Thanks,

Virginia
