Forcing Names in your Personal Address Book

This message explains how to fix the "sending to the wrong Steve Harris" 
problem.   The only way after implementing this change to send to the Steve 
Harris/ECT name is by going directly to the ECT Address Book in Notes.  If 
you have any questions please call.   

Thanks, Jean x7173


Add the correct Steve Harris (Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron)  to your Notes 
Personal Address Book (PAB).  See below for instructions on adding a Name to 
your PAB
Open your PAB and open the Steven Harris card, click on the "More Info" 
section
Find the line Full User Name:  Add "Steve Harris" (please note-Steven 
Harris/ET&S/Enron should already be there)
Click on the Save and Close button

Because Notes searches your Personal Address Book before Enron's Address Book 
all message regardless if you type Steven Harris or Steve Harris will be sent 
to Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron.






How to add a name to your Personal Address Book.

Go to the Notes  Workspace Screen and double click on the Enron's Address Book
On the left hand side make sure "People" is selected
Click on the Right had side and type "Harris" and select Steven 
Harris/ET&S/Enron
Click on the "Copy to Personal Address Book" bar, click on "okay" and "X" to 
close the Window.
