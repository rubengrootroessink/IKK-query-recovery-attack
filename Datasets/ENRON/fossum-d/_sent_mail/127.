Sorry, just got back from Houston and my duties require me to be in the big O 
for a few days.  Enerson and I were just talking about you on Friday--I'm 
forwarding this to him so he can take you out and feed you.  Hope all goes 
well.  Give me a ring if you have a few minutes and I'll give you the update 
on what's going on up here (dial 87-7449 in case you've forgotten how to dial 
us from world headquarters).  DF
