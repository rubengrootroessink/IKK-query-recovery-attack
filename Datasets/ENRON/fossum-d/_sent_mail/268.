Outstanding!  I'm in Houston on Thursday, flying to the big O on the 8:30 pm 
flight.  I'd love to get together for dinner around 5:00 or so if that works 
out for you guys.  Any chance of getting together with both of you?  DF

Flying in to Houston with Mary on Thursday afternoon, and back to London on 
Saturday p.m.  Any chance of seeing you, e.g., an early dinner on Thursday?
