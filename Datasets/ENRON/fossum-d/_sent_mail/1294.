This may be a good idea, but lets not forget that BP is the entity formerly known as "BP Amoco" which, if I'm not mistaken, is the home of Jeff Hooligan.  That guy sees evil in every pipeline deal,a nd may not have even known that his commercial people were doing deals with TW.  I'd like to think that the commercial people at BP have more clout than Hooligan and Kathy Edwards, but I wouldn't bet the ranch on that.  df

I'm assuming that BP Energy which is part of Indicated Shippers' Protest is the same BP Energy which entered into a negotiated rate transaction with TW for March.  Is it worth it to give their business person a call and see if they can get Kathie to withdraw the protest?  Let's discuss if you think we might get somewhere with them.  Thanks, maria
