Subject: FTC Subpoena

I understand that the FTC subpoena I sent to Julia and Mike Nelson yesterday 
has found its way to you.  Please give me a call with your thoughts on who is 
best situated to help prepare the response and how long it would take.  Mike 
Moran and I plan to call the FTC back this PM to discuss so your input would 
be helpful.  Thanks for your assistance.  DF
