Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF
