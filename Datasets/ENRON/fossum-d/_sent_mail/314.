Two answers:  1.  Just yourselves.  Sandra has laid in an excessive quantity 
of vittles and libations.  2.  Good idea.  Tryiing to launch an effort like 
that now would be a nightmare, but after Conoco, we'll have a lot of 
organizational work anyway.  Thanks.  df

#1 - Is there anything we can bring Saturday night?

#2 - Regarding the "record retention" problem, I was thinking that when this 
Conoco case is over, that might be a good time to go through all of the boxes 
we have pulled (probably close to 150) and weed out all of the stuff we don't 
need anymore  - which in the case of many of the boxes, may be the entire 
contents - instead of sending them all back to storage.  Maybe we could 
distribute copies of each department's record retention policy, figure out a 
way for the "owner" of the boxes' contents to come into the box room, review 
them and make a decision at that time.
