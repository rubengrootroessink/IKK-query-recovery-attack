Subject: Boycott materials

Please provide to me the materials, if any, described below that may exist in 
your organization as soon as you can.

The fourth quarter (1999) report to the Commerce Department in compliance 
with the anti-boycott provisions of the Export Administration Act is due by 
January 31, 2000.  Please review your fourth quarter files and provide to me, 
by January 21, 2000, any language, oral or written, in any communication to 
or from any company or person in your area of responsibility during the 
fourth quarter which might have been boycott-related.
