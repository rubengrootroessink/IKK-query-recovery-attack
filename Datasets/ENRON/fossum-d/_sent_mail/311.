We do in fact have a lot of captive markets.  I don't have a problem with S=
&P=20
saying that, although I wouldn't want Enron saying it too often.  In genera=

I'm OK.  Thanks. DF

I have a little discomfort with the reference a couple of times, that our=

argument related to risk of market.  Drew, what do you think??  MK

Tim Despain  received a draft copy of S&P annual review from the S&P rep.  =

that extended many firm contracts with most of its customers.

If anyone has further comments, I would suggest sending them directly to Ti=
