Thanks Susan--I agree with your analysis of the tying issue.  It ain't tying 
if we aren't restricting access to the service--we are just offering 
selective discounts.  Christine--I'm OK with it.  Thanks. DF

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.
