Subject: Capillo Peak Radio Tower

We are finalizing a purchase and sale agreement to sell TW's radio tower in 
Torrance County, New Mexico, to an individual for the grand sum of $15,000.  
I assume that there are no regulatory implications? Also when the deal 
closes, I will notify you.  Can you think of anyone else I need to notify?
