Has the old adversary adopted an "if you can't beat em, join em" strategy?  I 
noticed that CNG is planning to build some high deliverability storage.  More 
competition is always a problem, but at least that is a vindication of the 
MHP strategy.  I noticed Vaina was quoted in the trade press.  Is he the man 
on Tioga now?  DF
