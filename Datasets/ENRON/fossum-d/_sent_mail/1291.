Mary Kay

As we discussed yesterday, please find attached three (3) documents - A redlined
Strangers' Gas contract, a Release Agreement, and a calculation of the amount of
$$ netting changed OFS' Strangers Gas payments.  Please review all of these and
give us a call when you are ready to discuss.

Sincerely

Steve Winston
