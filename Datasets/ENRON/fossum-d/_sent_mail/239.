Subject: Four Corners Pricing

Drew,

Attached is an excel file which contains pricing for the following delivery 
points January 1, 1999 through 
April 30, 2000:

 Four Corners
 Palo Verde
 Mead Nevada
 Southwest Power Pool

Let me know if you want any additional information.  We can get April 30, 
2000 to present information.  I just
have to call RDI--they put it out by quarter so at the end of July we will 
get the next disk.  They'll send me the
data if we need it.

Lorna
