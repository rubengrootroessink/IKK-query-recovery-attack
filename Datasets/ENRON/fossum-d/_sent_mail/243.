I'd prefer that we give them a high level bullet point type summary rather 
than a draft of the filing itself.  DF

As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it 
is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that 
if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is 
going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen 
protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers 
before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it?

Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a 
prefiling conference with FERC?

I'm going over it and hope to have comments to you shortly-  we don't usually 
share the draft, just the concept which I don't see any hold up on that, but 
since we're still working on it, I don't want to give them a hardcopy-  MK

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review 
beginning TODAY.

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen
