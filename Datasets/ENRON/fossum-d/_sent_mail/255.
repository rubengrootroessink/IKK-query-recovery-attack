Can't make it, unfortunately.  The agenda sounds great--I believe you have 
seen the latest draft of the proposed options filing for TW, so I have 
nothing else to add on that.  Thanks. DF

Subject: Please RSVP: Lunch with Dan Larcamp of FERC on July 18


Dan Larcamp, Director of the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates will 
be visiting Enron on July 18.   I am planning for him to have lunch with a 
group of staff from the GPG at 11:30 (catered lunch in 50M).  Please RSVP at 
your earliest convenience whether you can participate in this lunch meeting 
and/or the topics that you would like to see us discuss.

The lunch discussion will be informal, but I think we should have two or 
three themes that we'd like to steer discussions towards.  Here are some 
tentative ideas.

How to Bring New Ideas to FERC.  Get Dan's suggestions on how to best work 
with FERC on new ideas.  Perhaps talk about capacity options as an example.
What were his Impressions about the Recent Outreach Meetings.  Did he hear 
anything new from any trade groups.   Is there any general feedback he'd like 
to give to pipelines as a group?
Get Dan to Talk about Expectations for the fall Order 637 Technical 
Conferences.  The first conference has been scheduled for Sept. 19.  What are 
the top issues on Staff's mind.  
What Does he expect to see in the upcoming RTO filings.  Are there Staff 
resources concerns that we should be aware of and/or any suggestions for gas 
filings during this time period? 


FYI - Here is an outline of what I tentatively has lined up for Dan's visit.
10:30-11:30 Trading Floor Visit  Christi Nicolay/Kevin Presto/Steve Kean
11:30-1  Lunch (50M)   GPG Staff
1-1:30  Gas Control Tour  Mike Bryant
