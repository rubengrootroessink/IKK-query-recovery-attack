I believe Allday is being deposed in Austin, which is still the capital of 
Texas, not the United States (although I understand that our next president 
is thinking about changing that!)  DF

Subject: Deposition

In your weekly report, I noted that Martin Allday's deposition is scheduled 
righ before mine on June 6-7.  I also seem to recall that due to some medical 
issues, Mr. Allday's deposition will be conducted in Washington DC.  If our 
lawers and Conoco's lawyers will be in DC, I could just as easily fly to DC 
vs. Houston for my deposition.  

Is this worth pursuing?????
