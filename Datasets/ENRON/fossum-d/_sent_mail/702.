I'm good with it, but have one question.  In par. 2, does the reference to 
Sec. 13 of the tariff incorporate the lottery method?  I think that's what we 
are getting at with that reference and I'm ok with it, but I just wanted to 
confirm that's what we meant.  Thanks. df

I could not remember where we were in the process of reviewing these posting 
& bidding procedures so I am sending them around one last time -- if anyone 
has any further comments please let me know.
