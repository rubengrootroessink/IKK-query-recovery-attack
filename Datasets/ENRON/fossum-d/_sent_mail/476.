The meeting with Dave has been changed to Houston.   Did you still want to 
participate?  The conference room in Houston has a conference telephone but 
it is not a video conference room.  If you want to meet in an office or 
conference room in Omaha I can conference you in if you are still 
interested.  Just let me know what you would like for me to do.

Thanks,

Tammy
