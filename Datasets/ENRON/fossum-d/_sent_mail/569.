Again, we may want to take advantage of the recent bump in gas prices due to 
the cold snap, to minimize our fixed gas payment and heat rate with ECS.  At 
the very least someone should have the mandate to keep their eye on prices 
and determine when to lock-in.  

Take a look at the attached presentation.  Effect of changing gas prices on 
Gallup is demonstrated on the first page lower left table.  Give me a call if 
you have any questions.
