FYI.  Feel free to sit in so you have a better sense of what you might face  
at the CPUC workshop on the 17th.  I'm not sure where we'll do this--probably 
either Shelley's or Steve's office.  DF

schedule a call from 5-6 PM (3-4 PT) on Wed, Mar. 28 to discuss the questions.
I gave him my number to call.  Drew and I will sit in from here.  Steve - let 
me know if you will be in Houston or be calling in.

McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  I checked with Steve Kean & he encouraged us to proceed (albeit 
with some caution knowing California's great desire to shift blame).

McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see that they are 
very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling in proposed 
answers.

I'd be happy to field the call (together with Steve Harris if he is 
available).  Let me know if you have feedback and/or prefer to handle the 
call yourself.
