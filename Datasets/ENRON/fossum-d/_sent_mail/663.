Subject: Additional Needles capacity

As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into 
the following issue.
As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, 
which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from 
Needles by Dec. 2001.
TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already 
calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.  
Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their 
primary point to Needles.
The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to 
sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are 
less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to 
earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, 
rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to 
sell out the expansion space.
I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for 
expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.  
If you have comments in the meantime, please let me know.  We may need to set 
up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.
