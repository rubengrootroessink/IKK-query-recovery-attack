Subject: Re: Potential Conflict  

It appears that EOTT Energy Pipeline Limited Partnership will be named as a 
defendant in a lawsuit brought by some of the landowners who were affected by 
a crude oil release in a subdivision near Midland, Texas.  The release 
involved a segment of pipe purchased by EOTT from the Texas-New Mexico 
Pipeline Company in May of 1999.  If EOTT is named as a defendant, we intend 
to file a cross claim against Tex-New Mex.  In that cross claim, we intend to 
allege fraud and gross negligence by Tex-New Mex in the clean up of that 
release and the subsequent representations to EOTT regarding the cleanup.

Please let me know by Wednesday, Feb. 28 at noon if you have any issues with 
EOTT's claim against Tex-New Mex.  If I do not hear from you, I assume there 
are no issues.  Thanks for your response.
