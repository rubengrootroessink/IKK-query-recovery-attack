Cabo's--very hip if you like meat markets (which I do, of course).  I suspect 
that fish tacos are a  very popular dish in London--at least among the London 
surfer crowd.  You can reach me on the cell phone @402-630-8461--I'll leave 
it on all day.  So what brings both of you down to Houston?  Anything going 
on that I ought to know about?  DF

Dinner at Cabo (grilled fish tacos), downtown, hits the spot.  We should be 
reachable at the Four Seasons, downtown, so leave us a message as to where to 
reach you.  mcs

Outstanding!  I'm in Houston on Thursday, flying to the big O on the 8:30 pm 
flight.  I'd love to get together for dinner around 5:00 or so if that works 
out for you guys.  Any chance of getting together with both of you?  DF

Flying in to Houston with Mary on Thursday afternoon, and back to London on 
Saturday p.m.  Any chance of seeing you, e.g., an early dinner on Thursday?
