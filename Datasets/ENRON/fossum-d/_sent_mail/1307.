Jean,

I have removed Drew from the CMS routing system.  You are free to go ahead and update his PC to Outlook and Windows 2000!

Thanks

I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df
