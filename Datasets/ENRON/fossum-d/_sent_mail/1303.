Drew, I talked to Kelly Strader today about migrating you next week....He is having some problems getting that  implemented....I asked him to get a name of who can get it pushed through and how badly you need to be migrated and he's going to get back with me tomorrow hopefully.  He says they aren't migrating anyone right now which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.....Once I have a name it might take a call from you ...I'll let you know more...when I hear....

Emily:  Drew should be totally removed from our CMS system now, and you can proceed with getting him transfered to Outlook.

Drew,

I have replaced you with both Dari and Tony in the routing system.  They will both receive all CAF's that would have come to you and should be able to approve them. 

Dari, Tony - if you have any problems approving let me know.  Unfortunately there is not a way at this time to split out north and south deals so you both will receive all general counsel level CAF's.   If this becomes a problem let me know and I will try to do something for you.  

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks

Linda

I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df
