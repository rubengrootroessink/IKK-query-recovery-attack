Subject: Document control

Drew,
Attached is the latest revision of the Document Control Investigation Report 
with further details provided by Contract Administration concerning the 
operation of the file room.
 
Do you have any problem with me forwarding this document to Mary Kay?  Or if 
you would prefer, you now have the latest and can forward it to her 
yourself?  The call is yours, just let me know.

It's a pleasure working with you as always,
Sarabeth

In Mike's weekly report, it was mentioned that you had a summary report on 
the document control project.  Could I get a copy of that.   Document control 
and retention is a critical area for rates, so I'd like to be in the loop on 
this project.  Thanks  MK
