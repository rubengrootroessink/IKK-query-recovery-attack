Drew, 
Not sure about gear sites for kid crash hats.   Could try www.rei.com .  You could just get  them hockey goaly helmets for multi-use and just hanging around the house  wailing on each other.  Haven't been to Terry downhill skiing in a while  but went x-country last weekend with the doggies and there's a LOT of  snow.  Brad and Jen are coming this weekend so we plan to check Terry  out.  Should still be decent in a couple weeks.  We'll let you  know.  Made it up to Hanna creek today fly fishing and cought a couple  wopping 4 inchers.  Wound up augered into snow up to my waist.  Bring  your fishing gear in case the skiing sucks.  Definately bring your  x-country gear.  Maybe we could get out for a quick morning at Eagle Cliff  and still make it to Terry to meet up with everyone else by noon.
See you later, got to go walk  hounds
