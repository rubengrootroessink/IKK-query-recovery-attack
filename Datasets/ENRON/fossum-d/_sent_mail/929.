Subject: Fuel on SJ Lateral

I thought I'd get the ball rolling and try to get this small group together 
next week to begin discussing the idea Drew had about selling the fuel on the 
San Juan Lateral to "free up" space which we could sell.  Is everyone 
available Thursday 12/28 at 10 am?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Lorraine
