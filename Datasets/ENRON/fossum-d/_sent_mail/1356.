This weekend on Tony Dean's Outdoors (the guy from Pierre) they featured a farm near Kennebec.  It is just South of where we were last year.  They appear a bit more organized with dogs and real guides.  I thought you might like their site.  I would guess that they are way more expensive than our guy, reinforcing our sense that we got a good deal.
