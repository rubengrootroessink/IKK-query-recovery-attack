I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two 
need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all 
payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet 
needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: 
"Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither 
is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the 
mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating 
service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor 
things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add 
"the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF
