Hell yes we're coming out!!  Especially now that I know the job market is so good!  I'll give you a call to confirm details (I don't think I've actually talked to you in a couple of years!)  By the way, we're moving to Houston--my boss up and quit and since no one else wanted his job they gave it to me.  Cool.  df

You still coming out here next month?  We could pick lettuce together,

I would have jumped yesterday but couldn't figure out how to get my window
open.  Since I'm on the 7th floor and the snowdrift goes up to the 4th, it
wouldn't have done much good anyway.  Know of any good part time jobs--I
need to supplement the ole' retirement plan!  df
