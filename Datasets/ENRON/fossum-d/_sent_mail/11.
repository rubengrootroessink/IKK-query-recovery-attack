Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.
