Awesome!  Tell Brother Dick that we're thinking about the camping deal--he's 
macho enough to groove on that.  Bummer about your dog rule--I was looking 
forward to sneezing all night.  DF

Dick and I are in for Saturday and likely Sunday.? My guess is we'll stay 
over for the fish... fry.? And, no you cannot sleep with my dog.

I have inquiries out to two other guys.? Let me know if you get short, 
because I can scare up other prospects.

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.? His opening day group is down to 6 guys 
so he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot 
at the rest.? He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out 
to fast and getting mad.??? I assured him that the way we all shoot that 
wouldn't be a problem. 
When:? Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29. 
Where:? Kenebec S.D.? (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha) 
$$:?????? $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.?? If we dwindle 
to less than 8, its $100 per guy.? (he will cut us some slack on this if 
some of you can only hunt 2 days.) 
Fish:? Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included 
Lodging :? Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.? Super 8 is a 
lovely place:? motto is "Labs sleep free."? $100 per night, 4 guys per 
room+ $25/head/night. 

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.?? I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.? More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.? Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due 
around this time.? What a lame excuse!!? You were there for the first 4, 
right?? Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?? If you guys have anyone 
else that's interested other than the folks that have already been invited, 
let me know as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have 
around 10.? Talk to you.? DF
