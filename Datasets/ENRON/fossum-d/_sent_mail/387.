Great letter.  I'd even suggest that you have the Weird Herald folks out for 
a tour, but well-intentioned ideas like that always backfire with the media.

Subject: Enron Response to Omaha-World Herald Column


Attached is a letter Larry DeRoin and I sent to the Omaha World-Herald in 
response to Tuesday's Mike Kelley column rehashing the Enron move from 
Omaha.  We think it is important to make sure the World-Herald recognizes 
that we are still here.



We don't know if it will be printed, but it felt good to write it.
