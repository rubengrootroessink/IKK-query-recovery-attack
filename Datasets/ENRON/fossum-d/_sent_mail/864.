Subject: Risk Management Caminus

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.
