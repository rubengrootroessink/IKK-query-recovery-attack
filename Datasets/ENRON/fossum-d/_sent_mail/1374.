Are you on this mailing list?  If so I'll stop bugging you.  This presentation should be good.  Marianne is the goddess of Texas electric restructuring (and she's my former boss!).

Dear Energy Bar Association-Houston Chapter Member:

Attached is a notice of our next EBA Houston Chapter luncheon of 2001,
scheduled for Wednesday, March 21st. We are pleased to have Marianne
Carroll, of Carroll & Gross L.L.P., joining us to share her perspectives on
the restructuring of the Texas electric market in light of California's
experience. This should be an interesting discussion.

Please print out and return the attached notice to confirm your seat for the
luncheon at the Hyatt Regency-Downtown. The notice will be distributed by
mail as well.

See you there!
