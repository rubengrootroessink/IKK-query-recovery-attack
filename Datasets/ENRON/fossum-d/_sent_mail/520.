Christmas pics?  Didn't you get the Christmas card with pics?  We shouldn't 
have outsourced the mail room function--quality control has gone to hell.  
Come to Omaha and hang out for a couple of days and I'll give you some pics 
in person!  DF

Which I have done - and is not bad, depending on who is doing the
staking...

Seems to me they were looking for Flynn 10 years ago, too. I remember at
that time, Rod Merriam told me something about how the "FBI" was looking
for Flynn, at least according to his mom. I DO remember that he was filing
for bankruptcy in the mid-80's. Then he dissapeared. (Used to live in
Crystal, or New Hope or somewhere.)

Oh,....I got it. And a professional job it was, too. Notice that there is
no "send to" address. Only phone #'s.

Yeah- like I'm gonna call Jeff Hogue.
