No problem. I told Brian that Horton would be the final decider,since he may 
have stuff going on that we are not aware of.

I don't see any problem with this transaction since it appears to be limited 
to Louisiana assets, but the issue of whether we are impacted by the 
noncompete agreement strikes me as a commercial call.  Please let me know if 
you have any problem with the transaction and I will pursue it.  Thanks.  DF

Subject: LRC Joint Venture

Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between 
Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline 
assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would 
restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business 
opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive 
with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include: 

(i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell 
Petroleum Inc. USA), 
(iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by 
American Electric Power Co. Inc.), 
(iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.); 
and 
(v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently 
ultimately owned by Koch Industries).  

In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation 
that you have no objection to the non-compete provisions in this 
transaction.  Please feel free to call Lance Schuler, Hal Bertram or me if 
you have any questions.

Regards,
Brian
