Congratulations.  My tenure (I think it is on a bronze plaque in the entry 
way on the first floor of the Enron building in Omaha) was 25 April 1994 to 7 
June 1996.  Say hello to Sandra.   mcs

You apparently didn't get this because my computer refuses to recognize your 
correct address.  Maybe this will work--I figured you'd want an opportunity 
to rebut.  Frank responded (through Deb Cappielo--he didn't have the guts to 
call himself) that he actually held the Gen. Couns. and Marketing VP jobs 
simultaneously for 3 months so I'm still way short of matching his record.DF

In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.
