Unless we have bought something that I'm not aware of, I don't believe TW or 
NN has any assets or operations in Louisiana and therefore should not be 
subject to the referenced tax.  As far as other jurisdictions, I don't expect 
that we'd have a problem with in-kind payment as an additional payment 
option.  On TW, which has no fuel tracker, in kind tax payment probably 
wouldn't help us.  Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might 
avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes 
in kind and stick them in the tracker.  We probably couldn't do that until 
the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our 
base rates at some representative level.

There is a proposal concerning paying the Louisiana Use (Sales) Tax by using 
in-kind rather than paying cash.  Please see the attached memo below giving 
details and asking for your comments:
