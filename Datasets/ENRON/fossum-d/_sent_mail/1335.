I got your message and understand you can't get all of us and Steve Harris in a meeting before Friday.  Lets do it this way:  I'll call Maria and MKM tomorrow am to discuss what we have learned so far and I'll grab Steve separately to update him.  No need for all of us in one meeting.  Thanks for trying.  df
