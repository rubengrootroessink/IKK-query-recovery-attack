Lou, do we have any sort of policy on requests like this?  Lee Huber made the 
same request last year and we gave her the chair (she only wanted one, 
however).  Norma, any thoughts?

Subject: Request to purchase chair(s) for Susan

Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her 
offices - on 47 and 41.  This particular chair is designed to help with back 
problems, which she has.  Many people at Enron already have this type of 
chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular.  
The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax.  Please approve the purchase of two.  
Thanks!
