Rod, I have an e mail stating that TBG has found sufficient funds for the 
bridge financing associated wither E&C activities of the three compressors 
stations and that Pete Weidler has agreed to allow E&C to roll the cost of 
equipment (compression) into the EPC price. 
The compression is to be ordered by ETS on the behalf of GTB.  My question is 
which ETS company will the equipment be ordered through?  GTB has made 
reference of EAMR in the LOI signed with Solar but I question that statement.

Son
