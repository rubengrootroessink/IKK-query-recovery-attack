Congratulations Adam, and welcome to ETS to both of you!!  You guys may not have heard this, but Mike Moran is retiring and I'm taking over for him as general counsel of the ETS organization.  Does this all mean that I'm your lawyer again just like in the old Zond days???  Weird.  Good luck and best wishes!  DF
