Hey--how the hell are you?  Still having fun and living large in the big 
apple?  Things are great on the prarie--Huskers are No. 1 in the nation (I'm 
actually talking about college womens volleyball since I refuse to watch 
professional Husker football) and wife and small chicks are doing great.  As 
to SD firm, I've almost hired Lynn Jackson Schultz and LeBrun a couple of 
times and then ended up not needing them.  I think its the biggest firm in SD 
(big whoop)  and is pretty well thought of.  I went to college with a partner 
in their Sioux Falls office named Jon Sogn.  He's a commercial litigator and 
a pretty good guy.  Good luck and hope all goes well.  DF
