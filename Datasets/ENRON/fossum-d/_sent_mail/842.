Its my understanding that the plan is to have it be a sub of EPC (or whatever 
the name of the parent of TW and NN  is these days).  I thought it had been 
moved already, but apparently not.  Susan, whats the status?  df

Don't know why I didn't think to look in Secretariat:

It's currently a sub of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Is this the best 
positioning for legal/regulatory purposes?  I liked your idea, Drew, of 
having it be a sub of Enron Pipeline Company.

If it's a sub of TW, it'll get disclosed in the TW Form 2.  I don't know 
whether that's a concern for you.
