FYI, a daily report put out by CIBC illustrating their view on the emerging=

market...

Daily Teletimes  CIBC World Markets

We had a very informative meeting with Enron=01,s management yesterday--Jef=
f=20
Skilling, CEO of Enron (ENE - Buy) as well as Ken Rice, CEO of Enron=20
Communications and their Software VP, David Berberian and others. Enron has=
=20
built out a substantial fiber network and begun to make substantial moves=
=20
towards developing a bandwidth trading market.  We don=01,t believe that a =
lot=20
of telecom investors understand how well thought out and agressive Enron=20
plans on being in this market.  It appears that Enron is now planning to=20
articulate its strategy- specifically at their investor conference on Janua=
ry=20
20th in New York.  While details will have to wait until the 20th, Enron is=
=20
essentially aiming to build a gateway tieing in all the major long-distance=
=20
networks, guaranteeing premium quality and pricing in doing so (i.e. a =20
=01&Network of Networks=018).  While ENE does plan to use its own network t=
o carry=20
traffic, it plans to focus largely on seamlessly integrating capacity bough=
t=20
on other carriers networks.  Operationally, this boils down to a very smart=
=20
switching system that gives customers the capabilities and reliability of a=
=20
single network at the front-end while integrating capacity sourced from=20
multiple networks on the back end, creating more robust overall transport=
=20
capabilities.  ENE believes that this integration of multiple networks will=
=20
offer greater path diversity, reliability, and efficiency than any=20
single-network solution.  We note that Enron=01,s multi-sourcing approach i=
s=20
tailor-made to foster the development of a robust capacity trading market (=
as=20
discussed in our recent bandwidth trading report).  Given Enron=01,s domina=
nce=20
of the electricity and natural gas markets, we believe that there is no=20
better positioned company to create and capitalize on such a market in=20
bandwidth.   While we await further details, we did leave the meeting with =
a=20
much greater understanding of and confidence in ENE=01,s overall telecom=20
strategy.  We believe that their telecom business could create tens of=20
billions of dollars of shareholder value if ENE executes well.  We recommen=
d=20
that telecom investors make an effort to attend the Jan. 20 meeting.=20
