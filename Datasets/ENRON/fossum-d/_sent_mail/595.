Subject: responding to USGT

Drew, here is a draft of a letter responding to USGT's with regard to the 
unpaid invoice for alternate points.  Thought I would see if you have any 
comments before I pass it along to Mr. Fawcett.  With regard to my reference 
to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my 
statement vs. pointing them to potentially troublesome language (ie "mutual 
mistake"), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included 
it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I 
thought I should address that.   Let me know what you think.
