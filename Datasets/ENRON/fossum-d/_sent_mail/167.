I don't know what she is even talking about.  Why does MKM have someone 
"coordinating" the migration to Windows 2000?  Doesn't the IT dept. do that, 
or has MKM taken over the IT dept?  What "issues" could we possibly have????  
Even if we had issues (which I most certainly do not, in spite of what 
everyone says) how could we possibly get the IT juggernaut to pay attention?  
We are all helpless to stop it in spite of our puny efforts to "coordinate" 
or "raise issues".    DF

Are you coordinating for legal on migrating to Windows 2000?  Mary Kay asked 
me (at her staff meeting) who was in charge for legal and I had no idea what 
she was even talking about.  Do you know anything about this?   If so, can 
you pls. coordinate with Naomi regarding possible issues that she has already 
identified.  Thanks, Maria
