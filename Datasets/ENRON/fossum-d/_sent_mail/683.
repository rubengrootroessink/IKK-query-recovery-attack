Congratulations Adam, and welcome to ETS to both of you!!  You guys may not 
have heard this, but Mike Moran is retiring and I'm taking over for him as 
general counsel of the ETS organization.  Does this all mean that I'm your 
lawyer again just like in the old Zond days???  Weird.  Good luck and best 
wishes!  DF
