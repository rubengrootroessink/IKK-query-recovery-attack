Tennessee Tech. Conference on Order 637 including Hourly Firm Service
January 24, 2000


Though the conference was billed as a combo of Order 637 and Hourly Firm=20
Service (FT-H rate schedule), Order 637 issues were not discussed.  Tenness=
ee=20
did a recap of where they are in that proceeding and explained how proposed=
=20
changes to daily balancing impact FT-H. =20

Basic Description of FT-H

? The target audience of the FT-H is combined cycle base load generation, n=
ot=20
necessarily peaker plants, though the service is available to all shippers.=
 =20
? FT-H will be generally available capacity subject to an NPV open season. =
=20
Contractual rights assigned to FT-H are firm daily quantities that can be=
=20
nominated hourly as 1/18 to 1/4 of the daily quantity. =20
? FT-H shippers must specify a 12-hour daily service period for MHQ=20
eligibility (i.e., 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and daily receipt quantities hav=
e=20
e to match delivery quantities on a contract basis (not necessarily on a fl=
ow=20
basis). =20
? Nominations have a one hour start-up and shut-down time. =20
? Balancing is the same as regular firm with no hourly balancing charges
? Rates are analogous to storage charges, with three components:=20
deliverability rate (hourly, 70%), capacity rate (daily, 30%), commodity=20
charge (based on flow).

Summary

With only lukewarm support of the proposal at the conference, Tennessee wil=
l=20
gather and send some clarifying material out to parties, but will also thin=
k=20
about pulling the service at this time.  If they do continue with the FT-H=
=20
proposal, the pipeline will file a modified proposal in two weeks with=20
comments due in mid-March.  There may be a follow up conference to be=20
scheduled at a later date.  A FERC order on the filing must be issued by=20
mid-May.

FERC Staff stated that they prefer to keep Tennessee=01,s order 637 proceed=
ing=20
(RP00-477) separate from FT-H (RP01-81).  Tennessee met with customers on 6=
37=20
issues the following day (Jan. 24th) and will file a letter on their proces=
s=20
going forward in RP00-477 by January 31st.

Discussion

After Tennessee=01,s explanation of the FT-H service, Staff asked questions=
=20
about the impact of hourly service on other services, and began by asking i=
f=20
Tennessee could make public any modeling or service studies done to determi=
ne=20
the impact of FT-H on other points (Staff noted that this analysis or=20
transparent modeling should be filed for transparency).  This opened the=20
debate about =01&historical operation,=018 which is the focal point of exis=
ting=20
shipper concern.  Shippers define historical operation as that they=01,ve=
=20
received over time; Tennessee maintains that current tariff entitlements as=
=20
contracted define current service, excluding enhanced services that may hav=
e=20
been offered when available.

LDCs are concerned with losing these =01&enhanced=018 historical services a=
nd argue=20
that their contracts were signed so long ago that many of the services they=
=20
use now were not available or defined then, and some, such as pressure,=20
wouldn=01,t be acceptable today as written in their contracts.  At the hear=
t of=20
the matter, LDCs have become accustomed to access to more than 1/24 of thei=
r=20
MDQ in an hour and do not want their capacity to be defined as such.  Also,=
=20
there is concern over nomination priority using NPV to compete with FT-H. =
=20

Other LDC concerns: =20
? Preferences to secondary rights to FT-H over FT-A,
? Ability of FT-A to get MDQ on peak,
? NPV will bias against FT-A (Tennessee explained that a max rate FT-A=20
shipper wins over FT-H because of total hourly capacity).

Generators, the alleged primary customer for this service, were lukewarm in=
=20
their responses.  Calpine and Dynegy said that they=01,d likely stick to FT=
-A=20
for their plants.  Though they encouraged FERC to accept the service, they=
=20
were not convincing that they=01,d sign up for it today. =20

Dynegy detailed a list of concerns and issues with the service:
? Dynegy=01,s not interested in the 12-hour designated block of time, they =
need=20
more flexibility,
? Ramp up time isn=01,t adequate,
? Rates are too heavily weighted toward demand side,
? Service needs to be somehow standardized for capacity release and=20
e-commerce,
? Penalty rates should not be based on power prices,=20
? Third parties should be able to offer this in competition with Tennessee
? Offer FT-H as a seasonal service.
