Will California's Restructuring Tremors Be Felt in Your Region?
,Copyright 2000 EEI.  All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum to 
investigate whether the problems of California could occur in other parts of 
the country.

The California "restructuring earthquake" is marked by the doubling of some 
electric bills, multi-billion dollar utility under collections, electric 
reserve margin problems, and consumer outrage.  While these problems are the 
result of numerous factors, some may be replicated in other parts of the 
country.  This E-Forum will look at six regions of the county to see if the 
same "tremors" will be felt in those regions and if not, why not.  Our 
speakers will address the following questions:

Will your region see price spikes next summer?

What reliability challenges might your region experience next year?

Do any changes in state or federal laws or regulations need to be made?

How will retail markets be impacted by other factors such as, market 
structure, dependence on a spot market, high gas prices, and environmental 
restrictions?

To address these questions we have:

California  - Dr. John Jurewitz, Dir, Regulatory Policy, SoCal Edison
ERCOT  - Mike McCall, VP, Regulatory Affairs, TXU
PJM  - David Pratzon, Consultant, Exelon Power Team
Mid -West  - Corun Gagatsis, Sr Regulatory Strategist, Detroit Edison
New England  - Gary Simon, Sr VP, Enterprise, Development and Analysis, NU
New York  - William L. Jaeger, Chief Eng., Transmission Planning, ConEd

Our guest moderator is Chuck Gray, Exec. Dir., National Association of 
Regulatory Utility Commissioners

To provide questions and commentary we have Dr. John H. Landon, Principal, 
Dir. Energy Practice Analysis Group/Economics

November 17, 2000 1 p.m. ET
Note:  Please block a 2-hour time slot for the E-Forum.  We expect the 
program to take at least one hour.  Q&A at the conclusion of the E-Forum 
could take up to an additional hour.
