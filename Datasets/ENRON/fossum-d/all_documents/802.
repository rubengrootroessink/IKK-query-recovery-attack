Dear General Counsels:

The attachments are Westlaw October allocations and Lexis-Nexis September 
Usage (Actuals) reports.  Please feel free to call me if you have any 
questions.

   

We had an amendment to Westlaw contract to include Public Records and Dow 
Jones/Company News with current $14,000 monthly rate in August.   As of 
today, I am still working with Westlaw to get Aug. and Sept. charges to 
reflect the changes (total about $5,000 credit).  I apologize for not having 
the corrected Westlaw invoices to do Aug. and Sept. allocation reports to 
you.   

October Lexis Nexis Usage report has not coming yet.  August one, according 
to Julie Pechersky was sent to me but got lost in the mail.  I am in the 
process having Lexis to send us another copy.   Again I apologize for the 
long wait even it's not under my control.

Thanks,
Sylvia Hu
