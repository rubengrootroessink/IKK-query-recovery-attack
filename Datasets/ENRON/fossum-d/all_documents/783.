Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the=
=20
Enron pipelines because EES: (1) buys/sells gas; and (2) holds transport=20
contracts on our pipelines. =20

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share=20
transportation information or shipper information with EES; (2) must functi=
on=20
independently and keep separate books and records.  Generally, I don't see=

the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning=

types of services.  However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with=
=20
respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate=
=20
standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to=
=20
transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file=
=20
room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a=
=20
marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me tha=
t=20
EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function=
=20
for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent=
=20
Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge=
=20
records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not=
=20
operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management=20
charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving=
=20
us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate=
=20
functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.
