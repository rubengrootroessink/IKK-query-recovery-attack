With the completion of the Enron SAP implementation known as "Apollo & 
Beyond" in August 2000, a new organization, the Integrated Solutions Center 
(ISC), was formed. The ISC is a support organization for Enron-wide back 
office information systems which, of course, includes SAP users and the SAP 
system.

The web is an integral form of support for our customers and as you may know, 
the ISC recently launched a new website in order to better serve its 
customers and to reflect the widening scope of services the ISC has to 
offer.  

From Friday 1st December 2000 sap.enron.com will route to isc.enron.com in 
preparation for the final closure of the "old" website on Tuesday 5th 
December 2000.  

All due diligence was taken when verifying and validating documents that were 
migrated from the old to the new site.  In order to assist you in navigating 
around isc.enron.com, please note the following navigation tips:

- Online forms reside at isc.enron.com > Online Forms

- Non-online forms (formerly at sap.enron.com > Quick Ref Tools) reside in 
the Document Library at  isc.enron.com > Online Forms > Other forms

- Documentation (ie User Procedures, quick ref cards, step-by-steps) reside 
in the Document Library at isc.enron.com under Get Help > Document Library

Please take a moment today to visit http://isc.enron.com and familiarize 
yourself with the new site if you haven't already been able to do so.
