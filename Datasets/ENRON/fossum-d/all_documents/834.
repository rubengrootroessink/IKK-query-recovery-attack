As you may recall we have been arguing with the MN Dept. of Revenue for years 
over whether or not natural gas used as a compressor fuel was subject to the 
Minnesota use tax.  Great Lakes has been in court with the DOR over this same 
issue.  Today I received the following, which is an internal memo that was 
circulated in the Dorsey & Whitney law firm, which has been representing 
Great Lakes announcing a favorable ruling.
