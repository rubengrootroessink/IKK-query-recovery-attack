FERC Audit CWIP.  The FERCERS  wil be in Omaha Monday afternoon.  Gary, Vince 
and myself have talked to the Regulatory Group about the Budget Item v. 
project issue they had and i believe we are comfortable with the issue.  We 
also briefed Keith and Ray Smith on the format and likely questions focusing 
on "controls".

Also at some future staff meeting I would like to volunteer Kim Watson and 
Martha Janousek to speak about Revenue Management and where we are in the 
process now.  Maybe i can do alittle on business mthod patents which is 
something we are starting to look at.
