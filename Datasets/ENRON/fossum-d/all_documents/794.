Europe May Need 69,000 MW by 2005; What Generation Mix Will the Continent
Use to Reach that Goal?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five
years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity
to be built, according to a new report from Financial Times Energy. The
additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,
but also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
At the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being
exacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions
in Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the
Continent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,
let's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming
Europe will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent
to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system
in Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double
the amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will
need an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering
proposition.

Granted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption
has grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,
FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 
terrawatt-hours
(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per
year. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note
that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,
estimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in
Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market
liberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction
or purchase of generation assets.

Although reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe
has been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as
it is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization
at different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their
privatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned
utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process
that will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of
its market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to 
privatize,
and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European
Union. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of
new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent
to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on
the energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions
may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount
of capacity.

Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization
and, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine
the policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany
is warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy
market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact
the Continent as a whole.

Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,
due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened
to competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should 
contribute
a large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large
percentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has
all changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed
a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an
unacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a
moratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down
19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two
largest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output
from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has
developed since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to
a reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating 
capacity.


Moreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly
500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third
of Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear
power in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace
nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's
energy industry.

Coal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,
but as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also
appears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,
coal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it
less economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other
countries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is
questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand
across the Continent.

Generally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will
take the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant
supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand
across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may
impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there
are no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private
pipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.
Also, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas 
increases,
so will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary
power source.

As a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable
energy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy
output to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as
hydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest
of Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate
10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian
countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and 
low-emission
forms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of
the Nordic region's total electricity production.

Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western
Europe, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the 
fastest-growing
in the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected
to grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective
is pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will
be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine
when planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet
peak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to
and the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based
on renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many
critics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely
unrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal
one nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted
over the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005
as the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating
capacity.

In addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution
problems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This
will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence
of a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects
only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of
energy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain
a slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.

So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for
new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources
that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in
mind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role
in Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not
necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For
instance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by
opening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution
of nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other
power sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very
ambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use
of merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are
demanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing
trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only
the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there
are signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear
power, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's
natural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting
process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear
if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.
Plus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily 
natural-gas
fired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.

Moreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter
due to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the
problem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown
if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.
Yet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues
to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.
