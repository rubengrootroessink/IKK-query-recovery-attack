First,  I thought the inservice was to be earlier than 3rd quarter??  confused
Second, on term I'd suggest we say a minimum of five years, so if someone 
wants to bid for a longer term they can--
Third, in the 3rd paragraph change the reference to term, to as specifed 
above-
Fourth, in the last paragraph, add minimum term of five years again.

Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some 
available and were not looking to expand there.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF
