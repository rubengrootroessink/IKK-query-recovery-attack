Vector Pipeline has appointed Craig R. Fishbeck as president of Vector. 
Vector believes that Fishbeck's extensive industry experience and knowledge 
of Vector's market area position him well to lead the company through its 
December 2000 start-up and coming years of growth. The pipeline also believes 
Fishbeck's appointment strengthens Vector's role as a vital link between the 
Chicago Hub and Dawn, Ontario, to help meet the growing demand for natural 
gas in the U.S. Midwest, Eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Fishbeck 
comes to Vector from CMS - Panhandle where he held the position of vice 
president, marketing.
