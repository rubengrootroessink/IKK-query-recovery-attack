The Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system is now open through Friday,=
=20
Nov. 17, for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback.  Th=
is=20
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback.

Management, when determining performance ratings, participating in PRC=20
meetings, and providing feedback to employees, depends on the comments=20
received via PEP.  For the users of PEP information to fully understand the=
=20
employee=01,s performance and the ratings identified, specific comments are=
=20
needed to explain each rating, including the overall rating.  It's most=20
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their=20
action was productive or why it needs improvement.

Comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improveme=
nt=20
are both important.  Just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to=20
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits, we also need to know what a=
nd=20
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors.  We all benefit from=20
constructive feedback.

Please actively participate in the year-end PEP process and make your input=
=20
meaningful.

PEP Feedback Tips:
? Provide feedback when requested.
? Rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year.
? Provide specific comments with specific examples.
? Indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate.
