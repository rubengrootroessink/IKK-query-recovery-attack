I'm told that the four states conducting the inquiry into UtiliCorp's gas 
purchases and capacity release methodologies have a conference call with 
UtiliCorp on Friday.

UCU has admitted an "accounting error" to Michigan and has offered a $100,000 
refund.  The PSC is looking for something more in the area of $20 million.

You remember that Nick Schwartz was in Lansing the same day we were last 
month giving a deposition.  Although it was supposed to be on another subject 
it quickly turned to this issue. A copy of the deposition is attached below.
