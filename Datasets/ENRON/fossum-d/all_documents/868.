Susan, you asked about Texas during our telephone conversation.  I should 
mention that Texas has a statute that prohibits demanding or selling at an 
excessive price such things as fuel, food and medicine if the Governor has 
declared a disaster, which I assumed didn't fit our scenario.  I didn't see 
anything in the Texas case law but it was a quick look.
