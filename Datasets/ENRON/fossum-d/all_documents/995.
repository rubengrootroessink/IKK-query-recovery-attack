FERC UNDER FIRE: CALIFORNIA IOUS RESPOND TO PROPOSED ORDER WITH SHARP=20
CRITICISM
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) concession that the
market rules and structure for wholesale of electricity in California are
"flawed" resulted in a 77-page proposal early in November to repair the
situation. The reaction from California's three investor-owned utilities
(IOUs) was immediate and overwhelmingly critical.

LADWP Continues to Shine Despite California's Dark Period
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California=20
Independent
System Operator (Cal-ISO) on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency
for the second consecutive day. The Cal-ISO is calling on all California
electricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and
urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=
le
for the reliability of California's electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares
a Stage One emergency when the state's power reserves drop to 7 percent.
In contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the
municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,
announced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are
enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into
the holiday season.

ANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP's genera=
l
manager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned
utility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an
uncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success
story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.


Let's take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself
from the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board
at LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought
to be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to
cut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=
ial
and industrial customers, Freeman's decision to take on the role of managin=
g
LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP
with an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of
lowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.

Early on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears
to be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state's th=
ree
IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20
restructuring.
While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means
of averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the
CPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=
s
electing to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked
ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP's trading
unit, and thus maintained control over the muni's generation assets.

Enter the summer of California's discontent. With demand on an unexpected
increase and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself
having the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=
y
has favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies
that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=
d
LADWP of "profiteering," but Freeman contended that the utility was just
taking advantage of California's flawed market. The truth is that LADWP
was in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to
generate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.
A shrewd move by any estimation.

The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated
by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=
s
indicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over
the course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made
in the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20
transmission
services generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=
e
revenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.

The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped
with the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within
the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and
warnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to
face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has
been forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=
d
air emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=
nother
carry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in
California.

And, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=
rs
(based on today's high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=
e
generation plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=
on
within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of
this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant
supply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman'=
s
priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative
energy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP
wants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by
2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=
d
for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los
Angeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=
ed
in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.
A previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,
is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.


Along with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look
forward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,
followed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.
As criticism continues to mount against California's competitive wholesale
market, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting
out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.
