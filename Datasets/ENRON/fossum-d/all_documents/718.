I am pleased to announce that effective November 1st, Jan Moore has joined 
the Marketing Analysis Team as a Senior Marketing Support Analyst.  She will 
be responsible for the budgeting, reporting and analysis support for the 
Transwestern Commercial Team.

Jan has been with Enron since 1990 holding accounting and scheduling 
positions in Enron Oil & Gas, Enron Capital and Trade Resources and Northern 
Natural Gas Company.  Most recently, she held the position of Market Services 
Co-ordinator for ET&S where she acted as liaison between Market Service Reps 
and Management.  In that position, she facilitated training and was 
responsible for developing processes and procedures for nominations, 
allocations, confirmations and scheduling for TW and NNG.

With her solid knowledge of both Northern and Transwestern, she will be a 
valuable addition to our team.  Please join me in welcoming Jan to the 
Business Development & Marketing Group.
