Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the 
contract would provide them better info than a contact name and phone 
number-  did they specifically ask for that inf0??  upon answer, work 
directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK

Please see my original message below.  Are you okay with TW forwarding this 
info to FERC?

Maybe you should ask Drew or Mary K.

Subject: FERC Request

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy
