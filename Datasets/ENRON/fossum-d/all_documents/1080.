The Supreme Court has ruled that there cannot be a nativity scene in
Washington, D.C. this Christmas.

This isn't for any religious reason.  They simply have not been able to
find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol.

There was no problem however finding enough asses to fill the stable.




Happy Holidays,
