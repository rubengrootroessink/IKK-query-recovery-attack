This will confirm our understanding that provided you clear any potential 
counterparty with the ETS Credit Department, it will not be necessary to get 
clearance for such counterparty from the Legal Department. As we discussed 
today, we will appreciate your continuing to include Legal on the notices of 
new potential counterparties.
