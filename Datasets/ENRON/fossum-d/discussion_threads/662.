Rob Marvin of Inside FERC called for Mary Kay today with a couple questions.  
I reviewed them with Mary Kay and reported back to him.  He wanted to know 
what "Settlement Amount" and "Net Settlement Payment Due" meant on the 
schedules.  I told him "Settlement Amount" was the Kansas ad valorem tax 
refund obligation due under the Settlement, and that the "Net Settlement 
Payment Due" was what was remaining due if the producer had already paid 
money to Northern.  He then asked how the "Settlement Amount" was calculated 
and I told him that was subject to settlement negotiation privilege and that 
the parties agreed not to disclose any calculations or formulas in the 
Settlement.  Jrt
