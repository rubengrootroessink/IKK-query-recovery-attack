The reviews are in and TheLaw.net is saving subscribers tons of time and 
money by offering a new way to solve old research problems at a low, flat 
rate that's affordable to anyone.

--AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE
Noted law cybrarian Genie Tyburski writes that "[t]he busy sole 
practitioner...may find TheLaw.net an inexpensive alternative to Lexis or 
Westlaw and a helpful index to select legal information sites." Says a 
practitioner from Colorado: "I found it easy to use (certainly easier than 
Lexis/Westlaw)."

Our subscribers in larger environments have found that TheLaw.net is the 
perfect complement to any West or Lexis plan that may be limited to your 
jurisdiction or practice area; an addition that allows you to go outside that 
premium wine package and survey a significant subset of the universe without 
any transaction, printing, viewing or download hassles.

--LEXIS BILL SLASHED BY 90%
An intellectual property firm subscriber of ours in Chicago dropped us an 
email just last week to say that "[y]our concept is great....for the money 
there is no better bargain for legal research. Our Lexis bills have dropped 
to 10% of what they were before. Thanks!"

Of course your results may vary, but for less than $25 a month annualized 
TheLaw.net gives you all the efficiency of electronic case law research 
without any of the conflicting emotions that come from a meter being held to 
your head. As the list below makes plain, TheLaw.net is indeed the world's 
best value for Federal and state appellate case law research whether you are 
at work, at home or on the road. And best of all, you get everything we 
have--all you can eat--for the same low, flat rate.

--KEEPING UP WITH THE LAW AND THE INTERNET
Everyone knows that in its raw form the Internet looks like a law library 
with the books all over the floor. That's why we developed this best 
practices software solution which incorporates a 50,000 link drop-down menu 
system for getting around online, together with our proprietary searchable 
database of Federal and State Appellate cases, 167 jurisdictions in all, over 
four million cases, updated daily.

NO RISK 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE
Your no risk Personal, Convenience or Workgroup Edition includes an 
unconditional 30 day money-back guarantee. Five attorneys in a firm or 
workgroup, for example, get unlimited use for one year for only $995; 
individual users for just $295. You'll be up and running in mere minutes and 
we can deliver your software today!
