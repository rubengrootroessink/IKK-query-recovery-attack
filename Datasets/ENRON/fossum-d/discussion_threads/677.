UL Approval for MTL 7000 Series Barriers


Many of you have inquired whether MTL barriers and isolators held UL
approval, and we are most pleased to report that Underwriters Laboratories
has granted UL 913 (Intrinsically Safe Applications) approval to all MTL
7000 Series Shunt Diode Barriers -- this adds to our FM and CSA approvals.

The 7000 series has been categorized by UL as "Process Control Equipment for
Use in Hazardous Locations." The barriers are suitable for use in Class
I/Division 2, Groups A/B/C/D hazardous locations with intrinsically-safe
connections to Class I/II/III, Groups A/B/C/D/E/F/G hazardous locations.

MTL barriers are used more often than those of any other manufacturer of
Intrinsically Safe Devices, and you may already be aware that Control
magazine has once again cited MTL for its Readers' Choice Award - this
continues the succession of recognition in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The MTL 7000 Series Barriers offer exceptionally high packing density (.28
in.), about half the size of conventional barriers -- this nearly doubles
normal packing density, reduces weight, and delivers a significant savings
on cabinet space.

Another advantage is the integral disconnet facility for isolating safe and
hazardous area circuits. The line can be disconnected without disturbing the
wiring just by swinging out the replaceable fuse. This allows significant
potential cost savings by enabling the MTL 7000s to function as a field
terminal in many instances.

Finally, the MTL 7000 Series improves flexibility and reduces installed
cost, since the barriers are clamped and grounded simultaneously on a
standard DIN-rail.
