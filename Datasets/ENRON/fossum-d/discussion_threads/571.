  Drew J. Fossum
  Counsel
  Enron Corp.

Dear  Mr. Fossum:

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to LRSolutions.  It is 
our mission to provide corporate in-house counsel with all the tools and 
resources necessary to excel in every area of legal practice - preventative 
law, new product development and new markets, litigation support, 
transactional work, and regulatory compliance, among others.  At LRSolutions, 
we are able to meet this challenge through the provision of expert legal 
knowledge at reasonable, fixed prices.

As you are well aware, legal research and related "knowledge" activities and 
products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise.  
(if you would like to see our website it is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  
Click on any of the links on the lefthand side of the screen for detailed 
descriptions).  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of 
"reinventing the wheel", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  
Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing 
inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to 
the enormous costs for corporate counsel.

However, LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and 
quality.  Our network of legal experts includes hundreds of the nation's 
premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized 
intuitively into areas of specialty.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/network.html.  In addition, our Board of Advisers 
includes the former Chief Counsel for Cigna Corporation, the former Associate 
General Counsel from Proctor and Gamble, and a partner from a large 
Washington D.C. law firm.

Experienced, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related 
projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  Our products 
and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research 
memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials 
such as appellate briefs and court filings, and listings of relevant 
authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and 
objective that best suits your needs.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/expert.html.

We also are in the early stages of developing essential online compliance 
education training for corporate employees.  As you know, compliance training 
is essential if corporations are to avoid damaging liability.  Please see 
http://www.lrsolutions.com/online.html.  Federal sentencing guidelines and 
courts often reduce or eliminate liabiity for companies with effective 
programs.  We are looking for corporations that are interested in forming 
strategic alliances with LRSolutions regarding production of these courses.  
Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com/strategic.html.

I would like to respectfully request a brief meeting at your corporate 
headquarters to discuss LRSolutions further.  If you would like to contact me 
by phone, or would like to receive a brochure, please feel free to call at 
1-800-627-8047.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am 
convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource 
for your legal department and greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely Yours

Ray Nussbaum, Esq.
CEO, President
LRSolutions, Inc.
