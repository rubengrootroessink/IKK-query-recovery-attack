Alliant Energy's WP&L Experiences Winter Power Supply "Close Call" 

MADISON- Dec. 12, 2000- Wisconsin Power and Light Co. (WP&L), Alliant 
Energy's Wisconsin utility subsidiary, experienced a power supply "close 
call" Monday evening. The company appealed to customers for voluntary 
conservation measures and exercised its interruptible customer contracts to 
maintain system reliability.

"While we have heard regular reports of this type of situation occurring over 
the past few days in California, this is the first time we have appealed to 
customers for emergency conservation measures in the winter," says Bill 
Harvey, president, Alliant Energy - WP&L. Harvey says the lack of electric 
generation supply in Wisconsin coupled with limited transmission import 
capabilities continues to put Wisconsin's power supply at risk. "There is 
very little cushion available, which makes dealing with emergencies like we 
had last night very challenging, and potentially very dangerous," says Harvey.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. last night, 300 megawatts of generation supply 
went off-line at WP&L's South Fond du Lac plant due to a fuel intake problem. 
The loss of this generation represented approximately 12.5% of WP&L's total 
Wisconsin generation capacity. High electric demand within the state and a 
constrained transmission system made obtaining replacement power virtually 
impossible. WP&L declared a system emergency, exercised its interruptible 
contracts and appealed to the public for voluntary conservation. The 
emergency status resulted in freeing up transmission capacity. WP&L was then 
able to bring on-line additional peaking capacity and obtain power from 
outside the state. Customer conservation efforts also played an important 
role in avoiding more serious power supply consequences.

"Thanks to our customers who conserved electricity last night and the hard 
work from our power supply team overnight, we are back to normal this 
morning," says Harvey. Harvey notes that winter power supply problems are 
rare, but are potentially much more serious and difficult to manage than 
summer problems. The circumstances surrounding last night's problems were 
particularly challenging. "The snow storm caused many businesses to shut down 
early, so we knew there was not going to be a great deal of power to be saved 
by exercising our interruptible contracts," says Harvey. "We appreciate the 
conservation efforts of our customers last night who turned off holiday 
decorative lights, delayed laundry and running their dishwasher."

WP&L and other Wisconsin utilities keep a percentage of their total 
generation, called spinning reserve, operating beyond what is required to 
meet current demand to deal with potential emergencies. With the loss of the 
300 megawatts of generation from the South Fond du Lac plant last night, 
WP&L's spinning reserves dropped below safe levels, prompting the emergency 
actions. "Issuing a public appeal and exercising our interruptible contracts, 
while unusual, was a prudent and conservative course of action given the 
weather conditions," says Harvey. The fuel intake problem at the South Fond 
du Lac plant has been resolved and WP&L's system has returned to normal 
operations today.

Over the last several days, the one transmission line connecting Wisconsin to 
power supplies in the west has been operating a maximum capacity, providing 
little or no ability to import additional power into the state. Local 
opposition to additional natural gas-fired and wind powered generation has 
delayed the construction of new in-state power sources. Harvey says the lack 
of new infrastructure results in a very troubling situation.

"The consequences of rotating blackouts in the winter are very serious, 
particularly with weather as harsh as we are currently experiencing," says 
Harvey. "Last night presented yet another clear indication of why Wisconsin 
needs to move forward, and do so quickly, to ensure the construction of 
needed additional electric infrastructure."
