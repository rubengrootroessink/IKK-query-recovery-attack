An overview of NERC's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009
      ,Copyright 2000 EEI. All rights reserved.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum 
providing an overview of the North American Electric Reliability Council's 
(NERC) recently released Reliability Assessment 2000-2009, the reliability of 
bulk electric systems in North America.

The reliability of the electric generation and transmission systems serving 
North America has come under increased federal government, state regulator, 
and customer scrutiny. Generation capacity margins have decreased and the 
bulk electric systems are subjected to flows in magnitudes and directions not 
contemplated when they were designed or for which there is minimal operating 
experience.

Each year, the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) of the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reviews the overall reliability 
of existing and planned electric generation and transmission systems in North 
America. This year's Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 report presents:

*An assessment of electric generation and transmission reliability through 
2009

*An assessment of the generation resource adequacy of each Interconnection in 
North America

*A discussion of key issues affecting reliability of future electric supply

*Regional assessments of electric supply reliability, including issues of 
specific Regional concern

Presenting an overview of this year's Reliability Assessment is Frank J. 
Koza, Jr., Chairman, Reliability Assessment Subcommittee, and General 
Manager, Ventures, PECO Energy Company.

Our guest moderator is Tim Gallagher, Mgr Technical Services, NERC

To provide questions and commentary we have Jolly Hayden, Vice President of 
Transmission, Dynegy

A copy of the Reliability Assessment 2000-2009 is available from the NERC web 
site at http://www.nerc.com/~pc/syscond.html.

November 21, 2000 1 p.m. ET
