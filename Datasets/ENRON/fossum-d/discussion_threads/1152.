Jean, I'm on the road in Houston and can't get into PEP.  It doesn't show up 
as an icon on the laptop when I get online throught the dial up program.  
Please let me know how to get into it as I've got about a hundred reviews to 
do and I'll be on the road constantly for a couple weeks.  Thanks. dF
