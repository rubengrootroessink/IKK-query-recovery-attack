Drew:
     How is life?  Things here are going very well; just extremely hectic
(which, I guess, comes as no surprise).  I am giving you plenty of advance
notice; we are getting married on Sunday, September 2, the Sunday of Labor Day
weekend in New York. We have scheduled this in part to accomodate our dear
friends from out of town such that they do not have to take the Monday off 
work.
Details to follow, but no excuses!  it has been far too long since I saw you,
and cannot imagine a happier occasion.  I will check in over the next few days
to hear how life is for you, and hope and trust it is all well.  Talk to you
soon, David & Joy

Outstanding!  You have our most sincere congratulations and best
wishes--first for a great trip and more importantly for a great life
together!  I need to find a CLE boondoggle in the city that I can bring
Sandra to and we'll get together and celebrate.  I'd suggest you look for a
CLE boondoggle out here, but given your practice specialty, it might be
difficult to convince your partners they need to pay for a "hog law" or
"corn law" seminar!!!  Adios amigo.  DF
