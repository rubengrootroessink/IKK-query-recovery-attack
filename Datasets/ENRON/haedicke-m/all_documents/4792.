Eddy,

I tried to check schedules but not everyone is on Outlook where I can see 
their "open time".  Rebecca did tell me that 3pm is the best time  for her so 
I recommend you plan for a 3pm phone call tomorrow.  From looking back at my 
notes it appears that the participants from Houston should include:

Rebecca McDonald
Jim Hughes
Mark Haedicke
Jim Derrick

I'm copying everyone on this note to give a "heads up" regarding the phone 
call for 3pm CST on Friday afternoon.  Eddy will provide dial-in information. 

If this does not work for those in Brazil, feel free to call me at home - 
281-392-9596 or cell 713-304-6073.

Loretta
