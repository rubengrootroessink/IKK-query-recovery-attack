Sarah,

I haven't heard back from Jade yet.  Beginning to think she is on vacation.  
In any case, looking at the questions below, I think #2-3 shold not be 
problematic for us to answer; seems like #4 is irrelevant; and #1 will be 
sensitive.  In any case, I will touch base with Jade (on a general basis) and 
contact you as soon as that happens.  If Michelle calls again, please tell 
her to feel free to call me in the interim.  I met her briefly about a year 
and a half ago and she may remember me.  Thanks.

Lara

Subject: DOJ Questions

Lara:

Here are the questions posed to us by DOJ (the attorney I spoke with is 
Michelle Cano - Jade Eaton is the lead attorney)

1. Markets that Enron is trading in

2. More information about Enron's request to become a control area in ECAR

3. Transmission constraints

4. Enron's plans for sale of power from its new plant in Illinois Power's 
service territory.

In addition to these Enron-specific questions, Michelle also discussed more 
general issues about the AEP/CSW merger such as whether AEP's ownership of 
coal-fired generation combined with CSW's ownership of gas-fired generation 
will give the merged company market power

Christi told me that Enron is not planning on building a generator in 
Illinois Power's service territory in the near future, so we are confused by 
DOJ's reference to this plant.

Christi is in the loop on this issue also, so please include us both on 
emails or phone calls.

Thanks for your help Lara.

Sarah
