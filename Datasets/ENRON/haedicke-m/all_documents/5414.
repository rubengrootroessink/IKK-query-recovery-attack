Bonneville Power Administration:=20
Vulnerable to Western Power Crisis, But Protected by Federal Status=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]Two mainstays of the Northwest's economy&#151public power and the=20
aluminum industry=0F-waging a war of words over the Bonneville Power=20
Administration's attempts to set rates for the electricity it sells. Both=
=20
sides have hired public relations companies in their attempts to sway publi=
c=20
opinion before the federal power marketing agency sets new electricity rate=
s=20
effective Oct. 1. BPA, which sells power produced at 29 federal hydroelectr=
ic=20
dams and a nuclear plant, has signed contracts for about 11,000 MW but has=
=20
generating capacity for only 8,000 MW. To help make up the 3,000-MW=20
shortfall, BPA is pushing a plan to idle the region's 10 aluminum smelters=
=20
for two years, until additional generating capacity comes online. =20

Analysis: Given the barrage of media coverage that continues to hang over=
=20
California's energy problems, the fact that the Pacific Northwest is=20
suffering from its own related maladies is often overlooked. Perhaps the mo=
st=20
extreme case that illustrates the severity of problems to the north of=20
California is the BPA, which in addition to attempting to increase its=20
wholesale rates by as much as 250 percent this fall is now unable to fulfil=
l=20
many of its long-term power contracts. Much like Pacific Gas & Electric and=
=20
Sierra Pacific Resources before it, the BPA now stands among a handful of=
=20
power firms in the West that have sustained devastating financial blows due=
=20
to volatility of the region's market. However, unlike investor-owned=20
utilities (IOUs), BPA is owned by the federal government and as such has be=
en=20
criticized for having access to federal funding and protection not extended=
=20
to other Western power victims. =20

It is important to remember that BPA is a federal organization that was=20
formed in 1937 to market power from the Bonneville Dam. It holds a lock on=
=20
approximately 46 percent of the Pacific Northwest power market, and is one =
of=20
the primary providers of power to incumbent utilities in the area such as=
=20
Tacoma Power and Seattle City Light.=20

In the 1990s, the BPA experienced an excess of power and sought power=20
contracts outside the Pacific Northwest in order to retain a positive cash=
=20
flow and support various programs to ensure the lives of salmon and=20
steelhead, which populate the Bonneville Dam. The BPA formed contracts with=
=20
such out-of-region buyers as Enron, Avista Energy and the main California=
=20
utilities. The BPA signed long-term contracts to sell 1,223 MW of=20
hydropower&#151enough to light the city of Seattle=0F-utilities outside the=
=20
Pacific Northwest and to private power marketers, adding to the base of its=
=20
contracts with Northwest utilities and C_customers (mostly aluminum=20
manufacturers). However, these contracts have aggravated regional power=20
problems in a new era of shortages and soaring prices. =20

For the most part, BPA's troubles have stemmed from weather-related=20
circumstances, unlike California and Nevada (where weather has served to=20
exacerbate fundamental restructuring problems). The Pacific Northwest, whic=
h=20
relies heavily on hydropower, has suffered one of its worst droughts in=20
recent history, which has greatly compromised what has typically been a=20
reliable and abundant power source. In fact, the Northwest is reportedly=20
between 1,500 MW and 3,000 MW short of the power it needs. Further, power=
=20
that the Northwest could typically rely upon from California and the=20
Southwest to supplement any shortage it might encounter in its own territor=
y=20
is no longer available due to power demands in other states. Given its role=
=20
as the primary power supplier to the region's utilities, the BPA has become=
=20
increasingly vulnerable to the volatility of the spot market. The end resul=
t=20
is that BPA, which clearly overextended itself regarding power contracts=20
formed in the last decade, has been forced to either buy expensive power on=
=20
the spot market to serve its customers or negotiate buyouts of its power=20
obligations. =20

The BPA also has traditionally sold power directly to industrial customers,=
=20
and over the last few months has attempted to rescind many of those=20
contracts. For instance, the Columbia Falls Aluminum Company, a Kalispell,=
=20
Mont.-based aluminum manufacturer, has agreed not to use 167 average MW of=
=20
the 171 average MW BPA had agreed to sell it from October 2001 to September=
=20
2002. Reportedly, the BPA has bought back the power under contract to=20
Columbia Falls for $19.50/MWh. This marked the second industrial customer=
=20
that has allowed the BPA to terminate a power contract, following a deal wi=
th=20
Alcoa (another aluminum producer), in which the BPA bought back about 400=
=20
average MW. Typically, the C_customers have agreed to break their contracts=
=20
with the BPA due to their own halted production schedules that have resulte=
d=20
from soaring power costs. =20

However, aluminum production is a critical part of the Northwest's economy,=
=20
and several lobbying groups have emerged to block the BPA from negotiating=
=20
with any additional aluminum manufacturers to cease production. Arguing tha=
t=20
the BPA has an obligation to fulfill its power contracts, the advocacy=20
groups&#151comprised of public power and manufacturing representatives=0F-
attempting to secure some form of legal restriction against the BPA before=
=20
the agency increases rates this fall. Without knowing the terms of the=20
contracts, it is not clear whether BPA has an exit clause that entitles it =
to=20
stop providing power to the various buyers.=20

Regarding its Northwest customers, which are given priority to BPA power=20
supplies, the BPA has requested that these utilities implement conservation=
=20
programs to reduce the amount of power that must be purchased on the=20
wholesale market. Nevertheless, the BPA has already disclosed that it will =
be=20
forced to increase rates by as much as 250 percent this October to cover it=
s=20
spot market power purchases (a condition that echoes similar movements by=
=20
PGOand Sierra Pacific Resources). BPA reportedly charges its utility=20
customers about $25/MWh for electricity. Wholesale electricity on the spot=
=20
market is now selling at between $250 to $300/MWh, and wholesale power sold=
=20
through long-term contracts sells for $75 to $150/MWh.  Consequently, the=
=20
250-percent increase could be the minimum at which the BPA raises its rates=
,=20
which would in turn impact the retail rates that Northwest utilities must=
=20
charge their customers. =20

PacifiCorp recently became the first IOU under contract with the BPA to=20
voluntarily reduce load on the federal agency. Under the agreement,=20
PacifiCorp has released BPA from its commitment to sell the utility an=20
average of 251 MW each year for the next five years. Other IOUs are not=20
acquiescing to the BPA's proposal. For instance, the BPA informed Southern=
=20
California Edison (SCE) that it would not provide 500 MW of power this summ=
er=20
to the utility, under the terms of a previously reached agreement. The BPA,=
=20
which unilaterally changed the terms of the contract from a strict sales=20
agreement into an exchange when SCE began to have its own financial problem=
s,=20
has argued that SCE has ceased providing needed power to the BPA. As a=20
result, the BPA will provide no further power to SCE unless it receives=20
financial guarantees in advance. SCE has deemed this threat as a potential=
=20
breach of contract and is currently pursuing the matter in the 9th Circuit=
=20
U.S. Court of Appeals.=20

Moreover, the crux of the matter presently is the dichotomy that BPA=20
represents in a deregulated energy market. On one hand, BPA is a federally=
=20
protected agency with access to federal funding and control over federal=20
lands. On the other hand, BPA&#151unlike any other federal=20
agency&#151controls about half of the Northwest's energy supply and in the=
=20
past has profited from power sales to other regions (mostly California). In=
=20
addition to the growing resistance from public power and aluminum groups ov=
er=20
BPA's plan to increase rates, other groups have raised the claim that BPA i=
s=20
receiving preferential treatment from the federal government. Some critics=
=20
find it inconsistent that the Bush administration supports free market=20
principles in the West (evidenced by the resistance to put wholesale price=
=20
caps into place) and increased production, but at the same time might allow=
=20
BPA to break long-term power contracts. Such critics (mostly clearly=20
represented by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a nonprofit Washington, D.C=
.=20
think tank) believe the Bush administration should force BPA to sell its=20
power to anyone who wants it at free-market rates (which of course are=20
consistently higher than its current cost-based rates).=20

In addition to potential rate increases, the BPA is attempting to secure=20
increased funding from the federal government. As a federal agency, the BPA=
=20
is allowed to borrow from the federal treasury to support infrastructure=20
upgrades such as transmission capacity and maintain federal dams that=20
generate the BPA's power. Recent reports have indicated that the BPA alread=
y=20
is spending around $1.3 billion in federal funds to modernize the region's=
=20
power grid and will request an additional $800 million from the federal=20
treasury for transmission upgrades and to modernize existing power-generati=
ng=20
facilities. Yet, at the same time, several regional groups are attempting t=
o=20
block any increase in the BPA's access to federal funds, arguing that the=
=20
administration has continuously lowered its annual payments into the treasu=
ry=20
and therefore should not be entitled to a credit increase. =20

The BPA may not have directly caused the current power problems in the=20
Northwest, but it is clear that the federal agency engaged in overly=20
optimistic power contracts that it now cannot fulfill. Moving forward, the=
=20
question will be whether or not, in a supposedly deregulated market, the BP=
A=20
should be governed by any special standards given its status as a federal=
=20
agency or whether it should be held to the same rules that apply to IOUs.=
=20
While the for-profit economy of the Northwest is now in jeopardy due to=20
volatile power prices, stakeholders in the region object to the BPA being=
=20
able to break contracts and increase rates. Once again, this appears to be=
=20
another matter that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Bush=20
administration to decide as part of the nation's unfolding energy agenda.=
