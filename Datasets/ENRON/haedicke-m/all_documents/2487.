FYI, the "WRMA" referenced in Jane's reply to you is the "Weather Risk 
Management Association."

Subject: Energy Seminar in Japan

Jane:

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Mark
