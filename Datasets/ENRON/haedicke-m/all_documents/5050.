Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee

Please see the following at the request of Mark Haedicke and forward this 
e-mail to any people that you think appropriate:

As many of you are aware, Enron Corp. has been appointed as a member of the 
Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Pacific Gas and Electric Company 
("PG&E") which filed a bankruptcy reorganization proceeding on April 6, 
2001.   As a member of the committee, Enron will have access to certain 
confidential and/or non-public information regarding PG&E.  Enron and the 
other members of the committee have signed a confidentiality agreement with 
PG&E that  restricts the use and disclosure of  this  confidential and/or 
non-public information.

Michael Tribolet with the Risk Assessment and Control group is Enron's 
designated representative to the committee, and Lisa Mellencamp with the ENA 
Legal Department will be assisting him in this role. Please be advised that 
they will be restricted from disclosing certain of the information that they 
receive.   Any requests for information regarding PG&E or its bankruptcy 
proceedings that Enron has obtained through its membership on the Committee 
should first be cleared by Lisa Mellencamp, Travis McCullough, Richard 
Sanders or me.
