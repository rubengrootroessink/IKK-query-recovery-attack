Attached are the turns of the Wind documents being transmitted to Wind after 
today's negotiations. Elizabeth, by separate e-mail I am providing you my 
draft legal risk memo and the Desk's draft DASH for your review.  Accounting 
is expected to report in tomorrow or Monday regarding the mark-to-market 
aspects, and I expect that the remaining known issues will be resolved in 
negotiations with Wind tomorrow afternoon, presuming I am released from jury 
duty by then. --David

It appears we have resolved these documents excepting (1) the number of days 
in 1(b) of the GPSA, (2) your review of our agreed concept for new taxes in 
the GPSA, (3) the Security Section 7.03 in the PPA regarding Seller's ability 
to provide and Enron Corp. guaranty before selldown occurs, and (4) agreement 
to a guaranty amount for EPMI to provide in association of the PPA (we have 
proposed a $25MM guaranty).

Michael, once you have had a chance to discuss these issues please give me a 
call to resolve.  

Thanks, - Mike
