HOUSTON BAR CLE SEMINARS ON CLEONLINE.COM!...

We are very pleased this month to announce that CLEonline.com and the
Houston Bar Association (HBA) have entered into an agreement to bring a
number of their CLE seminars online via our Web site.  Two of these new
HBA seminars are available this month, and many more will be offered on
our site in the months to come.

The Houston Bar produces a large number of excellent CLE programs each
year on a wide variety of subjects.  Through this new agreement, we will
now be able to bring many of these HBA seminars online and make them
available to all CLEonline.com users.  These seminars will feature
streaming video from the live HBA seminars as well as the written
materials.

If you are a member of a Bar association or other law-related group that
sponsors CLE seminars and your organization would be interested in
bringing your CLE seminars online just like the Houston Bar Association,
we would be delighted to talk with you and your group.  This is a
great way to extend the reach of your association's CLE seminars and
create a new source of revenue for your Bar association with no
additional costs.   If your organization would be interested in taking
advantage of this, please give us a call at 1-800-522-7566, and we can
provide you with all the details.

--> Identity Theft -- Strategies for the Information Age

This is the first of the new HBA seminars being offered and this is a
topic of growing interest for all attorneys and their clients.  This
seminar will address what identity theft is, how thieves can get personal
information about you or your clients, how this information can be
misused, and the statutory responses available.  You can watch and listen
to the same program that the HBA presented on this topic earlier this
year.  Scott Durfee of the Harris County DA's Office will serve as the
moderator.  This seminar is accredited for 1.5 hours of CLE.

Another of the new HBA seminars being offered this month is this new

live seminar, Ruth Kollman, Esq. of Dallas, will serve as the moderator
for this new online seminar.   This seminar is accredited for 2.0 hours
of CLE credit, all in legal ethics.
