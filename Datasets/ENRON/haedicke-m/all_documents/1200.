The Best of the Best!
MEA is searching for the best gas utility employees in the country to
compete in the National Gas Rodeo.  Teams of four will compete against the
clock and one another illustrating the skills required to perform their
daily jobs and to determine who is the =01&best=018.  For more information,=
 visit
our web site at <http://www.midwestenergy.org/rodeonew.html> or contact

Sara!

Interruptible Rate Structure/Black-Outs
Today, Eden Prairie High School, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota had
their electric service cut off by the local utility as part of their
interruptible rate structure.  An event like this -- students attempting to
learn in a dark, uncomfortably hot environment (outdoor temp 92 degrees) --
calls to mind an important natural gas-related issue: The availability and
attractiveness of gas-fired technologies (gas-fired air conditioning and
gas-fired power generation, for instance) to participate in the U.S. energy
picture.  This, in turn, raises the larger issue of a national energy polic=
y
and the role of natural gas to meet our various energy needs.

Big Questions for The Big Thinkers.  For those of us a little closer to "th=
e
trenches"....
