Gentlemen -

As a follow-up to my voice mail, attached are scanned copies of (1) the GOM 
Guarantee demand letter and (2) a separate letter to the GOI re same.  The 
separate letter to the GOI is a requirement under the GOI Guarantee.  

We are required to wait 7 days from the date of the GOM Guarantee demand 
letter before serving the GOI Guarantee demand letter.  I believe that we 
will serve the GOI Guarantee demand letter as soon as we are able to do so 
this coming week.

Bruce
