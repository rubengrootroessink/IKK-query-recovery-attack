Mark and John,

Michelle's understanding is that I am no longer to oversee this litigation.  
This is fine with me if that is your decision.  I think Michelle can handle 
it without my oversight.   On the other hand I am free to stay engaged as 
long as you want me to be.  Could you clarify our roles for both of us?  
Thanks.
