Christian:  as per our discussion, here is the risk memo Elizabeth sent me 
today with a few edits.  I thought I might hear from Pirog so I could get it 
a "little closer" but I have not heard from him yet.  Elizabeth wanted this 
to go to Mark today.  Please call me if you have any questions.  John
