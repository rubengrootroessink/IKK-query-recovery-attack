At Drew's request, I am delivering this message to confirm that under 
referenced contract, which we plan to have executed tomorrow, ENA will not be 
liable for payment of the contract price (or any part thereof), or any 
cancellation charges, or any other fees, charges or costs, unless and until  
ENA delivers to ABB a notice to proceed ("NTP"), which is entirely within 
ENA's discretion.  ENA has until December 1, 2000 to give NTP.  If ENA does 
not give NTP to ABB on or before that date, the contract automatically 
terminates, without any liability to ENA. 

 ENA may also, at its discretion, cancel the contract at any time.  If ENA 
cancels before NTP is given, ENA pays no cancellation charges or any other 
payment, and has no liability under the contract.
