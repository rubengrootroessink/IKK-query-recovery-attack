Gents, we have been asked to provide documentation support for EGM on this 
job, which includes some environmental remediation. Can you direct me to the 
lawyer you guys have handling this so we are sure to get  on the same page? 
Bill Middleton's nice summary two notes down references Greg Curran if that 
helps you find the responsibility center over there.

Thanks for the data, Bill. Please use Bob as your future contact for 
contracting support. 

Bob, please work with Scott Dieball for EAS legal input. I will find out who 
at EGM legal we should be liasing with since eventually their sign-off will 
likely be required.

 Thanks.

John,

This job is the 6 segment OE LNG  project in Puerto Rico for EGM benefiting 
San Juan Gas that will add EPC LNG truck loading facilities at Penuelas,  
purchase 2 reconditioned trailers to haul the LNG across PR to San Juan Gas' 
SJ facility.  At SJGas, the 4 project segments are (1) remediating of ~ 8000 
m3 of lightly contaminated soils (Enron bought the liability when they bought 
the plant), (2) EPC installation of a new 350,000 gal firewater tank to 
replace the existing one, (3) demolition of the of the existing 3,000,000 gal 
former gas holder fire water tank, and (4) EPC installation of an LNG truck 
unloading, storage and vaporization facility.  
Enron's corporate remediation contractor ThermoRetec has been retained to 
manage the remediation and existing FW tank demolition.  EAS will coordinate 
these efforts with the balance of the project segments.    

The new fire water tank was always an EPC effort.

The AFE's for the job have  been split into 484a & 593 at Owner's request .  
484a is approved by EGM's Greg Curran but has not been signed yet because EGM 
has not completed their DASH effort with Risk Management.  EECC performed the 
initial FEED for the Truck Unloading segment under an approved AFE.  This 
project has not been DASH'd because EECC does not have a risk position in any 
of this work. To date all work has been done with the full involvement of EGM 
& San Juan Gas.  The 2nd AFE is currently on hold at Owner's request.

The contract that will be produced will be between EGM and the Contractors 
with EAS acting as OE. 

The Owner is expected to authorize EAS to award the new FW tank EPC on 
Friday.  At that time we would need to be able to issue the successful bidder 
a letter of intent if the contract draft is not ready.

I will include Bob Sevitz on all future correspondence.  Renee' has done a 
very good job and has represented EECC/EAS and the Owner well from the first 
day.    

Allthough I am in Denver for the balance of the week, my cell phone is 281 
744 5234 and I can be reached here on it.  Please do not hesitate to call.

Regards and thanks for your continuing help.  

Bill

Subject: San Juan Puerto Rico LNG  - EPC and Firewater tank contracts
Project: 
Doc. Nbr.: 

Yesterday we were asked to prepare a construction contract for the pruchase 
and installation of a firewater tank for the San Juan Puerto Rico job. I 
understand that this originally had been slated to be done as a PO only, 
until construction was added to the scope late in the day.  We will work to 
get the contract drafted as quickly as possible.

I also understand that the bid is to be awarded this week, so before we 
launch a contract I wanted to make sure that any DASH, AFE or other 
authorization for the expenditure is in place.

Generally, the contract work on this project will be transitioning from Renee 
Alfaro to Bob Sevitz.
