I propose that Jeff, Chuck, Todd and I go through the documents with Marty 
and his number's guy or whoever else Marty likes (not his lawyers) first on 
Thursday.  We can always reserve on legal issues for which we need our 
attorney's advice.  Then if we need to do the mass-lawyer thing we follow-up 
with that Friday.

Marty is available either Thursday PM or Friday to negotiate our transaction 
documents.  I'd lean towards Friday because I'm not confident we would finish 
Thursday afternoon.  Please vote - the majority rules. Also, please state if 
you will be available and who you think are must attends.

Lastly, Sheila and/or Lisa, please coordinate with Lebeouf, Lamb.

Regards.
