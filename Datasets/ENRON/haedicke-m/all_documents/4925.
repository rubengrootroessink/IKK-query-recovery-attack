The draft legal risk memo for Project Priscilla (Las Vegas Cogen II) is 
attached for your review and comment.  I left a voice mail about the project 
on Friday.

The commercial people are working through the approval process this week.

Please let me know of any comment or concerns.  My extension in Portland is 
8863.

Thanks.
