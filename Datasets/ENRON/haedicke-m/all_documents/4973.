The Brazilian SEC has requested today that Elektro's response to questions 
from the Brazilian SEC be essentially published by tomorrow afternoon Brazil 
time.  As result, a conference call has been scheduled tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. 
to discuss the implications of this publication and the merits of objecting 
to the request.  My assistant will be sending around shortly an email with a 
call-in number for the call.   While we do not have an official translation 
of Elektro's response, the following is the best available at present:

1. Other than the dispositions of assets that are part of the ordinary course 
operations of Elektro, there is at present no specific intent or decision by 
Elektro, or the members of the controlling block of shareholders, to 
alienate, in whole or in part, the assets or capital of Elektro.  However, 
Elektro and the members of the controlling block of shareholders share Mr. 
Skilling's views referenced in your letter of March 22, 2001, wherein he 
states that for the right price and under the appropriate circumstances all 
assets are for sale.  As a result, preliminary and confidential discussions 
with various parties about the possibility of a sale of Elektro have taken 
place.  At present, there are no seriously active discussions of this type 
taking place.
 
2. Neither Elektro nor the members of the controlling block of shareholders 
have entered into any contract or agreement which commits or obligates, under 
any circumstances, Elektro or such shareholders to alienate the assets or 
capital of Elektro.  In the event such a contract were to be executed, 
Elektro's controlling block of shareholders would notify the CVM in 
accordance with Section 5 of CVM Instruction 299.

3. Elektro's program for infrastructure investment is regularly adjusted to 
meet the constantly changing demands upon, and forecasts made by, the 
company.  Based upon our assumption that your third question is intended to 
solicit an answer as to whether this program is any way being adjusted for 
reasons other than the needs and forecasts of the company, we can answer that 
it is not affected by any such reasons.  Accordingly, we reiterate our 
earlier response that Elektro's infrastructure investment program is being 
conducted in compliance with all of the applicable regulations and sound 
industry practices.

Robert,

This is the response - portuguese version - we sent out to CVM.
We basically took out the reference to possible future talks on the sale of 
Elektro, after discussing with Tozzini.
Reference to the existence of past talks was left unchanged (as was in the 
previous english version).
