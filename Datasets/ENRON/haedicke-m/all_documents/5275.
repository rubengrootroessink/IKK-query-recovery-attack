=09=09
=09=09Defendants'  blood alcohol test results were admissible, although the=
y were=20
not  under arrest at the time their blood alcohol levels were tested, =20
because the applicable statute does not mention arrest and provides  for th=
e=20
admissibility of blood alcohol test results in any civil  or criminal=20
proceeding where the blood upon which the test was run  was drawn "for=20
medical treatment" from a driver "involved in" an  accident. By its plain=
=20
terms, subsection (6)(e) concerns tests done  on blood drawn not for legal=
=20
responsibility reasons, but for medical  purposes, and is not limited to=20
those under arrest. The testimony  presented at trial indicated that the=20
medical procedures performed  on defendants, including the withdrawal of=20
their blood, were done  for medical reasons. Although one of the defendants=
=20
claimed that  he was not "involved in" the accident because his vehicle did=
=20
not  come in contact with another vehicle, the defendant was involved  in t=
he=20
accident because his vehicle played a part in the accident.  Affirmed.

that defendant was involved with Smith=01,s former  girlfriend. Defense cou=
