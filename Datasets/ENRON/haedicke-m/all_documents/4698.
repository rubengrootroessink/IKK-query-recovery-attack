IssueAlert for  March 9, 2001=20
California May Be Headed for Another Volatile Summer;
How Much Power Is Needed to Save the State?
by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis
Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity=20
contracts, or convinces people to turn off a lot more lights, California's=
=20
unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc again this summer. Ev=
en=20
with the long-term deals announced by Davis on March 5, up to 40 percent of=
=20
the state's daily needs may have to be bought on the highly volatile spot=
=20
market, where power is purchased a day ahead of when it is needed. That cou=
ld=20
prove hugely expensive for the state, because if this past year's spot mark=
et=20
prices are an indicator, then California might see spot market prices at fi=
ve=20
to six times more costly than what they would be under the long-term=20
contracts.=20
Analysis:  Despite the somewhat reassuring announcements that the state of=
=20
California has lined up various new long-term contracts for the supply of=
=20
power, it remains questionable if the power secured in the contracts will b=
e=20
enough to prevent another long, hard summer for the state and its residents=
.=20
In fact, some predictions suggest that summer 2001 could be just as bad or=
=20
worse as summer 2000, leading to another series of rolling blackouts and=20
spikes in spot market prices.=20
To date, California has spent upwards of $50 million a day (a total of $2=
=20
billion since January) to buy electricity on the spot market. The long-term=
=20
contracts in which the state has engaged are intended to lock in cheaper=20
prices and cut down the amount of electricity the state has to buy in the=
=20
volatile short-term market.=20
On March 5, Gov. Davis announced that the state of California=01*through th=
e=20
Department of Water Resources (DWR), the newly appointed power purchasing=
=20
agency=01*has agreed to 40 power purchase contracts with more than 20 gener=
ators=20
and marketers, which will supply an average of 8,886 MW per year over the=
=20
next 10 years. The contracts, varying in length from four months to 10 year=
s=20
and worth $43.4 billion in total, reportedly will provide the state with a=
=20
diversified long-term power portfolio, said Davis in an announcement. =20
According to a report in Megawatt Daily, the average price of the deals is=
=20
$69/MWh over the entire 10-year period. For the first five years, the avera=
ge=20
price will be $79/MWh, dropping to $61/MWh for the period between 2006 and=
=20
2011. Gov. Davis has offered that these prices are between 75 and 80 percen=
t=20
lower than recent spot market prices, although they are higher than the=20
original goal of $55/MWh that Davis had established when he first began to=
=20
negotiate long-term contracts. In a noticeable omission, the governor has=
=20
refused to identify exactly how much power from long-term contracts will be=
=20
available to the state this summer. =20
There has been a string of announcements regarding the long-term contracts,=
=20
so we know some of the 20 companies that are entering into agreements with=
=20
the state. For instance, Calpine Corp. locked the DWR into a 10-year contra=
ct=20
for the sale of approximately 5,000 MW of electricity. California will be=
=20
paying a fixed price for the power it buys from Calpine, but most reports=
=20
have placed the value of the deal in the range of $4.6 billion. Dynegy and=
=20
NRG Energy said that they have agreed to sell up to 2,300 MW=01*enough to p=
ower=20
about 2.3 million homes=01*to the DWR under contracts lasting through 2004.=
=20
According to the companies, their California generating affiliates=01*El Se=
gundo=20
Power LLC, Long Beach Generation LLC and Cabrillo I=01*will provide up to 1=
,000=20
MW of power to the state from today through the rest of 2001, increasing=20
deliveries of 2,300 MW from Jan. 1, 2002. Mirant Corp. (formerly Southern=
=20
Energy) announced an agreement to shift 1,000 MW in power contracts from th=
e=20
California Power Exchange to the state's DWR.=20
These are just a few examples, among other companies such as Avista, Duke,=
=20
Enron, PacifiCorp, and Williams that have signed on to serve the state unde=
r=20
long-term contracts.  Absent from the list is Reliant Energy, which=20
reportedly is in negotiations with the DWR, but reluctant to commit to more=
=20
than a 30-day contract to sell power to the state. Reliant is owed over $30=
0=20
million for power delivered to Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific=
=20
Gas & Electric (PG&E) in November and December 2000. The two major utilitie=
s=20
owe more than $12 billion to power-generating companies and can't buy more,=
=20
having no credit or cash to make the purchases, which is what prompted to t=
he=20
state to appoint the DWR into the power purchasing role =20
Gov. Davis has said, "With these deals in place, California's energy future=
=20
is looking a whole lot brighter." But is it really? That is the question of=
=20
the hour. Representatives for the governor have indicated that the long-ter=
m=20
contracts will reduce the state's need to purchase power on the spot market=
=20
over the next 10 years by about 75 percent. Yet, of more immediate concern =
to=20
analysts is what will transpire during the fast-approaching summer heat, wh=
en=20
demand increases. This represents a quite precarious scenario, the start of=
=20
which is only about two months away. Speaking at a press conference in Los=
=20
Angeles on March 5, Davis said state DWR negotiators have so far been able =
to=20
meet between 65 and 70 percent of the state's power needs for the coming=20
summer, based on last summer's consumption. The governor again called on=20
residents to cut usage by 10 percent over last year. Despite the tempered=
=20
optimism associated with these announced long-term contracts, the general=
=20
consensus is that, however much power Gov. Davis has lined up for this=20
summer, it won't be enough. In fact, when pressed for details about how muc=
h=20
power would be available this summer, Davis conceded that the state will=20
still have to buy 30 to 45 percent of its power on the expensive short-term=
=20
market.=20
As noted, the long-term contracts that have been established thus far vary =
in=20
length from four months to 10 years. However, when doing the math for the=
=20
anticipated summer season, the calculation of what will be needed versus wh=
at=20
will be available paints a pretty alarming picture. During the month of=20
August=01*typically the hottest month in California=01*peak daily demand fo=
r power=20
in the California ISO territory is expected to hit about 47,700 MW. The=20
state's three IOUs=01*PG&E, SCE and San Diego Gas & Electric=01*still gener=
ate=20
about 8,000 MW from their remaining power plants and have long-term contrac=
ts=20
from wind, solar and other energy sources that gains them an additional=20
11,700 MW of power. Gov. Davis has established that about 7,000 MW from the=
=20
long-term contracts will be available this summer. In addition, back in=20
February, Davis announced a plan to expedite new power plants in the state,=
=20
which he promised would bring 5,000 MW online by July (an ambitious goal th=
at=20
may or may not materialize). Altogether, assuming that all of these=20
projections are reliable, the total comes to about 26,000 MW that we know=
=20
should be available in California this summer, leaving the state about 16,0=
00=20
MW short for its power supply needs. =20
Gov. Davis may continue to secure long-term contracts with other power=20
suppliers. Or, then again, he may not be able to do so. Most of the promine=
nt=20
power suppliers operating in the United States have already signed deals wi=
th=20
the DWR and are included in the 7,000 MW that is already expected for the=
=20
summer. Thus, there is a strong chance that the bulk of the 16,000 MW neede=
d=20
by California will have to be bought on the spot market, where prices are=
=20
projected to remain high at least through the beginning of next year.=20
Reportedly, just within the last week, last minute prices on California's=
=20
spot market averaged $411/MWh, compared to $69/MWh, which is the average of=
=20
the long-term contracts. =20
Some officials, including Gov. Davis, have said that, now more than ever,=
=20
conservation in California is critical. Representatives of the governor hav=
e=20
suggested that if Californians reduce their electricity usage by 10 percent=
,=20
conservation efforts across the state could reduce peak demand by nearly=20
5,000 MW. =20
Or, perhaps a traditional rain dance would be in order. California is due f=
or=20
a cooler summer season after the two previous summers that were unseasonabl=
y=20
warm. A rainy season would bring cooler temperatures to the state and thus=
=20
drive down the anticipated demand for the summer, which is based on last=20
year's load. If the state is fortunate enough to receive a rainy season or=
=20
otherwise cooler-than-expected summer, then the state could squeak by with=
=20
enough power supply resources to accommodate anticipated demand. If summer=
=20
2001 is another unseasonably warm one for the state, the plan that is=20
presently in place sounds like a blueprint for another volatile and expensi=
ve=20
summer for California=20
