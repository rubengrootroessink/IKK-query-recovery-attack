Attached is an email that I received from A&K.  While I believe that it does 
not currently present a conflict, (i) it may present a conflict sometime in 
the future if we run into environmental problems in connection with our 
development efforts in Florida or (ii) for some other reason beyond my 
limited scope of knowledge.  Please advise regarding how I should respond.  
Thanks.

Stuart

Stuart,

 Just a note that the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection has requested A&K to represent it in some litigation against
Coastal.  The case is in Washington, D.C.  and does not involve power
plant issues.  Although niether I nor Sara will be involved in the
matter, Tom Starnes of our Environmental Section will be directly
responsible.

 I would appreciate your indication of whether this will be a
conflicts problem.  Feel free to do so by return email.

 Thanks, Stuart.

Paul Bohannon
