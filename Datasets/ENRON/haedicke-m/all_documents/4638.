Enron Develops New Wind Facility in Texas

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Enron Wind and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI), affiliates of Enron Corp=
.=20
(NYSE: ENE) announced completion of a transaction in which Enron Wind will=
=20
build a 135-MW wind power facility near Iraan, Texas, in Pecos County. Unde=
r=20
a related agreement, EPMI will purchase the project's electricity under a=
=20
long-term agreement for resale into the Texas wholesale electricity market.=
=20
This will be the first major wind facility that allows wholesale customers =
to=20
purchase portions of the wind power production. In the past, customers=20
interested in purchasing "green power" were often forced to commit to 100=
=20
percent of a project's output over the 20-year life of the equipment. =20

Analysis: I have suggested before that Texas arguably represents the most=
=20
active market for wind power in the United States. Enron's expansion of its=
=20
wind power assets in the state should further support the growth of=20
competition of wind power in this market, as the state gears up for the sta=
rt=20
of competition in January 2002. Yet, while Enron Wind expands its presence =
in=20
the market and prepares to sell wind-generated electricity on Texas'=20
wholesale market, several other companies also have established a significa=
nt=20
presence in the state's booming wind power business.=20

Enron Wind, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., has been in existence for about 20=
=20
years. The company designs and constructs wind power facilities around the=
=20
world, comprising more than 4,500 wind turbines and 1,600 MW of capacity.=
=20
According to information from the company, Enron Wind's manufacturing=20
facilities in California, Germany and Spain "develop and manufacture=20
state-of-the-art wind turbines technology ranging from 750 kW to 2.0 MW."=
=20
Reportedly, Enron Wind's 1.5 MW Series turbine is the largest wind turbine=
=20
manufactured in the United States and was the first of its size class to be=
=20
manufactured for the global wind power market. The Enron Wind 1.5 wind=20
turbine utilizes a variable speed, constant frequency design and a=20
custom-designed airfoil, resulting in enhanced reliability and durability d=
ue=20
to reduced mechanical loads, higher energy capture and lower noise signatur=
e=20
than conventional fixed speed turbines. =20

The new project in Iraan, Texas, which is still unnamed, will consist of 90=
=20
Enron Wind 1.5 MW wind turbines and is expected to be completed by late 200=
1.=20
Enron Wind claims that the project will supply approximately 520,000 megawa=
tt=20
hours of clean electricity each year, enough to supply the annual residenti=
al=20
needs of approximately 50,000 average American homes. =20

Enron Wind already has one wind facility operating in Texas, which is in fa=
ct=20
located only 10 miles away from the new facility in Iraan. The Indian Mesa =
I=20
facility is a 25.5 MW wind power generating facility also located in Pecos=
=20
County. In July 2000, Enron Wind entered into a long-term agreement with Ci=
ty=20
Public Service (CPS) of San Antonio to provide 100-percent output from the=
=20
Indian Mesa I facility to the west Texas utility grid. Electricity produced=
=20
from the Indian Mesa I facility reportedly is offered by CPS to individual=
=20
retail customers such as Windtricity=01v, which is CPS' first renewable ene=
rgy=20
product offering. =20

In addition to these two Texas facilities, Enron Wind also has developed,=
=20
constructed and operated wind power facilities in Iowa (Storm Lake, 193 MW)=
,=20
Minnesota (Lake Benton 1, 107 MW, and Lake Benton 2, 104 MW), and Californi=
a=20
(Cabazon, 40 MW, and Green Power 1, 16.5 MW). In all of these facilities,=
=20
Enron Wind has established long-term contracts to sell 100 percent of the=
=20
electricity generated at the wind facility to a local utility. As noted, th=
e=20
new facility being planned in west Texas represents a new approach for Enro=
n=20
Wind, as electricity output from the facility will be sold in portions to a=
=20
variety of wholesale customers in the Texas market. =20

Over the last year, there has been a sharp increase in wind power projects =
in=20
Texas, mostly being built in the western part of the state. At last report,=
=20
186 MW of wind generation was already in operation in the state, with close=
=20
to 400 MW recently announced or planned. As a result, Texas is experiencing=
 a=20
"wind boom" and is well on its way toward the 2,000 MW of renewable energy=
=20
capacity required under the state's Renewables Portfolio Standard. =20

For example, last September TXU Electric & Gas, a subsidiary of TXU,=20
announced an agreement to purchase renewable energy from a planned 82.5 MW=
=20
wind farm in west Texas. TXU Electric & Gas' share of the project will be=
=20
31.5 MW. The project marked the company's third major purchase of wind powe=
r=20
energy. Earlier in 2000, TXU Electric & Gas formed a partnership with FPL=
=20
Energy to build 242 wind turbines south of Odessa, Texas, which will supply=
=20
500 million kWh of electricity per year to approximately 29,000 homes. That=
=20
project followed similar development in Big Spring, Texas, including eight=
=20
wind turbines that are each capable of generating 1,650 kW of power.=20

As an energy supplier, TXU Electric & Gas has obtained a great deal of its=
=20
wind power by partnering with FPL Energy=01*the largest generator of wind p=
ower=20
in the United States=01*which serves on many of the new projects in west Te=
xas.=20
FPL Energy is a fast-growing, unregulated power producer that is a=20
wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL Group. Among the more than 3,000 MW net=20
generating capacity that FPL Energy now has, the company focuses on "clean"=
=20
technologies. Wind power now accounts for about 15 percent of FPL Energy's=
=20
generation portfolio.=20

The projects by TXU Electric & Gas represented the largest wind power=20
projects in the world until late August, when Reliant Energy announced what=
=20
it claimed to be the world's largest single wind power installation.=20
Reliant's wind power project, slated to become operational in the fourth=20
quarter of 2001, will be located on King Mountain, near McCamey in far west=
=20
Texas. Reliant says that the project will be able to produce 250 MW of=20
electricity that will be sold into Texas' power grid. (Note: The Reliant wi=
nd=20
project has now been eclipsed by a joint, 300-MW wind project between=20
PacifiCorp and FPL Energy in Walla Walla, Wash. However, I am focused only =
on=20
the Texas market in this column).=20

Thus, Enron faces stiff competition when selling its wind power into the=20
Texas wholesale market. Enron joins TXU Electric & Gas, FPL Energy and=20
Reliant as the four companies that are vying to gain a leadership role over=
=20
the limited areas of the state where the wind blows at speeds of 14.5 miles=
=20
per hour or higher (the minimum to make a wind project cost effective). =20

Why is there so much development related to wind power taking place in Texa=
s?=20
A number of factors are making the state a strong market for wind. The firs=
t=20
factor is nature itself: Texas is one of the handful of states along the Su=
n=20
Belt and Southwest regions that offer an abundance of wind. Some reports=20
indicate that average annual wind speeds in west Texas are 18 miles per hou=
r.=20
Second, deregulation legislation in the state resulted in the Texas=20
Renewables Portfolio Standard, which until the end of 2001 is providing a=
=20
federal tax credit for companies that produce electricity from wind. The=20
deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable=20
forms of energy when compared to the 24 states that have enacted legislatio=
n=20
for electric competition. The pro-renewables stance is perhaps attributed t=
o=20
the fact that a variety of environmental lobbying groups=01*including the=
=20
Environmental Defense group and the Texas Renewable Energy Industries=20
Association=01*were included in the dialogue when Texas was forming its law=
. In=20
addition, more efficient technology has lowered prices for wind-generated=
=20
electricity, while costs associated with natural gas have remained high. Ad=
d=20
all that to the fact that customers in the Lone Star State have a=20
comparatively high desire for wind power=01*along with other strong markets=
 such=20
as California, Iowa and Minnesota. Consequently, Texas has proven to be an=
=20
enticing region for companies like Enron Wind and its competitors in the=20
state's wind power market. =20
