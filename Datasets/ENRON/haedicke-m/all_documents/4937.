On May 1st, iBuyit Payables will be activated for all organizations support=
ed=20
by the Houston-based Accounts Payable processing center.  The purpose of th=
is=20
message is to explain the iBuyit Payables invoice review and approval proce=
ss=20
and to ask your help in defining and communicating the limits of authority=
=20
within your business unit.

How iBuyit Works
The May 1st introduction of iBuyit Payables will initially have the=20
flexibility to administer any invoice review/approval process, however, in=
=20
the near future it will also be able to enforce the review/approval process=
. =20
Therefore, until the enforcement functionality is activated the project tea=
m=20
is instructing iBuyit Payable users to continue to follow the current invoi=
ce=20
review and approval guidelines of their business unit. =20

The following steps outline the iBuyit Payables invoice review/approval=20
process:
1. The coder will self-direct the invoice to the appropriate=20
reviewer/approver, according to business unit guidelines. =20
2. If the reviewer/approver has the authority to approve the invoice,=20
according to their business unit guidelines, they validate the coding and=
=20
approve the invoice for payment.
3. If the reviewer/approver does not have the authority to approve the=20
invoice, according to their business unit guidelines, they self-direct the=
=20
invoice to the appropriate person for approval.

We Need Your Help
For an effective introduction of iBuyit Payables, it is important that each=
=20
business unit has a clearly defined release strategy.  If you do not=20
currently have a release strategy in place, it is important that one is=20
defined as soon as possible. =20

Once the release strategy has been defined for your Business Unit, I=20
encourage you to communicate it to your organization so that iBuyit Payable=
s=20
users can appropriately route invoices for review and approval.  Attached i=
s=20
a template to assist you in communicating this information.=20

In addition, please submit your release strategy to me by Thursday, April 1=
9,=20
so that the project team can work to enhance iBuyit Payables=01, ability to=
=20
function as an enforcement tool.=20

I am dedicated to ensuring that iBuyit Payable tool meets your control=20
needs.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions=20
(713-646-6222).
Thank You=20
