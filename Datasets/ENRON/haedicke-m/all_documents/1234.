Mark,

The coal group has reached agreement with Chris Cline to grant him a call on 
our equity interest in Jupiter Coal.  The terms of the call and the 
consideration therefor are described in the attached.  Mike Beyer asked that 
I send you a copy of the Dash and answer any questions you might have 
relating thereto.  There is, as usual, some urgency  as to signoff on this 
matter as we need to get the agreement in Cline's hands next Tuesday.  Please 
call with any questions.

 

Wayne
