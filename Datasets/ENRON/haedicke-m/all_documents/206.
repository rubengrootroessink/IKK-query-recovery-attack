I have attached hereto two versions of a confidentiality agreement you could 
use in connection with the project we discussed yesterday.  The only 
difference between the two is that one contains an arbitration provision and 
the other one does not.   Since we are the party providing the information, 
it sems to me that we  may want to have the option to sue in court for a 
breach.   The one without the arbitration provision is also shorter.

I have the left the term provision in paragraph 5 blank.  It occurred to me 
that the information we are providing may need to remain confidential for 
more than thirty days.  The appropriate term should depend on what 
information we are providing and how long the infomation will remain current 
and not obsolete.  Input from the business people on this may be helpful.  
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this or if I can do anything 
further for you .  Thanks.
