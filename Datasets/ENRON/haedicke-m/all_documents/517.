Attached is the the proposal that was submitted to ISDA last Friday by Enron 
with Mallesons. The proposal  is structured around  DealBench and on some 
significant points does not follow the general structure envisaged in the 
ISDA RFP. Whilst we await ISDA's response with interest we realize the chance 
of success may not be great.
