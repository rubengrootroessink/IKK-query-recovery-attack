Mark--As we discussed this morning, I have revised the legal risk memo for 
the Fountain Valley Power development to address the issue of the mismatch in 
dates for the respective parties to exercise their termination rights.  I 
have done this in a new paragraph "2" to the legal risk memo, attached.
