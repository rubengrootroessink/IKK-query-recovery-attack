We have scheduled several events on Tuesday, May 15, the day before the
start of the strategic planning session. If you are interested in attending
any of them, please let Yasuko and me know so that we can plan accordingly.
In particular, attendance at the Bank of Japan visits will be limited.

12:00 noon - 2:00 pm Pre-Strategic Meeting (Roundtable Luncheon)
Kohaku Room at Royal Park Hotel
Please see my separate email on the pre-strategic planning lunches.

2:30 pm - 3:15 pm Bank of Japan
Mr. Takashi Oyama, Advisor to the Governor, Financial Markets Dept. and
International Department

3:30 pm - 4:15 pm Bank of Japan
Mr. Taku Oizumi, Chief Manager, Financial System Division, Financial and
Payment System Office

We have a conference on the 15th at the Royal Park Hotel in Tokyo. Several
Board members (Maurits, Bob, me) will be speaking at that. In addition, we
have scheduled a session with the press at 10:30, which will be an effort to
reach out to the Japanese press so that they get to know ISDA better. In
addition to Tanaka-san and Koshikawa-san, we plan to have Keith, Hase-san,
Wani-san (our Japanese lawyer) and me at that session. You are welcome to
sit in on that press session to hear what is discussed and meet members of
the press informally.

I have planned an informal dinner for Tuesday night with the Tokyo staff and
other staff members who will be in Tokyo. You are welcome to join us. Please
let me know. We will provide details closer to the date.

On all of these events, please let Yasuko and me know if you are interested
in attending. In addition, if you have not already done so, please return
the strategic planning reply form to Yasuko with details on your travel
schedule.
