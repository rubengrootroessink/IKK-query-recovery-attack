Dear Mr Mark E  Haedicke,

I am currently in the process of sourcing papers for the Digital Media Web 
Portal and as a speaker at one of our previous conferences I would like to 
extend the invitation to you to provide a paper.

If you are not yet familiar with the Digital Media Web Portal, it is a unique 
one-stop information service for all media industry professionals and prides 
itself on providing excellent feature articles for our audience.  As an 
independent industry-focussed website we are establishing ourselves at the 
forefront of media providers.  We currently have a subscriber database of 
over 45,000 industry professionals.  Please log onto the Portal 
http://www.digitalmediaweb.com to view past features and interviews.

The topic can be of your choice, as long as it pertains to the digital media 
sector and is non-advertorial in nature. We are looking for a paper 800-1000 
word length and would urge you to take up this opportunity to use the Portal 
as your platform.  If you would like any further information on the Portal, 
or have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me on the details below.

Look forward to discussing this further.

Kind regards,

Zoe Ayliffe
