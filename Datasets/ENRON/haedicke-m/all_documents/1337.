Subject: Corporate Officers / Confidentiality Agreement

Robert, please set up the following Delaware single-member LLC, wholly owned 
by ENA:

EnronExec, LLC

Officers:
Richard A. Lydecker, President/CEO
Mark D. Meier, Senior Vice President of Business Development
Patrick L. Johnson, Senior Vice President of Operations

Please let me know if you need other information, such as SSNs or other 
identifying information.

Regarding the confidentiality agreement, can you please draft a template for 
a two-way agreement?  I would rather suggest a format with which we are 
comfortable from the start, rather than negotiate the counter-parties' 
template with them.  I believe we have a better chance of getting what we 
want that way.  Also, you may use the EnronExec name in the C.A.  Make sure 
that the C.A. includes language to protect against all information learned on 
Enron as well as specific language prohibiting the use of the Enron name in 
any of the counter-parties' correspondence, advertisements, etc. without the 
express written permission of Enron (we will yield to your judgement on 
language).

Please phone or e-mail if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.

-Pat
