I believe the start-up of click trading is an opportune time to go electronic 
on all aspects of the drafting and negotiation of master energy contracts and 
confirmations.  At least one law firm has a  project underway where the goal 
is to type in the country, the commodity type (including quantity and time) 
and to have a draft trading contract be the immediate result.  The concept is 
one of "modular" construction of trading contracts with maximum 
standardization and minimum differences country to country and commodity to 
commodity.  I want everyone to be thinking about how this can be 
accomplished.  I will schedule a meeting on this shortly.
