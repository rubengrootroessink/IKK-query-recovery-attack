=09=09Judge(s):  Gilman, Siler, and Duggan
=09=09
=09=09Deciding an  issue of first impression in the circuit, the court held=
 that a =20
plaintiff in a Fair Housing Act case has the burden of proof to  establish=
=20
the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation. Since  landlord-Golden Gate=
=20
had a legitimate interest in ensuring the quiet  enjoyment of all its=20
tenants, and there was no showing of  a reasonable accommodation that would=
=20
have enabled the plaintiff,  who suffered from schizophrenia and depression=

to remain in his  apartment without significantly disturbing another tenant=
,=20
plaintiff  failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to a=20
violation  of his rights under either the Fair Housing Act or the equivalen=

state laws. Plaintiff allegedly screamed and slammed doors within  his=20
apartment, causing the tenant in the apartment above his to  make repeated=

complaints to Golden Gate's manager. The parties attempted  unsuccessfully =
to=20
resolve the issue over a period of time, during  which Golden Gate=20
soundproofed plaintiff's front door and attempted  to work with his social=

court granted the petitioner-newspaper's request. The underlying  criminal=
=20
case involved the former superintendent of the city wastewater  treatment=
=20
plant. The jury returned a verdict on the charges of violation  of the Clea=
n=20
Water Act. During voir dire each prospective  juror announced his or her na=
me=20
and community of residence. The  trial attracted the attention of the local=
=20
media. After the verdict  was returned, a reporter requested the names of t=
he=20
trial jurors  from the court clerk. Thereafter, petitioner requested an=20
order  for the disclosure of the jurors' names and communities of residence=
, =20
but not their telephone numbers or home addresses. The request was  measure=
d=20
and confined to matters within the public record, and its  disclosure would=

=09=09
=09=09The trial court  did not err by using defendant's prior conviction to=
 convict=20
him  as a second habitual offender because the offense is now classified  a=
s=20
a misdemeanor. Defendant claimed that use of the prior conviction  in this=

n=20
Constitutions. The court disagreed and  affirmed defendant's conviction as =
a=20
second habitual offender and  the sentence imposed pursuant to that=20
conviction. A sentencing court  may use a prior conviction of a crime that=
=20
was classified as a felony  at the time it was committed to enhance the=20
sentence for a subsequent  felony conviction, even though the prior crime h=

=09=09
=09=09The district  court erred in failing to dismiss Count Three of the=20

=09=09
=09=09The trial court  did not err in concluding that clear and convincing =
evidence=20
supported  termination of respondent-mother=01,s parental rights. The recor=
d=20
showed  that respondent and her children shared a close bond. However, it =
=20
also showed that respondent continued to have contact with and marry  her=

boyfriend after she knew of his violent tendencies and that  he likely=20
injured her children, and after the court ordered that  he have no contact=
=20
with the children. Although respondent later  divorced her husband, and=20
testified that she was no longer involved  with him, other trial testimony=
=20
indicated that she did continue  to be involved with him. The trial court=
=01,s=20
findings indicated that  it did not credit respondent=01,s testimony, and t=
