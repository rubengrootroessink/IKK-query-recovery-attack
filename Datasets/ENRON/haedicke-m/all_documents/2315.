Attached is language which can be included in transactions involving power 
trades (physical or financial) which provides for the following:

1. Alberta market opening condition in favour of Enron Canada for January 1, 
2001; and
2. after market opening, provision for suspension of obligations in case 
there is a legislative or regulatory event affecting the Sundance "B" PPA 
which materially adversely impacts our ability to dispatch or sell the power 
of the Sundance "B" PPA.

There is, of course, some risk that counterparties will want these provisions 
to be bi-lateral, which could introduce the ability for the counterparty to 
use these concepts to avoid the transaction if, for example, the market moves 
against them.

Regards,
Peter
