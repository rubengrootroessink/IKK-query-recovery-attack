risk magazine has requested an interview with enron regarding risks=20
associated with the western power markets.  eric thode has lined me up to=

talk with them.  after seeing the questions that they are interested in, it=

seems to me that they are most interested in understanding legal and=20
contractual risks in the west.  while i am happy to talk with them, you guy=
s=20
are the experts on these matters.  what do you think of the questions posed=
=20
below?  should someone from the legal team talk to them instead of me?  let=

me know your thoughts.
