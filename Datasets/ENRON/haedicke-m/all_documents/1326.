Mark-sorry to bug you about this, but I'm getting bugged at this end.  Do
you see any problem in K&S representing BP in the deal outlined below?

Also, thanks for the Midway TECO deal-I always enjoy working with Kay Mann.

Regards-John

Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get
your
clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.

Thanks again.

Regards

John
