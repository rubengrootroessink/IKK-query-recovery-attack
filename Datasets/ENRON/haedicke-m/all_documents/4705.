Attached is a copy of the Texas Supreme Court's decision
yesterday in the Quantum Chemicals case, holding that a plaintiff in an age
discrimination claim under Texas law need only prove that age was a
"motivating factor" in his/her termination. 

The practical effect of this ruling is that it is easier for a plaintiff to 
prevail on claims of discrimination under the Texas statute.  

This makes it all the more important for us to be sure that we have 
legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for a discharge decision prior to the 
termination taking place.  Otherwise, we could find ourselves in an uphill 
battle in litigation.
