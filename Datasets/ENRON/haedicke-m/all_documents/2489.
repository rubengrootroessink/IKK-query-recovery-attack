The Railroad Commission is requiring that a 59 mile section of the A/S line 
be smart pigged.
HPL's estimated cost to make the line pigable is $1,000,000. This cost only 
covers the installation
of pig traps and replacing valves.  It does not include the cost to run the 
pig, making any needed
repairs, or cover any cost for business interruption.

I will update with more information as becomes available.
