Attached is a resume of Debra Ruby who I have known for many years.  She is 
currently looking for a position in Houston as a corporate attorney.  I can 
personally recommend Debra for a variety of legal positions within Enron.  I 
would appreciate it if you reviewed her attached resume and if you think 
there may be a fit within your organization, please contact her directly. 

Thanks for taking the time to look at her experience.
