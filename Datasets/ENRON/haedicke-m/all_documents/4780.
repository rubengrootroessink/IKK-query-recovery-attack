Mark -- 

William Rhode weighed in with his questions for Jeff.  I'd like to go over 
these with you, as I have my ideas about answers but am concerned about the 
project overall.


As a new market maker in derivative markets, what do we offer that banks 
don't?
What is it like being a non-financial entity going into these markets?
What kind of tangible commitment are you making to derivative markets?
Does your activity outside of core energy impact your stock price and make 
you a riskier investment?

Mark, I'd appreciate the opportunity to zero in on this tomorrow morning if 
possible.
