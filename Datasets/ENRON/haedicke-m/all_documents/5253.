Some 10-to-90-percent splits are good, like giving one-tenth of  what you 
make to those less fortunate, or putting 10 percent of your income  into a 
smart savings plan. Others are bad, like being a   miserly 10-percent tipper 
or using only that tiny portion of the  capabilities of your powerful 
computer software. Worst of all is the fact  that most of us use only 10 
percent of our intelligence and   creative potential, leaving vast quantities 
of what we're  capable lying dormant, unused, and untapped. It's this ratio 
that Robert  Cooper hopes to help reverse with "The Other 90%," his   
inspirational guide to waking the sleeping giant within.
