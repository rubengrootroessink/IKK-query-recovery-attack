Mark,
I would appreciate your help in nudging an Online FERC filing.  Our traders
feel somewhat hamstrung that they can't use Enron Online because of affiliate
restrictions in our tariffs.  The concern is particularly heightened as we
plan for the uncertaintly in the markets this summer.  A couple of months back
we got management agreement within Enron to make this happen.  A month ago PGE
and EPMI companion filings had been drafted and filing appeared imminent. 
Since then, however, we have been going back and forth on redrafts to address
a series of issues that the Online folks have been raising.  I'm looking for a
way to break this loose, if possible.  dn
