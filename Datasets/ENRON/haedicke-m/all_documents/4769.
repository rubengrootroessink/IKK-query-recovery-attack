Mark and Peter -

At long last, I received the revised Enron Corp form of guaranties.  I have 
asked for an electronic copy and will forward them to you upon receipt.  That 
aside, I think we should get on the phone for a brief chat about next steps 
-- at your convenience.  I have a few ideas and want to run them by you 
guys.  Let me know if this sounds ok to you and I'll have Deb set it up.

Thanks.

Rob
