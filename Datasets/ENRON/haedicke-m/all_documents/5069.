Hello Mark,

Both Bob and myself have left messages to speak with you about email 
retention time.  Those messages must have been lost, so I have decided to try 
email.

The group we work in, Technical Power Services,  is project oriented.  We are 
an extension of the Engineering department.  As you are well aware the 
development, and construction of power projects can be a minimum of 9 months, 
to as long as 4 years plus.  To give an example, the work that has been 
started on the coal initiative. At $4-$5 mmbtu for gas, the development of 
coal plants becomes more economical.  This development is just starting, 
nothing will be decided for a couple of years, then if it goes ahead 
construction could easily be 3 years or more.

What we are trying to stress is the information that is started in the 
beginning of a project needs flow through to the end of the project, which in 
most instances is longer than a year.

Some of the current power projects we are developing have COD date in 2002 to 
2004.  The retention of email is important to the projects.

The companies that we deal with will be keeping the correspondence and if we 
don't have our own copies, I think you know where this is going.

We would like to discuss this with you.  There has been folders set up in the 
Public mailbox system to give us more than the 100MB limit.  This is very 
helpful since some drawings files we receive can be over 10MB.

We are patiently waiting to speak with you on this subject.

Thank you.
