I promise this is my last e-mail of the day!

Thought you would be interested in reviewing Jim Newsome's speech given at
ISDA's Energy and Developing Products Conference in Houston on May 6.  He
discusses the Commodity Futures Modernization Act -- innovation -- and his
regulatory philosophy  - "do not regulate for regulation's sake alone"
