Attached please find the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, edited
pursuant to our discussion this morning.  Only one other change has been
made; Robin wanted to include the language "or which could have been
asserted" in paragraphs 6 and 7.  If you need any additional changes or have
any comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
