Mark,

As a follow-up to my e-mail of last week, attached is a transition list from 
Greer Mendelow. Of the 5 items on the list, I think items 1 - 3 should go to 
Scott and his group as those assets are going to Enron Europe. Items 4 - 6 
relate to projects in Middle East and EECC, so they will be transitioned to 
lawyers in those groups.

Let me know if you want me to correspond directly with Scott on this or if 
you will be passing this on to him.

Thanks,
Wade

Wade,


Attached is my list of projects and key items I am working on for each.  I am 
not sure who the in-house lawyer(s) should be the "transitionee" for each, 
but am happy to visit with you about it.   Let me know your thoughts so I can 
begin the process.  I am in the office the rest of this week and all of next 
week, then not again until Aug 1.  We are planning to leave London around Aug 
10.

Thanks a bunch. Take care and I'll speak to you soon.

Greer
