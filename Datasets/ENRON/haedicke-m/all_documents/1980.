The CPUC has subpoenaed EPMI to produce an incredible totality of information 
by October 4.  I'm sure at least  Richard is already aware of this and Mary 
Hain is directly involved up here.  If we actually have to do what they ask 
us to do,  it  is going to cause quite a stir in this office over the next 
few days.   Steve Hall of Stoel Rives has been working here this week as part 
of our training program for Stoel Rives and is giving Mary some help.  Marcus 
Wood is in the office working on an origination deal and is aware of the 
situation.   Steve says Stoel Rives recently helped a client deal with 
producing a massive amount of information for an anti-trust investigation.   
In case we need a big firm to help us respond logistically to this thing we 
should consider them as perhaps a good local resource.  My concern is that 
the  regular trading- legal process  up here is going to grind to a halt, 
thereby creating all kinds of misery if I have to drop everything and sort 
through documents.   There is going to be a conference call at 9 pacific time 
on Wednesday to pull together a strategy.     ----cgy
