Mark, attached is the revised Excel spreadsheet showing allocation of inside 
costs between ENA, ECM, EIM, EGM, NW, and all others.  I added allocations to 
Schuler/McCullough Cost Center for EIM and EGM as requested since we did make 
a provision in the budget for 2 additional attorneys for that group but I 
forgot to account for them in these allocations.  I also revised to more 
accurately portray the Corp. Legal allocations and included on a separate 
line below your Cost Center.   The percentage of Inside Costs for ENA is now 
67.19%.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Deb
