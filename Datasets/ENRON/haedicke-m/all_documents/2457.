Subject: Meeting - Friday December 8

Randy:

Per our meeting on Friday, you asked me to summarize what we discussed so=
=20
that you can address these issues with Mark Haedicke:

1. I recently changed the standard ECB slate of directors of the Caycos=20
directly owned by Enron Caribbean Basin LLC, to reflect the standard ESA=20
slate of directors.  These Caycos all relate to projects or assets in=20
Colombia and Venezuela. =20

2. Early this week Nancy Muchmore mentioned that the new slate of directors=
=20
would be put into place: Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzalez (replacing Bannantine an=
d=20
Christodoulou), Derrick and Walls. Today=01,s email from David Delainey sta=
tes=20
that Enron Global Assets =01) South America will work in close coordination=
 with=20
Enron Americas. However with these recent re-organization announcements,=20
would this new slate that Nancy mentioned, apply to the Enron Global Assets=
 =01)=20
South America group? Perhaps, upper management should consider naming some=
=20
key individual(s) in the South America Assets group to the slate.  I believ=
e=20
that we should keep it simply with one standard slate in place (in case we=
=20
reorganize again), but adding at least some one from the assets side. =20

3. I was about to move the mentioned Caycos directly owned by Enron Caribbe=
an=20
Basin LLC under Enron South America LLC when the new re-organization was=20
announced.  I will need a directive from Legal as well as from Tax where to=
=20
move these entities. =20

4. Also, there is a list of Caycos (set up for bid purposes in Colombia and=
=20
Venezuela) that management has reviewed and approved to be dissolved.  I pl=
an=20
to provide that list to Tax for their review and approval. =20

5. Another point to address is the standard slate of directors/officers of=
=20
those Delaware entities (that have operations in Latin America) which have=
=20
Haug, Cumberland, Castagnola and Sayre named as Directors/Officers.  A=20
decision has to be made who are going to replace these individuals. =20

I await your instructions.

Denise
