F/y/i -- The proposed Enron media position on the LNG vessel fire incident is 
set forth as an attachment below.  Enron PR is anticipating (and in fact may 
have received) a question or two from the international shipping press re the 
incident as it is well known in LNG and shipping circles that Enron recently 
signed a timecharter for the service of this vessel.  

We're still gathering info re the incident (the shipowner appears to be 
cooperating fully but still has significant access restrictions due to the 
pending investigation) and will relay any relevant info we receive.  We have 
asked for a copy of any official incident report when it is available.  To 
date, we have not received any communications regarding potential involvement 
in a claim.  Although it is always possible that we could be named, we are 
confirming with maritime counsel that our exposure under maritime and tort 
law in connection with this incident is slight, if any, as we had no 
involvement in or control over the shipyard operations and the vessel had not 
been delivered into service for Enron at the time of the incident. 

Stay tuned for more as things develop.

Kind regards,
Dan

Johan

Please see below.

I have contacted both Eric Gonzales and Wayne Perry about this and we propose 
a reply such as the one below.  However, before I respond, Wayne says that 
you may already have something on this pre-drafted and wish to deal with the 
enquiry yourself.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thanks

Andrew

PS Which other groups do you do PR for?

Further to your enquiry below I can confirm that as we had not committed 
cargoes to the vessel prior to the incident we are not looking for extra 
shipping capacity at this time. The extent in delay in delivery is unknown 
until a full assessment of the repairs required is completed.  It is 
important to note that although Enron has a Charter on the vessel we have not 
yet been delivered under that charter as it was still undergoing 
refurbishment by the Owner at the time of the fire.  Should you wish to 
enquire about the statues of the vessel, please call the owner directly.

Hi Andrew, we had a report about a fire on an LNG carrier Hoegh Galleon
that is due to begin a charter to Enron on 10 December. Is there anyone
I can put questions to about this? I wanted to ask if Enron would need
to use additional tonnage to move cargoes, in the interim, while the
delayed vessel completes repairs, and if yes, has it managed to arrange
this.
Many thanks,
