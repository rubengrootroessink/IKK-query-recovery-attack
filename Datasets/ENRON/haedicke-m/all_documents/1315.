Hi,
I work in RAC and I was told you might be able to provide closing documents 
on a deal called "Impact".  Our group is working on PortRac, a database that 
tracks the assets activities, and I need information for first quarter 2001. 
The only thing I know at this time is that it used to be Startech (Hubble) 
shares Enron owned which were transferred to Arch then to Impact.  According 
to the dash Enron is going to holding Impacts shares.  Can you please provide 
closing documents?

I want to thank you in advance for all your assistance.  Please feel free to 
call me or e-mail me if you should have any questions.

Thank you,
Lea Savala
