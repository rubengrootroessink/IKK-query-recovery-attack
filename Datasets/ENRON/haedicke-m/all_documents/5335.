eProcurement

I am pleased to announce that as part of our original implementation 
strategy, all current eProcurement users will receive the new version of the 
eProcurement system on Monday, June 18th.

The purpose of this e-mail is to announce the upgrade of the current 
eProcurement system and to encourage you to prepare yourself to use this 
enhanced tool.

eProcurement Upgrade
The new version will have a number of new features:
*  Approval routing based on reporting structure and spend/approval limits
*  Ability to view approval routing before submitting your shopping cart
*  Ability to include attachments to your shopping cart
*  Ability to assign a percentage of a line item amount to multiple cost 
centers

Getting Prepared
Over the next several weeks the iBuyit team will be providing you with the 
following information to help you prepare for your transition to the new 
system on June 18th:
*  New eProcurement System Brown Bag Session, When: May 30th, 11:30 - 1:00, 
Where: Enron Building, 50M Dining Room
*  Information about the differences between the current system and the new 
system
*  Information about training opportunities and resources
*  What you need to do to transition from the current system to the new system

I encourage you to review this information carefully and to take advantage of 
the training opportunities.

If you have any questions about the eProcurement upgrade please contact the 
iBuyit project team by sending an e-mail to <<mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>>.
