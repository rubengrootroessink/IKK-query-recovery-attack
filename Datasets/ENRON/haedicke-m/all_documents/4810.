Deb,

Attached is the file you requested.  The consolidated report includes all of  
ENA Legal cost centers, except for 107062.  As we have talked about before, I 
don't think that I am responsible for maintaining CC 107062 since it's part 
of EIM.  Give me a call if you want to clarify on this issue.  I am still 
working on the year-end report for 2000.  I found that there were two 
different reports for August 2000, and I think that's where the problem 
lies.  We're also moving this week, so please give me until the end of Monday 
to send you the file.

Thank you,
Vivian

Vivian, what Cost Centers are included in the Consolidated report attached?  
Also, we would like to see separate O&M reports for all Cost Centers in EWS 
Legal.  The Cost Centers are 105653, 105654, 105656, 105657, 105658, 105659, 
105660, 107061, and 107062.  What about our year-end O&M reports for these 
same Cost Centers?  Thanks, Deb
