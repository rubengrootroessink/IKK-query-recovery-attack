Mark -

I know that we will talk on Monday but thought that I would give you some 
preliminary thoughts on Randy's e-mail.

I can work with Randy's proposal that South America report directly to you.  
I respect Randy's ability to be a "honest broker" (a function of both his 
"stature" and the fact that he is an "Enron guy").  I don't know John Novak 
as well but, from his reputation, believe that he could probably serve the 
same role if and when Randy transitions to a new role at Enron.

I see two competing considerations for me.  

First, India may make the same argument given their support of Sanjay's 
broadband efforts and I'm less confident that Sandeep Katwala will have the 
political muscle (given his personal desire to do more broadband work across 
Asia, his fairly imminent return to Linklaters and Sanjay's influence on 
India) to maintain the "honest broker" role.  If Frank Sayre ends up staying 
with Global Assets to help with Central America, he may want the same 
reporting structure.

Second, Rebecca and Jim are going to expect me to have an ability to 
direct/influence legal activities in Global Assets -- they already have 
concerns about their own ability to direct commercial activities (given the 
lingering influence of former regional business heads) and are not going to 
want to compound these difficulties with legal reporting problems.  I'm a 
little concerned about the responsiveness of lawyers in South America to me 
if I'm completely outside their reporting structure.  That being said, I 
think that we can probably work this issue out with Randy.

I look forward to our conversation on Monday.
