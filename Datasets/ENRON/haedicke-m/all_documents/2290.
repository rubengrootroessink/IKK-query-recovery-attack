Tom,
Mark,

Five Palestinians (one a woman) killed at approximately 12 noon while=20
travelling in a bus towards a Jewish settlement within Gaza; in this=20
incident, an Israeli tank opened fire with its machine gun. Israelis=20
reportedly suspected the bus was carrying terrorists.=20

One Israeli shot dead yesterday in a separate occurrence in Gaza, while=20
shootouts between settlers and Palestinians have led to demolition of marke=
t=20
areas of towns (Hebron and Jenin).

* From cell phone call to Mohamed  El-Shareif, we understand the plant=20
continues secured (main gate chained and locked shut) and unharmed; securit=
y=20
personnel have left area and no EGOL or other employees permitted to enter;=
=20
both Mohamed and Mahmoud Joudah, EGOL Admin Manager, drove to the site wher=
e=20
they remained briefly this morning outside the gate.

* No LPG, vehicle fuel or food  supplies and only minimal medical supplies=
=20
permitted into Gaza which, with other Palestinian areas, remains sealed off=
.

Observations:

Arafat=01,s announcement that Palestinian police are justified in firing at=
=20
Israeli soldiers has escalated the tension, while the return home of the=20
Egyptian Ambassador from Israel is viewed as an uncomfortable sign that the=
=20
conflict has grown in importance regionally.

Because of the fear of vandalism, and especially loss of difficult-to-repla=
ce=20
materials/equipment from the plant site, it is important to generate a dail=
y=20
reassessment of the evacuation order. This will allow a security presence t=
o=20
be re-established as soon as the reported targeting of the site by Israel i=
s=20
reversed. The EGOL O&M team is ready to recommence its work at that point.=
=20

Sincere regards =01) J.
