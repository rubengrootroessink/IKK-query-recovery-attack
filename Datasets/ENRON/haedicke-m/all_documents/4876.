Dear Reader:

As a former Exnet conference delegate we are happy to provide you with a
free trial subscription to Restructuring Today.

Restructuring Today is America's leading daily news publication focused
on the convergence of the electricity, natural gas and communications
industries with a special focus on emerging retail markets.

You've watched the old industries begin to change and you've seen the
pace of change accelerate.

That's what Restructuring Today focuses on -- not routine news about the
industry today but indications of where it's headed from the people who
are creating the new industry.

But instead of giving a lot of detail about what we do I'm going to send
it to you - free and with absolutely no obligation -- so that you can
see for yourself, to taste the product and benefit from it (see today's
issue attached).  Then in a couple of weeks I'll ask you whether you'd
like to subscribe.

Thank you,

Season Hawksley
US Publishing

PS - Please call 800-486-8201 with your questions and feedback.
