NBI, INC. SEMINARS ON CLEONLINE.COM!...

We are very pleased this month to welcome to CLEonline.com another new
CLE seminar sponsor-- NBI, Inc.

We have entered into an agreement with NBI to produce a number of new
online CLE seminars based on content from live CLE programs sponsored by
NBI.  These new seminars will feature both audio and written materials
from NBI's seminars.  NBI produces a wide variety of CLE seminars
throughout the year in numerous states around the country.  Two of these
new NBI seminars are available this month, and many more will be offered
on our site in the months to come.

*********************************************************************

NEW SEMINARS FOR THIS MONTH...

The following are brief descriptions of our new seminars for this month.
Full details on each are available on our Web site:

--> NBI Presents "Practical Legal Ethics in Florida: Issues and Answers"

This is the first of the new NBI seminars being offered on our site, and
it features an essential topic for all Florida practioners.  This timely
online seminar will offer practical advice on everyday ethical issues,
avoiding inherent pitfalls in legal practice, and how not to be the next
case we read about.  The seminar features the audio and written materials
from a live NBI seminar held in Florida earlier this year. This seminar
is accredited by the Florida Bar for 3.5 hours of CLE.

--> NBI Presents "Superior Deposition Strategies in Florida Civil Trial
Practice"

Another of the new NBI seminars being offered this month is designed
for Florida lawyers on the subject of depositions.   In this new seminar,
you will learn strategies used by veteran litigators to prepare your own
client as well as how to take the deposition of the opposing party.  This
seminar also features the audio and written materials from a live NBI
seminar held in Florida in February of this year. This seminar is
accredited by the Florida Bar for 7.0 hours of CLE, including 1.0 ethics.

--> Internet Legal Issues - together with CCE

Together with another of our regular CLE seminar partners, the Center for
Continuing Education (CCE) in California, we are pleased to present this
new online CLE seminar which is designed to review and discuss three
evolving areas that are vitally important for attorneys with clients
doing business on the Internet.  This seminar features a streaming video
program from a live CLE seminar on this topic that was originally
conducted in California by CCE that features Prof. Marc Greenberg, who is
a Visiting Professor and Founding Director of the Intellectual Property
Law Program at Golden Gate University Law School in San Francisco. This
seminar is accredited for 1.5 hours of CLE credit.


--> Corporate Counsel Wrongful Discharge Claims:  Ethics, Policy and
Practice [1.0 ETHICS]

Continuing to add to his outstanding collection of ethics seminars on
CLEonline.com, attorney David Hricik of Austin has prepared this new
legal ethics seminar designed for attorneys who serve as in-house
counsel.   Whether in-house counsel who have been wrongfully discharged
should have a cause of action against their employer presents an
interesting issue that has divided the courts and commentators. This
seminar will review this issue and provide insight into various values
recognized by the courts that are important to in-house practice.  This
seminar is accredited for 1.0 hour of CLE credit, all in the area of
legal ethics.
