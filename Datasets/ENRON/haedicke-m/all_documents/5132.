Paul -

To confirm our conversation today, I understand that Locke Liddell has been 
approached by Salvage Sales to represent them in some commercial negotiations 
with our BLM project company for the purpose of finding a third party to 
demolish and/or sell BLM Unit 1.  We do not have an issue with that 
representation.

Thanks,
Bruce
