Hi All !!!

Guess what .. we've got some updated photos on Gillian's website ... so if 
you're at a loose end, please check them out at:

http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asesgoh/baby.htm

Gillian's now 5 and a half months old and weighs in at a hefty 18 pounds 
(8.05 kg) (she was weighed 2 weeks ago so I guess
 that she's little heavier than that by now) ... not bad for someone who was 
6 weeks early!  She's a little chatterbox who can't 
stop yabbering and talks incessantly in her sleep as well.  She's just 
started to suffer from stranger anxiety as well.  
Rather embarrassing really 'cos she now bursts into tears whenever she sees 
Men (her papa excluded).  The driver, 
the gardener and the grandfather have all been her 'victims' so far .... 
we're wondering who will be next.

Regards,
Anita
