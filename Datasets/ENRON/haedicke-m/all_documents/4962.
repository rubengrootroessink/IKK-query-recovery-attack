Are T=02=15Businesses Superfluous for Trading Operations?

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Power Finance & Risk] Vertically integrated power company=
=20
Dynegy is likely to sell its electricity distribution business within the=
=20
next few years to focus on its more profitable energy generation and tradin=
g=20
activities, predict analysts familiar with the company. Anatol Feygin, seni=
or=20
equity analyst at J.P Morgan in New York, says a sale of Dynegy's=20
transmission and distribution assets could fetch the company close to $1=20
billion.=20

Analysis: There are two different ways to evaluate the speculation that=20
Dynegy may be looking to sell its transmission and distribution (T&D)=20
business. From a company-specific perspective, such a strategy would make=
=20
sense for Dynegy, as it would allow the company to focus more exclusively o=
n=20
its trading and marketing operation, which has experienced truly spectacula=
r=20
growth over the last year. Although Dynegy has refused to deny or confirm=
=20
reports that it is planning to sell its T=02=15assets, the company's financ=
ial=20
numbers clearly build a case for such a move. In addition, Dynegy's potenti=
al=20
restructuring could very well be part of a larger trend in which those=20
companies that place a high priority on their generation business see littl=
e=20
value in remaining in the highly regulated and low-profit T=02=15market.=20

To be clear, Dynegy's T=02=15subsidiary is Illinois Power, based in Decatur=
, Ill.,=20
which serves more than 650,000 natural-gas and electric utility customers i=
n=20
a 15,000-square-mile area across Illinois. Dynegy acquired Illinois Power=
=20
when it completed its merger with Illinova in February 2000. At the time,=
=20
Dynegy maintained that a primary value of the acquisition was Illinois=20
Power's T=02=15operations and the fact that they would allow Dynegy to gain=
 a=20
foothold in the Illinois market. Of course, Dynegy also gained approximatel=
y=20
4,929 MW of generation that Illinois Power had previously structured in an=
=20
unregulated subsidiary. Nevertheless, if Dynegy is planning to sell its=20
T=02=15operation, the sale would include Illinois Power and would represent=
 a=20
dramatic strategy turnaround for the company.=20

Let's look at the unique reasons why Dynegy might be considering such a mov=
e.=20
It's rather apropos that word begins to circulate of a sale of the company'=
s=20
T=02=15business at the same time that Dynegy releases its 1Q 2001 report, i=
n which=20
its earnings more than doubled. As it has in the past few quarters, Dynegy=
=20
reported remarkable numbers, including a 73-percent increase in its earning=
s=20
that resulted primarily from wholesale natural gas and electricity sales.=
=20
Dynegy's recurring net income in the first quarter rose to $137.5 million o=
r=20
41 cents per diluted share from $79.4 million or 26 cents in 1Q 2000.=20
First-quarter revenues rose to $14.2 billion from $5.3 billion. Dynegy=20
reportedly produced and sold 26.1 million megawatt hours of electricity in =
1Q=20
2001, which represented a 19-percent increase over the same period in 2000.=
 =20

Dynegy continues to discount the role that California sales played in its=
=20
earnings, despite the fact that it owns about 2,800 MW of capacity in the=
=20
state (including joint ventures). Due to its presence in the state, Dynegy=
=20
(along with a handful of other power suppliers) continues to be singled out=
=20
as having gained a financial windfall from the California energy crisis. Ye=
t=20
even without California, cold weather in the Midwest during 1Q 2001 also=20
benefited Dynegy (along with other natural gas and power producers such as=
=20
Enron and Duke). Looking nationally, Dynegy has ownership stakes in about=
=20
13,000 MW of generating capacity and is on its way toward the goal of ownin=
g=20
or controlling 70,000 MW by 2005.=20

Consequently, it seems fairly clear that wholesale marketing and trading is=
=20
where Dynegy is making most of its money. It only makes sense that the=20
company would want to invest its existing capital resources (and any funds=
=20
gained from selling its T=02=15assets) into growing this part of its busine=
ss. In=20
contrast, in general T=02=15operations typically only bring a return of equ=
ity of=20
about 10 percent, given the fact that they are still heavily regulated by=
=20
FERC. When 73 percent of its earnings are coming from wholesale operations,=
=20
it is a no-brainer that Dynegy would move further and further into this=20
market. Moving forward, Dynegy's business most likely will become more abou=
t=20
managing its power sales and exchanges on its still-new trading platform=20
(Dynegydirect), and less about operating a distribution system. =20

As noted, I think Dynegy's business model fits into what appears to be a=20
growing trend among companies heavily focused on generation and trading.=20
First, over the last year there has been a slew of companies that have=20
divided or are planning to divide their regulated and non-regulated=20
businesses (AEP, UtiliCorp, Southern Company, Reliant and NRG, to name a=20
few). The operations are being split not only to attract two different sets=
=20
of investors, but also to allow a high-growth business such as independent=
=20
power production or wholesale trading to grow independently from regulated=
=20
operations. =20

Second, I think we can look to AEP as a company that is charting what may=
=20
become a more common path. Last fall, after completing its acquisition of=
=20
CSW, AEP announced an extensive corporate restructuring that includes an=20
exclusive focus on generation assets, wholesale marketing and trading. The=
=20
company has no plans to expand its distribution assets, either domestically=
=20
or internationally. AEP has not released its 1Q 2001 earnings report yet, b=
ut=20
for year-end 2000 wholesale margins at the company were 41 cents per share=
=20
higher than in 1999. AEP presently controls a generation portfolio of 38,00=
0=20
MW and is a top 10 power marketer and top 20 natural gas trader in North=20
America. Nevertheless, AEP's restructuring could take more than a year to=
=20
accomplish, especially considering that the company may have pooling of=20
interests restrictions related to its merger with CSW and other conditions=
=20
that fall under PUHCA.=20

Thus, it's evident why the power marketing and generation business is so=20
appealing. In addition, it is also becoming clear that transmission and=20
distribution businesses might be something to avoid unless a company only=
=20
wants to remain in this heavily regulated side of the energy industry. I've=
=20
already mentioned the low average return on equity associated with=20
T=02=15operations (also referred to as =01&wires businesses=018 in some sta=
tes). In=20
addition, FERC continues to monitor interstate transmission activity, and=
=20
oftentimes the policies affixed onto separate transmission systems can be=
=20
divergent and extremely complicated. A company that owns or operates=20
T=02=15assets, especially ones that transcend regional boundaries, may find=
 that=20
the business causes an excessive amount of operational headaches that simpl=
y=20
cannot be justified by its minimal profit opportunities. Siting is also a=
=20
problem, as even when communities can be convinced of the need for new=20
T=02=15capacity, they typically do not want it within their own view.=20

As a result, the wires business is presently considered to be rather=20
lethargic, considering its low risk / low rate of return characteristics.=
=20
According to Reuters, electricity demand over the next 10 years is expected=
=20
to increase by 20 to 25 percent. In contrast, transmission line capacity is=
=20
expected to increase by only about 4 percent. The reasons for this disparit=
y=20
are that many companies are avoiding further investment in transmission=20
capacity due to the inherent disadvantages associated with this business.=
=20
Further, companies that presently own or operate transmission lines are=20
impacted by FERC Order 2000, which mandates a plan for forming or joining a=
=20
regional transmission organization (RTO) by Dec. 15 of this year. While RTO=
=20
plans continue to remain a high priority, the siting or expansion of=20
T=02=15capacity has become a secondary concern.=20

Considering these many downsides to the wires business, Dynegy and other=20
companies that look to sell their T=02=15businesses may not have such an ea=
sy time=20
with the divestiture. As noted, the business is heavily regulated and any=
=20
potential sale would have to be approved by several layers of regulatory=20
agencies. In addition, a company looking to purchase T=02=15assets, assumin=
g that=20
the company is aware of all the risks involved, would most likely be a=20
company that is only interested in T=02=15and is not an active participant =
in the=20
generation business. =20

There are companies with this kind of business model. National Grid comes t=
o=20
mind as a leading example. The U.K. company is one of the world's largest=
=20
independent transmission companies and for over a year has been attempting =
to=20
establish a major presence in the transmission and distribution sectors of=
=20
the industry, primarily in the United States. National Grid has acquired=20
Niagara Mohawk, New England Electric System (NEES) and Eastern Utilities=20
Associates (EAU), all T=02=15operations located in the Northeastern United =
States.=20
Dynegy's assets are located in the Midwest and do not seem consistent with=
=20
National Grid's regional focus. However, the point to be made is that there=
=20
are companies active in the United States that are aggressively pursuing=20
T=02=15operations, despite the seemingly obvious risks associated with this=
=20
business.=20
