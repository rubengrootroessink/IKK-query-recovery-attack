FASB Excludes Joint Ventures From Business Combinations Project
BNA - March 1, 2001

NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Feb. 28 wrestled
with how to define joint ventures, business enterprises intended to be
outside the scope of rules on business combinations, and the kind of
reporting that will leave deeper imprints on firms' earnings statements than
current practice.

FASB specifically excluded joint ventures from its pending proposal on
accounting for mergers and acquisitions. The proposal is expected to yield
final rules in late June.

The rationale for the decision to exclude joint ventures is the idea that
there exist shared enterprises or mutually beneficial projects of companies
or other entities that do not represent an acquisition of one enterprise by
another.

Instead, two or more existing corporations, governments, or perhaps even
individual people may combine assets and create a genuinely new enterprise
to, for example, develop a new product or technology. Such joint ventures
often carry with them veto rights of the venturers that typically are not
enjoyed by shareholders of a public company.


Goal Is Speedy Issuance

In addition, FASB members have stressed their goal of issuing as quickly as
possible a standard to remedy long-standing problems in the use of the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting in more bread-and-butter corporate
combinations.

In the past, joint ventures have presented difficult definitional problems.
They are a focus of the "phase two" of the board's business combinations
project, which deals with "new basis" accounting issues.

At the same time, FASB believes the topic of joint ventures warrants
action--or at least some clarification--to address "the misapplication of
joint venture accounting to transactions that should be accounted for as
business combinations," according to a recommendation of the board's staff
endorsed at the Feb. 28 meeting.

Under current accounting practice for joint ventures, the assets in play are
reported on a carryover basis at historical cost. That treatment mirrors the
effect of a "pooling," under which the book values of the assets of two
combining companies are merely added together, leaving no dent on the income
statement.

With the impending issuance of the new rules on combinations, FASB would bar
poolings and instead require use of the purchase method of accounting. Under
purchase accounting, one company is identified as the acquirer. It must
record the cost of purchasing a company on its books whether it uses cash or
exchanges stock to acquire the target firm.


APB 18's Description Clarified

In defining joint venture, FASB Feb. 28 tentatively decided to retain the
description of the term in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. It also would
add the clarifications to help draw boundaries around use of joint venture
accounting in areas where the planned rules on combinations should come into
play.
The term " 'corporate joint venture' refers to a corporation owned and
operated by a small group of businesses ("the joint venturers") as a
separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the
members of the group," APB, the rulemaking board that preceded FASB, stated
in Opinion No. 18. "A government may also be a member of the group."

APB said the purpose of a joint venture "frequently" is to share risks and
rewards in developing a new market, product, or technology and to pool
know-how and resources to reach the joint goal. In addition, such a
corporate joint venture "usually" provides an arrangement under which each
venturer may help manage the venture and "have an interest or relationship
other than as a passive investor," according to APB No. 18.

In extended discussion that showed how difficult the issue of joint ventures
is, FASB agreed most strongly on adding, by way of clarification, that the
participating rights entailed in taking part in a joint venture have some
economic substance beyond shareholder rights.

Along those lines, FASB and its staff plan to refer to guidance completed in
1998 by the board's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF Issue No. 96-16). That
guidance is used for investor's accounting for an investee when the investor
has a majority of voting interest in a firm but the minority shareholder or
shareholders have certain approval or veto rights.


Sticky Issues

Two other issues to be taken up in the planned clarification proved to be
sticky Feb. 28.
First, the board will try to resolve whether an individual person can be a
joint venturer, in other words, whether an individual's participation in
what is termed a joint venture can mean that the label is legitimate and not
simply form part of a cover for what in reality is a business combination or
acquisition.

That issue carries some relevance internationally, as pointed out by Michael
Crooch, a FASB member. In some countries, laws require that a citizen of
that country be a partner--if not a majority shareholder of record--in an
enterprise financed by a foreign company.

The last issue confronting FASB pertains to planned transactions. The board
posed the following question: If a company planned at the date of formation
of the venture to issue a public offering of stock stemming from the
venture, was the enterprise a joint venture? What if the offering of stock
were unplannned?

In coming weeks, FASB's staff plans to work on answering those questions and
return to the board with recommendations.

"We need to take this around the track one more time," said FASB Chairman
Edmund Jenkins.

The board plans to make the envisioned language on joint ventures part of
the standard on business combinations rather than place it in the planned
rules' basis for conclusions.


Derivatives Guidance to Be on Web

Separately Feb. 28, FASB approved clarifications to cure some confusion
about use of guidance on the board's rules on derivatives and hedge
accounting, Statement No. 133.
The guidance, developed with the help of the board's Derivatives
Implementation Group, was cleared previously by the board. (DIG Issue No.
H8, Measuring the Amount of Ineffectiveness in a Net Investment Hedge).

FASB plans to post the revised guidance March 1 on its World Wide Web site.


EP Committee hears Lamfalussy on financial services.
Reuters English News Service - March 1, 2001

Lamfalussy  and financial services - MEPs seek "call back" mechanism

Appearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Alexandre
LAMFALUSSY , chair of the Group of Wise Men on Financial Services, responded
to concerns raised by MEPs seeking a "call back" mechanism as part of a new
approach to speed up the integration of Europe's financial markets. The
committee wants to retain the right to review legislation as it passes
through various processes, should this be considered necessary.

Mr. LAMFALUSSY has proposed setting up two new committees, an EU Securities
Committee and an EU Securities Regulatory Committee, to help speed up
necessary financial reforms. He has offered to allay Parliament's concerns
by keeping MEPs informed of the work of both committees by the provision of
documents, minutes and agendas and the introduction of a procedure whereby
if Parliament passed a resolution taking the view that the Commission
exceeded its legislative powers then the Commission "should take the utmost
account of the European Parliament's position", a procedure which he
admitted did not amount to a formal call back position but would in practice
amount to the same thing. At the same time he could not envisage the
Commission ignoring Parliament's view.

In the ensuing discussions attention focussed on whether or not this
amounted to sufficient controls on the Commission and the proposed European
Securities Committee. One fear is that this new body - which Mr. LAMFALUSSY
recommends should be chaired by the Commission but composed of high level
national civil servants of state secretary level - would be the key
decision-making body responsible for the technical details and under the
control of national governments.

The report will be discussed at the March plenary and the committee will
meet again next week with a view to proposing a draft resolution to plenary.


Bank regulator intervenes in Turkish crisis
Financial Times - March 1, 2001
By Leyla Boulton

Uncertainty over the Turkish government's next steps in the economic crisis
gripping the country continued yesterday, as the Ankara Chamber of Industry
said foreign companies were refusing to accept letters of credit issued by
Turkish companies. Local banks were also reported to be freezing personal
and company loans and the use of credit cards.

In its first move since the crisis erupted last week, the Banking Regulation
and Supervision Agency took control of a small, troubled bank, Ulusal Bank,
while Bulent Ecevit, prime minister, expressed the hope Ankara could secure
a Dollars 25bn loan from foreign banks to help it through the crisis.

Separately, the government expressed hope that Kemal Dervis, a top Turkish
economist at the World Bank in Washington, would accept the job of central
bank governor. The post has been vacant since Gazi Ercel, the former
governor, resigned last weekend, after the government was forced to allow
the free float of the Turkish lira.

Turkish officials are now negotiating with the IMF and World Bank a revised
disinflation plan, together with a bank restructuring strategy. But they are
not expected to make any announcements before the start on Monday of the
week-long religious holiday of Eid al-Adha, and before the central bank
governor and treasury chief are replaced.

Despite Mr. Ecevit's optimism over future loans, analysts and bankers said
it was more important for the government to show it was serious about
economic reform in general and bank restructuring in particular.

Apart from implementing radical fiscal measures and privatisation, this
meant closing any other unhealthy institutions among 27 privately owned
Turkish commercial banks to counter the twin shock of a big jump in interest
rates followed by a devaluation.

"If the bad banks are not closed down, they will ruin the market for the
healthy ones," said one senior banker, who declined to be identified. Aluk
Akdogan, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, concurred, saying the country's
four biggest private banks, still seen as sound, accounted for 75 per cent
of the industry's Dollars 10bn equity. But their net foreign exchange
liabilities - which he estimated as not exceeding 30 per cent of their
equity base - could become more difficult to trim if weak banks were allowed
to continue to drain available liquidity.

The government also faces the challenge of dealing with four state-owned
banks that account for 40 per cent of deposits and have accumulated historic
losses of at least Dollars 20bn.

But analysts say dealing more effectively with the state-owned banks also
risks uncovering corruption, which could in turn hurt individual members of
the three-party coalition government.

"This is above all a crisis of political leadership," said Charles Blitzer,
an economist who follows Turkey closely.

Slightly Altered Bankruptcy Bill Clears Senate Committee
American Banker - March 1, 2001
By Nicole Duran

WASHINGTON - The Senate Judiciary Committee cleared the bankruptcy overhaul
bill Wednesday, eliminating one sticking point but leaving several others
for Thursday's anticipated floor action.
The legislation appears headed for passage in both chambers.

"They're not going to stop it," Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch said of the
bill's opponents after the committee's lO-to-8 vote in favor of the bill.

The Utah Republican said that opponents could slow the legislation down but
predicted they will ultimately fail "unless the entire process breaks down
and there is no bipartisanship."

The House cleared the way for a vote on its version of the bankruptcy bill
Wednesday afternoon and was expected to begin debate this morning.

The Senate Judiciary Committee accepted some Democratic amendments
Wednesday, most notably one by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, that would
prohibit people convicted of crimes from filing for bankruptcy to avoid
paying court-ordered fines, penalties, or damages.

Similar amendments that specifically applied to people convicted of violence
against abortion clinics held up identical bankrupt- -cy legislation in the
106th Congress before it eventually passed, only to be pocket-vetoed by
then-President Clinton. Sen. Schumer modified his amendment to eliminate all
specific references to abortion.

He scored again when the committee unanimously agreed to adopt his "netting"
amendment. The provision is designed to limit the damage that can occur when
a company that holds derivatives contracts files for bankruptcy.

Under current law, derivative contracts are frozen in a bankruptcy
proceeding, which prevents creditors of a bankrupt institution from settling
their obligations. The amendment would allow creditors to reconcile, or "net
out," their derivatives contracts, and thus reduce their losses.

Sen. Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, collaborated on an amendment to protect consumer privacy. Their
amendment, adopted on a voice vote, would prohibit companies filing for
bankruptcy from selling client lists containing personal information, such
as Social Security numbers, as a way to pay off creditors. The provision
also would create a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect consumers'
interests in bankruptcy court.

Sen. Leahy said the ToySmart.com case revealed the need for such a
provision. The company had a privacy statement assuring customers that
personal information would be kept confidential, but when it went under, the
bankruptcy judge ordered it to sell one of its only assets - its customer
list - to pay off its debts, Sen. Leahy said.

Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., a vocal bankruptcy opponent, got about half his
amendments approved outright and agreed to save some of his more
controversial provisions for the Senate floor.

Two of his victories concern farming. One of his amendments would make it
easier for farmers to qualify for more lenient Chapter 12 terms by lowering
the amount of a filer's income that comes from farming operations, to 50%
from 80%, and by doubling the debt limit to $3 million. The other would
ensure that any bankruptcy payment plan leaves a farmer with enough money to
continue farming.

The panel also agreed to a modified version of Sen. Feingold's amendment
dealing with renter's eviction during bankruptcy proceedings.

The committee's work Tuesday and Wednesday still left about half of
Democrats' 30-odd amendments to be tackled on the Senate floor.

Some of the more nettlesome outstanding points concern whether bankruptcy
filers can keep expensive homes and how much information credit companies
must provide consumers about interest rates and minimum payments.
