AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE DECLARES ITS OPPOSITION TO
ANTI-DUMPING PETITION

The American Petroleum Institute says it is opposed to an
effort by a coalition of independent American oil producers
to penalize four countries that the coalition  claims are
illegally dumping crude petroleum products on the American
market. API will also supply information to the federal
government in an effort to deny standing to the coalition,
Oklahoma-based Save Domestic Oil Inc. . . . Page

SENATORS SQUARE OFF OVER CAFE FREEZE; GROUP SAYS 28-MPG SUVS
POSSIBLE

For the first time in five years, a congressional battle
could be brewing over the fuel efficiency of sport utility
vehicles and other light trucks, Senate staff and lobbyists
say. In the House, representatives have once again attached
language to a Department of Transportation appropriations
bill (H.R. 2084) that would freeze fuel economy standards at
the current level of 20.7 miles per gallon. . . . Page

ENTERGY OFFER TO BUY PILGRIM PLANT WINS IN FIRST COMPETITIVE
BID FOR NUCLEAR PLANT

New Orleans-based Entergy Nuclear closes a deal under which
it will pay Boston Edison $81 million for the 670-megawatt
Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Plymouth, Mass., the first
successful sale of a nuclear plant by competitive bid in the
nation, according to the two companies. In addition to the
$81 million purchase price for the plant, nuclear fuel and
the plant's 1,600 acre site on Cape Cod Bay, credits of up
to $31 million potentially available on future nuclear
insurance premiums will be transferred from Entergy to
Boston Edison. The companies said the sale includes power
purchase agreements through 2004.  Boston Edison has also
agreed to fully fund the decommissioning trust with $471
million. . . . Page

COURT REJECTS FERC VALUATION OF RESIDUAL OIL SHIPPED ON TAPS

A federal appeals court rejects for the second time the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's valuation of heavy
residual fuel oil shipped on the Trans Alaska Pipeline
System and says the commission's decision to apply the
valuation prospectively was an abuse of discretion. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
upholds other challenged aspects of a 1993 FERC order
regarding valuation of distillate oil on TAPS. The FERC
order approved a settlement on valuations that was contested
by Exxon Co. USA and Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Co. . . . Page

WHITE HOUSE WILL LET COURTS DECIDE DISPUTE ON CONTROLLING
TRANSPORTED NOX

The Clinton administration will allow legal appeals to
proceed rather than become involved in the effort between
states and the Environmental Protection Agency to reach a
compromise on the issue of transported ozone pollution, the
White House tells three governors. The administration was
asked in an April 1 letter to intervene in the standoff
between EPA and Midwestern and Southern states to reduce the
transport of nitrogen oxides to upwind states. . . . Page

HOUSE MEMBER TO INTRODUCE BILL THAT REPRISES EARLIER CLIMATE
LEGISLATION, SOURCES SAY

A House member from New York is likely to introduce a bill
on global climate change that is largely a reprise of a
Senate bill introduced earlier this year, but which is still
languishing, industry and environmental advocacy sources
tell BNA. The sources say Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) will
introduce a bill possibly as soon as July 14 that would
attempt to deal with the issue of voluntary action to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. . . . Page

FRANCE SAYS ENERGY TAX NEEDED TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION, MEET
KYOTO GOAL

Implementation of a new tax on carbon emissions from
industrial sources is the only way to guarantee that France
meets its international climate change commitments and
reduces overall energy consumption, according to an
inter-ministerial "white paper." The white paper is the
centerpiece of government efforts aimed at convincing
industry to accept the new energy tax, announced earlier
this year and now slated to go into effect Jan. 1, 2001.. .

JAPAN, CHINA, KOREA JOINT PROJECT TO USE CLEAN DEVELOPMENT
MECHANISM

Japan, Korea, and China are planning a joint greenhouse gas
emission reduction program based on the "clean development
mechanism" approved as part of the Kyoto Protocol on climate
change, program organizers announce. Mitsubishi Research
Institute (MRI) Ltd., organizers of the project, says it
marks the first time that the three countries have reached
an agreement to implement jointly a global warming project.

MUNICIPALITIES IN CONNECTICUT SIGN AGREEMENT TO PARTICIPATE
IN ENERGY PURCHASING  POOL

A coalition of Connecticut cities and towns sign an
agreement with Boston-based National Energy Choice to
establish a purchasing pool through which member
municipalities can buy energy at negotiated rates. The new
purchasing pool--to be known as CCM Energy--will allow
members of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities
(CCM) to leverage their buying power to purchase electricity
and natural gas at favorable rates. . . . Page
