New York Obstacles Thwart Sithe Energies' Plans for New Power Plant=20

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from PR Newswire] Sithe Energies, Inc. announced that, in respon=
se=20
to issues raised by local residents, the company is reassessing its plans f=
or=20
a power generating facility in Ramapo, New York. The alternative currently=
=20
under review is a smaller "peaking" facility, which would use no water for=
=20
generation and operate only during a time of peak electricity use and=20
emergencies to help ensure reliability of the region's electricity supply.=
=20
Originally slated as an 827-MW combined cycle facility fueled by natural ga=
s,=20
the alternative plant is a 510-MW peaking unit also powered by natural gas.=
=20

Analysis: Sithe Energies' original plans for the Ramapo plant appear to hav=
e=20
been thwarted by concerns among local residents who opposed certain aspects=
=20
of the plant. Ramapo is located 30 miles north of New York City. Chief amon=
g=20
the concerns of local residents is that Ramapo plant was originally planned=
=20
to run all the time to meet demand, and as a result would use local water=
=20
resources for cooling purposes. In response to the concerns of residents,=
=20
Sithe is modifying plans for the plant and reducing its planned output.=20
Unfortunately, Sithe plans to move forward with a smaller peaking unit at t=
he=20
very time when it has become increasingly clear that the state of New York=
=20
has some rather serious power supply concerns. =20

For background, it is important to note that Exelon Corp. owns nearly half =
of=20
Sithe Energies. In December 2000, Exelon acquired 49.9 percent of the stock=
=20
of Sithe. The remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe is owned by Vivendi (34=20
percent), Marubeni Corp. (15 percent) and Sithe Management (1 percent). The=
=20
acquisition marked the continuation of an aggressive generation expansion=
=20
plan on the part of Exelon.=20

Jim McGowan, Sithe senior vice president for development, referenced the ro=
le=20
that public opposition played when he spoke about the new plans for a peaki=
ng=20
unit in the area. "Sithe has a strong history of working closely with local=
=20
communities and inviting their input to ensure their major issues are=20
addressed," McGowan said. "We've listened carefully to [residents'] concern=
s=20
and are addressing them by considering a facility that is clean, less=20
visible, and uses no water for generation." McGowan further noted that the=
=20
new peaking plant will only operate a limited number of hours annually whil=
e=20
fulfilling the region's growing need for electricity during times of peak=
=20
consumer demand.=20

As an independent power producer, Sithe Energies owns power plants across t=
he=20
United States and internationally. The company has a generation presence in=
=20
such states as California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and=20
Pennsylvania (among several others). In New York, Sithe Energies owns four=
=20
rather small plants and one large plant that generate approximately 1,329 M=
W:=20
Batavia (58 MW), Independence Station (Scriba, N.Y., 1,042 MW), Massena (86=
=20
MW), Ogdensburg (83 MW), and Sterling (Sherill, N.Y., 60 MW). In addition t=
o=20
the proposed peaking plant in Ramapo, Sithe Energies also has proposed=20
Heritage Station, an 800 MW power plant located near Lake Ontario. A full=
=20
siting review in New York normally takes a year to complete. However,=20
projects under 80 MW are not required to go through the extensive=20
environmental impact statement, which generally involves a detailed=01*and =
time=20
consuming=01*examination of alternatives. =20

The state of New York has not brought a new plant online since 1996, when a=
=20
200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years since a 1,0=
00=20
MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to open upstate. Further, Ne=
w=20
York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in the next three =
to=20
four years. Consequently, concerns about the state's ability to meet=20
increasing demand for power have gained momentum, heightened by the ongoing=
=20
problems in California. Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to=
=20
expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state. However, at=
=20
the same time, environmental groups closely guard the proposals for new=20
plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will=
=20
produce power. This appears to be the case in Sithe Energies' Ramapo plant,=
=20
which is proceeding on the condition that it will not use water resources t=
o=20
generate power.=20

While other new plants are being planned in New York, realistically it will=
=20
be two years or more before they come online and provide sufficient capacit=
y=20
to ease concerns about shortages. Meanwhile, the state enters this summer's=
=20
season with significant doubts about its ability to meet power demands. "Ne=
w=20
York City, like other areas of the Northeast, the Midwest and California, i=
s=20
in a very serious situation," reported a member of the New York Public=20
Service Commission to the New Assembly. =20

While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the problem=20
appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 FERC=20
report entitled "Investigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"=20
highlights specific capacity problems in the New York City/Long Island=20
community of 11 million people. These areas are particularly vulnerable=20
because they are isolated from most of the state's grid, the study says. Li=
ke=20
northern California, which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission=
=20
constraints, New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantiti=
es=20
of power on constrained transmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are=
=20
plentiful in upstate New York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densel=
y=20
populated and heavily residential, it is difficult to site new power plants=
=20
in the area. Consequently, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes i=
s=20
generated by the city. New plants are being proposed because New York City=
=20
reportedly will be 300 MW short of its required 8,428-MW generating capacit=
y=20
needs this summer. That projected shortfall is expected to increase by=20
another 200 MW by summer 2002. =20

Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N=
ew=20
York City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 199=
5=20
to 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. This=20
year's demand is expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above=20
regulators' earlier forecasts. According to the FERC report, New York City'=
s=20
load should reach 10,535 MW this summer alone, requiring 8,428 MW of in-cit=
y=20
capacity, along with imports, to meet demand and provide a reserve margin.=
=20
With a current capacity of 8,132 MW, there is a potential 296 MW shortfall.=
=20
Long Island has a potential 131 MW shortfall to meet the required 4,653 MW =
of=20
power. =20

The report confirms earlier projections by FERC Chairman Curt HSbert and=20
others that unless New York gets additional generation capacity online with=
in=20
the next few months, the state could suffer some of California's problems.=
=20
However, despite the need for additional power generation in the state, the=
=20
intense public scrutiny of Sithe's plant in Ramapo echoes similar protests=
=20
from environmental groups and politicians for new generation plants=20
throughout the state. For instance, the New York Power Authority's (NYPA)=
=20
plan to install ten 44-MW combustion turbines by June was met with oppositi=
on=20
from environmental groups like the New York Public Interest Research Group=
=20
(NYIRG), which has sued the NYPA, charging that it circumvented the=20
environmental review process for siting new plants. In addition, FERC's=20
report included data from the New York ISO indicating that there were=20
approximately 74 projects proposed to be built in New York State (as of=20
November 2000). The report indicated that only one of these projects is=20
likely to be built in the next three to four years.=20

Although Sithe has modified its plans into a smaller peaking unit, McGowan=
=20
has reiterated that New York should not fall behind in meeting its energy=
=20
requirements. If it does, it will make the same mistakes for which Californ=
ia=20
is now paying a tremendous price. Along the same lines, William Muesler, CE=
O=20
of the New York ISO, recently said that to avoid a replication of=20
California's market meltdown, New York must move quickly to build more powe=
r=20
plants. Muesler cited that 8,600 MW of new power plant capacity, 25 percent=
=20
more than is currently available, must be constructed in New York by 2005 o=
r=20
shortages will become likely, pushing up prices and increasing the odds of=
=20
rolling blackouts. =20

However, despite these clear warnings about the need for new power plants,=
=20
"not in my back yard" has been a common response in New York. Even New=20
Jersey's acting Governor Donald T. DiFrancesco has joined the ranks of thos=
e=20
opposing new power plants in the region. DiFrancesco reportedly told a=20
meeting of about a dozen North Jersey mayors who oppose new power plants th=
at=20
he has created a task force to help opponents of various power plant projec=
ts=20
in New York and New Jersey. Included in the task force are members of=20
DiFrancesco's own staff, the state Department of Environmental Protection a=
nd=20
the Attorney General's Office. Moreover, although California offers a clear=
=20
picture of the ramifications that can result from not establishing adequate=
=20
supply, New York appears to be heading down a similar path. Although=20
California and New York have different restructuring models, one market=20
factor is the same in both states: supply that cannot meet demand. We know=
=20
the toll that this inequity has had on California. Is it only a matter of=
=20
time before New York suffers the same consequences?=20
