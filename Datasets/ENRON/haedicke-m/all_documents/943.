Mark, Bruce and Randy:  Below is a draft reorg memo and an updated org chart 
for your review and comment.  The org chart is a bit dense so any suggestions 
on how to clean it up would be welcome.  Thanks.

Rgds,
 John


The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new organizational changes 
that have been implemented in the Enron South America legal department in 
response to the recent reorganization and realignment of the principal Enron 
Wholesale Services business units operating in the region, Enron Americas and 
Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently general counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing him will be John Novak, who will 
become general counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal 
department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron 
Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, 
coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to 
support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce 
Lundstrom, general counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect 
to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the 
new structure is attached.

We believe this new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality 
legal support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

Mark Haedicke
