Ann, Lance,

the possibility of Enron Europe shorting the stock of British Energy (BE), =
a=20
UK listed company has raised its head again and I would be grateful for you=
r=20
assistance (or for the assistance of someone in your teams) in analysing th=
e=20
US consequences.

I attach for your information an exchange of emails which took place in=20
October last year when we last discussed this.

The largest trade we would execute would be to short up to 5% of the capita=
l=20
of BE, which is currently worth approx UKo50m. I believe that Enron=20
Investment Services Limited (as agent for ECT Investments Inc. - the=20
principal in the transaction) would execute the trade through third party=
=20
brokers in the UK.=20

A number of issues cropped up last time and I presume the position is not=
=20
changed as a result of our transaction being being a short sale rather than=
 a=20
purchase. The issues were:

1. Hart Scott Rodino:  could you please let us know how HSR impacts the sal=
e,=20
whether filings are required which mean the transaction has to be delayed,=
=20
and what further information you need to be able firm up on your analysis.=
=20

2. PUHCA: same as for HSR.

3. Restricted List: hopefully Donna will be able to confirm that BE is not =
on=20
the restricted list, but I have not seen the list for some time.=20

4. Enron Corp Personal Trading Rules: Richard Lewis is the originator of th=
e=20
idea for the trade in the UK and he expects to have a say in when it is=20
liquidated, so it might be said that he has a degree of "responsibility" fo=
r=20
the trade although it would be executed through John Greene's team. Richard=
=20
and his team are responsible for UK Power and Gas and Continental Gas at=20
Enron Europe. They do not on a day to day basis have responsibility for=20
equity trading within Enron Europe. My reading of the latest version of the=
=20
Personal Trading Rules which I received:=20

"Employee Trading.  No employee of any Enron Business Unit may engage in th=
e=20
trading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron=20
Business Unit (whether for their own account or for the account of any thir=
d=20
party) where such Position relates to  (i) any financial instrument,=20
security, financial asset or liability which falls within such employee=01,=
s=20
responsibility at an Enron Business Unit, or (ii) any other commodity not=
=20
covered by (i) included in any Commodity Group". =20

...is that this trade should not result in Richard or any of his team losin=
g=20
the ability as a result of the above rule to trade generally in equities fo=
r=20
their own account. Do you agree? Is there any mechanic for getting a=20
clearance on that front?=20

5. Insider Trading: two UK issues here which we are getting to the bottom o=
f.=20
Firstly, Richard and/or members of his team with knowledge of this potentia=
l=20
trade may have already shorted BE in their own names. If done in anticipati=
on=20
of a future large short trade by Enron Europe, Enron Europe's trade could=
=20
make them insiders and their trades criminal offences. Secondly we need to =
be=20
clear that the information which is driving Enron Europe (through ECT=20
Investments Inc) to execute the trade is public information and not insider=
=20
information: eg information obtained through a one on one trading=20
relationship with BE. Breach of these rules, or even the appearance of brea=
ch=20
of these rules, could breach the rules of the SFA, our UK regulator.

I presume there are similar issues in the US.=20

I will call you both this evening to discuss this if I may. It would be ver=
y=20
useful if a Houston lawyer could be nominated to assist us on this and to=
=20
coordinate input from the (inevitable) various sources .=20


Many thanks in advance.

Ann

We would like to kick off the filing under the HRS Act - if only to be able=
=20
to move forward quickly if we decide to do so. Seeking guidance from outsid=
e=20
counsel may be a waste of time in light of the clear advice you received=20
recently from V&E.  But we'll be guided by you if you think otherwise.

Michael Mills - who is the commercial person leading this in London -  woul=
d=20
first like to understand at what point the filing fee becomes irrecoverable=
=20
(this may be day 1!).

Please provide any info on this and Michael will then decide whether to kic=
k=20
off the filing (which, if I've understood correctly, will not take more tha=
nm=20
20 days - please confirm).

Please liaise with Michael directly since I'm out Monday and we may well wa=

to begin this process then.  Many thanks for your help

Paul, As a follow up to the Chinese Wall issues, I have verified that Gary=

10/3/00).  After discussion with Lance, we have determined that it will be=

From an operational standpoint, EEL does not have an existing account with=

I am not at all sure that Enron could rely on the "Solely for Investment=20
Purposes" exemption of Section 802.9 of the Rules promulgated under the=20
Hart-Scott-Rodino Anti-trust Improvements Act.  On its face the rule seems =
to=20
be applicable if the voting securities are acquired for investment purposes=
=20
only and the post-acquisition holdings will be 10% or less, regardless of=

recently by Neil Imus, a partner in the Anti-trust Section of Vinson &=20

we should consider whether to make further inquiry with the FTC staff or ma=

a filing under the HSR Act.  The filing fee is US$45,000, and the waiting=

=09=09 Subject: Equity Stake in British Energy (Confidential)

We are currently analysing British Energy to ascertain whether or not we wa=
nt=20
to take an equity stake in them.  Our equity trading capability in London i=
s=20
not quite up and running, which means that if a decision is taken to move=
=20
forward with this investment, the equity trades would need to be executed b=
y=20
traders based in Houston. =20

Lance has kindly provided some useful initial information on this and has=
=20
indicated that you may be able to assist further.  The issues would seem to=
=20
be as follows:

1. Chinese Walls Procedures

I understand that your Chinese Walls procedures require all proposed=20
investments of this kind to be routed through Donna Lowry.  Donna, on the=
=20
assumption that our decision to invest is not based on price-sensitive,=20
non-public information, please let us know what other procedures we need to=
=20
follow to satisfy your requirements.=20

2. Hart Scott Redino

I gather that these issues will not arise if the stake we are looking to ta=
ke=20
is less than $15 million, or less than 15%.  We will certainly be taking le=
ss=20
than 15% of  BE, but it is not clear to me what the size of our investment =
is=20
likely to be.   (Richard?).

Lance, you mentioned that if the shares are being acquired for "investment=
=20
purposes only" then we would be exempt from these requirements.  Presumably=
=20
this is in addition to the size requirements mentioned above.  My=20
understanding is that our stake would be purely for investment purposes -=
=20
essentially to hedge our trading position should the price of power go up,=
=20
and that we are not looking to acquire BE (or a substantial stake in BE)=20
which is in the same sector as Enron.  Assuming this is the case (and=20
Richard, please correct me if I'm mistaken), please let me know whether we=
=20
need to take this issue further.

3. PUHCA Issues

I am not sure what these are (!), but perhaps Sheila could comment on wheth=
er=20
any arise on the facts given above. =20

It may also be helpful to note that British Energy is a UK company quoted o=
n=20
the London Stock Exchange, but not on any North American Exchange.  It does=
,=20
however, have substantial assets in Canada and a 50/50 joint venture with a=
=20
US partner which owns Three Mile Island and another generating asset.  Plea=
se=20
let me know if you require further information.

Many thanks.
