Bush Energy Plan Emerges,=20
Cuts in Renewable Energy Spending Expected

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[Knight Ridder Washington Bureau, March 8] Days after telling the nation th=
at=20
there's a real energy crisis and vowing to "promote alternative energy=20
sources and conservation," President Bush is proposing a budget that would=
=20
reduce federal spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy by as muc=
h=20
as a third, and increase funding for oil and natural-gas drilling. Bush=20
proposes to cut the Department of Energy's renewable fuels and energy=20
efficiency budget by 30 to 40 percent, according to Energy Department and=
=20
White House officials who have briefed energy and environmental lobbyists.=
=20
The president's proposed Energy Department budget is another indication tha=
t=20
the administration will emphasize increasing oil, natural-gas and coal=20
production more than cutting energy demand or developing alternatives to=20
fossil fuels.=20

Analysis: During his presidential campaign, President Bush was critical of=
=20
Bill Clinton for failing to adopt a national energy policy. Facing=20
unavoidable problems within the nation's energy industry=01*including the=
=20
ongoing California problem, supply concerns across the country, and=20
predictions of several more years of erratic electricity, natural-gas and o=
il=20
prices=01*Bush has been on a fast track to develop his own comprehensive en=
ergy=20
strategy. More than likely, the president is still weeks away from unveilin=
g=20
his official energy plan. However, the word circulating through Washington=
=20
D.C. (and the energy industry as a whole) is that his plan will emphasize=
=20
increasing oil, natural gas and coal production (by giving unique financial=
=20
incentives to producers) and de-emphasize conservation efforts and renewabl=
e=20
energies. =20

Given the fact that President Bush's energy plan has not yet been released,=
=20
analysis of the proposed plan is still based on speculation at this point.=
=20
While many opponents of the proposed plan are quick to criticize anticipate=
d=20
cuts for energy efficiency and renewable energy, Bush has not indicated tha=
t=20
these approaches will not have a role in his administration's strategy. It =
is=20
important to keep in mind that, while funding for efficiency and renewables=
=20
may indeed be reduced, there is still is a budget for these technologies in=
=20
the Department of Energy. Bush may believe that the time has now come to le=
t=20
market forces support further growth of renewable energies such as wind and=
=20
solar, while he searches for a more immediate solution to the significant=
=20
problems facing the energy industry.=20

According to the Knight Ridder report, Energy Department spokesperson Joe=
=20
Davis expects that there will be cuts associated with the department's $19=
=20
billion budget in an effort to deal with "belt-tightening." In fact, Bush's=
=20
proposed $19 billion DOE budget is $700 million less than what the departme=
nt=20
now spends. Reportedly, the cuts are being made so that the president can=
=20
boost spending on "clean coal" technology to make the fossil fuel more=20
efficient and less harmful to the environment. =20

Rumors of Bush's budget cuts for renewable energy and conservation efforts=
=20
have sparked an immediate outcry from environmental groups and leaders with=
in=20
the Democratic Party. For instance, New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman, the=
=20
ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, went on record in=20
disagreement with the proposed cuts. "Clearly if we don't dedicate adequate=
=20
resources (to research and development for energy efficiency), we lose our=
=20
ability to benefit from this technology," Bingaman said.=20

Renewable energy supporters point to the fact that the clean coal technolog=
y=20
program already in place still has about $600 million in unspent funding,=
=20
despite the fact that it has produced few usable results. In addition,=20
conservation advocates refer to a report concluding that the Department of=
=20
Energy's conservation program has already saved $30 billion and 5.55=20
quadrillion Btus of energy. The overall consensus of the groups that oppose=
=20
Bush's expected spending cuts is that, now more than ever, spending for=20
renewable energy and conservation programs should be increased, not cut. =
=20

It has already been well established that President Bush supports opening u=
p=20
federally protected lands for increased oil and natural-gas drilling. The=
=20
president has made no secret of his intention to move forward with the=20
controversial step to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in=20
Alaska. The Bush administration is pushing to open and develop for drilling=
 8=20
percent of ANWR, which consists of 1.5 million tundra acres and spans 200=
=20
miles along the Arctic Ocean. Throughout his campaign, President Bush=20
reiterated that he would make this move, a point on which he differed sharp=
ly=20
from Al Gore, who maintained that he would keep the land protected. For som=
e=20
time it was expected that Bush's energy plan would also include expanded=20
conservation efforts and increased funding for alternative fuels. However,=
=20
according to Bush's team the short answer to the electricity shortage that=
=20
has rocked California and put fear into the rest of the country is to=20
"increase domestic supplies of natural gas, coal and oil, all of which can =
be=20
used to run power plants."=20

As another action plan, President Bush has argued that the United States=20
needs to become more autonomous when it comes to meeting its energy needs.=
=20
The Bush administration has claimed that the United States has become too=
=20
dependent on foreign sources of oil, especially when there are abundant=20
reserves that can be processed domestically. Yet, it's also important to no=
te=20
that President Bush has never suggested that domestic supply of oil and=20
natural gas will be sufficient. Rather, the president recognizes that acces=
s=20
to an adequate supply of foreign oil and gas is strategically important to=
=20
the United States and the global economy. =20

However, instead of relying predominantly on the Middle East, Bush will wor=
k=20
more closely with Canada and Mexico to increase cross-border flows of oil,=
=20
natural gas and electricity within North America. Toward that end, Bush has=
=20
asked Mexico's President Vincente Fox to help by allowing private U.S.=20
capital to build electricity plants and transmission lines in Mexico that=
=20
would send power north. This has been a rather contentious issue in Mexico,=
 a=20
country that has had a long-standing history of state-owned electricity. Pa=
st=20
proposals to privatize or allow even minimal levels of private investment i=
n=20
Mexico have been widely denounced. Fox has responded that Mexico is having=
=20
trouble meeting its own power needs, let alone being able to send power to=
=20
the United States. However, Fox has agreed to work with President Bush on=
=20
establishing a regional energy plan between the two countries with the=20
objective of providing enough power to fuel their growing economies. =20

Running concurrent to Bush's proposed energy plan is a comprehensive energy=
=20
bill reportedly being developed by Senate Republicans, under the leadership=
=20
of Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, a Republican from=20
Alaska. The bill appears to be a mirror image of the policies expected in=
=20
Bush's energy plan, including drilling in the ANWR and also tax breaks=20
offered to the oil industry. For instance, the measure reportedly would gra=
nt=20
oil producers operating on federal lands a break on their royalty payments =
to=20
the government, along with granting federal royalty relief for producers=20
operating in deep waters and difficult formations such as tight rocks and=
=20
coal beds. In addition, the bill would require that federal agencies such a=
s=20
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Interior Department confi=
rm=20
with the Energy Secretary before taking any action "that would have a=20
significant effect of reducing domestic energy supply." =20

Of course, earlier this month the U.S. Supreme Court granted extended power=
=20
to the EPA to regulate emissions from utility power plants, along with othe=
r=20
industries. In one of the most important environmental and business decisio=
ns=20
in decades, the Supreme Court rejected industry arguments that the federal=
=20
government must consider cost and not just health benefits in setting=20
national air pollution standards. Largely rejecting arguments by business=
=20
groups, the Supreme Court said that the EPA has the power to issue new=20
standards designed to reduce the levels of smog and soot in the air. Prior =
to=20
this ruling, it was suggested that President Bush was also considering=20
relaxing some environmental standards to allow electrical plants to expand=
=20
capacity. It is unknown at this point whether or not Bush will still go in=
=20
this direction, considering that the Supreme Court unanimously sided with t=
he=20
EPA's authority in these matters. =20

Moreover, it may be premature to draw any conclusions about President Bush'=
s=20
energy plan until the official strategy is released and we can assess=20
specific numbers. I have not seen anything that would indicate that the=20
president does not support a significant role for renewable energies such a=
s=20
wind and solar, along with increased conservation efforts. In fact, recall=
=20
that Bush was an active participant in the Texas restructuring legislation,=
=20
in which the Renewables Portfolio Standard requires that approximately 5=20
percent of fuel generation comes from renewable sources. In fact, the=20
deregulation law in Texas is considered the most supportive of renewable=20
forms of energy when compared to the 24 states that have enacted legislatio=
n=20
for electric competition. Consequently, during his tenure as Governor of=20
Texas, President Bush demonstrated support for alternative forms of energy.=
=20
However, as demand continues to outpace supply on a national basis, the=20
president appears to be looking for an immediate solution, which more than=
=20
likely will give priority to large-scale production plants efforts includin=
g=20
coal, natural gas and nuclear. In the next few weeks, when President Bush's=
=20
energy plan is formally released, it may very well emerge that his=20
administration proposes a more balanced approach to the nation's energy=20
needs, which still includes conservation efforts and exploration of renewab=
le=20
energies.=20
