Here is the execution version of the PPA amendment.  I am taking a copy to 
Jake for his signature which I will then fax to Jim Jordan today.  I will 
also get Jake to sign two hard copies that we will send by overnight courier 
to Jim Jordan, for execution as described below in Don Kane's note.

Al:

Attached is the amendment with the two small changes we discussed.  Jim 
Jordan will look for your overnight package with two signed originals 
tomorrow morning.  Upon receipt, Jim will (i) obtain the signature of PSCo's 
Paul Bonavia, (ii) fax a copy of the fully executed amendment to you, and 
(iii) return one fully executed original by overnight delivery to your 
attention.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or Jim.
