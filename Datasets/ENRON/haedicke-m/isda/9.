Stacey,

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.
