Mark -

Attached is the EGA Legal report for February.  I'm interested in your 
feedback on level of detail.  Some of our contributors gave quite a bit of 
detail (e.g., India) while others were quite a bit more brief (although 
generally on less important projects).

Also, I've left out discussion of the South America assets.  I'm assuming 
that is coming from John/Randy -- I know that Miguel Mendoza is inputting to 
them on most of these assets.

Thanks,
Bruce
