Please see below  the  information requested a legislator in California.  
Most of this information is already available but I do not know how much we 
want to disclose. 
 Please plan to meet at 7:30 am on Monday in 8C1 for us to pull together our  
materials and decide what we can disclose so weI can forward to the lobbyist 
by open of business in California.  I will get a call in number for those not 
able to attend.  

Marty and Don:  can you determine if the ENA folks that are on this memo need 
to attend ? I am uncertain about how  we handled the contracts we have with 
ENA, or how much we want to disclose about our relationship with ENA, since 
we have not really  been asked these types of questions before.
