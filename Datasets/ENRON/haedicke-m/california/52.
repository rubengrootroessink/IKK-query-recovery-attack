 When we printed out the final hard copy of the memo for our files we 
discovered that it did not print correctly.  The memo heading masked the date 
and the privileged designation.  Although we realize that you have probably 
passed this on, we are providing a new version which we believe corrects the 
problem.  If you can we would ask that you use this version.
