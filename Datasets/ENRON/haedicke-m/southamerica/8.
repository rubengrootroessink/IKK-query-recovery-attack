		 Subject: New YPF GSA  vs. 10/98 GSA

Please find attached the most current draft of the renegotiated YPF GSA 
reflecting the new commercial terms reached in the past few weeks with YPF 
and Andina compared against 10/98 GSA. 

Here are a  few highlights of the revised deal: 

1.  significant reduction in price (Article 2)
2.  delivery point for all gas now inlet of GTB (Article 13) shifting all 
upstream transportation cost to Sellers
3.  55% take or pay with 5 year makeup (increased from 1 year makeup) 
(Articles 1 & 4)
4.  increased annual damages cap from $4 million to $20 million (Article 6)
5.  added concept of joint proportional liability (not joint & several)  -- 
effectively, YPF is liable for 50% of the damages caused by Andina, and vice 
versa (Article 6)
6. increased flexibility in event of PPA termination or change in Brazilian 
law (ToP to 0% and repricing option) (Article 20) 
7.  increased exclusivity obligation from 75% to 100% (upon expiry of Vintage 
ST) (Article 8)
8.  L/C required in event of SCC payment default inceased from $12.5 million 
to $20 million (Article 9)
9.  added permitted assignments in event of sale of EPE and to Sellers 
affiliates/aggregator (Article 16)
10.  Sellers to sign consent re financing at GSA closing -- Banks' put option 
should disappear (Article 16)

The issues that are still being refined are damges during commissioning 
(Sellers want reduced cap) and details/mechanics of the repricing option in 
Article 20.
 
Fede & Erwin are planning to circulate a 1st draft of the DASH on Friday.  
Please let me know if I can answer any questions or provide any additional 
info. in the meantime.  We expect to be in position to sign the new GSA by 
late next week (June 1 at the latest).
