Not clear at this point.  No deals have been done.  My guess is that it will 
be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark

Mark, who within the Enron legal group is responsible for Enron Excelerator?  
From what I've heard about this initiative, it sounds like it may be doing 
deals similar to what we've done for Enron in the past.  We'd love to get the 
opportunity to help -- we have valuable experience we can bring to bear in 
this area.  Thanks.
