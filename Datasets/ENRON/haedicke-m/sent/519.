Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite 
scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We 
envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the 
offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.  Departure would occur the 
morning of December 16th.  It is important that everyone stays for the entire 
period including Friday night.  Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken 
time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about 
Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.

A complete agenda will follow shortly.

Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.

Regards
Delainey
