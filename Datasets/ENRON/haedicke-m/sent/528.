David will be spending a couple of weeks with us in Houston (October 9 - 20) 
before he goes to London for a week.  It would be great if each of you could 
set up a lunch or dinner with him while he's here.  He will be in EB3878C at 
extension 5-3757, while he's here and his assistant will be Chaundra Woods at 
extension 5-7621. 

Thanks in advance for your assistnace in making David's stay here in Houston 
enjoyable.

Regards, 

Alan
