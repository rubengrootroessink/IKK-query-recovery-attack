Subject: CLERP6 Draft Australian Legislation



The Australian Financial Markets Association has sent to ISDA a copy of
CLERP6, the draft legislation reforming the Australian Corporations Law
relating to securities and derivatives.  We  understand that is expected to
be implemented in January 2001.  ISDA has not yet reviewed the draft.

 We attach a copy of the draft legislation for your information
