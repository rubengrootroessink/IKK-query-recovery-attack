E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice

We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail=20
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000=
.

The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained onl=
y=20
30 days as compared to the current 365 days. =20

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important=20
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up=
.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the=20
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific=
=20
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic=
=20
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and=
=20
voice mail.

Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged=
=20
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enro=
n=20
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing thei=
r=20
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain=
=20
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron=20
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing=
=20
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.

The revised retention schedule follows:

Message Location    Maximum Retention
Inbox     30 Days
Message Log/Sent Mail   30 Days
Trash     Rollover from Inbox for 15 days
Bulletin Boards    30 Days
Folders/Archives    E-mails placed in Folders or Archives =01) one year
Voice mail     90 days

The Corp IT Group responsible for maintaining compliance with this=20
e-mail/voice mail policy will automatically purge e-mail and voice mail old=
er=20
than the allowed maximum retention age.  Any exception to this policy=20
requires approval from Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders.

If you need assistance in creating folders and saving documents to them,=20
please call the Helpdesk x7454.  We will be glad to assist you.


Thank.  Jean x7173
