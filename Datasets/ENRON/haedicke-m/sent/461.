Mr. Haedicke,

I'm a new hire and was recently advised to become familiar with the NYMEX.com 
website.  While I was there, I looked up Enron under NYMEX.com's "member 
firms" section.  I found Enron's name and your name as a contact point.  What 
was odd though was that although your email address appears correctly as a 
hyperlink ("mhaedic@ect.enron.com"), I noticed that the actual email 
reference was to someone at El Paso Energy, "morrissont@epenergy.com".  You 
can see this by right-clicking on the hyperlink and looking at the link's 
properties.   I believe this will cause emails intended for you to go to El 
Paso Energy.

I don't know how often this link would even be used so this may not be a big 
deal...

If you have any questions I may be reached at extension 53707.

Hal
