Mark,

Thanks for a great presentation today.
I have already received several comments 
from people saying how much they enjoyed it.

I've attached a few orchid shots.
In fact, I will be showing them all on Saturday.
My photo organization, Houston Center for Photography is sponsoring a print 
sale.
It is from 10 am to 6 pm this Sat. at 1441 Alabama (near the Menil).

Hope you have a great weekend.
Thanks again.

Frazier
