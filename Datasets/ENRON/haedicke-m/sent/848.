I don't have a problem with it, subject to our normal litigation exception.

Mark:

I am attaching a copy of a brief memo I received from one of my partners in 
our Houston office about a potential representation of a company called 
Centrans, which apparently is a partner with Enron in a Guatemala power 
project.  Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a 
Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much).
We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund.  I am not 
sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that 
Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase.  So, from a 
conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf 
representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation 
in which Enron is a shareholder.

Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale?  
Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of 
that could create a potential problem from your standpoint?  I assume this 
transaction would fall within your "world" but, if not, is there somebody 
else that I should check with on this?  We understand that Thelen Reid & 
Priest is representing the Fund.

Thanks, as usual, Mark, for your consideration.  Perhaps you could just reply 
to this e-mail or ask Janette to give me a call if it is ok.

John
