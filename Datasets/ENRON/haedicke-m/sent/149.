I will be in Tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in 
Japan for Enron.  I would like to book time on your respective schedules to 
meet on Wednesday afternoon.  I have some flexibility in my schedule if that 
does not work for you.  I will be in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday too.  Look 
foward to hearing from you.
