Please provide your comments to me as soon as you can.  The most important 
thing at this point is to make sure I have the business correctly described.  
I am working on the letter of intent now.  We will have to decide how 
detailed you want the term sheet and loi.  I would think you would want it 
fairly general for your first few meetings until we get feedback.  Let me 
know.
