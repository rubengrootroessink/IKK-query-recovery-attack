I think we will need to do something for Peter.  I would be interested in HRs 
view on how much.  Mark

Mark,

I was chatting with HR rep in Calgary and she mentioned in doing the new 
contract on Gaffney it brings him very close to Keohane and possibly we might 
look to do something for him also?

What are your views?

David
