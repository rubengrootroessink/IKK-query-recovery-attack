Mark-    I'd like to invite you to pareticipate in the newly formed Houston
Chapter of the Texas General Counsel Forum.  GC and their direct reports are
the targeted membership and the organization has been very successful in
Dallas.  Led by several local GC and supported by only a few large law and
accounting firms, the Houston effort is just beginning.  Current
participants include Chase, Reliant Energy, Compaq, Texaco, Equiva, American
General, Sterling Bankshares and others.

 A breakfast meeting is scheduled for June 13 at the Doubletree in Allen
Center at 8:00 a.m. in the Granger A conference room.  Each organizer is
inviting two guests and I hope you can be one of mine.  Of course,  we would
also like Jim to participate and membership is open to all GC or their
direct reports in a company. Vince may visit with Jim about this group.

I have copied below a blurb desciribing the TGCF and membership plans. Let
me know by phone or email.  Thank you very much.

I just got back form 6 rounds of golf in 3 days at the Inn of the Mountain
Gods in Ruidoso. And a little time in the casino. Have you played there? My
game can be desrcibed as " arguably improving early beginner", says the rest
of the foursome.

practices for legal department management and for
                                             effective communication between
the legal department and executive
