Hi Larry:

I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.  I think we got 
a gift -- I remember Susan saying something.  I am just the Dad!  Everything 
is going well.  Keep me posted on your job opportunities or if you want me to 
follow up with anyone here.

Mark

Hi Mark:

I heard from Ted Bland last week. He said that George still has not tested 
the equipment and Bryan has not met with the COO about hiring yet. 

I am looking forward to an offer coming in this week from a small public 
company that wants me to develop a new business development group and 
increase their sales from $10MM to $50MM over the next couple of  years and 
get the stock price up. 

I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end 
due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position 
in the next couple of weeks. 

Everyone is settled into school and doing well. What is new with you and your 
family? 

Debbie and I sent you and Susan a gift a month or so ago for having Bryan 
stay with you. Did you receive it? 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Larry
