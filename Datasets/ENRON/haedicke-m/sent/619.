The top ten legal risk report for EGM is new.  It should help focus attention 
on the most significant legal risks.  Mark

I'll defer to you.  How does this supplement your reports now?

Mike and Jeff:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  Alan and I am preparing a monthly trading 
and transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Mark
