David:

It was good to see you also.  I am only available on the 14th.  I would like 
you to come to Enron and talk about the audit and certain key provisions in 
the trading agreements with the top trading lawyers.  Give Mark Taylor a call 
at 713-853-7459; he is GC of the financial trading.

Regards,   

Mark

Mark, it was good to see you Thursday.  My next visit to Houston is
scheduled for May 14 and 15.  I will be making a presentation concerning the
legal consequences of market abuse in electricity trading to a Risk Magazine
Conference on the 14th.  As we discussed last week, I would, if you wish, be
pleased to speak to your colleagues on the same subject during my visit.  I
would also be pleased to discuss the contract audit issues, focusing on the
key provisions that have been, or we expect to be, critical from a financial
or reputational perspective.  In that regard, it would be helpful to discuss
Enron' experience with agreements/provisions before finalizing my remarks.
Perhaps you could identify someone on your staff with whom I may speak.

Best regards.
