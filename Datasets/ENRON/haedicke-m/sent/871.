		 Subject: Lawyer Intervew for EEOS position 

As i have mentioned, I need to fill the vacant Carlos Sole slot here at EEOS. 
Vicki had agreed this, but I wanted to run this past you before I move on 
it.  Between the work we do to support the ENA projects, the Pipeline Group 
work, and our claims and litigation, I think I do need to fill the vacancy 
with a lawyer.

I have identified a candidate that has significant construction experience 
that I would like to bring in next Tuesday afternoon for an initial screen, 
but before I do that I wanted to see if you are on board with me filling the 
slot.  

I  would not trouble you with an interview request unless after I meet her I 
think she is a strong enough candidate to pursue further.
