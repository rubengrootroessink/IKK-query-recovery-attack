Mark - Could we arrange a telephone call with you, Mary and me this week to
discuss the North America Energy Derivatives Committee and a proposed agenda
for the near term - including the conference in Houston that you've been
discussing with Mary?  There has been no meeting for some time as you know.
Regards, Ruth

Mark:

Thanks a lot for the lists.  If it's ok with you I will get back to you on
getting some contact names.

We are looking into hotels in Houston for the Energy conference in February
or March, 2001.  Is there any certain time in those months that wouldn't
work for you?  Houston is becoming a very difficult place to find hotel
availability.  The thinking was to hold an Energy conference in the U.S. in
the first half and in the U.K. sometime in the second half of the year.  It
has been mentioned that we should hold the Europe Energy conference in
Amsterdam.  My thinking is that we should first hold it in London.  What do
you think?

Regards,
Mary

Mary:

I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.  It seems to me that we
should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to
join
ISDA.  Let me know if I can help.

Regards,

Mark

Janette:

I meant to copy you on this, but sent it before thinking.

Mark:

Last week you requested that I give you a list of about 10 counterparties
that
you would forward on to ISDA.  Please note that the listed counterparties
came
from information given to me by the documentation group.  In any event, the
list
is as follows:

          1.  AEP
          2.  Aquila
          3.  Coral
          4.  Duke Energy Trading
          5.  El Paso Merchant Energy
          6.  Koch
          7.  PG&E Energy Trading
          8.  Reliant
          9.  Southern Company Energy Marketing
          10. Williams Energy

I hope this is of some help.

Jeff
