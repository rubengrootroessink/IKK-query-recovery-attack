Peter:

You are asking good questions.  Generally, most employees are part of ENA and 
provide services to all the wholesale businesses.  The executives tend to 
have their own company business cards and stationary.  But, most of the 
business continues under ENA or an existing company.  Occasionally, 
litigation concerns dictate not following the general rules.  You can get 
more specific info from Julia.
