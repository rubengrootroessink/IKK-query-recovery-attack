Dan: 

I think you should add a sentence that you will continue to be directly 
involved in LNG matters including the contracts for Dabhol and that addtional

Alan,

Attached is a draft of the memo we discussed with Mark during our recent 
Dubai trip.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  If you are in 
agreement as to content, I'll be happy to ensure that it is distributed to 
the Middle East Team.

Thanks,
Dan
