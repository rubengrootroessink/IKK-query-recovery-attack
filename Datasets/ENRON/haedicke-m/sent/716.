Mark -

Thanks for your help yesterday with Francisco.  I haven't heard from him but 
will talk to him on Tuesday if he and I don't talk today.

As a follow-up to our discussion yesterday, I thought that I would pass along 
an e-mail from Coralina.  

Bruce

I am former counsel with Enron Caribbean Basin, which included supporting 
legal for the Dom REP: SECLP and the LNG project in development , and for 
Puerto Rico: Eco Electrica, Progasco and ProCaribe. As part of the Enron 
restructuring, I have been assigned to Enron Global Markets. 
 I understand that the SECLP asset  in the Dominican Republic has been 
assigned to your group. I am in the process of moving to the Enron building 
before year end and I have been told that my office will have very limited 
storage space. Please let me to know where to send the SECLP files.
I will be available to assist in the transitioning of this matter.   

Thanks,

Coralina
