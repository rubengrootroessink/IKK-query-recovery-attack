Chris:

Thanks for the update.  Let's try to get together in Toronto on Tuesday, 
August 15 or 22.  Do either of those days work for you?  I would envision 
getting up to speed on business opportunities in Ontario and addressing the 
questions you raised.  Your proposal makes sense, but I would like to defer 
our decision until we have had a chance to talk it through.

Mark
