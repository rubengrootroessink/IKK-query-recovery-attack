Rex:  We are trying to make this as limited as possible.  Can you define 
specifically what requires an exception?  I am the signoff for the wholesale 
group, but it makes sense to be consistent across Enron.

Regards,

Mark

Sharon - Exceptions are handled through an approval from Mark Haedicke. If he 
approves the exception, then we will not subject the mail file in question to 
the retention agent. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Thanks-
Cyndi

I am requesting that Rex Rogers, Vice President and Associate General 
Counsel, of our Enron Corp. Legal Department be granted an exception to the 
length of time that he can retain his messages.  He has some emails from 1999 
that are important for him to retain because they deal with Securities and 
Exchange Commission filings, the Enron Corp. Form 10-K, and other vital 
information.  Thank you for your consideration.
