Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will 
pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.  It seems like overkill to 
recruit just for shipping.

Alan, Mark,

they are firing from all angles. We had this approach from Stu Staley and 
Pierre Aury. 

My line to them has basically been: we will provide best shipping advice 
promptly: please refer all your queries in this regard to Justin Boyd's team 
ie first contact: Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, then any other team members, 
including Justin and failing them, me. 

So far, we are far from being swamped with technical shipping issues that we 
cannot deal with in-house. As and when we get to that position, we have good 
relationships with the best shipping firms in London, including Richards 
Butler and Sinclair Roche and Temperley. This may be adequate cover at that 
stage. Alternatively we may decide to recruit. In making that decision we 
would of course consult with George and Stu and the rest of the team. My view 
is that we are not at that stage yet. 

I would love this business to expand to the position where we needed to do 
that, and I hope we get there soon. When we do, we will ensure these business 
areas are properly covered until we get new staff on board. The business will 
not be prejudiced by a wait and see approach.

This approach has satisfied Stu and Pierre. Of course we have to be flexible; 
if George is adamant and prepared to fund the recruitment, then off we go. I 
think I could persuade him however that he didn't need to do that now. 

What are your views on this?

Subject to how you want to play things / have already played things with 
George, I would propose to speak to Stu and Pierre about this again and then 
call George to ensure he is happy with the game plan.

I'll try to call you both tomorrow morning your time to discuss this.

Thanks.



        Mark

Mark - we are rapidly expanding our vessel trading business in London.  In 
addition other Enron groups such as liquids, LNG, steel and pulp & paper are 
becoming much more active on the vessel side.  One of our areas of concern as 
we go forward is gaining ready access to competent shipping counsel.  I would 
like to meet with you to discuss our interest to hire a in-house shipping 
attorney in London. 

Thanks,

George
