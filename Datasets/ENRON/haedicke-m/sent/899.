Pursuant to your request, I called Deborah Bubenko regarding what information 
she needs from you regarding space planning for the new building.  Deborah 
had Kim Kaase (extension 35349) return my call.

Listed below are the next steps:

Review the space plans and give your comments
You mentioned one of your major concerns is size of offices
Provide information regarding any speciality areas such as the number of file 
rooms, the number of conference rooms the department needs, etc.

In summary, the next steps are to determine the requirements for the 
department and then schedule a meeting through Tammy Shepperd (Wes Colwell's 
assistant) to provide them your feedback.
