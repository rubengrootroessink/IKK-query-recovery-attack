You are clear to sign CSN with ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil.

John;

I am hoping to close a PPA with CSN on Friday.  The nominal value of the deal 
is approximately US$6million for a 13-month term.  I am fighting to get 
ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil as a dispute resolution mechanism.  
CSN insists on MAE mediation & local courts (which is unacceptable to us).  
In case we reach an agreement, can I go ahead with arbitration in Brazil ?  
Have you talked to Michelle Blaine or Mark Headicke yet ?

Tks,

Sami
