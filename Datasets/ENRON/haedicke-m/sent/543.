Bryan -

I have a meeting scheduled with Mark on Monday at 4:00 to update him on the 
status of a number of item associated with our Department's technology 
plans.  I had hoped to update him on the status of the intraweb site; 
however, since no one from your group has contacted me to follow-up on our 
Sept. 29 meeting, I was wondering if you would be available to attend the 
meeting I have with Mark.  If so, I would hope that we could discuss issues 
pertinent to moving the process along as our goal is to have a functioning 
web site as soon as possible.  

Please let me know your availability and when I can expect some movement on 
this project.

Thanks.

Mark
