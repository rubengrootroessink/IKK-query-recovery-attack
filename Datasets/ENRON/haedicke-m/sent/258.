I am OK with this so long as it does not set a precedent for next year.

Sheila:

As we discussed when you gave me my offer letter, I have some vacation 
already planned and would like to make that vacation (with pay) a part of my 
offer of employment, in addition to the 28 or so hours that I'll accrue 
during the balance of 2000, which I will need to use for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas.  We are planning to spend the end of August in New England -- 
Thursday and Friday, Aug. 24 - 25, the following week of August 28 - 
September 1, and Labor Day, September 4.   Do you want to discuss this issue 
with Mark or would you prefer that I discuss it with him directly?

Otherwise, I am happy to accept the terms of the offer letter.  I still need 
to make some decisions about benefits.  I am assuming that I do not need to 
make my actual elections until my start date.  I would like to start on 
Monday, May 1 so that I have a couple of weeks to wrap things up with the 
firm.  

Thank you so much for all of your help with my transition to corporate life!

Leslie
