Seth:

I thought last week was very productive.  I appreciated your help.  The ISDA 
office in Tokyo is set to open officially on April 13, 2000.   Yasuko Horibe, 
who is currently in the ISDA office in NYC at 212-332-1271 is planning on 
moving to Japan to open the office.  Give her a call and get more details.  
Get back to me if you don't get the info you need.   

Rgards,

Mark
