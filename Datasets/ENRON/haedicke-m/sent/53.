Terry:

Greetings.  I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in 
Japan starting next year.  I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other 
large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?  Would you 
or someone else you know want to talk about that?  Let me know.  Hope things 
are going well.

Take care.

Mark
