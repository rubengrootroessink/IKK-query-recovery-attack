Dear All

Kathleen and I are getting married on 17 March 2001. Kathleen has had the 
pleasure of meeting those of you who were in Singapore in the last year and a 
half. As for the rest, I've told her so much about all of you that she feels 
she has met you!

Nony has been so kind to help us distribute our wedding invitations to you. I 
know its probably too far to come, but we really wanted  to somehow share the 
occasion with you, our friends in Houston. If you do happen to be in the 
neighbourhood and manage to come, we would be truly honoured.

Best regards
Matt
