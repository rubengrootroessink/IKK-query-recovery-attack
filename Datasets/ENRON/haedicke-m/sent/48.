Jim, I am looking for weather data by region for 98 and 99.  I believe that 
there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support 
that.  This is background info to support the arguments for standardized 
power contracts,  which are nearly agreed to.  Let me know what there is and 
who I should talk to.  Thanks for your help.     Mark
