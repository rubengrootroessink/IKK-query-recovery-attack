Thanks for the message.  I appreciate the feedback.  I know she has been 
working particularly hard lately!  We are working to add resources, but that 
is not easy.  Thanks for your support.

Mark

Mark,

Just wanted to let you know that Sheila has been doing a truly outstanding 
job for West Power lately.  There has been some big, thankless challenges 
related to transacting around our new finance vehicle, Turbopark, and she 
might feel a little beat up by the experience, but she has performed 
extremely well. 

Regards,

Chris
