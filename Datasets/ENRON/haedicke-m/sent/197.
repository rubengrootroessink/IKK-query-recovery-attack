On Tuesday, April 11th the Chairman of Milbank, Tweed-- Mel M. Immergut,--and 
two of his partners who have done a considerable amount of work for 
Enron---Ed Feo and Eric Silverman --- are coming to Houston to pay us a 
courtesy visit.  I will host a lunch for them to which you are hereby 
invited.  Following lunch, they would like to visit with you or your 
designees to better acquaint themselves with the breadth of Enron's legal 
needs.  It might also  be useful for them to take a tour of one of our 
trading floors.  Please let me know if you are available to have lunch with 
us on the 11th and to spend perhaps 45 minutes with them sometime between the 
end of lunch and 5:30 p.m. discussing your group. Thank you.  JVD
