Steve:

It looks like a great program!  I am happy to participate.  I would like to 
have a teleconference of the panel within a few weeks so that I can make sure 
I have time to get my materials together. 

Regards,

Mark

Mark, 

Per my telephone conversation with Margaret Gerhardt, I want to thank you 
very much for your interest in participating on the e-commerce panel for the 
Energy Bar Association mid-year program.? Margaret suggested that you be 
listed on the program brochure as "invited," in case a conflict should arise. 
The Association will be distributing a final brochure at a later date which 
will reflect any changes in speakers.? Attached for your information is a 
draft program brochure and a brief overview of the? e-commerce panel.? The 
Association believes that the e-commerce panel is timely given the dramatic 
impact that electronic commerce is having on the economy generally, and in 
particular due to the unprecedented changes taking place in the energy 
industries.? Having the perspective of EnronOnline, the industry leader, will 
be a great addition to the program. 

Please let me know if you have questions or need additional information.? I 
look forward to seeing you at the program. 

Steve
