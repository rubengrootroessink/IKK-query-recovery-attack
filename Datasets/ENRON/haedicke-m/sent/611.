Mark (T.) and I have recently discussed our forwarding to ENA Legal our 
updated dealflow summaries so we can ensure that (1) legal coverage is being 
provided for the relevant transactions and (2) there is agreement that the 
"right" lawyers (both inside and outside) are being engaged.

Please feel free to distribute, as needed.  I previously provided Travis with 
a copy.
Let me know if you have any questions/comments.

Jordan
