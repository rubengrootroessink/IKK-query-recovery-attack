I would think the change in the business direction requires a different ski=
ll=20
set.  Is that an appropriate response?

Subject: The power of why

Mr. Walls

I was checking the stock prices when I saw the Enron=01%s homepage saying "=
The
power of Why". So, I=01%ve decided to write these few words. Certainly you =
do
not remember me as you meet lots of people everyday around the world. But I
had the pleasure of meeting you when I was attending a SAP training course
in 2000 when I was in Houston.
I worked for the Legal Departament in the Sao Paulo office and had been
developing a good job (at least my performance evaluations said so) when I
was said teh company was firing many people and I was included in the fatal
list. My immediate supervisors tried to do everything they could to keep me
there and all the answers were no.
I want you to know that this message is not to complain about my firing.
Everyone who works is subject to this fact, specially in Brazil. I simply
became astonished when I was told that two people are being hired for the
same position I had less than 2 months after I left the company.
So, my question is WHY? Why and how does Enron commit such a mistake? I
really trusted the company I used to work for, I really enjoyed working for
Enron and why? Why did Enron fired me and two months later started hiring
two others for the same position? How can such a big company like Enron be
so unreasonalble and why not to say insensitive?

Sorry for this emotional words but I had to say that. I know you might not
even  read this message but I had to try, specially because I did believe i=
n
RICE and I felt I had found out a company where the speech did correpond to
the action, but unfortunately...

Thank you for giving me a little piece of your time and wish success for th=
e
company because I still have friends working very hard there and they reall=
y
like it as I did once.

Thanks a lot for your attention.
