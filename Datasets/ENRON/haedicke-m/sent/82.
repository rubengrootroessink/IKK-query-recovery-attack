My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives 
business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in 
Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor 
on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or 
interest rate traders.
