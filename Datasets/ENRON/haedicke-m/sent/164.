Paul:

Thanks so much for your help.  I think the legal team you have made available 
to us is very impressive.  I look foward to our success in Japan.  I have 
authored many articles on trading in markets around the world.  Would anyone 
in your shop like to work with me on energy trading  and documentation in 
Japan?

Mark
