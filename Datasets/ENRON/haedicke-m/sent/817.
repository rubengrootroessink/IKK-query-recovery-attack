I think it is a good opportunity to promote standardized contracts.  Mark

Mark-

We have been discussing whether to have a press breakfast or other press
contacts in Houston for the March 6 conference.  We think there could be
some interesting media coverageand press interest.  

I look forward to your thoughts and would be happy to have a short call to
explore further Monday. Please advise.

Thanks and regards, Ruth
