Mark,
Good morning.  The CA has been approved by Yvan's counsel.  After your 
review, could you send me originals for Bob Crane to sign.  Thank you.
Dusty

Bryan:

This is ok.  It's been reviewed by both our counsels.  You can have it signed 
by
an officer of Enron and fax it to me.

I'm on holiday for the week but I asked Natalie Tanguay to set up a meeting.
She's at 514-394-2214.

Thanks.

Yvan.
