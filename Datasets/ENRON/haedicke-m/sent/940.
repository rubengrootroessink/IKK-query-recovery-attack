Mark -- If it's O.K. with you, I think it would be better for us here for any 
South America invoices to be sent to us in S?o Paulo, since that is where 
they'll be processed for payment.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Rgds,
 John

Marty -

I don't need the originals or copies of these invoices and defer to Haedicke 
and Novak on how they want them processed.  Thanks.

Rob

We can definitely send you copies of these invoices in the future to help 
facilitate your review and processing of bills. We send the originals to Rob 
Walls in Houston. We will begin with the March invoices which will be going 
out shortly.
    By copy of this memo to Rob Walls, we are advising him that we will be 
sending you copies of these invoices. Please let me know if this is 
satisfactory for your purposes. Marty

Dear April,

Would you mind sending the original of the statements of fees of the
subjects below to the S?o Paulo Office? Usually, before the invoices are
cleared they receive comments, codes, they are submitted to provisions for
cash and may route to different people for review.

Please let me know if this is not any inconvenient for you. Current
subjects invoiced by Skadden are:

                    Dona Francisca (John Novak)
                    RioGen Merchant - Eletrobolt (John Novak)

Thank you.
