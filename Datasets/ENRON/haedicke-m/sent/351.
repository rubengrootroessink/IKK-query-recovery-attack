Michael:

The September ISDA meeting is coming up and I am starting to plan my 
schedule.  I will be in London on Monday and Tuesday, Sept 12 and 13.  I will 
also be in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday.  Are you free for dinner on 
either Monday or Tuesday?  Who is the best person in Frankfurt to give me an 
overview of the trading markets in Germany?  

Regards,

Mark
