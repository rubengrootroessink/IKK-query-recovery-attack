We want the letter on Doyle and New Albany ASAP.  Is there any reason we 
would not do the joint defense agreement.

Received this just now - will not reply until we have your thoughts.  Cle 
Dade  had a thought about mentioning the existing New Albany - Doyle units in 
our reply letter as well.  We are available at your convenience to discuss 
the New Albany - Doyle turbine situation vis-a-vis Power Systems - Al

Al,

Our non-infringement opinion letters on the redesigned components have been 
ready now for over one week.  I understood your client was anxious to receive 
them, so we worked very hard to complete them as quickly as we could. 

Please forward to me the executed Joint Defense Agreement so that I can 
forward our non-infringement letters.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Trent
