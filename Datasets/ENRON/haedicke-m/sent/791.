Mark -

I was cleaning out my email in anticipation of the move to microsoft outlook 
from notes and found this.  Interesting. . .

Subject: Dan Rogers

Guys-

Dan Rogers is an absolute beast.  I am very impressed by the amount of 
workload he can handle, his appreciation for commercial objectives and his 
awesome attitude.  He maintains a very good balance between doing what he can 
do and knowing when to delegate stuff to outside counsel; no one I've worked 
with in the legal group has mastered this as well as Dan has.

People usually don't hesitate to complain, thought you may want to hear some 
good stuff too. 

Adios,

Andrew
