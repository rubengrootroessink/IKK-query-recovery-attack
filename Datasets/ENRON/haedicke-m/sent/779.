Mr. Fournier:

This is Janette Elbertson, Mark Haedicke's Assistant.  I spoke with your 
assistant this morning and this meeting has been rescheduled for Thursday,  
March 1, at 11:30 am in Jim Derrick's office.  Lunch is scheduled after the 
meeting if that meets your schedule.

Mark Haedicke is traveling this week.  I will call your e-mail to his 
attention upon his return on Friday.

Dear Mark: 
 
I trust you had a pleasant holiday season.  I understand that our meeting 
with Jim Derrick and you has been rescheduled to the first part of March.  
Your assistant gave us the choice of March 1 or 2.  Although we can 
accommodate both dates, March 1 works better for David Jackson. 
 
Our understanding is that Blakes is not getting any further work from Enron 
as a result of the circumstances under which we could no longer continue 
acting for Enron in litigation involving Westcoast, another Blakes client. 
 
As you can well imagine, the prospect of losing our valued relationship with 
Enron is extremely disappointing, especially considering the significant 
inroads we had made during the last couple of years in getting to know Enron, 
its various businesses and representing your interests on a number of major 
transactions and initiatives in Canada. 
 
At this point in time, we need to better understand where we stand and 
whether there is any prospect of representing your interests in Canada.  One 
of our concerns in trying to mend fences is our relationship with your 
Calgary office which we perceive to be paramount in any effort to 
re-establish the kind of relationship we had with Enron prior to this 
incident.  As a result, we would like to seek your views on this prior to our 
meeting in Houston so as not to further aggravate our relationship with the 
Calgary office.
 
David Jackson and Jim Christie, two key members of our senior executive, and 
I would be available to discuss this matter with you at your convenience 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.  Perhaps you can let me know what 
works best for you and we could initiate the call. 
 
Thanking you in advance for your kind consideration. 
 
Best regards, 
 
Dan
