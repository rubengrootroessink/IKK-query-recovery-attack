Subject: Legal Team Meeting -- Friday, 12:00 noon Rio time

We are implementing a legal team meeting with a smaller group that will meet 
during weeks when we don't have the all hands Legal Staff meeting.  The Legal 
Team meeting will be held every other Friday at 9:00 Houston time (currently 
12:00 noon S?o Paulo/Rio time) starting tomorrow.  The idea of the smaller 
group meeting is to get updates on the key deals/assets in the region so we 
can keep Houston current on a weekly basis when the larger legal staff 
meeting is not scheduled.  

While the group included on this call may change from time to time as deal 
priorities change, currently I would like to allocate reporting 
responsibility as follows:  Arap (key trading/origination deals); Watanabe 
(Eletrobolt); Vasco (Elektro); Porto (CEG/Gas Business Unit); Mendoza 
(Transredes sale process); and Novak (Cuiab?).

I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Rgds,
 John
