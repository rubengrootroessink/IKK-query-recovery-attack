Mark:  Thanks for the info.  I had a great time at the football game!  I 
think you will like Dubai.  It has some great restaurants.  

Regards,

Mark

Mark,

I will be out of the office on Monday, so I have asked Jon to chair the call 
from the London end.

I was interested to read in the press that we are considering a new LNG 
import terminal in the Bahamas connected by pipeline to Florida!

Hope all is well.



     Mark
