Sylvia:  I think there should be a cost center for each of ENA, EGM, EIM, ESA 
and EGA, which tracks the org chart of people reporting directly to me.  Deb 
Korkmas can help you with the proper account numbers.

Mark:

With the last re-org, I have been told that most of the old EI Legal Groups ( 
CALME, APACHI, etc.) have moved under your ENA Legal, now known as EWS.  When 
I do Lexis and Westlaw allocations, would you like me to put all under you 
cost center or should I separate them out by 12 subgroups?  I retrieved your 
org. chart from your website.  Please advise your preference and provide cost 
centers that you would like me to allocate Lexis and Westlaw charges at your 
earliest convenience.

Thanks,
