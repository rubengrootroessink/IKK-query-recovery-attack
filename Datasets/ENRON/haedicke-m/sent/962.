Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged
