Let's catch up when you get back to Houston.  We can go to lunch or set up 
time to meet in the office.  Mark

Mark -

I'm attaching the March report for EGA.  I understand that the length is 
still probably more than you want -- we will keep working on winnowing it 
down.  I tended to leave in more discussion of troubled projects like SECLP 
and Dabhol.

I hope all is well.  I've been on the road for some time and am currently in 
Singapore.  I'm likely to head back to Bombay for at least the first few days 
of next week.

Bruce
