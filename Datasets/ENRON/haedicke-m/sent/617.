Mark and Rob:

   I finally finished the highly scientific process of dividing up the
tickets.  The methodology I used is as follows:

   (1) We each ended up with one exhibition game.

   (2) The two of you expressed a preference for weekend nights.  There
are 12 Friday and Saturday games, so I gave each of you six.

   (3)  I tried to give you games where you will not be out of town
(although I ended up giving each of you one game where both of you will be
out of town).

   (4) I divided the teams into good teams (Trailblazers, Jazz, Heat,
Spurs, Lakers,  Knicks, Pacers and Sonics), medium teams (Timberwolves,
Hornets, Kings, 76ers, Cavaliers, Suns, Celtics and Nets) and bad teams
(Bulls, Pistons, Grizzlies, Wizards, Magic, Clippers, Mavericks, Bucks,
Nuggets, Warriors, Raptors and Hawks), and I tried to divide the teams so
that there was a realtively even distribution of team levels. Mark ended up
with 5-7-6, Rob with 6-3-9 and I ended up with 2-1-2.  Although Rob has one
more good team than Mark has, he get to see more dogs.  I am not 100%
certain that I have a good handle on whose going to be good, mediocre and
bad, and there were some teams that might be bad but I put in a medium
category because they are interesting (e.g. 76ers, Celtics and Nets).

   (5) Finally, I attempted to minimize the repeats.  But it ended up
that Mark has the Timberwolves and Grizzlies  twice, and Rob has the
Warriors and Nuggets twice.

   And, of course, if you don't like what I did you can always trade.
   
   This was a highly scientific process, done with the aid of Lotus
1-2-3.

Mark: please note that I have given you Tuesday night's tickets vs. the
Lakers.
