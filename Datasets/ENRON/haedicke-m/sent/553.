		 Subject: ISDA Agreement

Mark:  Hydro-Quebec has asked us to assist them on documenting an ISDA 
agreement with ENA (I think it is a multi-currency cross border 
arrangement).  The associate here who has been asked to work on it said Mary 
Cook is the ENA in house lawyer working on the deal.  Before he left us a few 
months ago, Kevin Leitao had from time to time worked on behalf of some of 
our utility clients in transactions with ENA where, for example, Sara 
Schackleton or Shari Stack handled the transaction for ENA.  Before we go 
forward on this for Hydro-Quebec, however, I wanted to double check with you 
to make sure thare was not any problem from ENA's standpoint.  Could you 
reply to this and just let me know.  Thanks.  We look forward to seeing you 
on Friday.  John
