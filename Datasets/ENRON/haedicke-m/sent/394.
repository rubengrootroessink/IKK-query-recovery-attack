I think partnering with a lawfirm would be a good idea re documentation.  
However, I am not sure the ISDA board is likely to pick a proposal that 
includes a competitor of the stature of Enron.  I will call ISDA and try to 
get a read on what ISDA wants to do which is not clear at this point.

Regards,

Mark
