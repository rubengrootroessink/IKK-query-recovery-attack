Mark:

Happy new year. I hope your new year was eventful on the personal side and
uneventful on the business side.

As you will have seen from my e-mail earlier this week, we are very close to
final on the Supplement. We just have a couple of firms to hear from and we
are chasing them down. One of those is Enron, which you recall took on the
responsibility for the various commodities that no one else volunteered for
(benzene & methanol). Can you check up on the status of the review?

Thanks.

Bob
