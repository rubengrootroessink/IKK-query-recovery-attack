Would it be possible to send a copy or two to Portland so we can do our due

Thanks.

We have purchased 30 copies of the referenced book.  It is a short read -- 
about 30-45 minutes.  The copies are located at the clerks' station, EB3808.  
Please read this short story prior to our ENA Legal Conference and then 
return it to the clerks' station so everyone attending the conference will 
have an opportunity to read it prior to the conference.
