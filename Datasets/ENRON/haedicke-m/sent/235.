Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about 
energy.  I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like 
financial commodity swaps.  Also, I pointed out that innovation has been 
slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure.  
I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few 
congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill.
