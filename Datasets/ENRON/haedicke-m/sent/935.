Mark and Peter - Attached is a copy of the speech made today by the Ontario 
Minister of Energy.  Of course we would have been much happier with an 
outside date or target of November 1, 2001 or  an unconditional May 1, 2002 
date; however, it at least shows a commitment to deregulation. 

While Enron Toronto will be busy with ongoing marketing and certain major 
projects in the near future (the OEFC NUG Contract Management Agreement, the 
G6 retail initiative and the ENERconnect amendment),  the obvious umber one 
priority of this office in the short term will be negotiating an extension to 
the British Energy Supply Contract.

Regards 
CJG

Mr. Speaker: 
This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the 
province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a safe, 
reliable and affordable supply of power.
When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us. 
Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.
Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And 
we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third 
highest in Canada. 
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and 
competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of 
date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.
That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:
The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity 
market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is committed to 
an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and reliable supply.
There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to 
competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive markets 
are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit 
consumers. 
There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like 
to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to ensure 
the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are committed to 
opening the market at the earliest possible date, while ensuring all of the 
conditions required for a smooth transition to competition are met.
And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding 
the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.

First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The 
overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition 
puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to 
the lowest possible costs and better service for all. 
Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of 
electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs. 
Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater certainty to 
potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion dollars in new 
generation projects. 
Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the 
Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity sector. 
They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the requirements 
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new 
electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the 
province's environmental assessment process.
And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the 
search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will 
be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they want, 
including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help promote 
the demand for cleaner, greener electricity. 
And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity sector 
will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to introduce a 
competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put the principles 
in place to ensure that we do it right.

Thank you.
