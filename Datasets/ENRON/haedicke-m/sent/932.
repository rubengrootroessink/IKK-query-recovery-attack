		 Subject: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  
Coal,  LNG & Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a 
liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain 
under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are 
taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend 
our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that 
currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary 
regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue 
Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity 
in every deregulated market.  

Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the 
Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our 
Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, 
and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be 
primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but 
he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial 
Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through 
these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and 
target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the 
company.
