Dear Mark and Bob,

We will be kicking-off the above group in January. The core members are
scheduled to meet in advance to discuss the priority and order of the issues
to be discussed. For this purpose, I would appreciate if you could arrange
for someone to send me the minutes of the past committee meetings in NY and
London. If they are not open to non-chairs or the ISDA Board, I will digest
it and reduce them into plain Japanese summary.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,

Terry
