I am willing to do this on the 20th, but only for one hour maximum.  See if 
Jim has any interest and then get back to Peter.   Mark

Jim and Mark, further to my earlier exchange of e-mails with Mark, 3 
representatives of the Donahue Ernst & Young firm, Doug Black, Harold Huber 
and Ron Deyholos, will be in Houston on March 19th and 20th, and they were 
wondering about your availability to meet with them.  They have other 
meetings lined up on the 19th, but would be available, subject to your 
availability, later in the afternoon on March 19th or any time in the morning 
on March 20th.

Please let me know whether that works for either of you, and I will have Ron 
Deyholos then contact you directly to make firmer arrangements.

Regards,
Peter
