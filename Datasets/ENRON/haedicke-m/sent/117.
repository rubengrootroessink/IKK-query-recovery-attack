John:

I will get on your calender in January when I am over.  It is also my 
understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that 
Chinese walls are not necessary.  But it will be necesary to address if 
equity trading starts up.  Also, there are probably related issues, like 
restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading.  Hope you 
have time to enjoy the Holidays.  Take care.
