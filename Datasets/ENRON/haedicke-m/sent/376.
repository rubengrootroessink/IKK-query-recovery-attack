I am uncertain what your people want but here is a first try.

"By accepting work under this Agreement, Contractor warrants that it will not 
perform any similar work for a competitor of Company.  Contractor 
acknowledges its obligations under section 4 of this Agreement and, as such, 
shall not accept any work in which it might divulge any information, ideas, 
concepts, know-how or techniques learned or created during the work performed 
for company."

I agree completely. However, we probably need to develop language that 
defines an Enron competitor, as people will ask and we are considerably 
broader than we used to be.
