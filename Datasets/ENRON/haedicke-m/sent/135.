Subject: URGENT: Bonus and Merit Key Dates

I have attached a planning schedule that I will be following in HR for the 
1999 Bonuses and 2000 Merits.  Please remember that this schedule depends on 
several parties so some deviations may occur.  I have also attached some 
basic questions and answers that many employees ask.  Please call me at Ext 
30649 or my assistant Irma at Ext 31543 if you have any questions or 
concerns.  Also, I will ask you to pass this information to any of your 
direct reports which may need it.
