FYI.  I am working on new procedures requiring a "budget" for outside counsel 
on our more complex deals to improve cost control.  Mark

I have reviewed the O&M Expenses for ENA Legal for month-ended August 31, 
2000, as compared to the budgeted amount for the same period.  The overall 
legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to 
Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.  The most 
significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant 
development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and 
misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.  The Inside Costs were 
under budget in the amount of $259,654.

If you have any questions, please call me at extension 35448.
