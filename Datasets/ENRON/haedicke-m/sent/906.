Please handle.  I think you should send an email to the OGC and ask if they 
are aware of any such contracts.  Mark

Program


Dear General Counsels:

The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available.

Please contact me by Wednesday, April 11, 2001 and advise me of the number of 
contracts between the United States Government and the Enron entities you 
represent.  In the event any of the Enron entities which you represent have 
government contracts, we will need a member of your respective law 
department(s) to pull the government contracts, and all supporting 
documentation, from the Enron companies which you represent and be available 
to work with other members of the team.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-7224.

Thank you.

Sharon
