Mary:

Spring break for most schools in Houston for 2001 is March 12 through March 
17.  Otherwise, I am open in Feb and Mar at this time.  I think London is a 
better venue for an energy conference than Amsterdam.  Also, I think we will 
eventually want to do an energy trading presentation on Japan --  maybe at 
the update on October 26.

Ragards,

Mark
