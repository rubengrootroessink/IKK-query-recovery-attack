1.  Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for 
ECT.  I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.  This 
resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract 
risks.  There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of 
this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on 
transactions and faster focus on solving problems.
   
   2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy  --  in the face of 
almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed 
that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.  The traders and 
originators helped design the policy and have "bought in".  Training was 
completed in June.  This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the 
same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.

   3.  Lead power industry to develop a standardized form  --  pushed ISDA 
and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master 
trading form for power.  The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after 
the ECT form.  The result will be a significant saving of legal time and 
effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk 
of an unintended default.

   4.  Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge 
legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses.  
These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) 
weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii) 
acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and 
the Peoples deals.

   5.  Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a 
settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.

   6.  Deals are Us  --  lots and lots of deals done.  Legal built a closer 
relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the 
company.
