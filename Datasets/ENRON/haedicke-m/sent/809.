I am looking for some additional general corporate outside legal assistance 
in the LA area (at a more reasonable rate than is charged by Milbank, 
Tweed).  I have come into contact with two former Milbank lawyers who are now 
at McDermott, Will & Emery.  We were impressed with their work in the past 
and believe that they can provide us with prompt, reasonably priced, top 
quality general corporate legal assistance.  McDermott has represented Enron 
Trading Systems and EBS.  Is this an acceptable firm for me to hire?  Thanks, 
Jim
