Christian:

Based upon our discussion, here is the confirm I would like to attach to the 
internal DASH and send to McCook as the documentation we would require from 
BPA. This draft highlights changes from the Stoel Rives version which, based 
upon our discussion, are appropriate. I am available to discuss any of the 
nuances of the language. We are potentially looking at transacting tomorrow 
afternoon and Tracy Ngo is preparing the DASH which will go to Houston today 
(which requires input from you).

Thanks
