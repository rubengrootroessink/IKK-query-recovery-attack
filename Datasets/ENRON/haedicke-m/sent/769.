I am not in favor of this promotion.  I think in the new environment that it 
could be negative for him.  Let's talk about it.  Mark

Mark - I just wanted to touch base with you to confirm that FPL is now an 
Assistant General Counsel.   His confirmation sheets states that he has been 
promoted to that rank, but I didn't want to convey the new title to him until 
I had your confirmation that the promotion was ok with you.   Thanks.
