I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.
