Here is the mock up of the Star Wars invitation.  There are a few tweaks, but 
this is essentially what it will look like.  Michelle

I just received the last catering proposal, so I am working on the cost 
estimate and should have it completed this afternoon.  Attached is a proof of 
the animated invitation.  Let me know what you think.
Thanks.

Dorie, We put out our "save the date" email, and there is good buzz on the 
event.  In your voice mail, you mentioned that you would have menus and 
invitations ready this week.  I am only here a half day tomorrow and then out 
all next week, so I am ready to see that stuff today, if possible.  Thanks!  
Michelle

Wanted to let you know the status on the following:
Working with Ivy Bradberry (with the Image Center) on the cost & production 
of the animated invitation.
Should have all catering proposals by Tuesday, June 5.
I will have a cost estimate and approval form prepared for you no later than 
Wednesday, June 6.

Questions for you:
Do you have any idea how many children are expected?
What was the final decision on the starting time for the program?

Thanks.
