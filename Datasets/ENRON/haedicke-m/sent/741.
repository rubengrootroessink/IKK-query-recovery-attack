Mark:

We have recently been talking to a gentleman named Ed Straub at Duke.  I'll
see if I can push him perhaps by telling them they can speak in Houston if
they join up?

I also spoke with Constellation Energy today and they are serious about
joining as a Primary.  I might even be able to have their application by
next week's Board meeting.

Sorry if I asked you this before, but do you or anyone at Enron know Powder
Horn Petroleum Company out of Tulsa, OK?  They have applied as a Subscriber.

Thanks.
Mary

I am actively pursuing have Duke Energy become an ISDA member this month.
We are very interested in supporting the effort you mentioned at the
October meeting to begin developing one universal master energy trading
form.  Please keep me informed of future meetings, to insure our active
participation as this effort develops.  Thanks.
