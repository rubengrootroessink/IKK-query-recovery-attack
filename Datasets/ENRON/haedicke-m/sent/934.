Hello Mark -- Andrei Postelnicu, Financial Times, will contact you regarding
the electronic trading article.  For reference, his number is 212-641-6339.

Mark, in cases where we receive similar requests in the future, may I put
reporters in contact with you directly? (with the understanding that,
depending upon the issue, you may or may not decide to speak with them) 

Also, feel free to let me know if you would like any of the ISDA staff to
join your call with Andrei. Many thanks -- Stacy

Article on Electronic Trading                
 

 




The FT has contacted ISDA regarding our contribution to an upcoming article
they are writing on the emergence of electronic trading.

ISDA staff will give them regulatory background in US and Europe.  I
thought
it might be worthwhile for them to hear a business/legal perspective as
well.

Would you be interested in speaking with the reporter within the next
couple
of days?  Please advise.  Many thanks!
