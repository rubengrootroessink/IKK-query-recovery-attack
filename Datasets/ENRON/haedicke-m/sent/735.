With regard to Geresse, check with Mark Haedicke to see if Dan ultimately 
needs to see Johan's bonus amount.  You will probably need to explain the 
problem to Mark.

Rick,

I forwarded your email on Stromquist and forwarded to EGEP's HR Department to 
communicate to his Manager.  Additionally, Janie intentionally excluded Johan 
Gerrese's bonus from Dan Rogers' bonus spreadsheet because of the amount of 
his bonus.  Is it all right if Dan see this?  Please advise.

Thanks
