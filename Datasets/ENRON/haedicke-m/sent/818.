Mark: Do you know off the top of your head who Enron uses in Frankfurt,
Germany?  

I am trying to help out someone who is looking for a U.S. firm (or a firm
with a U.S. office) that also has an office in Frankfurt, to assist with a
large business transaction.

Many thanks.


Hope you are doing well.
