What is your global strategy? How will you implement it?

Global eCommerce Law & Business Report can help net market makers answer
these questions with rich monthly analyses of legal and regulatory issues,
best business practices, and the barriers and opportunities that exist in
regions around the world. In our latest issue, for example, we provide a
detailed evaluation of content regulation, privacy, electronic signatures,
and consumer regulation which e-commerce marketers in Japan must consider.
Next month, look for a review of the regulatory environment in China.

Also in the current issue, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group explores
Latin America's fast growing Internet market, which is expected to more
than double by 2003. Venture capital funds are funneling billions of
dollars into enterprises in the region, and global players like Microsoft,
AOL, and Telefonica of Spain are making substantial acquisitions. Is this a
market you should be in?

As net markets build liquidity and seek to add value, globalization becomes
an increasingly important component of many business models. Global
eCommerce will help you stay ahead of the curve.
