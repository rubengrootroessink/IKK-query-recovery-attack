I had a brief conversation with Vicki about splitting the costs 50/50 on the 
legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement.  She asked to use 
the European operation as  a model.  At some point, Peter you should just 
give Vicki a call and talk it through.

To be brief, this project is percolating but being held up on the following 
fronts:  

1.  ENA/EES issues.  I have not been involved so I don't know where it is 
at.  As request by Dave P., Mark P. has sent a copy of his preliminary issues 
memo to Vicki S.  

2.  Market Achievement Plan for unsold PPAs.  The Government is expected to 
announce October 31st.  This will impact the market in many aspects, 
including the viability of competitive retail market options v. regulated 
rate options.  

3.  We have proposals from two law firms.  Donahue Ernst & Young and Blakes.  
My preference would be DEY for diversification reasons, but DEY may have 
unresolvable conflicts which I would have to discuss with you if we are to 
proceed.  Blakes proposal may also have significant conflicts, which may be 
resolvable but which may limit the effectiveness of their representation.  
Nonetheless, it seems a decision will not need to be made until the end of 
October.  In the meantime, Mark P. is working on scoping out legal and 
compliance issues, as well as forms.

Peter.
