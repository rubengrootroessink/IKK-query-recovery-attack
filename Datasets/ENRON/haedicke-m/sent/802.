John:

What is the status on this?  I now have Eddie Daniels dedicated full time to 
Cuiba.  Hopefully that will help you some.

Regards,

Mark,

As a follow-up to our  monday meeting, I want to reiterate our need to have a 
local dispute resolution mechanism for merchant (trading) activities.  My 
suggestion is to automatically allow ICC arbitration (English or Portuguese) 
in Sao Paulo for deals out to 4-5 years and smaller than 200 average 
megawatts, with a case-by-case review for deals of longer maturity or larger 
average capacity.  I appreciate the fact that this requires some discussion 
of company policy, and I am grateful for any help you can give.   I strongly 
believe that we will not be able to prosecute  a successful trading operation 
without a meaningful dispute resolution forum in Sao Paulo.

It was good to see you again, and I look forward to your continuing interest 
in South American trading.
