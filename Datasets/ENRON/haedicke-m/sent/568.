Dear all,

As we know, some of the persons on the distribution list of Polish weekly 
updates still receive the updates, although they have changed their positions 
and/or responsibilties. As we would not like to bother you with our e-mails 
with the reports that you do not need, please confirm that you wish to 
continue receiving the reports on Enron's activities in Poland. 

The common address ECT London European Trading will be deleted from the list 
as a whole. Only the persons who send the confirmation will be added to the 
list.

Thank you.


With best regards,

Jarek Ferenc
