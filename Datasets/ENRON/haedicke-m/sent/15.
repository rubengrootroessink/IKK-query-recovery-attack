Having dealt wih Manfred on a number of matters I have to say I am not 
surprised.  Scott, please get personally involved in selecting a Punder 
lawyer that will take his place in meetings with customers and regulators.  I 
don't want to lose control of legal to John T in Germany.  Let's hire a 
lawyer on the ground if we need to.  Let me know.  Thanks.  Mark
