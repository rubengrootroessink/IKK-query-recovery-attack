Great conference in Amsterdam.  It was the best one yet.  I would like to 
have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next 
year.  I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives 
around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.   If we 
do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our 
membership dramatically.  Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Mark
