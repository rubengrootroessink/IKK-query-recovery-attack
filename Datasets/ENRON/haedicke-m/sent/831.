Mark - Attached is a draft of a 3 year, 30 MW power transaction that Enron 
Canada Corp. is contemplating entering into with Atlantic Packaging Products 
Ltd.  The form of agreement is the one-off industrial form that is 
back-to-backed  by the British Energy supply source.  We have used this form 
for the Sunoco, TransCanada and Ivaco transactions.  As with the other 
agreements, the transaction is conditional on, among other things, Ontario 
Market opening occurring by November 30, 2001.

Regards
CJG
