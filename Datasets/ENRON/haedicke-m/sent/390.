Mark,

Thanks for the help.  I have worked with Anne Koehler a number of times in 
the past; however, since this is specifically Net Works and may be more of an 
acquisition than an investment, I wasn't sure who to contact.  Please find 
attached a brief description of the Altra Gas Pipeline Software Business, 
along with CIBC's Confidentiality Agreement.  I am sure you will have changes 
to the CA, as a result, I will try to identify the appropriate contact at the 
bank.  You may want to give me a call and/or Tom Gros to make sure all of his 
concerns are addressed.
