Please schedule a meeting for Dan Fournier and David Jackson with Jim Derrick 
and me in Houston over the next couple of months.  We will probably first 
meet in Jim's office and then go to lunch.  Mark

Mark, received your voice-mail. Our national Chairman, David Jackson, and I 
are at your disposal. Just give us a bit of a heads-up on timing and we will 
come to Houston. Best regards, Dan.
