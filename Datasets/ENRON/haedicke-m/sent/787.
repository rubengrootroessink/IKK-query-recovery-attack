The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new We are pleased to 
announce organizational changes that have been implemented in to the Enron 
South America legal department in response to the recent reorganization and 
realignment of the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units 
operating in the region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets.

responsibilities within Enron.  Replacing him will be John Novak, who will 
become General Counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal 
department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron 
Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, 
coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to 
support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce 
Lundstrom, General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect

We believe This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality

coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.
