Mark - 

Attached is the proposed language for a letter explaining the reasons to 
postpone the securitization deal.  Larry Lawyer would like to send this 
letter to the investment banks, potential investors, rating agencies and the 
deal team.  

Please review the statement and give me a call at X33242 with any comments or 
changes.  

I have also attached the final draft of the Q&A.  I appreciated all the help 
from the legal department on this document.  Shari and Janet had several 
comments that I think will be very helpful.

Thanks again

Traci
