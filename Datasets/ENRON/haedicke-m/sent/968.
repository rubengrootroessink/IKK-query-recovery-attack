Mark:

I am writing in regards to ISDA's Energy and Developing Products conference
in Houston on March 6, 2001.  I have attached a copy of the agenda for your
information.
 <<Houston speaker agenda.2001.doc>>

We are now in the process of trying to find suitable speakers for the
conference.  I know Mary Cunningham had mentioned to you about inviting a
senior person from Enron to open the conference on the Overview of Energy
and Developing Markets from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM.  We are concerned that if
Jeffrey Skilling spoke at the conference his participation would take away
our draw at the AGM in April.  We would be delighted to have you open the
conference unless you think we should invite a business speaker to give an
Overview of Energy and Developing Markets.

Should you have any questions, please call me at 212-332-2559.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Liz
