I would like to get together at the AGM.  I will ask my assistant to work on 
a time would could meet and propose that to you.  Hope things are going well.

Mark,

Remembering that we missed each other in London, will you be at the AGM in
DC? If so, shall we get together briefly? I met Mark Evans from your team in
London recently and had a useful chat about the state of the relationship
between CC and Enron. I also know that David Yeres from our NY office met
with you some time back in Houston. He will also be at the AGM and would, I
know, like to follow up on that meeting.

Best regards.

Mark
