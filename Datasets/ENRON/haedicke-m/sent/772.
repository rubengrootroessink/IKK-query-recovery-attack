Mark

There are a lot of art galleries in Sao Paulo, but I am not sure what you 
like.  The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.  Jacques' 
gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary 
Brazilian "naif" artists.  Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, 
"Brazilian" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the 
greatest African influence and a very rich culture).  Kind of funky and "out 
there,"  but I really like it.  He also has some terrific textile works by 
Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States 
(we have one of her wall hangings in our den).

Jacques' web site is at http://ardies.com/quemingl.htm.  I don't think it is 
very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.

There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk 
about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.

By the way,  I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have 
a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.  I will keep you 
posted.

Regards,
Randy
