Eric:

I have talked to Alan Aronowitz about this as well.  You need more resources 
immediately from inside.  We will also have to recruit outside to get enough 
resources as the business grows.

Regards,

Mark

Mark,

I just wanted to send you a quick note regarding the LNG legal support.  As 
we discussed several weeks ago, I am concerned that within Dan Rodgers 
current group of resources there is no one with ECT commodity transaction 
experience.  This lack of experience is very noticeable to our commercial 
team as the current legal group is on a steep learning curve and given our 
immediate deal requirements.  Dan and I spoke about this yesterday and agreed 
that he will expedite the effort to recruiting someone from within ECT.   I 
believe not only will this person help enormously within our current deal 
flow but he/she would be a great resource for the other EGM legal team 
members regarding commodity transactions.  

The main reason for this note is to enlist your help to get the right person 
into the group.  I will routinely be checking with Dan as to the progress we 
are making on this effort.  

Thanks for your help in this effort.

Eric
