Mark:  As noted in the few attached e-mails, we have been asked to give some 
general advice on municipalization to the City of Bakersfield, CA.  I assume 
that this is not an issue from a conflcit perspective, but because it 
"touches" CA I had raised it with Vicki just in case there was something that 
i was not aware of .  Could I bother you to Reply to this and just let me 
know if you see any possible problem with us doing this work?  Thanks.

It was good to catch up with you briefly on Friday.  It sure seems like 
everything is going very well for you.  With everything you have going on, 
both domestically and internationally, I appreciate your taking the time to 
get together.  I'm sure we will be speaking in the not too distant future as 
the CA developments continue to unfold over the next few weeks.

Thanks.

John

Vicki:  I assume this is not a problem from a conflict, but just wanted to
double check since it "touches" CA.  As you may know from the trade press,
a number of cities, etc. have been looking into the possibility of forming
their own muncipallly owned utilities in light of all the CA problems.
This will undoubtedly be a long and arduous process by any city that
pursues it and probably will not go anywhere, at least not in the short
term.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to check.  I assume we are still on for
this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.  Thanks.  John

John,

 As mentioned in my E-mail, I have been contacted by the City Attorney of
Bakersfield, Cal., a city of about 150,000 concerning our ability to advice
the City concerning it operating its own electric utility.  I told him that
because of our work for Enron that I would need to check whether we would
be in a position to be of assistance.

I would appreciate your thoughts.  Bakersfield is in  P G & E's service
area.

Dean
