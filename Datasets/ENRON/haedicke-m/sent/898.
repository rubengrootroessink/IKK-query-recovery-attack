Mark/Rob -

Good news is hard to come by these days in the Enron emerging market world =
so=20
I thought that I would pass this along.

We still need to work on repatriation/conversion issues to get our money ou=
t=20
but at least it sits safely in an Enron account in the meantime.

Bill Krenz worked very hard on this matter under trying circumstances.  The=
=20
head of the HEPCO negotiating team through a cup at our business guy, Don=
=20
Bunnell, and shattered a tea pot.  Shards from the pot hit Don in the face=
=20
and he had to be hospitalized.  He is apparently fine now.

No bank gty was necessary afterall.  Although it's a bit complicated, Hepco=

initiated what amounted to 8 separate wires today, 6 of which hit today, an=

two of which will hit Monday (we have chopped confirmation from the relevan=
t=20
banks that the last two wires were initiated, but it was too late in the=20
business day to get the funds today).  At day's end RMB 271 million of RMB=

341million hit today.  We'll follow up Monday for the rest, but dont=20
anticipate any problem.
