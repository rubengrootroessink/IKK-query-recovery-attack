Mark and Rob:
 
Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance
to make the playoffs.  (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be
back.)  
 
So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.  We are supposed
to respond by this Friday, March 30.
 
This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make
the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments.
The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the
Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship.
 
I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal
obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western
Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a
commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs).
 
Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.  $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.  That's
two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at
$93.00 per ticket.
 
Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per
seat, or $3,664.  I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games.
 
For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.  That's
approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4.
I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff
tickets that's fine also.
 
So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether my
ticket is Round 1 or 2.  If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for
the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.  If
the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098
for Rounds 1 and 2.
 
This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can
ask for a refund by the same means that you paid.  So what I would propose
to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the
playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my
bill if they don't make the playoffs.
 
Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th
of April.
 
So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take
a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way)
