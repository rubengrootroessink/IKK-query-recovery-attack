               Mr. Haedicke,

               My name is Shari Fleishman.  I am an attorney with Akin, Gump, 
Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., and I was referred to you 
by Charles Moore.  

               Thank you for agreeing to help us arrange interviews with 
Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford.  To give you some 
background, we are representing Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. in a breach of 
contract dispute with Central Resources, Inc. regarding losses and costs 
resulting from Central's alleged default of its obligations under the terms 
of natural gas and crude oil swap and swaption transactions.  Statoil alleges 
that Central did not provide the credit assurances required once it exceeded 
its credit limit, so Statoil terminated the transactions.  During 
negotiations, however, prior to termination, Central and Statoil were 
negotiating with Enron regarding a possible assignment of the transactions to 
Enron.  This was not consummated, but we would be inquiring into the 
circumstances surrounding the proposed assignment.  We would like to 
interview Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford regarding these 
discussions concerning the potential assignment, in o!
rder to evaluate whether there is any need to depose either of these 
individuals.  

               Please let me know if you need anything further, and again, I 
appreciate your cooperation in arranging these interviews.  You can call me 
at 202-887-4387, or e-mail me, to discuss arrangements.  Thank you for your 
help.
