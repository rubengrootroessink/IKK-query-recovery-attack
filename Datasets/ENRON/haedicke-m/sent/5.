Alan, please handle and respond directly to Rick.  It looks like it would be 
a good opportunity for ECT to speak.  Mark

Mark,

Would any of your colleagues be interested in speaking in Singapore in
September on the Global Energy Derivatives Market (see the attached
invitation).  None of the ISDA staff can speak at this conference because
our September Board meeting will be held the same week.

Rick
