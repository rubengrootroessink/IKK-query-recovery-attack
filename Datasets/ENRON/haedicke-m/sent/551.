In a moment of weakness I agreed to divide up the tickets.   I will divide
the tickets up in a manner that is absolutely perfect and totally equitable.

Please let me know if you know of any particular time or times when, for
example, you'll be on vacation or otherwise absent where you would prefer
not to be assigned games.  In addition, I am assuming that both of you would
prefer weekends to week nights (let me know if that's not the case).  And
let me know if you have any other scheduling issues.

Also, the third exhibition game is this Saturday night against the Spurs.  I
believe each of you said you couldn't make it.  I'll plan to give them away
unless you will be able to use them.  I need to know by tomorrow, however.

Here's the regular season schedule, and I will also be glad to take into
account your preferences on particular games if you'll send me an email
indicating the games you'd like. (or print this out, check games you'd like
and fax it to me at 512/236-3210).
