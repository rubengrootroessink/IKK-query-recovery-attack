Mark-

Thanks for the opportunity to see the game last night.  I had a great time.  
I hope I have the opportunity to return the favor some time.

How about the Presidential election!  

With regard to the Consulting Services Agreement to be signed by John 
Lavorato, please inform me as to when you would like me to drop by to discuss.

Thanks,

John
