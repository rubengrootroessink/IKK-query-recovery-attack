Mark:

A concern has been raised about IT service providers working on EOL or other 
Enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor, such as Dynegy.
Since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies, 
it seems like this is a significant issue.  How do we address this risk in 
the contracts?
Do we need to add a non-competition clause?
