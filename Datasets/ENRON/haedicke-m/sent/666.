Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and 
NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society 
and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free 
to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is 
aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well.  

 As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that 
his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, 
and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity 
and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of 
Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).
