To All -

Thanks again for the participation in this project.  I believe we made some 
progress yesterday on the overall look and feel of the site. 

Meeting Notes:

Mark - Presented ideas for the look and feel of the web site based on law 
firm web sites and intra-Enron sites.  I will continue to pursue work with 
the IT group on the design and implementation of the site.

Michelle - Reported on her progress with the ENA PR group on a name.  
click.legal or click.law seem to be the favorite addresses; however, 
"legalmatters.enron" was also suggested.  Michelle will continue to work with 
the ENA PR group to develop a name, possible logo and slogan/tag-line 
consistent with the Enron vision statement.

Janette - Reported on the status of the organization chart information to be 
used on the site.  Indicated she is still waiting for responses from several 
of the groups for the "who are we" paragraph.  She is also making progress on 
matching the org. chart to the individual legal team members.  Work on this 
project will continue.

Ed/James - Both reported on the status of link identification.  Discussion 
took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with 
the links and those links that will be useful to the Department, realizing 
that few clients will actual access our site for links.  Work on a listing of 
categories and sites for these categories will continue.


General Information:

Subsequent to our meeting, I met with our designated IT project coordinator - 
Tamika Hebert.  We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we 
want in the site.  Unfortunately, John Reese, our IT designer, was out of the 
office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date.  I hope 
to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available 
to everyone for comment.  I also provided Tamika with references to some of 
the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of 
the look, feel and functionality we want.

Concerning actual development of the background structure, the "programmer" 
has not been identified for this project, but should be by the end of this 
week.  Once he/she is identified, work will begin on the design of the 
functionality of the site.  Concurrent with this effort, it is necessary that 
we start providing content to Tamika so that site areas can be tested and 
reviewed.  Accordingly, once information is available in your respective 
areas, please provide it to me or forward it directly to Tamika.

Reminder - Please remember to note that we have moved the time of the meeting 
from 2:00 to 2:30.  Our next meeting will be next Wednesday, November 1 in 
EB38C2.

Thanks again for the hard work.
