Mark:

As you may recall, I interviewed with you in the fall of 1997.  I ended up
accepting an offer from Koch before going through the last round of
interviews (4th)  with Enron.

Over the past 2+ years, I have been the only power attorney at Koch.  Among
other functions, I have supported the power trading operations, the power
project development operations, and Koch's retail power accounts.  The work
has been challenging, exhilarating and at times overwhelming from a work
load perspective.  I truly love my job.  While I cannot complain about the
job experience, Koch as a company leaves much to be desired.

I would love to work for such an innovative company as Enron; your company
sets the standard in our industry.  I would love to talk to you about any
potential employment opportunities with Enron.  Please contact me if you
think I could bring value to you and Enron.

Sincerely,

Tim Beverick, Attorney
Koch Legal Services - Houston
