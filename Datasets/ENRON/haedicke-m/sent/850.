As I mentioned DEY representatives will be in Houston March 19/20 and wanted 
to meet with you and Jim Derrick.  Jim is not available, but they were 
wondering if they could meet with you.  Given Jim's position on these types 
of firms, Jim's unavailability, and your schedule do you have any interest in 
meeting with them?  Peter.
