I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about 
joining ISDA.  He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.  He is 
familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.  I told him he 
would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive 
Committee.  I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.  Please give him a call 
at 011-551-1-2322100.  I think he could help build membership in ISDA in 
Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.  He goes 
by Emilio.  I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.  Let  me know if you have 
any questions.

Regards,

Mark
