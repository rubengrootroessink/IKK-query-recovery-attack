Mark:
    Following up on the suggestion from Al Alexanderson that you were
expecting "a phone call and a resume" from me, I am sending you my resume as
a Word document attachment to this note. I presume that you are in fact
looking for a lawyer as Al described.  I'm not going to go into any detail in
this note, but if you are looking, we should talk.  I have extensive
experience in both transactional and regulatory aspects of energy practice.
As Sr. VP and deputy general counsel at an energy development company, I did
project development work, including turnkey project sales and power purchase
arrangements.  In private practice, I represented some end users, but mostly
utilities, in power purchases, transmission arrangements, project
development, joint ventures, and all of the other business relationships and
transactions that have been used as the industry has evolved from the
regulatory model to the market model.  I am assuming from Al's description
that you are looking for someone for Portland, Oregon, but Al said he wasn't
sure of the location.  Tell me what you are looking for, and I'll give you an
honest assessment of whether I think I would be a good prospect for filling
that need.
