Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is 
available to discuss the attached.

Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background 
information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more 
efficient.

I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm 
experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a 
reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial 
experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was 
able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.  
If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an 
out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said 
the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any 
candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is 
Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax.

A couple of points:

Strengths:

(a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is 
a highly regarded commercial associate.

(b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial 
associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary 
came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.

(c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a 
number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think 
he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the 
atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.

(d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary 
clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal 
lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent 
reviews.

(e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in 
the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable 
schools in Canada.

(f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.

(g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably 
impressed.

Issues:

(a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career 
has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous 
experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.  
Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After 
graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest 
in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor 
boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out 
Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a 
position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod 
Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established 
their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with 
his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then 
be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).

(b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, 
especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova 
for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project 
organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, 
commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment 
to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and 
natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, 
he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.

(c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer 
(as opposed to retaining counse)?

I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in 
Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), 
or look to other alternatives.

Peter.
