Mark: Travis and I have been meeting fairly regularly.  I would enjoy 
attending your staff meetings but have a conflict with Andy's.  Let's see if 
Travis and I can firm something up for now through the end of the year to 
ensure "real time" communications regarding dealflow.  We intend to meet 
later today around 5pm.

Jordan
