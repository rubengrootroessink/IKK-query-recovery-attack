Attached is our first draft of a comment letter on the CFTC's Regulatory 
Reinvention proposal.  The comment letter must be submitted to the CFTC by 
next Monday, August 7.  I would appreciate your comments by COB this 
Wednesday, August 2.  Of course, I am available to discuss the draft as 
well.  At this point, I do  not think we need to have a conference call on 
this and we can just coordinate and assemble the comments.  If others feel 
differently, please let me know.
