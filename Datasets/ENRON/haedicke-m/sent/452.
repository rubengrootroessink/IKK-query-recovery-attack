Well done!  Please send a copy of the plan to the OGC and work with Janette 
to schedule a meeting of the OGC to review the plan and get buy-in across the 
group.  Let's schedule the meeting for 1and 1/2 hours.  I would like you in 
the mean time to focus on a time line to implement the program.  Also, please 
set up a meeting for you and me with Phillippe Bibi to discuss getting help 
from IT to implement our plan.

Mark
