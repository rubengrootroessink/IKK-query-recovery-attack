Does Matt have time to do all the LNG work?  My guess is that he may have the 
time.  Mark

FYI. This will greatly impact Matt's workload and availability for potential 
EBS activities. I would like to visit with you about this.

Alan,

As we discussed the other day, I'm forwarding my "work list" of projects 
either currently or soon to be underway that will be led by V V Rao's team 
out of Singapore (with support from Dubai and Houston):

1. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG "Wedge Quantities" bid.  Proposal for 
mid-term, firm (but declining over time) LNG supply for merchant trading 
activities prepared and being sent to NWS next week.  Preparation and 
negotiations of SPA, transportation and marketing contracts to follow.

2. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- 
draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to 
follow.

3. Indonesia -- PERTAMINA Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared 
and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to follow.

4. Japan -- Osaka Gas Co. Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared 
and sent to counterparty.  Expect responsive comments next week.  
Negotiations to follow.

5. Malaysia/Spain -- LNG fuel supply for Enron's Arcos IPP in Spain -- 
initial term sheet under development.  Expect this one to heat up in the next 
few months.

6. Malaysia -- Malaysia LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft 
prepared and will be sent to counterparty later in the month.  Negotiations 
to follow.

7. Malaysia -- "Bintulu Hub" e-commerce venture with Malaysia LNG, Malaysia 
Int'l. Trading Co., Enron LNG Marketing and Enron Networks -- under 
development.  Legal needs will depend somewhat on final deal format.  Goal is 
to be set up for LNG commodity and LNG transportation capacity e-trading 
(possibly on a Deal Bench auction site platform) by year-end.  May expand to 
cover crude oil commodity and transportation capacity trading as well 
following recent meetings in London.

8. Japan -- LNG Receiving Terminal & gas and power marketing joint 
development project with Enron LNG Marketing LLC, BHP and EnCom.  Initial 
draft of joint development MOU prepared.  Negotiations to follow.

9. Korea -- KOGAS Winter Cargo Supply & Transportation Opportunities -- under 
develoopment.  Various MOU drafts have been exchanged, but deal structure and 
timing keep moving around.  Legal needs will ultimately depend somewhat on 
final deal format. 

10. Master LNG Vessel Transportation Capacity Access/Trading Agreements -- 
under early development, but should accelerate to match pace of no. 7 above.  
Document will then be used to propose access to numerous other LNG vessel 
owners/charterers who may wish to participate with Enron in making a market 
for spare transportation capacity.  Initial draft underway in Houston, but 
may be handed off to Singapore at some point.

As you can see, there's presently quite a lot of activity being undertaken 
from Singapore.  Much of this has arisen since the beginning of this year.  
Nancy and I have been involved in preparing initial drafts, providing 
comments, etc. from Houston (and occasional fly-in appearances)  and V V 
presently has on-the-ground legal support from an excellent Linklaters Team 
based in Singapore.  Matt Lee has now circled with V V's team and is 
undergoing both intensive commercial LNG training and intensive LNG trading 
contract training.  I suspect that on average this year, we could easily use 
70-100% of  Matt Lee's time (depending on how the above activities progress).

Kind regards,
Dan
