Mark,

In a week or so Enron Global Exploration & Production will make a pitch to 
Korea National Oil Corporation amounting to a comprehensive proposal to 
provide various oil- and gas-field services to KNOC, plus offer the 
opportunity to provide financing, risk management and other Enron-type 
things.  (Our dealings with KNOC are so far highly confidential.)

Cedric Burgher, the CFO of Enron Global E&P, has, in the message below, 
sought my help with language to make the financing pitch as strong as 
possible but at the same time not binding on Enron.

Can you look at this and offer any comments or suggestions, or have someone 
in the legal group of ENA respond?  I would really appreciate it.

Thanks.
Stephen Wallace.

Stephen,

As we discussed, it would be helpful to contact an attorney in ENA to lift 
"invester banker" like language to insert in our initial term sheet for 
KNOC.  The following is an approximation of what I have in mind.

"If desired by KNOC and subject to prevailing market conditions, Enron will 
use its best efforts to structure, advise, arrange, underwrite, syndicate, 
and/or provide the capital necessary to complete the project."

I'm sure the ENA guys have better language than this from some of their pitch 
books, but hopefully you see what I'm looking for with my first cut.  From a 
marketing perspective, we would like this to be as strong and attractive as 
possible from a KNOC perspective, and still provide us outs to make the 
"offer" non-binding.

Cedric
