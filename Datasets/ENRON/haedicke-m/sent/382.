Alan,

Here's a good start on the list of the most likely of the telecom guys to be 
transacting under the Master (or who have already transacted).  With that, 
I'd say that ISDA should initially target this group in its membership.  (You 
asked for 10, but I thought of 12 -- you can cut two if you like.)

GENUiTY
Broadwing
MCI WorldCom
Level (3)
Global Crossing
360networks
Touch America (Montana Power -- might already understand ISDA from power 
trading side)
Cable & Wireless
Universal Access
AT&T
Teleglobe
Qwest

Good to hear from you, and keep in touch!  Things are really moving up here, 
and we couldn't have done it without all your help and guidance.

Let me know if I can help with anything else.

Best regards,
Jay
