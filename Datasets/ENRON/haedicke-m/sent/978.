Great questions!  It is fine with me if you would like to distribute them.  I 
may cover some in the floor talk.  Thanks for the help.  Mark

Mark,
 
Attached are a few questions that you might like to have asked and have a 
prepared answer for, to assist in your Floor Meeting.
 
As a suggestion you might want to allocate these questions, or any others to 
be asked to your direct reports at your regular meeting on Monday and where 
necessary they can provide you with any particular details to give as full an 
answer as you would like. Janette could possibly ask question numbered 1.
 
Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do. I will of course be 
happy to ask any question, provided you have had the opportunity to prepare 
an answer.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus


1.When will EWS Legal Department be moving to the new building and where will 
we be located? 

2.Will all attorneys have an office?

3.While we expect all areas of the EWS business to grow, which areas , over 
the next 6-12 months, do you believe will grow the fastest and require the 
greatest support from the EWS Legal Department?

4.With the bankruptcy of PG&E what were we able to do using our existing 
contracts to mitigate our exposure?

5.Are there any changes that you believe we will need to make to our 
contracts or any new contracts we will need to consider entering into with 
counterparties to assist us in managing our risk in the event of future 
bankruptcies?
 
6. Are you able to tell us what we estimate financial our exposure is to PG&E 
as a result of their bankruptcy?

7.Why is Enron winding down its power trading operations in Japan?
