The previously sent request may be an oversight, or you may be busy  with 
other things, but because we have a deadline for the PUHCA filing with the 
SEC, we are sending a reminder to you that we would like to have the 
information for your respective areas as soon as possible.  Please refer to 
the memo from Robert Eickenroht dated March 29, 2001.

If you should have any questions, please contact Robert at 713-853-3155 or 
myself at 713-853-7014. We appreciate your help on this project.
