Jim:

Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo:

Global Trading --  All lawyers providing legal services for trading 
activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one 
group reporting to Mark Haedicke.

Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to 
categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books".  To that end, Mark 
will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his 
designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company. 
The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a 
consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks 
day to day.  It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report 
will be prepared for Enron.
