Bob:

I think Enron is more  likely to use the intranet service.  I was unclear 
however, if additional service was available in the internet service, such as 
links to the explanatory books?  I think generally we would want the 
convenience of having the ISDA materials inside for use by any Enron 
employee.  If the cost gets too high, I don't think members will pay for it.  
$10,000 sounds ok to me.

Regards,

Mark
