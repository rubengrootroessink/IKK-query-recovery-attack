I am responding on behalf of Mark Haedicke.  We have checked with our 
department and our lawyers are not aware of any such contracts as you 
described in your e-mail. 

Barbara Gray responded, "I am unaware of any subcontracts for this period.  I 
do know that we have used minority lawyers, but that does not appear to be 
responsive to the question."

Thank you.
