Mark, attached is the draft of the email to the deal team (with copies to you 
and Dave D)



[Distribution]

Prior to the equity investment in and joint venture with Power Systems 
Manufacturing ("PSM"), we will need to take the following actions:


+ Conduct additional due diligence on the PSM/General Electric ("GE") lawsuit 
regarding infringement of GE patents.  We will need to determine if the 
litigation will affect the viability of PSM as the operator or ENA as owner 
of the equipment involved in the litigation.  This will commence immediately 
and a brief legal opinion obtained on these points.

+Conduct legal patent due diligence on the mobile power units that are the 
subject of the proposed joint venture and obtain legal opinions with respect 
to both the component parts being acquired and the proposed modified  units 
themselves.  [Timing]
