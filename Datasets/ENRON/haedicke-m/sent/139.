Dear Mark,

We, at IBJ, started working on developing Japanese language confirms of
weather- and energy derivatives. We would like to make them as identical
to the standard document adopted by the market makers like yourselves as
possible.

I would appreciate if you could bring some of your standard form
confirms with you to London, although most of them would look exotic
enough to our traders.

Thank you in advance and see you next week.

Regards

Terry
