Stu,
I am sure you will be aware from your market intelligence of the problems at 
FF
Unit 2, which we are advised is an event of Force Majeur. I believe it would 
be
counter-productive to the spirit of current negotiations to prosecute an FM
claim and do not therefore propose to do so at this time. However, in the 
event
of an unsatisfactory outcome to these negotiations we do reserve the right to
ultimately pursue a Force Majeur claim in respect of the failure of FF Unit 2.
I am also holding back FF's claim for mill damage from the rogue cargo of hard
La Loma coal on the same principle.
Please respond if you disagree with this approach.
Regards
Max
