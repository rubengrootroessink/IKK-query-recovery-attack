Larry:

On the resume, only one comment.  I would split out Community Affiliations or 
just delete it.  I will give the resume to a friend of my in HR and ask where 
he thinks the best fit would be in Enron.  Do you want me to e-mail your 
resume to a few people I know in other businesses? If yes, please send again 
without the note to me.  

Mark
