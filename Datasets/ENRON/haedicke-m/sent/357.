accomodations in Frankfurt:
Should anybody plan for staying on for a couple of days, we would be

commuter=01%s traffic towards Frankfurt in the morning. Closest is the
"Sheraton" (walking distance), also close is the "Steigenberger Airport
hotel" (shuttle bus). Happy to do the bookings at any hotel.
