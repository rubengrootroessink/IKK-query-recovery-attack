		 Subject: Supreme Court Grants TGS Injunction Against Rio Negro

Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court 
granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the 
Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently 
rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with 
penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had 
ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection 
proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an 
injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 
million which was unprecedented.

Dodged another bullet!
Cheers!
Michelle
