As you know, Donahue E&Y has been doing work for us lately, so far on the 
retail, regulatory, and general corporate fronts.  I also believe they have 
the ability to work for us in a broader capacity.  E&Y is generally among the 
best situated for the coming deregulated power market.  E&Y set up many of 
our systems in Toronto and Donahue E&Y is currently assisting us on the 
wholesale side with Ontario Energy Finance Corporation (one of the 
deregulation off-shoots of Ontario Hydro) on finalizing the NUG management 
arrangement.  They are also very strong on tax, and may be able to assist 
non-ECC business units (i.e. Global Markets and EES) in Canadian 
initiatives.  Representatives of their firm are considering a trip to Houston 
in the Spring and asked me if they could visit with you and others within 
Enron in Houston.  I told them that we would be pleased, once the timing is 
right.  Once they have a date I will let you know to see if we can set 
something up. Peter.
