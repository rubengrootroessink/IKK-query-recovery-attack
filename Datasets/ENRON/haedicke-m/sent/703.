My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following:

1.    EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry 
development of the first master power contract.  The form is rapidly becoming 
the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically 
lowering costs and increasing liquidity.  In October, we put an EEI into 
place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 
less than under the prior contract.

2.    New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system 
which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to 
determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal 
risks.

3.    EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training 
regarding all major EWS legal issues.  This website will reduce training 
costs and increase availability of training to all employees.  

4.    Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and 
structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com, 
insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia.

5.     Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably 
including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA.

6.    Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal 
issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas 
Cogen II, Pastoria, sale of the Peakers, sale of HPL, Electrobolt, JV with 
Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power, 
QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets) 
and on and on. 

7.    Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition 
and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to 
significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business.  

8.    Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the 
underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across 
Enron.
