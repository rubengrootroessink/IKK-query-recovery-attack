Rick:

As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation 
on electronic signatures.  There is a big need to standardize the approach 
with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.  I 
think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly make 
money through a protocol.  Let me know what you think.
