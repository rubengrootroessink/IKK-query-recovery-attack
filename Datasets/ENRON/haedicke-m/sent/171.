There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, 
Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to 
talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might 
propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for 
energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other 
companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for 
transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably 
discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.

What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
Should legal counsel be in attendance?
Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?
