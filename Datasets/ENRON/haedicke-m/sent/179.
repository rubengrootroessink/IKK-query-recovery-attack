Seth:

There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of 
the office.  You should find out that person's name and try to meet with that 
person in Japan as soon as you can.  I think Enron should try to steer one of 
the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way.  I am 
not sure what committtee that would be at this point.  I think you should 
have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the 
board level.  

Let's keep comparing notes.

Regards,

Mark
