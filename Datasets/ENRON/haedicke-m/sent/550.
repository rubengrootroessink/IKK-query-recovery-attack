Rob,

I would like to visit with you on staffing your upcoming 4th Quarter legal 
needs.  I understand that Enron North America may be looking for additional 
outside counsel to help document a number of production payments currently 
under negotiation.  Haynes and Boone has an energy finance team with 
expertise in oil and gas, tax, derivatives and energy finance that is ready 
to help. 

I would like your advice on how Haynes and Boone can best approach your 
production payment group. Please give me a call.
