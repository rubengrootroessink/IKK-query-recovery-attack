Mark,

As a practical matter, I believe that it will be difficult to maintain an 
updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis.  That 
conceivably could be someone's full-time job, given the vast amount of 
confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS.  

I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how 
Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade 
secrets).  Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel, 
I would suggest that Pete, Scott Tholan, the IT security team, internal 
corporate security, as well as legal subject matter experts get together to 
put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected.  
Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the 
corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material.  
For example, trading positions and curves would have one standard for access 
and disclosure, while personnel information would have a different one.  The 
benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a 
periodic basis to make sure that they are followed, rather than create 
updated inventories.  

It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.  I would not view this 
type of approach as requiring much, if any, assistance from outside counsel.

Let me know your thoughts.

Michelle

  Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our 
trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have 
visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing 
your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K 
committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general 
instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine 
what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting 
our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  
Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared 
proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to 
a specific operating group.
 
  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition 
agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know 
basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.  

  Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in 
agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you 
agree so we can get the project off the ground.
