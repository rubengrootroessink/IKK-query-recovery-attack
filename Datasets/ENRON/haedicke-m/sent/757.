Mark - Enron Canada is on the verge of entering into a 3 year fixed price 48 
MW power sale to Ivaco Rolling Mills Limited Partnership and Ivaco Inc.  The 
sale is a back to back transaction with the British Energy supply source.  
The electricity purchase agreement is based off of the industrial one-off 
form that was developed to do back to back deals with the British Energy 
supply source.  That form has been approved by Peter Keohane and previously 
reviewed by Elizabeth Sager.  A copy of the Ivaco agreement is attached.  If 
you would like further information about this transaction please let me know.

Regards
CJG
