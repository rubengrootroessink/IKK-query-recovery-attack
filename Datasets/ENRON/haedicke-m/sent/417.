Paul:

We do Sales Practices training which gets into some of what your are 
suggesting.  I think it is a good idea to take it further with a list of 
"don'ts".  We can get you are training materials.  We are in the process of 
uploading all training materials including videos into various websites.

		 Subject: Taped Lines

John and Michael would like to put together training for London-based traders 
on the "dos and don'ts" of using recorded telephone lines - As part of this 
we're listening to tapes to pick up on some "don'ts" (eg racist comments, 
harrassment, breach of SFA rules etc) which we can possibly use as case 
studies (you'll be pleased to hear that so far we haven't found anything of 
this nature!).

Have you given any training on this subject to traders in Houston?  Any 
materials you may have used or thoughts you have on this would be very much 
appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

Paul
