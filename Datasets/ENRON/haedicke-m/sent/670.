We were unable to convince Morgan Stanley's counsel to provide the Affidavit 
in support of our position by the noon deadline today.  He said that although 
the traders were OK, he needed to track down internal approvals over the next 
few days.  Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful 
to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.  We 
would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him 
to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is 
a good likelihood he would do so).  As mentioned it would be very helpful if 
we weren't the only party advocating the need for a comprehensive index 
before the judge.  Accordingly, if you have any residual pressure to bear on 
MS, it would be greatly appreciated.

Peter.
