Louise:

Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most 
significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers 
to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes 
sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk 
about what are the objectives.  Great question!

Subject: CACs Forms

We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no 
approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is 
not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really 
do not provide full authorization.

There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented:

(i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed 
under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the 
contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included 
need to go through the process outlined below.

(ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal 
team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie 
signed) by the following Enron staff.

Trader/Originator ________________________________
Head of Group (VP or above)______________________
Credit__________________________________________
Legal__________________________________________
Tech Services (where applicable)__________________
Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________

A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be 
maintained by Legal.

Thoughts please?
