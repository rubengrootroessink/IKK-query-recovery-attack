Michael:

I think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of ISDAs we have 
as a way of focusing attention on our progress.  I think it may be a good 
idea to get a paralegal secondee from A&O or Linklaiters.  That secondee 
could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm.
