Alison:

I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should 
discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy 
documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.  This 
is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!  I will copy Paul 
and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members.  
Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.
