Kristin:
Kevin is very concerned with this charge.  Why is litigation now being billed 
up front?  Why is there a 50% increase in corporate legal?  Why is there a 
100% increase in corporate secretary?  Why are we billed for the library when 
we use primarily electronic sources?  Could you please work on the answers to 
these questions and get back to me.

Mark
