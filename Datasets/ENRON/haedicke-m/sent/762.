Dad:

The name I have is Dr. Vinberg.  He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 
80s.  I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good.  He recommended 
that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if 
it is productive.  His number is 713-622-1441.  He charges $150 per hour and 
I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston.  
Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you.  If he is, I will propose 
dates and we can see if they work for everyone. 

Love,  

Mark
