The lawyers had a kick-off meeting today.  Vicki and I echoed your point on 
not shutting down the business.   We have a great team assembled and I think 
it will calm down the traders in EWS.  I will keep you posted.

Mark, I appreciate your help in these matters.  We need to be accurate and 
manage our risk but we can't "land the plane" or kill current and future deal 
velocity in the process.  Let me know how I can help.

Thanks much
Dave

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged
