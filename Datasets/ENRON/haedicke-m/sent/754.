Mark;

Randy Young suggested that I send you an update regarding the above captioned 
deal.  This is a total energy management services deal where Enron Argentina 
is currently providing billing services to Azurix Argentina.  The TEM 
Agreement was executed on August 25, 2000.  The contract term is 3 years and 
the NPV is approximately US$900,000.

Azurix Argentina is facing a very difficult situation arising from its Buenos 
Aires Province water concession agreement.  Over the past few days, local 
newspapers have informed that Mr. Carlos Ruckauf, the BA Governor, has called 
a local congress extraordinary session "to consider the early termination of 
Azurix water concession agreement" (sic).  The BA Province is claiming that 
Azurix did not fulfill the contracted investments.  In case the Azurix 
concession is revoked, our agreement will also be terminated.

Rgds,

Sami
