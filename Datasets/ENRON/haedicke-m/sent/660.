The  person I had in mind was Fransisco Pinto-Lite.  He is unwinding from his 
old obligations.  I will work on an update.   Mark

Mark, I am concerned that although assistance has been previously (prior to 
the latest reorg) represented to Peggy as forthcoming, it has not yet 
arrived.  We left our QLMeeting without a definite plan.....as I recall, 
because we thought there might be an individual with one of the "disbanding 
units" available "in the near future.  I am concerned  (based on some very 
tenuous third hand information) that Peggy may already be looking 
elsewhere...........I have told her that finding help for the Mexico work was 
on the very top of our agenda.....I would like to be able to inform her of 
what exactly we are doing to handle this situation................can you let 
me know what the status is of the individual referred to above.

Many thanks

BNG
