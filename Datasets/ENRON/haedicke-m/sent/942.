Mary:

I would like to discuss seminars in Europe to further promote the isda form 
among energy companies on the continent.  Please give me a ring at your 
convenience.
 
Regards,

Mark

Mark,

Enron Europe's experience is that there is some resistance to ISDA 
documentation in most of the European countries in which we are active. Our 
list of countries which we feel would benefit from promotional sessions 
arranged by ISDA is as follows. The countries are in order ranked by Enron 
Europe's view of the significance of the market in each country and where 
ISDA resistance is strongest. Most significant market and most resistance 
ranked at the top of the list for both Europe and the Far East: 

Europe
Germany
Switzerland
Austria
Spain
Nordic countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland
Netherlands
Italy
France
Poland
Czech Republic
Hungary

Far East
Singapore
Japan
Hong Kong


Thanks



     Mark
