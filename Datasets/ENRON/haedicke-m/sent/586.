Mark, on reflection, I think that there is currently only one legal risk 
within Enron Canada that would warrant being added to the top legal risks for 
ENA, which is the Alberta Sundance "B" PPA acquired in the Alberta PPA 
auction in August, 2000.

I would suggest the description attached.

Peter
