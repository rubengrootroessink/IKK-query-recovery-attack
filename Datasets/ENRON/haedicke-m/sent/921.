Mark:  I had a request from Doug Hawes as to whether there might be a senior 
Enron commercial person in France that he could make contract with regarding 
a project he is working on (see attached e-mail).  Since I know that France 
falls within your "world," I thought you might have a good feeling for who 
Doug might be able to contact.  If you are ok with Doug making such a contact 
and you could perhaps suggest a person Doug could call, I know that Doug 
would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks, Mark.  I'm sure we will be speaking soon with everything that is 
going on.  John

John:  I know you are busy, but when you get a chance could you let me know 
if you think you could get me an introduction to the Head Enron person in 
France assuming there is one.  The reason is I am working with a very 
successful LBO firm of medium size by French standards.  The project is in 
the process of being defined, but it is essentially a web site that brings 
together a number of elements of the energy field including electricity, gas 
and petroleum.  I would like to find out what the Enron person thinks is 
available and what is not available that would be useful.  It might be that 
Enron would want to participate in some fashion eventually, but the contact 
would not be about that.  It does not matter if it is an English or a French 
speaker.  Perhaps they run their presumably modest operation out of some 
other place like London.  I would be happy to go wherever the person is.  By 
the way, did you see the article in this week's EUW that says there is going 
to be an electricity trading market in France starting in May?  Because of 
EDF's expansion ambitions elsewhere especially in Europe they are beginning 
to get serious about opening up the market here.  Regards. Doug
