I am actively pursuing have Duke Energy become an ISDA member this month.
We are very interested in supporting the effort you mentioned at the
October meeting to begin developing one universal master energy trading
form.  Please keep me informed of future meetings, to insure our active
participation as this effort develops.  Thanks.
