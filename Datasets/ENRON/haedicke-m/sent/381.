Mary:

I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.  It seems to me that we 
should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to 
join ISDA.  Let me know if I can help.

Regards,

Mark

I meant to copy you on this, but sent it before thinking.

Mark:

Last week you requested that I give you a list of about 10 counterparties 
that you would forward on to ISDA.  Please note that the listed 
counterparties came from information given to me by the documentation group.  
In any event, the list is as follows:

  1.  AEP
  2.  Aquila
  3.  Coral
  4.  Duke Energy Trading
  5.  El Paso Merchant Energy
  6.  Koch
  7.  PG&E Energy Trading
  8.  Reliant
  9.  Southern Company Energy Marketing
  10. Williams Energy

I hope this is of some help.

Jeff
