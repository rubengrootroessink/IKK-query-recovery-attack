Justin:
Thanks for the info.  Alan and I are going to work on it from this side.  It 
sure looks like we could use a lawyer in New York.  After you and Alan talk 
it through, let's agree on a plan to get the work done in NYC to make sure we 
are coordinated.   

Mark

The information I am working from shows:

Gentlemen,

Please could you tell me how many employees are located in New York - this 
would include both MG as well as Romulus employees.

Thanks

Justin
