Mark -

I reviewed the information below and the current functionality of the=20
website.  Basically, eLaw is a shopping center for legal information. =20
Currently only information related to Labor & Employment is available, but=
=20
construction efforts are focused on many other areas including Antitrust,=
=20
Corporate Securities, E-Commerce, Environmental and Intellectual Property. =
=20

Since it is a shopping center, it basically works like any other shopping=
=20
site.  You search for the information you want, whether it is an article,=
=20
legal brief or form document related to the desired topic.  Once you find=
=20
something you want, you move it to your "Briefcase" (or shopping cart) and=
=20
continue searching.  Once you have finished searching, you go to the check=
=20
out screen and, after checking out, down load the information, via e-mail, =
to=20
your computer.

As with the legal education site I have been looking at, the central questi=
on=20
is the integrity of the information.  Though it may have been developed by =
a=20
reputable source (e.g., Baker & Botts, Baker Hostetler, etc.), concerns as =
to=20
age, reliability, and specifically direct applicability, would always=20
prevail.  The information would be useful as a base or building block, but=
=20
there may be additional work to do in order to verify the information or=20
tailor it to the specific need (especially if the need has specific=20
jurisdiction requirements).

I would be more than happy to further review the product if you wanted to=
=20
pursue it.  However, as I indicated, usefulness at this time may be somewha=
t=20
limited given the limited topic areas covered.

Mark,

The Austin Ventures people in Austin who have invested in eLaw have had the=

eLaw is partnering with some of the worlds leading law firms to build=20
comprehensive databases of proprietary legal analysis and work product that=
=20
are accessible online by attorneys. =20

time: legal research and document drafting of transaction and litigation=20
oriented material.  By using material in the eLaw libraries, eLaw users can=

Would you please give me a call when you have had a chance to review.

Thanks,=20
