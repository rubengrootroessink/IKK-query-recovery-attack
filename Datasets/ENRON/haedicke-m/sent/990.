Dear Mark,

Per our conversation during the AGM, I would like to inform you that ISDA is
now committed to focus its efforts in Brazil. We are currently in the
process of organizing a small working group to further push our initiative
in that market. I would greatly appreciate it if you could refer me with
someone from your institution that would like to participate in this effort.


I look forward to having a representative from Enron participate in the
Brazilian working group.

If you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to
contact me

Best regards,
