Mark:

I write this email to discuss the Energy and Developing Products conference
in Houston on March 6th, 2001.  Attached please find a copy of the latest
agenda for your perusal.  Mark Taylor graciously helped me find speakers for
the conference.  However, I just want to confirm with you your availability
to speak on the Panel Discussion on Recent Events and the Growth of New
Products at 9:30 AM.
 <<spkeragendaEnergy.doc>>
The issues to be discussed include:  Power Price Spikes; Delivery Failures;
OPEC Production Decisions; Emissions Trading; and New and Developing
Products.  Christophe Chassard will also speak on the panel.  This is a
difficult panel to find speakers.  We have invited Steve Bunkin to join
panel and still waiting for his reply.   If he accepts then we will have
just three speakers on the panel.  Christophe said he is comfortable
speaking about OPEC production decisions and to a lesser extent power price
spikes.

Let me know if you are available to speak.  And if so, what topics on panel
you would feel comfortable discussing.

Thanks,
Liz
