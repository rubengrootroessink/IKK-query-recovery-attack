I would try talking to Jenny Rub. She can refer you to the right person.

Mark,
 Does EWS have a particular procedure for dealing with document retention 
issues asociated with litigated matters? Is there a particular IT person you 
would suggest we talk to concerning obtaining e-mails and tapes?  Thanks in 
advance.

                      Attorney-Client Privileged Communication


Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
recordings.
It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.
