I do not think so.  I think he will be at Enron until he is 65.   Mark

I think it really depends on what sort of topics they are thinking of having.
Also BTW, do you think Ken Lay is going to resign?  Everyone here seems 
pretty sure he will (so does the Japanese media).  I have heard his responses 
to this question before so I know what the official line is.

It sounds premature at this time for ISDA to put on an energy seminar in 
Japan.  Do you agree?   Mark

Enron Japan is also planning an energy conference in April / May of next year 
to promote our energy business here in Japan.  The arrangements are still 
very much at the preliminary stage so are confidential which is why I did not 
copy this email to the ISDA person.  (As you would suspect we are still some 
way off being able to use ISDA documentation for any of our energy 
transactions, which are tending to be physical transactions.)

Jane:

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Mark
