John:  I would like to go over the work your firm is doing for us.  I will 
ask my assistant to give you a call and set up a meeting.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Mark

Mark-as a result of the latest reorganization of Enron, there are a number
of projects that King & Spalding's Houston office is working on that now
fall within your area of responsibility.  I'd like to have the opportunity
to meet with you to explain what we are doing, and to bring you up to date
on the growth of our Houston office.  Would a meeting in the next week or so
fit your schedule?  My assistant (Carmen Schnur) keeps my calendar, so if
your assistant want to contact her to coordinate, that would work well.

I take this opportunity to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

Regards

John L. Keffer
King & Spalding
