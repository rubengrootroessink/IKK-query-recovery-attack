I have looked over it thoroughly and am ready to talk when you are.  I had 
thought Dan was going to set up a meeting, but maybe I was mistaken.  I am 
around and available this week so let me know what is convenient on your 
schedule.

		 Subject: Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. v. Gulf Oil Limited Partnership

We are considering instituting an arbitration on behalf of Enron Liquid 
Fuels, Inc. against Gulf Oil Limited Partnership to recover approximately 
$55,000 for due and unpaid fuel oil sales.

If you are aware of any reason legal action should not be brought against 
Gulf Oil Limited Partnership, please let me know.  My direct line is 
x5-7105.  If I do not hear from you by Tuesday, January 30, I will assume 
that you have no objection to Enron Liquid Fuels, Inc. instituting this 
arbitration.

Thanks for your assistance.
