Thanks for the chart.  Let's get together next Monday and talk through.

Randy/Sandeep:

I'm attaching a first stab at an org chart for the Enron Global Assets legal 
group.  Mark Haedicke's preliminary thought is that all international region 
attorneys will initially be put in Global Assets.  Over time, we can review 
this allocation.

I understand that some international lawyers are currently doing EBS and EES 
type work.  However, unless Vicky Sharp or Kristina Mordaunt has these 
lawyers on their respective headcounts, we need to get them included in Enron 
Wholesale.

I'm sure that the chart is not yet accurate.  I'm out of the office today and 
we did not have time to track down each lawyer's current title.  I would 
appreciate your help in this regard.  All other comments are welcome as 
well.  

Thanks for your assistance.

Bruce
