Mark -

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying "yes" or "no."
