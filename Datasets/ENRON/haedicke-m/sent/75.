This is about a trip to Brazil.  She asked me to pay the $6000 in expenses.  
Do you see any rationale to pay for this?  Mark

Mark,

 Thanks for looking into the People's to People program for me.    Instead of 
asking Cliff for full funding perhaps it would be "better received" to 
suggest 50% funding?   If it doesn't look like that would work either, would 
it be ok with Enron's policy to go on my own?

 Thanks.  (I hope that I'm not being a nuisance about this Mark, if so, just 
say the word and I'll drop it!)

 Monica
