I am taking steps to retain the lawyers we have and supplement with more 
Brazilian lawyers and lawyers in Houston.  Big challenge to get all the work 
done.

Mark,

I hope that your trip to South America was instructive.  You mentioned to me 
the week before this trip that you and I would talk about your findings and 
decisions concerning legal support for my team.  Do you still want to do it?
