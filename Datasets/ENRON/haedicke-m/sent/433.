Mark:

It never fails.  Ironically, within an hour after hitting the "Send" button 
on my prior e-mail to you, I got a call from Stephanie, Jim's assistant, 
informing me that Jim's travel schedule for the first week in September had 
changed since I had set up the appointment and so we are going to have to 
reschedule the meeting with him.  Stephanie gave me a couple of possible 
dates in late Sept. and the middle of October that I need to follow up with 
Steve and Peter on.  Once I circle back with them, I'll follow up with you to 
see what may work for you.

Since I am scheduled to have a meeting in your offices on the morning of the 
7th, I still plan to be in Houston.  Is there a chance that you and I could 
get together for lunch on the 6th or perhaps catch up for a few minutes that 
afternoon or the afternoon of the 7th?

I'll touch base with you to see what your schedule looks like.  Thanks.  John
