Re:   C.H. Guernsey & Company's Antitrust Web Links


      We at C.H. Guernsey & Company are actively engaged in providing
resources to our clients in the areas of antitrust and the deregulating
industries. To this end, we have compiled a set of web pages linking
directly to federal and state antitrust legislation and to antitrust cases
of specific interest to analysts of the markets for electricity, natural gas
and telecommunications. Since they may be useful research tools for other
analysts in the field, we are now making these pages publicly available
though our web site. The address for "C.H. Guernsey's Antitrust Links" is:

http://www.chguernsey-econ.com/antilinks.html

     We invite you and interested members of your organization to review
these materials and to comment thereon; note that other comprehensive links
pages specific to electric and natural gas deregulation are also available
