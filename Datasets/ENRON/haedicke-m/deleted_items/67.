Shell Foresees the End of the "Hydrocarbon Age"=20



By Jon T. Brock
Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence=20

[News item from Reuters] Big Oil must prepare itself for the end of the hyd=
rocarbon age as alternative energies win over consumers in coming decades, =
chairman of the world's No. 2 energy firm Royal Dutch/Shell said on Wednesd=
ay. Oil giants from the last century will have to look to their laurels if =
they are not to be unseated as motorists move toward hydrogen-powered vehic=
les, and renewable energies, such as wind or solar power emerge Shell Chair=
man Phil Watts told reporters.=20

Analysis: It seems that "Big Oil" is beginning to look at scenarios that ha=
ve alternative energy sources to oil and gas. At least two of the three "Bi=
gs" are prominently playing alternatives into their long-range planning. Br=
itish Petroleum (BP) has an aggressive campaign on alternative energy sourc=
es, while others like Exxon have continued to be focused solely on oil and =
gas.=20

Wednesday in New York, Watts spoke to reporters about Shell's scenario plan=
ning. This long-range outlook of world energy has oil shrinking from 40 per=
cent of the world's energy source to 25 percent by 2050. Oil will still be =
the leader, with gas coming in at 20 percent in 2050. However, it is still =
quite a drop.=20

From Oil to Gas=20

"One thing I am convinced of is that the next 50 years is not going to be m=
ore of the same. An energy company had better make sure it has the necessar=
y expertise and knowledge," Watts said at the launch of Shell's 'Long Term =
Energy Scenarios'. Referring to one of Shell's scenarios, Watts said, "We c=
ould see an evolutionary progression, the so-called carbon shift, from coal=
 to gas, to renewables, or possibly even to nuclear."=20

One could argue that the U.S. is already seeing the shift from coal to gas.=
 The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated that at the fore=
casted rate of electricity consumption, 1,300 new power plants will be need=
ed over the next 20 years. The majority of these plants are fueled by natur=
al gas. According to the energy profile of the U.S. released by the EIA in =
April of this year, the U.S. has proven natural-gas reserves of 167 trillio=
n cubic feet (Tcf), 3.2 percent of world reserves, and currently consumes n=
atural gas at a rate of 22.8 Tcf per year. From a long-term perspective, ho=
wever, natural gas is very limited in supply. In the United States, the rem=
aining natural gas resource is expected to be near depletion within 50 year=
s. Coal is clearly the nation's greatest resource, representing approximate=
ly 90 percent of our fossil energy reserves.=20

Calpine is certainly capitalizing on the near-term future of natural gas-fi=
red generation. They announced a purchase of 35 7FB and 11 7FA gas-fired tu=
rbines from General Electric in April of this year and 27 Siemens Westingho=
use steam turbines just last month. The purchase announcements are a part o=
f Calpine's five-year strategic plan to have 70,000 megawatts of generation=
 online by the end of 2005.=20

The U.S. imports only (net) 3.6 Tcf of natural gas, largely from Canada. Na=
tural-gas wellhead prices averaged over $6.00 per thousand cubic feet (mcf)=
 during the first quarter of 2001, up sharply from $3.62/mcf seen in 2000 a=
nd nearly triple the 1999 average price of $2.08/mcf. The price increases a=
re attributed to a decline in U.S. gas production during the 1990s because =
of low prices, the increase in demand driven by new power generation, and g=
as storage levels dropping below normal. Recently, gas prices returned to t=
he $2/mcf level after a mild summer, but NYMEX futures contracts for late 2=
002 deliveries are trading above the $3/mcf level indicating the expectatio=
n that gas prices will rise in response to the anticipated increased demand=
.=20

Canadian imports are also expected to expand substantially through 2020 res=
ulting from additional gas-fired electric power plants. This anticipated in=
creased consumption requires expansion of gas pipeline and storage capacity=
-$1.5 trillion over the next 15 years according to the National Petroleum C=
ouncil. Duke Energy certainly has recognized this trend and has capitalized=
 quickly by announcing the purchase of Westcoast Energy, Inc., a Canadian-b=
ased utility engaged primarily in natural-gas gathering, processing, transm=
ission, storage, and distribution, as well as electric power generation, in=
ternational, financial, information technology, and energy services busines=
ses.=20

From Gas to Renewables=20

According to one of Shell's scenarios, at some point we will move from gas =
to renewables. Shell lists those options as solar and wind energy and has b=
acked up its claim with a $500-million to $1-billion spending package over =
the next five years, focused primarily on-you guessed it-solar and wind. If=
 a large oil company announced that it had up to $1 billion to invest in so=
lar and wind, who would begin to show up on the radar screen? Let's take a =
quick look at a few likely candidates.=20

AstroPower, Inc.
461 Wyoming Road, Solar Park
Newark, DE 19716-2000
www.astropower.com=20
Technology: Photovoltaics
Start date: 1983


AstroPower produces a complete line of photovoltaic solar cells, solar modu=
les and complete systems packages for residential, commercial and industria=
l applications as well as turnkey power plant solutions for utilities in th=
e newly deregulated energy market. They originally received a $2.3-million =
investment from the Department of Energy (DOE) and have since IPO'd and can=
 be found on the NASDAQ at symbol APWR.=20

Big Frog Mountain
100 Cherokee Blvd., Suite 321
Chattanooga, TN 37405
www.bigfrogmountain.com=20
Technology: Alternative energy sources
Start date: 1999


Big Frog Mountain is a private company that designs and supplies renewable =
energy equipment to businesses, industry and private residences. The altern=
ative energy equipment supplies power using micro-hydro, solar panels and w=
ind turbines.=20

Bergey Windpower Co., Inc.
2001 Priestley Avenue
Norman, OK 73069
www.bergey.com=20
Technology: Wind turbines
Start date: 1979=20


Bergey Windpower is a private firm that designs and manufactures wind gener=
ators in sizes of 850, 1,500 and 10,000 watts. They claim to have seen an i=
ncrease in home wind energy systems as a result of the California energy cr=
isis.=20

Worthy of noting here is the fact that Shell competitor BP has already ente=
red into the renewable arena and has recently formed a new division known a=
s BP Solar. Based in Linthicum, Md., they produce high-efficiency silicon c=
ells and modules, custom-designed batteries, power control electronics and =
where appropriate, load equipment in the solar industry. Fueling Shell's in=
terest may be some of the recent successes that BP Solar has enjoyed.=20

In March of this year, BP Solar announced that over 400,000 residents of th=
e Philippines would benefit from a deal signed between them and the Spanish=
 and Philippine governments to bring solar power to 150 isolated villages i=
n the Philippines. Led by the Philippine Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR=
), the $48-million contract-the largest solar energy project ever-is financ=
ed by the Spanish government and will be implemented in two phases, the fir=
st scheduled to begin just last month.=20

In April of this year, BP Solar announced plans to build a solar-module ass=
embly plant in Hamlin, Lower Saxony, Germany. With a total investment in Ha=
mlin of $12 million, the plant will have an annual production capacity of 2=
0 MW and create more than 100 new jobs.=20

The Hamlin plant was soon surpassed by the announcement of an Australian fa=
cility in June. Opening in Homebush Bay in Sydney, the new plant will manuf=
acture BP's high-efficiency solar panels, bringing valuable export dollars =
to the country with over 60 percent of the panels to be exported around the=
 world. BP invested over $20 million to build the plant that is providing o=
ver 200 high tech jobs. The new facility houses all of BP Solar's Australia=
n manufacturing, design and market support facilities. Cell annual output c=
apacity will reach 25MW in 2001 and the plant has the capability for possib=
le further expansion.=20

Do Renewables Include Fuel Cells?=20

Shell also mentioned multiple scenarios under their long-range planning eff=
orts, one of which included an increase in the fuel cell industry. Accordin=
g to the fuel cell scenario, rapid growth in fuel cells-which produce elect=
ricity from hydrogen and cut harmful emissions-could shift the energy busin=
ess dramatically away from oil long before oil becomes scarce. Today's fuel=
 cells typically create hydrogen by reforming natural gas, so they do not f=
it the definition of being a renewable resource. Rather, fuel cells hold gr=
eat promise to reduce air pollution emissions when compared to combustion t=
echnologies. Fuel cells produce near-zero emissions and highly pure water w=
hen converting a hydrogen-rich source into electric energy.=20

I am impressed that two of the three largest oil producers are beginning to=
 look at their mainstay business as being limited in the long run. Radical =
changes that are possible in the energy business means that the industry pa=
rticipants which dominated the last century such as Exxon, BP and Shell can=
not afford to assume they will dominate for the next 100 years. In the word=
s of Shell Chairman Phil Watts, "that would be a very complacent view. Long=
evity in corporations is not the norm." Chairman Watts reminds me of an exe=
rcise performed in many business schools around the country today. Look at =
the New York Stock Exchange 100 years ago and try to find companies that ar=
e still in the "mix." Surprisingly, it is difficult to find many. Those tha=
t are still in existence have had to change dramatically in order to surviv=
e. IBM used to be a typewriter manufacturer. Today they are the world's lar=
gest computer company. Where will the oil companies be in 50 years? Will th=
ey still be strictly oil and gas? If Watts executes his scenario plans, not=
 a chance.=20
