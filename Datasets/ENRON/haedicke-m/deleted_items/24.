Mark,
Nothing particularly new to report this week on Cuiaba.  GT12 should be commissioned on gas in early November and GT11 repaired and finally commissioned by year end.  Still only verbal commitments from the insurer, but coverage looks good.  We may have some issues on recovery of legal costs.   No more news from Furnas, but the team continues to work with the Brazilian gov't to get these issues resolved.  Pete does not want to send Notice of Dispute letters to Furnas at this time.  We continue to prepare for the Shell mediation in Toronto set for November 5-7. 

On Elektro, the tariff pass through suits are finalized and will be filed today.  The suit to protect our assets prior to the Annex V set off will be filed this week.  We hope to have the information from ASMAE to conduct our calculations around Oct. 24th.  If there are any delays,  we will file an injunction compelling the information.

Regards,
      Michelle
