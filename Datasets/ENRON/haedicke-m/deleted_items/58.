After last night's US and Great Britain retaliation against Taliban and Bin Laden forces, I am extremely concerned about travelling to Houston at this point in time.

Houston is not only George W's hometown are but it is also one of the US cities with a very large community of muslims.  Hope not, but it could certainly be one of the next targets for terrorists attacks.

Unfortunately, I've already suffered NYC immigration problems in the 90's during the Gulf War and would rather not face it again.  You have no idea what is like to be questioned by immigration officers, take your clothes off in a small office, and have your luggage carefully searched.  Syrian name, Italian passport, Brazilian residence ...  To me, today's situation is a lot more complicated than the Gulf War.

Thank you in advance for understanding my personal decision of not travelling to Houston for the seminar.

Regards,

Sami

I spoke with Mark Haedicke today regarding the recent developments in Afganistan.  He advised that there is no Enron prohibition or advisory regarding travel to Houston for the off-site for our group, but he is leaving the decision up to each individual, based on comfort level and personal considerations.

I have decided to travel, but wanted to advise you of my conversation with Mark.

Regards,

Vicky
