FERC Chairman Wood Ups the Ante on RTO Formations,
Outlines Long-Term Objectives for Industry=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[News item from Reuters] The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=
ission (FERC) said that all U.S. utilities must submit plans to the agency =
by Dec. 15 for joining regional transmission organizations (RTOs) or the fi=
rms and their affiliates would no longer be able to sell electricity in the=
 wholesale market at market-based rates. Merger approvals for transmission-=
owning utilities that do not join an RTO might also be restricted. FERC Cha=
irman Pat Wood, speaking at an agency meeting, said he believed there shoul=
d be four RTOs nationwide: one each covering the Northeast, Southeast, Midw=
est, and Western markets. "To me at this point, the four RTOs is a good pla=
ce to land," Wood said. Each RTO would oversee a region's electric grid to =
ensure all power suppliers had fair and equal access to transmission lines.=
 In addition to the aggressive timetable for RTO formation, Wood also outli=
ned several priorities that are included in FERC's long-term agenda, includ=
ing steps to reduce market manipulation and improve the industry's infrastr=
ucture.=20

Analysis: In the transition from the former FERC under the leadership of Cu=
rt H?bert to current chairman Pat Wood, it has often been projected that th=
e new commission would become more interventionist and carry a "big stick" =
to force utilities to comply with federal requirements. Clearly, this new d=
eclaration from Chairman Wood, in his first substantial motion since becomi=
ng FERC's leader last month, demonstrates just how commanding that stick ma=
y become, along with the commission's unwavering commitment to the implemen=
tation of its comprehensive RTO plans. Quite unlike his predecessor, who so=
ught to reduce the extent to which FERC would regulate, through his develop=
ing agenda Wood reportedly seeks to heighten the commission's role to the l=
evel of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commis=
sion. In other words, Wood wants FERC to create policy for the energy indus=
try and then aggressively implement it, with RTOs being at the top of the l=
ist.=20

The difference of FERC's new approach to RTOs (i.e., comparing Wood to H?be=
rt) cannot be overstated. For the last several years, FERC has been regular=
ly criticized for developing a policy toward RTOs that on paper called for =
voluntary participation by the nation's transmission-owning utilities. Wood=
 is carving out a vastly different approach that ups the ante for RTO parti=
cipation and affixes stiff penalties for those utilities that fail to compl=
y. The new motion makes Wood's position very clear: utilities that own tran=
smission assets must agree to turn those assets over to an RTO by Dec. 15 o=
f this year-just over two months from now-or lose their authority to sell w=
holesale electricity at market rates. In addition, Wood has said that FERC =
should condition subsequent merger approvals on whether or not a transmissi=
on-owning utility has complied with the commission's RTO order. Interesting=
ly, Wood maintains that FERC's evolving position on RTOs still calls for "v=
oluntary" participation among utilities. However, the new chairman clearly =
states that if utilities don't join RTOs, they won't have access to the ben=
efits of competitive markets.=20

It is important to note that Wood acknowledges that the actual transfer of =
utility transmission assets may not occur for several years. The new motion=
 from Wood calls only for utilities' agreements and specific plans to trans=
fer their transmission assets by Dec. 15. This proposal changes an earlier =
FERC order that preceded Wood in which the commission called for RTOs to ac=
tually become operational by Dec. 15, which the commission now apparently r=
ealizes is not feasible.=20

This "big stick" that FERC is now hanging over utilities does offer some be=
nefits as well, as Wood has been quick to reiterate. For instance, FERC has=
 already offered utilities higher regulated rates of return for transmissio=
n assets under RTO control. In addition, by turning the transmission assets=
 over to an RTO, utilities will be removed from state regulatory oversight =
of the assets. Of course, it is important to note that states still control=
 retail rates, which sets up many potential conflicts between federal and s=
tate regulatory policies. There is also a separate measure that is coming t=
ogether in Congress that would eliminate the tax consequences utilities fac=
e when transferring their transmission assets to FERC-approved RTOs. Utilit=
ies often cite the costs associated with transferring their transmission as=
sets to an RTO when resisting compliance with FERC's order. If this federal=
 legislation is passed, transmission-owning utilities will have one less re=
ason to resist the transfer of their transmission assets over to an indepen=
dent entity.=20

It is important to note that Wood's new proposals related to RTO formation =
are an adjunct to FERC's order from last July that mandated consolidation a=
mong existing RTOs, with the stated goal of creating four large national en=
tities (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West). The Electric Reliability C=
ouncil of Texas (ERCOT), which already exists, is outside of FERC's jurisdi=
ction. Four large RTOs is still the vision that FERC has in mind, and as no=
ted Wood agrees that "four is a good place to land." However, the mandate o=
n consolidation appears to be softening, at least in some regions. For inst=
ance, in the Western region, presently three separate transmission entities=
 exist (the California ISO in California, RTO West among the Northwestern s=
tates and Desert Star among the Southwestern states). In its July order, FE=
RC had clearly stated that it wanted to see these three entities consolidat=
e, a point that has caused a great deal of conflict with the California ISO=
, which wants to remain independent. Now, Wood appears to be backing away f=
rom forcing the consolidation issue in the West and has said that FERC's st=
ance will be "not as aggressive" for integrating the existing RTOs in the W=
est. Further, Wood now says that having a single Western RTO is not imperat=
ive at this time.=20

Consolidation among the existing RTOs in the Northeast appears to be moving=
 forward. In fact, consolidation among the PJM Power Pool, the New York ISO=
 and the New England ISO could take place as soon as the end of next year. =
This progress comes somewhat as a surprise, considering that the last repor=
t out of this region was that the New York ISO and New England ISO resisted=
 the preference that had been shown for PJM's model. In the Midwest, two en=
tities still exist (the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO), and Wood has sai=
d that FERC is working toward a revised agreement between the two entities =
that would encourage them to merge. Just recently, six investor- and public=
-owned power companies in the Midwest applied to FERC to form a new company=
 to merge their electric transmission systems. Translink Transmission Co. w=
ould be a for-profit entity. It is not presently known if or how Translink =
may be required to conjoin with the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO.=20

As noted, Wood has also set out a long-term agenda for FERC, covering other=
 points beyond RTO formation. For instance, another critical issue for the =
commission will be potential market manipulation that might take place by v=
arious participants in deregulated environments. One of the ongoing debates=
 related to the failure of California's deregulated market was whether or n=
ot out-of-state generators or state-affiliated entities such as the Califor=
nia ISO and the Department of Water Resources intentionally manipulated the=
 state's market to impact power prices. Wood has indicated that FERC will s=
oon release a formal policy for policing companies authorized to sell power=
 at market rates and utilities that use transmission services bundled into =
state-regulated retail rates to thwart wholesale power competition. In addi=
tion, Wood has said that FERC will establish new policies related to the in=
formation that energy companies can share with their affiliates. This is a =
direct reference to a pending case involving El Paso Corp., in which the co=
mpany has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with one of =
its unregulated affiliates to gain a market edge in the natural-gas market =
of California.=20

The other key focus area for Wood is upgrading the electricity infrastructu=
re in the United States, which he says has not even remotely kept pace with=
 the tremendous growth in the economy over the last 15 years. Instead of bu=
ilding new power lines, however, it appears that Wood supports the developm=
ent of new technologies that would boost capacity on existing lines. Toward=
 that end, FERC and the Department of Energy will hold a forum on innovativ=
e but unused energy technologies in January. Also along these lines are pla=
ns to develop uniform strategies for hooking up existing and new power plan=
ts to the transmission grid.=20

Moreover, as we head toward the end of 2001, we are fast approaching the fo=
ur-year anniversary of the start of electric competition in the United Stat=
es (California, the first state to implement direct access, opened its mark=
et in March 1998). Four years later, the industry is still caught in somewh=
at of a limbo between the old structure of monopoly control and the new str=
ucture of full deregulation. Chairman Wood has assumed leadership over FERC=
 at a time when the commission has been heavily criticized for not doing en=
ough to limit the amount of market abuse that has arisen as a result of der=
egulation. At the same time, the extent to which the commission should prov=
ide regulatory oversight in a deregulated marketplace has also come under q=
uestion, even by the commissioners themselves. Thus, Chairman Wood's challe=
nge will be to push electric competition forward while taking steps to redu=
ce the potential for market manipulation. Clearly, RTOs continue to play an=
 integral role in these objectives and remain a top priority for FERC under=
 the new leadership of Pat Wood.=20
