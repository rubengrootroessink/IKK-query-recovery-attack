   Subject:    Tuesday Board Meeting
   
   We have not been able to secure video conference facilities for the
   Board
   meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 25. We will proceed with a teleconference.
   The
   information to connect to the call is as follows:
   
   International Number is 1-865 524 4287
   
      U.S. Domestic Number is 800 417 3187
   
      Participants Code is 169 326
   
      The meeting will be more effective if we can gather several Board
   members in locations in New York and London. We will host the New
   York
   session at our offices at 600 Fifth Avenue (entrance on 48th Street),
   27th
   floor. The London session will be at our offices at One New Change,
   EC4.
   Please proceed to the Allen & Overy reception desk at that location
   and you
   will be directed to a conference room.
   
      The meeting will begin promptly at 9:00 am New York time/2:00 pm
   London time. Based on responses we expect to have several more Board
   members
   on the phone than are necessary to satisfy quorum requirements, but
   we do
   need you to join us from the beginning of the call.
   
      If you are joining us in person, please arrive at the New York or
   London location in advance of the start of the call. If you are
   connecting
   by phone, please do so a few minutes prior to the start of the call.
   Our
   Board members in Asia and Australia are starting this call at 9:00
   pm, 10:00
   pm or 11:00 pm, depending on their location. We will make every
   effort to
   keep the meeting to an hour and a half.
   
      We will consider the following issues from the original September
   agenda:
   
      Filling of the vacancy created by Damian's resignation
   
      Membership applications (Mary will send a separate email with
   details on each application)
   
      Relationship with FpML
   
      Market convergence issues
   
      An abbreviated review of the three-year plan
   
   If you need the materials for any of these matters, please contact
   Cynthia
   Richards or me.
   
   I look forward to speaking with you on Tuesday.
   
   Bob
