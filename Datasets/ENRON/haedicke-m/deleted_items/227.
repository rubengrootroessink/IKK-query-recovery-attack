Some Reasons Why Duke Energy
Was Named Company of the Year



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PR Newswire] Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) was named Energy Compa=
ny of the Year at the 2001 Financial Times Global Energy Awards ceremonies =
held last week in New York. The awards, sponsored by publishing and informa=
tion company Platts and the professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohm=
atsu, recognized Duke Energy for its diversified operations and its success=
ful overall growth during the past year.=20

Analysis: 2001 may turn out to be the most tumultuous year in the history o=
f the energy industry, and certainly the most volatile since deregulation b=
egan about four years ago. However, in the course of a year that has witnes=
sed the bankruptcy filings of two leading energy companies (Pacific Gas & E=
lectric Co. and Enron), Duke Energy's success during the same time frame is=
 all the more impressive. In addition to earnings that consistently meet or=
 exceed expectations, Duke has carved out a unique niche in the energy merc=
hant space, the same market in which its competitor Enron has now failed. T=
he pending acquisition of Vancouver-based Westcoast Energy should also add =
to Duke's already-diverse portfolio, give it a lock on Canada's seemingly a=
bundant gas reserve fields, and expand the company's North American pipelin=
e capacity. However, in my estimation, the real significance of Duke's perf=
ormance is the strategy that is working behind the scenes at this company. =
While more energy companies continue to announce massive restructuring plan=
s-dividing up their regulated and unregulated businesses-Duke remains intac=
t. Further, while other companies become more focused on a primary fuel sou=
rce (natural gas, coal or nuclear), Duke remains broadly diversified. What =
this means is that, once again, Duke Energy is bucking trends and doing thi=
ngs its own way. Instead of following a growing trend of becoming a pure-pl=
ay company, Duke continues to play its card as a multi-focused operation, w=
hich it claims may be its secret weapon in a volatile market.=20

First and foremost, Duke's stats remain very impressive in a market terrain=
 that has become rather bleak. The company has consistently maintained a ma=
rket capitalization of $28.6 billion, a book value of $16.11 and P/E ratio =
of 13.86. In addition, while Enron's stock has languished below the $1 mark=
, Duke shares are currently priced at $36.81 (as of early morning trading o=
n Dec. 10), and recorded a 52-week high of $47.74. For the third quarter 20=
01, Duke reported a 46-percent increase in ongoing earnings per share, or $=
1.02 per share. Year-to-date earnings per share from ongoing operations as =
of Sept. 30 were $2.30 compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. For=
 year-end 2001, Duke remains committed to delivering earnings growth within=
 a stated guidance of 10- to 15-percent compound annual growth in earnings =
per share from a base of $2.10 in 2000. Looking ahead to 2002, Duke Energy =
expects to earn toward the high end of the 10- to 15-percent range.=20

In addition, Duke presently owns and operates nearly 30,000 MW of generatio=
n worldwide (putting it on par with or very close to other generating compa=
nies such as AEP and Exelon), and reportedly trades eight times as much pow=
er and five to six times as much natural gas as it owns, operates or contro=
ls. Duke also claims that it transports 8 percent of the natural gas consum=
ed in the United States as a whole, and 26 percent of the natural gas consu=
med on the East Coast. Also, Duke has some 12,000 miles of natural-gas pipe=
line in operation, 900 miles under construction and 450 miles in developmen=
t.=20

Responding to the newly bestowed award, Duke's CEO Richard Priory said, "Th=
is award recognizes the business strategy of Duke Energy, which has remaine=
d focused on creating customer and shareholder value during a turbulent yea=
r in the energy sector." This statement is significant because, perhaps mor=
e than Duke's strong numbers, the company's business strategy is arguably w=
hat gained it the enviable designation as "company of the year." According =
to Priory, Duke is attributing its financial success and strong projections=
 for the future to its diverse portfolio and decision to remain an integrat=
ed company. In other words, all of Duke Energy's various business operation=
s-including ownership of natural-gas and power assets, storage and transpor=
tation positions, and financial and physical trading-all stand as business =
units under the parent organization. Duke apparently has no plans to spin o=
ff any of its high-growth operations into a stand-alone operation. In fact,=
 Priory maintains that "combining our slate of power generation and gas-pip=
eline assets with trading capabilities and structured origination allows us=
 to prosper through the ups and downs of market cycles."=20

Priory previously expressed that "Duke is positioned to sustain its growth =
trajectory by leveraging the volatility that so many [other companies] fear=
." It is becoming more and more uncommon for a company to remain as broadly=
 diversified as Duke Energy, with regard to owning natural-gas pipelines an=
d generation assets and operating an active trading strategy. Indeed, Wall =
Street presently seems particularly skittish about energy companies that ha=
ve their fingers in various business sectors, and seems to prefer companies=
 that become more focused on one operation in which they can excel. When re=
ferring to the pure-play strategy, Priory has previously alluded to compani=
es that focus exclusively on generation or trading, and how he believes tha=
t approach carries a higher risk proposition than Duke's more diversified s=
trategy.=20

The other trend that is so common with energy companies right now is corpor=
ate restructuring to split off regulated and unregulated units in an attemp=
t to realize greater value for both. The list of companies following this s=
trategy is becoming longer all the time, but already AEP, Reliant, Southern=
 Company, UtiliCorp, and Xcel have announced (or completed) massive endeavo=
rs to construct an operational wall between their regulated and unregulated=
 businesses. In some cases, this has led to spinning off the unregulated bu=
siness into its own stand-alone company.=20

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Duke remains a holding company with va=
rious business units all integrated into one business model. As of spring 2=
001, Duke had structured its operations into seven business segments:=20

North American Wholesale Energy (including the company's merchant generatio=
n portfolio);=20
International Energy (comprised of Duke Energy International, with business=
es in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and European regions);=20
Field Services (including the company's natural-gas midstream, gathering an=
d production businesses);=20
Natural Gas Transmission (comprised of the company's natural-gas storage an=
d pipeline businesses);=20
Franchised Electric (Duke Power, the electric utility serving two million c=
ustomers in North Carolina and South Carolina, and Duke Electric Transmissi=
on);=20
Duke Ventures (including Crescent Resources, a real estate operation, DukeN=
et Communications, a telecom outfit, and Duke Capital Partners, which is es=
sentially an investment banking firm); and=20
Other Energy Services (including DukeSolutions, a C&I commercial energy ser=
vices unit, Duke Engineering & Services, an energy engineering and technica=
l services unit, and Duke / Fluor Daniel, which is involved in power plant =
engineering and construction).=20

It should be noted that, at least until the Enron debacle, there have been =
downsides to this approach. First, investors may continue to be less likely=
 to support a fully integrated operation that is broadly diversified, prefe=
rring instead to invest in companies that are more clearly focused. As note=
d, investors generally now support pure-play strategies and may seek out en=
ergy companies that have a very narrow and targeted business model. Second,=
 on a related note, in an integrated company the success or failure of one =
business unit will have a direct impact on all of the other units. Without =
separating its operations, Duke could face a situation in which struggles i=
n one particular area (telecom, for instance) could impinge on earnings in =
an unrelated, but connected, business unit. The bottom line for Duke may be=
 that these potential risks pale in comparison to the advantage that the co=
mpany believes it has over competitors in keeping its diverse operations in=
tegrated.=20

As a final note, it is important to establish the role that Duke's $8.5-bil=
lion pending acquisition of Westcoast Energy most likely will play in its c=
ontinued success, and its role in the reasoning for Duke being anointed as =
company of the year. From my perspective, one of the most important aspects=
 of Duke's purchase of Westcoast Energy is the control over natural-gas pip=
elines that Duke gains in the deal. Upon completion of the deal, the combin=
ed entity reportedly will have 58,000 miles of gathering pipeline; 84 gas-p=
rocessing facilities; 19,000 miles of gas transmission; and 16,500 miles of=
 distribution pipeline. The purchase of Westcoast Energy, which includes a =
substantial amount of energy infrastructure in Canada, should help Duke to =
supply fuel to its current power plants in the United States and ones that =
the company has planned for future construction.=20
