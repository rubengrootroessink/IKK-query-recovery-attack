Dynegy Remains on a Roll as Earnings Soar=20

[News item from Reuters] Power marketer and trader Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) =
announced that its third-quarter earnings hit the upper end of Wall Street =
expectations as its backbone wholesale energy business delivered strong ret=
urns. The company said earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per dilut=
ed share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same pe=
riod in 2000. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial / First Call had expecte=
d earnings in a range of 77 cents to 85 per share, with a mean expectation =
of 82 cents.=20

Analysis: Dynegy has scored an impressive feat in beating its stellar finan=
cial performance over the course of 2000. Given the restrictions placed on =
power generators in California, general market upheaval and impact on the e=
conomy that has resulted from the events of Sept. 11, one might have expect=
ed Dynegy to see its earnings dip slightly compared to its 2000 performance=
. Quite to the contrary, Dynegy has emerged once again as a bright star in =
a rather bleak financial galaxy, demonstrating that its core focus on marke=
ting and trading, along with a cautious approach into international markets=
 and uncertain businesses such as telecom, is a winning strategy. Even in a=
 weakened economy in which its own stock has fallen some 24 percent over th=
e course of 2001, due in large part to market turmoil, Dynegy still stands =
out as a leader in the energy field, and almost single-handedly has kept en=
ergy stocks high on the radar screen of Wall Street.=20

Dynegy's numbers command attention. In addition to its impressive 3Q report=
, during the first nine months of 2001 Dynegy has earned $571 million, or $=
1.69 a share, compared with $395 million, or $1.17, for the first nine mont=
hs of 2000. Dynegy also has raised its earnings estimate for year-end 2001 =
to a range of $2.09 to $2.10 per diluted share from the $2.07 target set on=
 Oct. 1. For 4Q and year 2002, Dynegy remains comfortable with its previous=
ly established target of 40 to 41 cents a share and $2.50 to $2.60 a share,=
 respectively. The revised figures represent an increase of well over 30 pe=
rcent for Dynegy's projections for 2000. Further, the company said that it =
remains confident that its projected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate o=
ver the next three years (through 2003) will average 20 percent to 25 perce=
nt.=20

Without question, the vast majority of earnings increase at Dynegy is being=
 derived from the company's Marketing and Trade unit, which Dynegy said acc=
ounted for more than 90 percent of the 3Q profits. In fact, out of the $286=
 million that Dynegy reported in the 3Q 2001 earnings, $263 million came fr=
om the marketing and trading division, representing an increase of 85 perce=
nt from 3Q 2000. Dynegy Marketing and Trade is engaged in a broad array of =
energy businesses, including the physical supply of and risk management act=
ivities around wholesale natural gas, power, coal, emission allowances, and=
 weather derivatives.=20

On the basis of the marketing and trade subsidiary, Dynegy is currently ran=
ked as the fifth largest gas marketer in the country, and its ongoing succe=
ss has resulted from a dual focus on natural-gas trading and power generati=
on. For year-end 2000, Dynegy Marketing and Trade reported a 252-percent in=
crease in recurring net income to $355 million, representing nearly 80 perc=
ent of Dynegy Inc.'s overall results. The segment's performance benefited f=
rom Dynegy's expanded North American natural-gas and power operations, incl=
uding the integration of Illinova's unregulated generation assets, strong m=
arketing, trading and risk management activities and a return to normal wea=
ther patterns.=20

Clearly, this particular unit is the primary earnings driver for the entire=
 company. In the third quarter, Dynegy Marketing and Trade's North American=
 natural-gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bc=
f/d), an increase from 9.8 Bcf/d during 3Q 2000. Also under the same unit, =
total power sales increased 86 percent to 90.5 million MWh in 3Q 2001, comp=
ared to 48.7 million MWh in 3Q 2000. This 86-percent jump in total physical=
 power sales led to an 85 percent year-over-year increase in recurring inco=
me for the marketing and trade division. According to Dynegy, the higher vo=
lumes in both gas and power were the result of improved market liquidity, g=
reater market origination, increased sales volumes on Dynegydirect, and inc=
remental gas marketing in Canada.=20

Part of the expansion of this business will be an ongoing penetration of th=
e European trading market. However, Dynegy maintains that, unlike its direc=
t competitor Enron, its European expansion is methodical and cautious. Dyne=
gy recently expanded its Dynegydirect trading portal into the United Kingdo=
m, but its penetration of this market has been much slower than Enron, whic=
h, according to Dynegy, tried to expand into the European market "in a hurr=
y." Another Dynegy rival is Reliant Energy, which also expanded into Europe=
 in advance of other companies and is now reportedly considering a sale of =
its electricity generation business in the Netherlands.=20

The comparison that Dynegy has made between itself and Enron may be intenti=
onal. Along with being long-time Houston-based rivals, Dynegy must find its=
 current success even sweeter considering the turmoil that has taken place =
at Enron over the last year. Of course, Enron lost its CEO Jeffrey Skilling=
 just over a month ago when he resigned amid the company's diminished stock=
 value and huge losses in the telecom sector. Enron released its own 3Q ear=
nings report on Oct. 16. Enron's core wholesale trading and marketing divis=
ion met targets and drove up profits by 35 percent. The company's earnings =
also rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 ce=
nts a share, in 3Q 2000. However, Enron posted a 3Q net loss as it faced $1=
.01 billion in charges, which included a $287 million write-down on its Azu=
rix venture, $180 million from the restructuring of its broadband unit and =
$544 million in investment losses related to The New Power Company. What we=
 know presently is that Enron's stock has dropped about 57 percent over the=
 course of 2001, due to its troubled broadband sector, losses associated wi=
th its Dabhol subsidiary in India and overall downward market trends.=20

If there is something that could be considered a blemish on Dynegy's curren=
t record, it may be its telecom business, known as Dynegy Global Communicat=
ions, in which the company reported a $15 million loss for the third quarte=
r. Dynegy Global Communications seeks to capitalize on the growing converge=
nce between energy and communications sectors by building a broadband marke=
ting and trading system. Dynegy has said that the loss is due to costs asso=
ciated with developing its 16,000-mile bandwidth network, which reaches 44 =
U.S. cities and is expected to be completed in the four quarter. Unlike oth=
er power companies that are trying to exit the telecom sector (Reliant, for=
 example), Dynegy still projects that it will find long-term success in thi=
s area, in part because it is taking a cautious approach toward expansion. =
Also, as another means of comparison with Enron, Dynegy's telecom business =
lost $15 million in the third quarter while Enron's broadband unit took a l=
oss of $80 million. Another unit taking losses is Illinois Power, Dynegy's =
regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary, which reported a $15-mi=
llion loss in 3Q 2001. Dynegy attributed this loss to a reduced industrial =
load.=20

Perhaps the other area that may give pause to investors is Dynegy's engagem=
ents in the California market, which still remains unresolved. Dynegy is re=
portedly still owed about $320 to $325 million for power that was sold to t=
he California utilities before the state government took over as the primar=
y power purchaser. Despite Dynegy's best efforts to obtain the outstanding =
balance, and its confidence that it will ultimately be paid, the financiall=
y unstable condition of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California =
Edison makes the timetable for any such payment quite uncertain. Also impac=
ting Dynegy's California involvement are reports that California lawmakers =
want to renegotiate long-term agreements that the Department of Water Resou=
rces signed with various power suppliers, including Dynegy, earlier in the =
year. Wholesale prices have dropped considerably since the state of Califor=
nia signed the long-term contracts, and thus the state wants to renegotiate=
 a better price for the power. Dynegy claims, however, that the contract it=
 signed with the state contains legal protection for Dynegy's interests.=20

Overall, however, Dynegy's 3Q financial report represents what is one of th=
e few unqualified success stories in the energy industry. Stacked up agains=
t other companies that have struggled against the volatility of the nation'=
s economy, Dynegy is clearly flourishing. Like other companies with heavy a=
ssets in generation, the fact that Dynegy's marketing and trading division =
is the primary profit driver for the company is not a revelation. What is p=
erhaps more important is the diligent way in which Dynegy has methodically =
accumulated an arsenal of generation assets and expanded into new business =
lines with a very cautious approach.=20
