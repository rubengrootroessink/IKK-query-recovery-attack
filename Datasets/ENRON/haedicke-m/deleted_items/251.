Mark: To supplement my earlier email, I just got off of a t/c with Weil and some of our in-house attorneys (we have a daily call for the lawyers to catch-up); they advised that there is a hearing this week for expedited approvals (ie. before yearend) for the sale of certain Enron Wind partnership interests (Indian Mesa?) valued at about $190MM and our large PPA in Alberta, Canada. (I'm unsure of the value, although I thought I heard it was worth--at least at one time--close to $300MM--I think U.S.)  The Wind transaction is motivated by the expiring tax credits, while (I believe) the PPA impetus simply relates to the risk of declining value.  I'll keep you apprised.
