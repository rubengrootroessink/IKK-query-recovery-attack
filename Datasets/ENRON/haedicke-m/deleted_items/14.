Dear Paul,

ISDA is holding a conference on Energy and Developing Products at One
Whitehall Place in London on December 4, 2001.  We would be delighted to
have you speak at 10:45am on Physical versus Financial Trading as well as
moderate the panel discussion on the following issues:

*	Dealing with Different Standardized Documentation in Europe for
Similar Products
*	Benefits of Using a Bridge or Annexes to a Single Master Agreement 
*	Physical versus Financial Trading

For your information, Rita Pearson Schwandt (RWE) has been invited to speak
on dealing with different standardized documentation in Europe for similar
products and Richard Tredgett (Allen & Overy) on using a bridge or annexes
to a single master agreement.  

Attached is a copy of the agenda.  

 <<finalagenda.doc>> 
We would also like to invite you to speak in the afternoon workshop on
Documenting Energy and Power Derivatives Under the 1992 ISDA Master
Agreements at 2pm which is repeated again in the afternoon session at
3:45pm.  Just so you know, we usually invite 2 or 3 people to speak at each
of these workshops.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Liz
