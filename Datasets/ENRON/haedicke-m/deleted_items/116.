AGENDA
DAY 1:  Tuesday, October 16, 2001
8:30 a.m. WELCOME: WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS?
8:40 a.m. POWER MARKETING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY - Dave Freeman, Senior Director, Aquila
Power marketing is largely the business of price risk management for the energy industry. Energy policy at the state and Federal level can act to facilitate, or cripple the ability of the market to respond to and mitigate threats to price stability.
9:20 a.m. THE SUPPLY RESPONSE: ADDING NEW GENERATING CAPACITY - Lynn H. Church, President, Electric Power Supply Association
The ability to add new generating capacity in a timely fashion is key to avoiding future energy crises. Balancing environmental concerns, NIMBY and public accountability with the need for additional generating capacity.

10:00 a.m. THE NUCLEAR RESURGENCE - Joe F. Colvin, President and CEO, Nuclear Energy Institute 

After coal, nuclear power remains the most important source of electricity in the US, and with license renewals, and proposed facility expansions, is likely to hold that position for some time to come. Nuclear power economics and opportunities in today's competitive markets.

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

2:00 p.m. BUILDING COAL-FIRED POWERPLANTS-- Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone 

The US isn't the Saudi Arabia of coal-- it's the whole OPEC of coal. Most power generated in the US is coal-fired, and is likely to remain so. It is not the fuel of the past, it is the fuel of the present and future, with more coal-fired plants planned now than any time in decades. The economics and political realities of coal plant construction. 

2:45 p.m. NATURAL GAS AND POWER - Mike Reed, VP Market & Quantitative Analysis PG&E National Energy Group  

Gas is the dominant fuel for new powerplants, and the dominant source of growth for gas markets, but the markets aren't joined at the hip. How gas and power interrelate, and the public policy implications of market power in both/either markets. 

RETAIL

2:45 p.m. TEXAS MARKETS   Stephanie Kroger, Partner, Mayor, Day, Caldwell and Keeton  

With the pilots launched and full access in two months, all eyes are on Texas retail markets-- the biggest retail markets in America. How these markets work, how to take advantage of the opportunities they present. 

3:30-4:15 P.M . Break Visit Exhibits 

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

4:15 p.m. PRIVATIZING TRANSMISSION-- John Howe, Former Chairman of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, Vice President, Electric Industry Affairs, American Superconductor  

New transmission technologies and the massive growth in electric demand are creating opportunities for investment in transmission. What are the opportunities? How does regulatory policy impact the siting of transmission facilities and their operation? 

5:00 p.m. ISOs, RTO's TRANSCOS & STATUS QUOsDariush Shirmohammadi, PA Consulting. 

How are the various structures of transmission organizations working? What are the prospects for progress in creating super-regional, independent transmission organizations?

5:00 p.m. CONSERVATION AND LOAD MANAGEMENT IN URGENT SITUATIONS- Don Fuller, Director, Client Relations, California ISO 

California has recently become a testing ground for mechanisms to manage the demand-side of the supply-demand equation, with dramatically effective results. What went right. 

6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Power Marketing Association Reception in Exhibit Hall DAY 2:  Wednesday, October 17, 2001
8:30 a.m. CREDIT RISK AND ITS MANAGEMENT - (Special early morning session) Scott Ettien, Vice President and Tim Moore, Senior Underwriter, NCM Americas.
Price differentials aren't always about time and location-- sometimes they are about the likelihood of being paid. Utilities have traditionally finessed credit requirements by spreading uncollectables among their customer base, and until recently, this was enough to make the utilities themselves bulletproof credit risks. No more. Using credit insurance and internal controls to manage the final frontier in risk management.
KEYNOTE ADDRESS

William L. Massey, Commissioner

10:30 a.m. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION - Buck Buckner, Director of Marketing, Stewart & Stevenson 

Power shortages have caused revisitation of the issues associated with distributed generation-- interconnection policy, limits on operations, gas tariffs, siting review, net metering and a plethora of lesser issues. With these changes, the potential for distributed generation has grown significantly. 

11:10 a.m. COMMODITY EXCHANGES: REGULATED AND UNREGULATED- Brad Leach, Senior Director, NYMEX 

As power markets continue to mature, commodity exchanges are slowly beginning to develop, with varying characteristics of liquidity, neutrality and regulatory status. Where exchanges stand today, and where they are heading in the future. 

11:50 a.m. CAREER TRENDS - Marc Granet, President, IDC Executive Search, Inc. 

What jobs will last? What skills become more valuable? How do I build my career in the evolving energy industry?
