Janette:  Would you please forward on the notice of the ADL program to the energy group legal team.  It looks like a great program!   Mark

Hi Mark. How are plans for this year's BEAR program? I wanted to forward an invitation to a community program I am chairing later this month. I thought this would be of interest for your legal team. We are working on CLE credits for this as well. Call if you need more details.
