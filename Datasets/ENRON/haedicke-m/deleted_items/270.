I am currently planning on being out of town this week from Wednesday morning through Sunday.  We will be at Lake LBJ, at 830/598-8923.  We will also be in San Antonio on Thursday and Friday, at various times.  I can be reached in San Antonio at the Kingmans (brother-in-law), at 210/826-7311.  My cell phone is 713/503-4456.  Note, both the Blackberry device and the cell phone do not work at the Lake - horribly convenient.  Thanks.  Lance.
