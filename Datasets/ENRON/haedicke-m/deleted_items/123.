Mark, is this what you were working on at one point?  Maybe it should go to Sally Beck, but I'm not sure.

Ken,

I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.

Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

Sorry to have troubled you, but I KNOW that if I mention it, then you will get it to the right person for consideration.

Many thanks

Andrew Henderson
