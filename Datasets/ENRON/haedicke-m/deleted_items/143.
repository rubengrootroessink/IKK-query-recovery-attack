Please join me in welcoming Laura Mowbray to the staff in the London office.
Laura joined us during our London member update week, which of course was
overshadowed by the events in New York and Washington. Laura will work
initially on our European regulatory effort. She has studied European
government and is fluent in German, having been a reporter for a German
newspaper.
