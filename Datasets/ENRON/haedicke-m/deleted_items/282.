From Julia Murray anad Carol St. Clair


As requested, we reviewed the Chase prepays to determine ratings trigger events. Upon a downgrade by S&P below investment grade, the collateral threshold under the margin agreement would be reduced from $10MM to zero. There is no Moody's downgrade trigger. In addition, Mary Perkins has advised that we do not have monies on deposit with Chase.  We are told that there are no outstanding Citibank prepays.
