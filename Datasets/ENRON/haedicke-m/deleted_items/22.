   Our board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, November 13, in New York.
   It is
   our annual budget meeting so it is an important meeting. I am aware,
   however, that some firms have instituted temporary bans or
   limitations on
   travel. It would be helpful to know for planning purposes whether you
   will
   be able to make it to New York for the meeting. George James is
   hosting the
   meeting here at the Morgan Stanley offices.
    
   Bob
