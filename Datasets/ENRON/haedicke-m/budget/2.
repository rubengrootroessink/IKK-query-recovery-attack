Mark,
Attached is the most current copy of the ENA Legal 2002 Plan Presentation and supporting schedules.  We have added (for presentation and allocation purposes) a Bonus Accrual line item in order to include an allocation of bonuses to other Business Units.

I am aware that several Business Units have questions on or are disputing thier plan allocation.  We have made adjustments for EPI, however I don't believe we have received any authorization from you or Deb to make any other revisions at this time.  Please let us know should we need to do so.

I am aware that you are scheduled to meet with Louise Kitchen on Friday.  Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or desire to discuss the attached information prior to your meeting.

Thank you,
Edie Leschber
