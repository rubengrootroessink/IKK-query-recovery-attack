Mark, per your request, it looks like your guess was right on target.  I 
calculate that 70.62% of the 2001 EWM Legal Plan for Inside Costs Only is for 
ENA business units.   Attached for your reference is my Excel worksheet along 
with a page explaining my calculations.  Please call me if you have any 
questions or need further information.  Deb
