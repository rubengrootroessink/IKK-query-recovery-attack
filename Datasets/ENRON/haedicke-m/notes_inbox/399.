> We understand that the London portion of the Restructuring Meeting on
> November 13 was not as comprehensive as members would have preferred,
> partly as a result of logistical difficulties.  I will be in London from
> December 13th - 15th and would like to have a meeting in London on
> December 14 from 4:30 - 6:00 p.m. at UBS Warburg's offices at 100
> Liverpool Street to hear the views of our London members on the
> Restructuring issue and to report on any subsequent developments.  If you
> would like to attend this meeting, please send an email to Barbara Hanlon
> at bhanlon@isda.org.
>
> We have attached a copy of the minutes of the November 13 meeting.
