I don't really have any datapoints for most of 2000 for Dan.

I guess I could see what Rick has said in the written form and sit in on the 
review so that we can make sure there is no confused message.

Any other suggestions in this awkward situation?

Alan

Shouldn't you and Rick do that together so as not to have confusion.  Mark

I have completed your written performance review and have put a signed 
original copy in the mail to you.  When you get it, contact Brenda to arrange 
for a time for us to talk.  After we talk, you will have to sign the original 
and forward it to Dave Hill.
