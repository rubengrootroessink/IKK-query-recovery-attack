Mark -

Attached for your review and comment is a proposed initial welcome statement 
for the web site.  This statement can either appear on the home page or 
within the "What's New" area.  I anticipate keeping some welcome message on 
the site at all time, but updating it as necessary to reflect the current 
status of the site and the information in the site.

The logo at the top is what PR and the IT design team have developed and 
indicated meets current Enron site branding requirements.  The slogan - 
Providing Innovative Legal Solutions - was agreed to by the Team as a means 
of further marketing ourselves through the site.  It is anticipated the 
slogan will be on every page as a continuous message of our commitment to the 
business groups.  We have spoken to Peter Mims at V&E about the use of the 
logo and requested he inquire whether or not there is a comparable external 
use that we need to be aware of.  If not, we have asked if it is possible to 
reserve the name and possibly trademark it for our use.

When you have a chance, please take a look at the attached.  I welcome any 
and all comments.
