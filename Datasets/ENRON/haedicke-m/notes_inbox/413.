Mike, I would appreciate your help on the following matter. =20

I attach the e-mail that I sent to David Haug on August 11 of this year abo=
ut=20
the $2.9 million settlement payment that the SECLP  project in the Dominica=
n=20
Republic owes us and that they have not paid, and that has been accruing=20
interest for years. EECC will have to write off all of this amount unless=
=20
some resolution is achieved.  The e-mail tells the story so I won't repeat=
=20
it, but will just update the note as follows:

After we sent this note, there were several internal Enron meetings between=
=20
EECC and CALME in which it was decided that Dan Castagnola would approach t=
he=20
lenders in a last ditch attempt to obtain payment. If the Lenders refused t=
o=20
approve payment, then EECC would be freed to file litigation against SECLP =
to=20
recover the full uncompromised amount of the claim (approx $5.6 million,=20
excluding interest).
This project was then transferred to Global Markets in connection with the=
=20
CALME breakup, and the owner's efforts to discuss the matter with the Lende=
rs=20
seems to have ground to a halt. We do not think that the discussion with th=
e=20
Lenders ever occurred.
However, we are still willing to consider alternatives to litigation, such =
as=20
selling the claim to the Enron shareholder in SECLP for the amount of the=
=20
settlement, and allowing the Enron shareholder company to hold and control=
=20
the claim against the project and perhaps have it treated as a capital=20
contribution for which shares might be issued later. This would allow EECC =
to=20
clean up its books without taking a write off and allow the Enron sharehold=
er=20
to preserve the claim and perhaps capitalize it.=20

Please call me when you have had a chance to review this note. Hopefully, w=
e=20
can work something out.

David, as you know we have been trying to get the open claim we have with=
=20
SECLP settled for some years now.   I am sending you this note as part of a=
=20
last effort to get this settled, and so it is to be considered part of the=
=20
settlement discussions and used solely in that context, and is without=20
prejudice.

For you  convenience, I wanted to summarize the history of  the dispute=20
involving the outstanding invoice dated 19 March 1996 from Enron Power=20
Construction Company ("EPCC") to Smith/Enron Co-Generation Limited=20
Partnership ("Owner") in the amount of $5,586,145.00 ("Claim").

Project History
November 1993   Owner and GE execute the Turnkey Agreement;
November 1993   NTP issued to GE;
May 1994    Phase I Simple Cycle Commercial Operation achieved;
September 1994   Owner and EPCC execute the Construction Completion Agreeme=
nt=20
("CCA");=20
August 1995   Phase II Combined Cycle Commercial Operation achieved;
  =20
The Construction Completion Agreement.
Under the CCA EPCC administered the final stage of the Turnkey Agreement by=
=20
stepping into the shoes of Owner in order to manage the schedule for=20
completion of the work under the Turnkey Agreement.  It is important to=20
remember that (i) EPCC had no authority to settle disputes or determine if=
=20
the Commercial Operation was achieved and (ii) EPCC had no warranty=20
obligations for GE or any other third person.

The Costs under the Invoice.
Between August 1995 and March 1996 EPCC continued to incur costs including=
=20
additional scope of work items and costs incurred as a result of third part=
y=20
actions (Force Majeure).  Our costs totalled $5,586,145 and were included i=
n=20
the 19 March 1996 invoice. Since we have not been paid, interest has been=
=20
accruing on that amount.
=20
Settlement Discussions.
Beginning 2Q 1996 I personally had discussions with Owner about the Claim. =
=20
We discussed several payout options, most involving insurance proceeds.  EP=
CC=20
and your partner, Smith Cogeneration Dominicana, Inc. executed a settlement=
=20
agreement in early 1997.  This was negotiated personally by Rod Gray, on=20
behalf of EI.  However, Owner refused to execute the settlement agreement=
=20
pending Lender approval.  This Lender approval never materialized, and the=
=20
settlement agreement was never signed by the Owner.  However, I was asked b=
y=20
Rod, on behalf of EI, to await the insurance settlement.The settlement=20
agreement stated that Owner would pay EPCC $2.9MM as follows:
? 6% of Owner insurance proceeds (i.e. 10% of Owner=01,s 60%) for the first=
=20
$13.5MM gross=20
 insurance (max is $800k); and
? 12% of Owner=01,s insurance proceeds (i.e. 20% of Owner=01,s 60%) above $=
13.5MM=20
until EECC=20
 obtains $2.9MM.=20

Meanwhile, we have patiently waited to close out the CCA while Owner resolv=
ed=20
its claims against the responsible parties including Raytheon/Ebasco, Gener=
al=20
Electric, and Foster Wheeler.   We have spent considerable time and effort=
=20
investigating and addressing issues raised with respect to these liability=
=20
issues even to the point of allowing our personnel to be interviewed.  We=
=20
have waited so long that we had to execute a Tolling Agreement on 1 August=
=20
1999 in order to protect our rights from disappearing due to lack of=20
prosecution! =20

Finally, in June 2000 your team suggested that the Lenders may consent to t=
he=20
settlement agreement if we sent a stern letter outlining our position and=
=20
evidencing our frustration.  Our litigation counsel drafted and sent such a=
=20
letter on June 7, 2000, but Lenders did not consent to the settlement=20
agreement.=20

Current Status.
We now have no prospect of repayment of the Claim and no path forward.  EPC=
C=20
is prepared to move forward and initiate appropriate proceedings for=20
collection of this long overdue outstanding balance, but I wanted to give y=
ou=20
this letter as notice in case you had another solution to this dilemma. =20
Please note that the CCA allows for a 12% per annum interest charge on all=
=20
unpaid amounts and we will include four years at this rate in the arbitrati=
on=20
claim.

Please respond with your thoughts and comments.  I look forward to discussi=
ng=20
this matter with you.
=20
