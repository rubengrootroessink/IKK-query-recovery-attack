Dan Reck is hoping to enter into discussions with Canadian National, who are 
insisting upon the inclusion of a non-raid provision in the confidentiality 
agreement, the offending clause is attached.

In speaking with Dan, his view is that it is more likely that Canadian 
National would want to employ some of our people than us wanting to employ 
any but their most senior people.

The period proposed is for one year after the date we have terminated our 
discussions. I have asked that Canadian National consider a 6 month period 
and they have not yet responded.

In looking at the legal policy on this, I see that the head business person 
and you, as the General Counsel, will need to be comfortable with this 
provision.
Once you have had the chance to review it I would be grateful if you could 
advise as to what we are able to accept and who you believe is the "head 
business person" who will also need to sign off on this.
 
Many thanks.
 
Marcus
