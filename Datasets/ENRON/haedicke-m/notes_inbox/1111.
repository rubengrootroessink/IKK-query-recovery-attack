since the violent acts were directed  at and witnessed by the police, and=

because police officers are  not "members of the public", the defendants'=

=09=09The government=01,s  motion for rehearing or reconsideration of the c=

defect by which the court was misled or which, upon correction,  would lead=
=20
to a different result. The government=01,s argument that  the mandatory tra=

r=20
timely fashion, and in any event defendant=01,s  prior conviction of=20
second-degree home invasion did not place him  within the scope of that=20
provision. The court determined that defendant=01,s  crime of second-degree=
 home=20
invasion, involving his breaking into  a house with the intent to commit=20
larceny, did not contain an element  of actual or threatened use of physica=
l=20
force against the person  of another and therefore, was not a predicate=20
