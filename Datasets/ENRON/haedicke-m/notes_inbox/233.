The following notice was sent to a ISDA documentation task force.
The issue to be discussed may be of interest to each of you and we encourage
your attendance.
> We have arranged for meetings of the Credit Derivatives Documentation Task
> Force to take place simultaneously in New York and London on Monday,
> November 13, at 9:30 NY time/2:30 London time. The New York meeting will
> take place at the offices of Chase Manhattan Bank, 270 Park Avenue, 11th
> Floor, Room C. The London meeting will take place at the offices of Morgan
> Stanley Dean Witter, 20 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14.  Please
> RSVP to Barbara Hanlon at bhanlon@isda.org indicating at which location
> you will be attending.
> At each meeting, I will arrange for several individuals to present their
> view on the Restructuring issue. There will then be an opportunity in each
> meeting to ask questions of those individuals and for more general
> discussion. We will then link the London and New York meetings by
> telephone to share views between the meetings.
> This distribution list is drawn from participants in the documentation
> process. The Restructuring issue, while focused on a term in the
> documentation, is nevertheless one of market practice and not really one
> of documentation. We, therefore, encourage you to ensure that the views of
> your trading desk are expressed at the meeting, preferably by having
> someone from the desk at the meeting. We expect a large number of people
> at the meetings, however, so we also encourage you to consider who from
> your institution is most critical to be in attendance to ensure that your
> views are heard.
> We look forward to hearing from you on the 13th.
