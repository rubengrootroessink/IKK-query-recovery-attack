Dear Reader:

A new world is unfolding and you're in it.  The industry you know is
changing into one no one has ever seen and you'll probably be a part of it.

That's why we've created Restructuring Today - to report to you the
twists, the plans, failures, strategies, shocks, absurdities, new sales
and buying methods as energy and communications converge into American's
biggest industry.

Add the $220 billion power industry to the $80 billion gas industry and
merge in the $200+ telecom, cable and internet industries and you're
talking big bucks.  Restructuring Today is focused down the road,
reporting where the industry's headed every business day.

Our editors will tell you what the CEOs making the big decision are
thinking and planning on.  And those editors cover more seminars that
you could imagine going to (or paying for).  They're guided by a network
of correspondents in state capitals - most of them business editors of
important newspapers.

Can you ask questions?

Of course you can call 1-800-486-8201 anytime with your questions
because that keeps us up on what our readers want to know.  The news is
readable because Restructuring Today's editors write the way people talk
- not in the language of the Federal Register.

Analysis:  Restructuring Today is not written by recent journalism
graduates.  Our editors are directed not to write what the news is but
to report what the news means.  It may seem opinionated but
Restructuring Today's analysis is frequently mentioned when we survey
readers about what they find useful in the daily reports.

Urgent:  We have enjoyed being able to send you some samples of what
Restructuring Today does and if you would like to benefit from our
special, unique focus on convergence and new markets, simply fax the
order from at the end of today=01,s issue (attached) and I'll make sure
you don't miss a single, vital issue.

Cordially,

Season Hawksley
Marketing Manager
