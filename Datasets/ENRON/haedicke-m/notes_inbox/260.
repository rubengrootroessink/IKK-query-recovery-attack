Mark -

I work in the middle market group in the Portland West Power Group.  I feel 
that this year there have been some issues regarding turning around certain 
legal financial tasks.  A good example to look at is the SMUD ISDA contract.  
This counterparty transacted with our weather desk in a breakthrough deal 
that began in October.  Both Enron and SMUD are still struggling to sign the 
ISDA.  Part of the reason for the delay in signing was the difficulty I had 
in getting someone in legal to get the process going before the deal 
transacted.  I probably began speaking with someone (I think is was Sara) at 
least several months prior to the closing of the deal but never made any 
progress.  Ultimately I got frustrated and left the process to Gary Taylor in 
the weather group to deal with (I was merely supporting him since I had a 
relationship with SMUD).  

Although I historically felt Sara Shackelton was the west power contact for 
such matters she seems overwhelmed with many other groups needs.  I am 
interested in one contact for our group that can turn things around in a 
timely manner.  I think from what I heard from other in my group that my 
opinion is commonly shared.  I have tired to bring this issue up with Mark 
Taylor since early September yet after trying to call him several times and 
sending two emails I have given up trying to contact him (this seems ironic 
given the subject I wanted to discuss with him).  

I would welcome any insight you can provide.  One thought I had was to have a 
lawyer who represents both financial and physical issues (Shari Stack seems 
to be qualified to represent both sides and she works for the West).  My 
group has become used to speedy reponse on the physical side and perhaps has 
high expectations on all legal matter.  You can reach me at 503-464-3810.  
Thanks.
