Mark,

I would like to request the authority to download all of the emails that I 
retained from the two peaker transactions.  I feel that these emails might be 
very important in defending ourselves against any possible claim arising 
under the Purchase and Sale Agreements with each of Cinergy and Allegheny.  
Numerous approvals were received from each of the buyers via electronic 
mail.  In addition, the electronic correspondence makes clear, in many 
instances, that the buyers were made aware of certain material facts 
regarding the facilities.  Without these files, I might be unable to 
establish that things were done entirely by the book during the transaction 
process.  Please advise.  

All the best.

Stuart
