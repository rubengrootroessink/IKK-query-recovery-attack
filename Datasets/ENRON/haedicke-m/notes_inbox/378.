Mark:

I just wanted to let you know that Jeff Skilling's office confirmed that he
would speak at the AGM on Thursday, April 5 from 12:15 PM-12:45 PM.  As I
mentioned to you, that was really the only time he could do it.

Also, I received a Subscriber application from Powder Horn Petroleum Company
in Tulsa.  Do you know them?  If not is there someone at Enron who would?  I
would like to get them approved at next week's executive committee call.

Thanks.
Mary
