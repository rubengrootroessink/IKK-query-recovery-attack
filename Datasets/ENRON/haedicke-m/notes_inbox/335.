To everyone in Calgary and Toronto:


On Tuesday, I sent an e-mail to all of you reminding you of our media policy.

In the interim, you may have seen press reports involving the Competition 
Bureau's investigations at the offices of Enron Canada and Powerex last 
spring.  For those of you located in Calgary, you will recall that last 
spring representatives of the Competition Bureau executed a search warrant on 
our offices, and those press reports relate to those investigations.

The purpose of this memo is to remind you of the following:

1. This matter is not to be discussed with the media, except in accordance 
with the media policy as outlined in my memo yesterday.

2. Although you may receive inquiries from friends, families, commercial 
counterparts or others with respect to this matter, it is your duty not to 
speculate on this matter or provide your thoughts or interpretations on any 
of the press reports.  This does not mean that Enron Canada is intending to 
obstruct the process in any way.  To the contrary, although Enron Canada 
believes that the allegations are without substance and that the matter will 
resolve itself in due course, Enron Canada is cooperating to the greatest 
extent possible with the Competition Bureau.  It is, however, important that 
the matter is not elevated or aggravated as a result of inaccuracies, 
speculation or conjecture.  To that extent, if inquiries are made of you that 
have legitimate business concern, such as concerns from a commercial 
counterparty, you should indicate that you will make the appropriate 
inquiries, and those matters should then be specifically referred to either 
Rob Milnthorp, Rob Hemstock, Aleck Dadson or me.

3. It is important to bear in mind that the Competition Bureau's formal 
complaint, as may be reported by the media and as is the nature of such 
things, was lodged prior to, and in order to initiate, their investigation.  
Therefore, by its nature, allegations have been presented by the Competition 
Bureau in a way designed to indicate that there is substance to the 
allegations, but which have not been substantiated and which we are confident 
will be resolved to our satisfaction.


Peter
