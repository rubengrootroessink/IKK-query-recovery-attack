Hello Mark - I have attached an outline that will hopefully assist in
planning and prioritizing activities for the NA Committee for the remainder
of the year.  If your schedule permits, can we arrange a call sometime this
week to discuss?

Thoughts for your consideration:
* what should be the goals of the committee?
* what are the primary issues affecting the committee? (by region and
product type)
* what issues present a role for ISDA?
* Next steps: 1) formulate draft agenda 2) coordinate agenda
w/European Committee 3) schedule remaining North American Committee Meetings
- June, August, October, December.

Many thanks!
