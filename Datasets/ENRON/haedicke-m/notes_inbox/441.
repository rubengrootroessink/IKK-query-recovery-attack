Mark,

Firstly, thanks for the email on the reorganised EWS legal group. I am 
delighted to be part of the legal policy group and look forward to working 
more closely with you in connection with that and with Enron Wholesale 
Services generally.

Secondly, I have faxed to you (to 001 713 646 2600) PRC feedback on our VP 
candidates: Jon Chapman, Justin Boyd and Marcus Von Bock. I am happy to 
discuss any of this with you if you so wish. If you need the same in respect 
of me, no doubt you can get that from Michael Brown.

Thirdly, I attach for your information the Enron Europe Legal Department 
Reorg Announcement which I hope to issue on Wednesday, together with my 
working version of the org. chart.  Please let me know if you have any 
comments on either document.



Thanks.



        Mark
