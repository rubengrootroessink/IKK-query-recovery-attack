I have been meaning to let both of you know the status on this matter.  There 
have been no more calls for additional meetings w/ McConnell.  

The last cargo delivered went in with no problems.  We had some doubts that 
(i) the tanks would hold all of the barrels because the plant had not been 
running as scheduled, and (ii) that the testing would turn out to be on 
spec.  As it turned out, the cargo tested on spec, and was discharged without 
any demurrage.  ECTRS even made some money on the deal (not a lot, but 
some).  

And the attached is the latest on our efforts to get the specs issues 
addressed by Siemens.
Regards,
Janice

Jon,
     Based on a telecon this morning with Victor Santos, it is my 
understanding that you are quite upset because we have contacted Siemens 
directly to discuss certain liquid fuels specifications.  If correct, I find 
this reaction to be puzzling as you and I had previously discussed the fact 
that I would attempt to establish a dialogue with Siemens for the purpose of 
expediting their positive response to the ECTRS request of September 12, 
2000.   We also understand that you believe the person identified for us to 
contact at Siemens may have a negative bias towards FGPC and that our direct 
approach is likely to be counterproductive.    Although we have spoken with 
the Siemens-Westinghouse representative in Houston,  we have yet to establish 
a dialogue with the Siemens person referred to above. 
     More than two months have passed since our original written (urgent) 
request to FGPC and the status of this request within the Siemens 
organization is unclear.    As of today we remain uncertain about whether the 
appropriate contacts within Siemens beyond Mr Kirschen have been made by 
anyone.  Our impression from talking with the Siemens-Westinghouse Houston 
representative is that the ECTRS request has not yet been seen by anyone in 
Germany.
     Our objective is to resolve the ECTRS request in a positive fashion and 
as soon as practicable.  In keeping with this objective, we are willing to be 
flexible in our approach and would welcome your ideas.  Please bear in mind 
that an affirmative response from Siemens would also have a beneficial effect 
for FGPC because ECTRS could then deliver from a wider pool of high quality 
condensates.  Perhaps we could have a conference call between you, Ricky, 
David and me at noon Thursday Manila time?  The primary purpose of this 
conference call would be to clarify your opinion on how best to approach 
Siemens and to discuss any other areas that may be of concern to FGPC.
Regards,
Mike
