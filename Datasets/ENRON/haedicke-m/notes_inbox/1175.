HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net  REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

Computers take the elbow grease out of legal research, but they have driven 
subscription prices through the roof. Why? In our opinion, hegemony and 
Passive User Licensing Schemes, which calculate subscription fees AS THOUGH 
everyone in the firm is a user, even when they are not.

How cool would it be to have a database subscription business comprised in 
part of subscribers who never actually use your database? We can't tell you 
because TheLaw.net licenses only active users.

--"SO HOW MANY LAWYERS ARE IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?"

Who cares? Not us. Let's talk "All You Can Eat" for Active Users only:

----One = $395 annually for TheLaw.net Pro Convenience Edition; $345 if you 
subscribe in April. Save $50!

----Searchable Case Law: 72 libraries spanning over 175 Federal and state 
jurisdictions
----Plus, more than 50,000 menu driven deep-links to critical web based 
documents and databases
----Cf. The Two Headed Monster:

--ALL YOU CAN EAT 24-7-365 WITH A NATIONAL SCOPE

You can pay a lot of money for a little slice or you can pay a little bit for 
a national scope. The latter is where we come in and it's a great model.

You see at TheLaw.net we don't lard up the payroll by developing bells and 
whistles that most people rarely use and many find overwhelming. Instead, we 
deliver a large amount of serviceable, authoritative data to your desktop in 
a way that is fast and easy for anyone to understand and use. We're talking 
minutes.

--SAY GOODBYE TO AVAILABILITY PROBLEMS

Small to medium environments have an availability problem. Or, should we say, 
lack of availability. The vastness of West and Lexis' collections may be 
unavailable to you because the cost is prohibitive. You know there's a lot of 
useful, authoritative data online, but that also is unavailable because you 
don't have the time to find it. You need a best practices software solution 
in place to leverage this information on behalf of your online law office; a 
tool that also includes a great proprietary database as its core.

--WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL?

If you know electronic case law research and you know how to run a browser 
and shuttle through menus, you are a Power User in waiting. And, of course, 
these days they make it so easy to cherry pick specialized resources from 
their pay-to-play web sites that the days of annual contracts and contending 
with the management issues that arise from clicking outside The Plan may be 
numbered. It's a simple matter of knowing your options and tweaking your 
relationships accordingly.

Further, our subscribers will tell you that with over four million searchable 
cases, browsable and searchable Federal and state statutes, rules, 
regulations (including the CFR and Federal Register), forms, executive agency 
databases, legislative tracking tools, practice area helpers, nearly 1,000 
news resources, your favorite columnists, and a host of law office 
facilitators all just a click or two away on their desktop, they are saving 
more than money, they are saving time, too.

--LET'S GET STARTED. SUBSCRIBE THIS WEEK AND SAVE!

Subscribe this week and take $50 off TheLaw.net Convenience Edition. Install 
at work, at home and on your laptop. We can have you up and running later 
today wherever you are on earth. Better yet, sign up your partner and 
yourself or a workgroup.

Imagine. No surprises. No meters. No printing, downloading, pay-per-view or 
on-demand fees. In short, none of the gamesmanship you have come to expect 
and never appreciated.

At your option, we can build your packages and deliver them today via our web 
site or we can ship CDs via U.S. Priority Mail or FedEx. We thank you for 
your time and we hope to hear from you soon while the April savings last!
