I think we should stop going to these meetings.  We have a memo in which we 
list ten good reasons why the EEI is better than the WSPP.  If we stop going, 
the additions to the list will accelerate, thus playing into our overall 
strategy.  Any thoughts to the contrary?----cgy

Mountains for the nights of March 22 & 23 for the WSPP meeting.  If you plan 
to attend the WSPP meeting and would like to use Shari's reservation please
