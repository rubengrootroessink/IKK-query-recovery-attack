Mark - Thanks for getting me on the chart.  Per our previous conversation, 
you don't need to put me in the box at the top if it creates any sort of 
political problems at all.  I would be happy just learning the job.   My 
concern is that I have a permanent home and the I get a chance to learn what 
I consider to be one of the more crucial activities done in the company.  
Also, I've already talked to Mariella Mahan about the sale/monetization of 
the Caribbean assets and discussed counsel a bit.  I am looking forward to 
getting those activities going at the beginning of the year.  Thanks again.
