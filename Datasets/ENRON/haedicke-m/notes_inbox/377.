Mark -

A few updates:

I had some additional conversations yesterday with Randy Young.  Randy is 
making some changes to my org. chart but is reasonably comfortable with his 
people showing up in Global Assets as a group.  I'm trying to confirm with 
Frank Sayre that all of his CALME folks are now in another legal group and 
that no one needs to appear on the Global Assets chart.  If I can talk to 
Randy one more time today and confirm with Frank, my org. chart should be 
good to go.  I passed it by Jim Hughes and have forwarded it to Rob for any 
thoughts.

I'm heading to Singapore to meet with the Dahbol legal team (inhouse and 
outside counsel) to strategize re events in India.  There have been a number 
of articles in the India press in which relevant officials state that "a 
high-level group" is being established to "prepare a case" against Dahbol 
Phase II and to find any "flaws" in the revised PPA.  Some articles have even 
talked about cancelling Phase II.  While Dahbol Power Company has received 
nothing official threatening DPC, it is now the internal Enron consensus that 
something is likely to emerge.

Bill Krenz is currently in China.  I don't know if you were ever updated 
about the dismissal of Soon Yeap and his two closest allies/employees, but 
I'll give you 2-3 minutes sometime.  Bill is closing the loop on some 
formalities of their departure and helping with the investigation of other 
irregularities that Accounting has discovered in the Beijing office.

Jim and Rebecca are turning to understanding Cuiba's problems.  Rebecca has 
some meetings today and Monday.
