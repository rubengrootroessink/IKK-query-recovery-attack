Jim, I had a brief conversation with Mark regarding your concerns on 
legal-accounting firms which we will visit on in March when we talk.  In the 
meantime, if Alan has not already spoken to Ron, Alan please speak to Fred 
Erickson at Stikeman Elliott (403.266.9016) and I will call Ron and tell him 
that for various reasons we will be using someone else on this matter.

Regards, Peter.

Jim/Mark, Alan called me looking for the name of Alberta/Canadian counsel to 
assist him on short notice with respect to some lien financing and title 
transfer issues affecting a transaction he is working on.  I gave him Ron 
Deyholos' name at Donahue Ernst & Young, who works in this area and who is 
very responsive, although I advised Alan that I could give him the names of a 
number of lawyers at Oslers, Stikemans, Blakes or Bennett Jones.  If you have 
concerns, please let Alan or me know ASAP.

Thanks and regards, Peter.
