Mark:

I think this is a good start.

What do you think about a chart or survey of the different key jurisdictions 
regarding their views on the enofrceability of master netting/master-master 
agreements? We would probably need to lean heavily on ISDA's prior work.

Would we attach a sample Master Netting Agreement? I was thinking that we 
would.

That's all for now.

Alan

Do you want to include a discussion about online trading and/or the current 
and proposed bankruptcy provisions?
