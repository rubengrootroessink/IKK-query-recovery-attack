Mark - Enron Canada is contamplating submitting a response to OEFC's request 
for proposal ("RFP") which seeks to acquire services of a contract manager to 
assume responsibility for the day-to-day management of OEFC's non-utility 
generation ("NUG") contracts.   Essentially it will be a 3 year services 
arrangement whereby Enron Canada contract administration and management 
services. 

We intend to make a response to the RFP which is binding as to price and 
services; however, the response will be non-binding with respect to 
contractual terms.  Our response will also include a significant commentary 
on the RFP's proposed contractual terms and conditions.

As this is a services arrangement which does not involve any capital outlay 
it is my understanding that a DASH is not required.  Also, until we are 
either selected or short listed and the negotiations progress, I am holding 
off preparation of the legal risk memo.  Please advise if you think there is 
a need for either a DASH or a risk memo prior to our submission of a response 
(which is due October 6, 2000).

I will keep you advised as this transaction progresses.

Regards
CJG
