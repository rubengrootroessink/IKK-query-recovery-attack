A slight clarification: SOP is currently made on an individual: John J. 
Flaherty, 443 Congress St., P.O.Box 11410, Portland, ME 04104-7410.  Mr. 
J.M.Gagne' of Fasken Martineau Dumoulin, a law firm in Quebec, handles the 
corporate records but not SOP.  KC

I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process 
upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel. 
This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago, 
whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process 
relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states. 
Currently, that agent is NRAI. 

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies 
requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific 
business needs. 

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned 
company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific 
business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone on 
your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company 
is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.
