Subject: Re: Sysco - continuing internal difficulties  

As I reported at the Operating committee meeting Monday morning, we are 
developing a dedicated team to address EES/ENA coordination issues.  Jim 
Keller will head the team from our perspective.  We all recognize that last 
week's events were unfortunate, and are developing processes and procedures.  
Several meetings with ENA legal have occurred and more are planned.
We will keep you posted and in the meantime, feel free to call Jim or 
myself.  We know how important this issue is to the organization.

Thanks.  Vicki

Hope that you are both in the loop with Richard Z. as he tries to lead some 
of this tie-breaking.  (This is still the California piece).  Clearly, at 
least the optics around this demonstrate a need for evolving legal processes 
around our changing internal approval relationship with ENA.   I should have 
an update around noon today from the deal team.

Subject: Re: Sysco  

Richard, I have forwarded to you a copy of the Sysco California contract 
marked to show comments  made by ENA. Although ENA was very responsive, I did 
not find their comments substantive but rather style/preference oriented. 
Given that this was the first time they had seen this document, I was 
somewhat surprised. Jim Keller (who worked with Debbie) and Debbie reviewed  
them and took some of their suggestions and ignored others. I don't  think 
ENA completely understands the retail business as some of their comments were 
more wholesale oriented. Debbie can give you her view as well as information 
on the "process" the two legal departments used to work through the document. 
I do not know what  conversations Don Black had with ENA legal. 

I think what frustrated Hector and me so much was the number of people who 
had to review the contract, make suggestions, the suggestions had to be 
incorporated into the document (which, remember, Sysco had already seen 
once), then re-reviewed by the person making the suggestion. I realize that 
we are breaking new ground and that it is a California contract but there 
needs to be a better, less time consuming and smoother way. 

I have listed below most of the people who reviewed the contract (to the best 
of my memory). Several of these individuals were difficult to corner as this 
was not really their responsibility but given the state (California), were 
asked to do so. 


Debbie Asmus - lead attorney
Mike Smith - commodity
Jim Kellar - commodity
California Counsel - enforceability issue for Calif.
Elizabeth Sager - ENA legal
Paul Peppitone - Andrews & Curth - outside counsel - drafting
Beth Apke - tax
Don Black - commodity
Neil Bresnan - California curves
Sean Holmes - 
Nina Nguyen - mark to market
Denise Furey - credit
Chris Riley - commodity structuring
Mary Sapalio - account services
Hector Gutierrez - 
Chuck Randall

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Chuck
