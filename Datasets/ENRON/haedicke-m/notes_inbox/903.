A message from Will McNamara: 

If you enjoy receiving our free, daily IssueAlert, then we are sure that you 
will truly benefit from SCIENTECH's two new information sources: 

Generation IssueAlert
Emerging Technology IssueAlert 

Following the same successful format of the daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert, which 
will still be distributed via e-mail every day, the Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert will be delivered to you on Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday. 

The Generation IssueAlert focuses exclusively on issues related to the 
generation business within the energy industry. Issues that may be covered in 
the Generation IssueAlert include power supply, reliability, distributed 
generation, wholesale trading, developments in fuel supply (coal, natural 
gas, nuclear, renewables), and new competitive markets. 

The Emerging Technology IssueAlert focuses on new technologies that are 
emerging within the energy industry. This wide-ranging column covers 
information technology, new IPOs and investments, power supply technologies 
(e.g., fuel cells), billing software, energy management software, 
transmission services (RTOs), and new start-up companies. 

Both the Generation IssueAlert and the Emerging Technology IssueAlert are 
subscription-based publications. Generation IssueAlert costs $495 for a 
one-year subscription. The New Technology IssueAlert is $695 for a one-year 
subscription.  And you can get both Issue Alerts for $895, a 25% savings.  

Just like our daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert, the new Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert will be delivered directly to your e-mail 
address in an easy-to-read HTML format. 

Don't miss this opportunity to subscribe to the new Generation IssueAlert and 
Emerging Technology IssueAlert. As our successful daily SCIENTECH IssueAlert 
covers a wide-range of issues, our two new products aim to focus in on the 
one business sector that is most important to you--providing the analysis 
that you need to maintain continued success in your business. 

Sincerely,  

Will McNamara
Director Electric Industry Analysis
