Mark and Jim:

I am forwarding to you an email from my partner, Brian Westlake, of our 
Toronto office asking if Enron would have any objections to us acting for a 
potential buyer of the business carried on by Azurix.  To my knowledge, we 
have not been retained by Enron as I understand most of the business is 
located in the United States.  However, should you be looking to retain 
Blakes in this transaction, I would appreciate it if you would let me know as 
soon as possible.

I look forward to your reply and trusting all is well.

Regards,

Dan
