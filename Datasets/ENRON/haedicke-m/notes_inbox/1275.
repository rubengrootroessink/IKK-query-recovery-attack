Greg Piper raised the following questions:

Is ENW a marketing affiliate?
Is EOL a marketing affiliate?
Sally Beck's organization?
Can Beck's organization process transactions for CMS pipelines?
Could Sally use ETS resources to do processing for CMS?

Greg is looking for some guidance by Tuesday.  Let's discuss.
