Dear IssueAlert Subscriber, 

The demand for the undergrounding of power lines grows each year but the cost 
for burying lines grows as well. Estimates for utility burial can range from 
$500,000 to $3 million per mile, in comparison to $120,000 per mile for the 
construction of overhead lines. 

Utilities are experiencing tough franchise negotiations as cities link 
undergrounding agreements to renewals of franchises. Communities apply 
tremendous political pressure on utilities to underground systems in their 
commercial as well as residential neighborhoods. 

"Electric Utility Undergrounding" analyzes existing undergrounding programs, 
and provides an understanding of how regulatory bodies and utilities around 
the country resolve this challenging problem. This 80-page special report 
from SCIENTECH, profiles 12 state programs and is being sold online for a 
limited time for $1,200 (a $300 discount over the list price of $1,500).
