Hi Terry,

Long time no see, hope you are well.

Our credit trading group is starting to build up a Japan team (out of London) 
and the person who will head that group and has just started with us here in 
Tokyo is Mike Gordon (email address above).  Mike has indicated that he would 
like to get involved with ISDA here and I recall that last year we discussed 
getting some Enron traders involved in ISDA so this may be a good start.

I understand that the above newly established group has only met once here to 
date and wonder if you would mind making direct contact with Mike, when you 
have a chance, to let him know what is happening with the group here and 
details of the next meeting.  (I will also try and be as involved as I can in 
this Sub-Committee now that we have these guys here on the ground.)
