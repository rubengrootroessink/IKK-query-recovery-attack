Mark,

following our conversation, I will fax you consolidated feedback on Marcus 
Von Bock. Could you send me your fax number. Is that number sufficiently 
secure or should I call your assistant to let her know to collect it? Please 
let me know how you want to deal with that.

Thanks



       Mark
