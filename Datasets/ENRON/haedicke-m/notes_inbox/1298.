Does anyone know Capital One Bank (Europe) PLC?  They have applied for
Non-Dealer Financial Subscriber membership.

The contact given is Jim Stevens, Treasury Analyst, located at 18 Hanover
Square, London.

He says the bank is an end-user.  Identifies Capital One Bank as a credit
card issuer offering other limited retail banking services.

Thanks
Mary
