Please be advised that, through the distribution of this email, Global 
Finance is adding the following language to the Roseville FASH dated May 9, 
2001:

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and 
pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested 
for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of 
these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, 
thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  
Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be 
requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this 
DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure 
which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.
