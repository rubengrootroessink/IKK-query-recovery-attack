Mark,

Remembering that we missed each other in London, will you be at the AGM in
DC? If so, shall we get together briefly? I met Mark Evans from your team
in
London recently and had a useful chat about the state of the relationship
between CC and Enron. I also know that David Yeres from our NY office met
with you some time back in Houston. He will also be at the AGM and would, I
know, like to follow up on that meeting.

Best regards.

Mark
