Frank and Randy,

Attached are clean and marked versions of the CEG/CEG-Rio DASH for your 
review.  Any comments you make with respect to tightening up and shortening 
the "Risk Matrix" would be appreciated.  I would also like to receive a copy 
of the Legal Risk Memo before we finalize this.  We have classsified this 
transaction as "Merchant" which obviated the requirement for Board of 
Directors approval.

Your assistance in finalizing this DASH and hopefully have it circulated and 
fully executed by week's end is appreciated.

Regards,

Dave

Dave and Andre: Attached is a final version of the CEG/CEG-Rio DASH for 
circulation and approval.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement is anticipated to 
be signed on Sunday morning, April 29th.  Given the short time period and in 
order to expedite, please circulate a separate copy to each approving party. 

Mark:  Since you have asked me to sign the DASH, I wanted to make sure you 
had a copy for review in connection with your legal risk memo.  As you will 
see, the DASH goes into a little more detail than the bullet-point format of 
the legal risk memo would allow.

Thank you,
Randy
