Acting CFTC Chair Jim Newsome was at the White House on Wednesday for a 
meeting with Andy Card, White House COS and Clay Johnson, Presidential 
Personel.
Word is that meeting went very well.  If all background checks went well, the 
conventional wisdom is that Newsome will soon be nominated for CFTC Chair.

After that, there will be one open seat and another possible opening if 
Chairman Spears is not renominated for another term.  I have been approached 
by Walt Lukken on the Senate Agriculture Committee and Ryan Weston House 
Agriculture Committee to ask for our support of their candidacies for the 
open seat(s).  I told them that we are focused on the Chair position and we 
will meet with them after the announcement.
