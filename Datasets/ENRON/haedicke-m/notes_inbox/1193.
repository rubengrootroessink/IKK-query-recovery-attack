Dear ISDA Board of Directors:

As you know, ISDA launched it's Library of Interactive ISDA Documentation at
the AGM earlier this month. It's introduction marks the latest in a number
of e-commerce initiatives made by the Association in the last year.

Quite a few members in attendance at the AGM expressed interest in acquiring
the CD Rom.  These members were sent follow-up materials regarding pricing
and the ordering process last week. Announcements were sent to Primary
Contacts and members of the Documentation and Operations committees as well.


ISDA would now like to give the Board the opportunity to acquire the CD Rom
for their organizations.  Below is a summary of some features the Library of
Interactive Documentation provides:

  * Installation on company intranets for use by employees
internationally

 * Search all documents in the library simultaneously

 * Locate key terms within and between documents quickly

 * Easy access to sections, subsections and appendices

 * Reduce expenditures on booklets by having one pool of
information to be used company-wide

The Library of Interactive ISDA Documentation is licensed for one year from
June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002.  However, ISDA is offering members an
additional month of free usage if a license is purchased now.  The license
fee for Primary Global members is $15,000 USD per year.  The fee for Primary
International members is $10,000 per year.  The terms and conditions of the
license are detailed in the license agreement attached along with the CD Rom
order form.

As the Board is aware, ISDA's goal is to listen to industry professionals
and its membership and address their needs. The release of the Library of
Interactive ISDA Documentation addresses the needs of the Association's
membership not only by providing pertinent information, but also by making
that information available in a format consistent with the way ISDA members
do business today.

To submit your order form please complete and return by reply email or by
fax on 212 332 1212. I can be reached by telephone on 212 332 1205 should
you have further questions.


Regards
Corrinne Greasley
