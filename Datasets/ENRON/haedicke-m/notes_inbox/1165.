Hello Sheila and Mark.  Harlan talked to me about this news when I was in 
California last week.  I view it very positively;  I worked extensively with 
several of the Rudnick folks in Chicago and in NY when I was still at V&E, 
and was impressed with them at that time.  I am curious, Sheila, what your 
views are, because as I recall we used Rudnick in connection with the Midwest 
peakers - ??  Maybe we can all catch a minute to talk when we are in San 
Antonio for the conference this week.  Look forward to seeing you both.  --  
Karen

Sheila,

I was sorry to hear about your Mom, and hope she's all right.  We missed you
last week.

I mentioned to Karen when I saw her, and wanted you and Mark to know, that
we have begun merger discussions with Piper, Marbury, Rudnick & Wolfe.
Needless to say, there's a lot of talking and tire kicking to do before any
deal would be done.  But we are all intrigued by the possibilities.  The
combined firm would be approximately 1200 lawyers with a significant
presence (over 300 lawyers) on each coast and in the mid-west.  We would
have over 500 business lawyers, with specialties in virtually every area,
and the number-1 rated real estate, development, land use and environmental
practices in the country.  What is most exciting to us is that this would be
an entirely new national firm -- Piper Rudnick is itself the product of a
merger a year ago between two large regional firms.  That will give each of
the constituents the opportunity to share what is best about their business
and culture.

I believe your group worked with Rudnick & Wolfe before they merged with
Piper.  I would be interested in knowing how that went, and also any other
reactions you, Mark or any of your colleagues may have to the merger.  I
will call you about this later today.

If you and Mark would like to visit with us and Piper jointly to discuss
what we are doing, I would be pleased to arrange that.

Harlan
