Rick:  I would like to have a presentation on local rules such as ISO rules 
in the various locations where we operate.  Can your group do this as we work 
on the legal presentations.  I believe this is already happening in part, but 
I would like to make more institutionalized.  Let me know.   Mark

Subject: The Anti-trust Seminars

I sent you along yesterday a copy of the e-mail re the participation by Rob 
and me in the seminars that Blakes is doing for the traders and originators 
in Canada.  Thinking about it more this morning, I am wondering whether the 
seminars that Sullivan & Cromwell are doing in the US are too narrow in 
their  focus.  That is, it is important for traders not merely to understand 
the competition/anti-trust rules but also  the rules and practices of the 
market surveillance panels or committees that operate, I think, in each of 
the ISO jurisdictions.   It is that piece that Rob and I will be  trying to 
add in Canada.  Just a thought in case you want to raise it withJeff Hodge or 
Mark Haedicke.
