Sheila, thanks for your email.  I look forward to transferring on July 16 (or 
sooner if possible), and I would love to join you for lunch next week and 
also to participate in ENA meetings/events whenever possible.

Thank you!

Kenton

This is to acknowledge that you have accepted our offer of employment with 
the ENA Legal Dept. in Portland Oregon in the Power Assets/ Origination 
Group.  We understand and agree that you will not be available to start 
working with us until July 16, 2001.  If, however, you become available 
sooner, we would be pleased to accelerate your start date.  You will join us 
with your existing title and compensation.  Karen tells me that the new lease 
space will not be ready until late August or September and should you and 
Steve wish to view it, you will need your imagination since PGE has not yet 
vacated the premises.  Temporary accomodations will be made for you until the 
new space is ready.  Obviously, we are all delighted and we invite you to 
drop by the ofice at any time.  Should your schedule permit, we will want to 
start including you in certain meetings and special events.  In fact, our 
group would be delighted to see you at the Law Conference and to share lunch 
with you either Thursday or Friday.  Please let me know your plans.
