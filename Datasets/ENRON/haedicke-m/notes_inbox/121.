Alan,
Change in plans - ended up coming back to Tokyo and forgoing the trip to 
Houston.   I'm still obtaining the data from McLagan, but as soon as I have 
it, will be able to let you know how Jane's comp compares with the market.  
In terms of drawing up the contract, I'll work with Kathy and Michelle.  I 
would suggest that Michelle liase with Hideo Ohta-san at B&M in Tokyo.  
Thanks,
Caroline

I'm around all week. I would like to visit with you on Wednesday if you have 
time then. Please call me or my assistant, Nita Garcia, 713-853-9559, to

Alan,
Thanks for your note.  I will be in Houston Wednesday-Friday if you wish to 
meet and discuss.  Unfortunately, I don't have market data with me, but 
should be able to gather some information from McLagan by the end of the 
week.  One issue that needs to be addressed is the unenforceability of fixed 
term employment contracts in Japan.  Under Japanese law, a fixed term 
contract which is longer than one year binds only the employer - no 
obligation is created on the part of the employee beyond the first year of 
the contract.  I have some ideas as to how we might address.  Let me know if 
you have time to meet later this week.
Thanks,
Caroline

Last week I spoke with Mark Haedicke (who I report to within Legal), Mike 
McConnell and Joe Hirl about offering to Jane McBride a two-year employment 
contract. All three are on board with this idea. Mark will be in Tokyo later 
this week and early next week (he will be in the Tokyo office on Monday I 
believe). I want to work with you (and Sheila Walton/Kathy Neal of HR here in 
Houston) on the contract details. Our internal HR lawyer, Michelle Cash, 
would also need to be involved in the drafting of the contract working with 
Japanese outside counsel. Currently, we were thinking about a signing cash 
amount as well as some stock options at signing. In light of the market, do 
you have a feel for what those numbers should be?

Please feel free to contact me here in the office (713-853-3214) or at home 
(713-667-0525) as soon as you get this message so we can discuss further.

Regards, Alan
