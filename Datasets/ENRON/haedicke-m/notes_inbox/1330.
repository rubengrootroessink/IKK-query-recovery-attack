FYI--our local counsel's view on Domingo Cavallo (the third Minister of=20

in Wednesday's FT.  Sounds like we have friends in high places.  Pete do yo=

By the way, in talking with Gonzalo Flores at the World Bank, it looks like=

Dear Michelle,=20
Cavallo is supposed to make public his so promoted bill today or tomorrow. =
I=20
don=01%t know much about it yet. He said that he will be trying to abolish =
stamp=20
tax in the provinces but we will have to see what happens.
Please take into account that the new Ministry of Infrastructure (Carlos=20
Bastos) and former Secretary of Energy during Cavallo=01%s previous period =
is a=20
very close friend of Enron, former advisor of your company and it seems all=
=20
the energy matters will depend on him.
Although Cavallo has gathered positive reactions, the situation is extremel=
y=20
difficult and it=01%s not clear that he will get the needed support from ot=
her=20
parties (and even from the radical party)
I think we will have to wait a little bit before trying to contact him or h=

Guido I have an article from Freshfield's about a new law the Argentine=20
Congress is considering to attract foreign investment, intended to=20

also states that "it is also anticipated that several Argentine=20
provinces will enact their own legislation to facilitate projects within=20
their jurisdiction."  What do you know about it?       =20
What is everyone's pulse on Cavallo?  There are three articles about him=20
today in the Financial Times. Any thoughts on how this will impact our=20
stamp tax case?  Any chance we can get in to see him?
