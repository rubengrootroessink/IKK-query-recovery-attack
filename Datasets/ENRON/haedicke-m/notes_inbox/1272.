Script

ENA Lawyer in an Obsequious Voice:  Hey, Substitute Building Guy, I=01,m wi=
th=20
ENA Legal and I=01,ve had four office moves this past year because of=20
construction on our floor.  Please, please tell me that when we move to the=
=20
new building, I won=01,t have to move offices ever again.
=20
Substitute Building Guy (with Mark Haedicke standing next to him):  Well,=
=20
good news, I can promise you that new building will be Enron=01,s state of =
the=20
art and Jeff Skilling has mandated that there won=01,t be any more construc=
tion=20
in the new building for at least 2 years after it opens.  But as for whethe=
r=20
you=01,ll be moving offices again, I think I better let your general counse=
l,=20
Mark Haedicke address that question.  Mark.

Mark Haedicke in a dry, public service announcement deadpan:  Thanks,=20
Substitute Building Guy and thank you [lawyer=01,s name] for your question.=
 =20
[Lawyer=01,s name], as you pointed out, you have had to move 4 times this y=
ear=20
and although you may feel it=01,s been disruptive, your office moves and th=
ose=20
of your colleagues have produced some very valuable unintended consequences=
=20
that we want to continue enjoying: first, constant office moves promote=20
increased collegiality; second, constant office moves ensure that ENA Legal=
=20
remains at the "cutting edge of Enron's document retention policies"; and,=
=20
third, constant office moves have dramatically reduced our outside counsel=
=20
litigation fees since we have no documents to produce during discovery=20
requests.  As a result, I am pleased to announce our new "quarterly office=
=20
move policy".  Our new quarterly office move policy will continue to promot=
e=20
the foregoing objectives and, in fact, I intend to suggest to Jim Derrick a=
t=20
the next general counsel=01,s meeting that we implement this policy on a=20
corporate basis.  Remember, we may be done with construction, but we=01,ll =
never=20
be done moving. =20
