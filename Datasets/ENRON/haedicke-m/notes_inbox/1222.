RE: Take TheLaw.net Challenge!
FROM: Mark Whitney, CEO/President, TheLaw.net Corporation
HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net  REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

If you are a savvy legal compusearcher you will not want to miss this 
opportunity to take the TheLaw.net Challenge, below. On the other hand, if 
you ever feel challenged when it comes to computer research, stay with us. We 
can help.

Before you begin, forget that TheLaw.net's searchable cases overlap West and 
Lexis' to the tune of more than four million entries across more than 175 
Federal and state appellate jurisdictions. Just put it out of your mind.

Forget that it is very easy, using our software, to quickly learn for 
yourself how courts have treated the particular cite, statute, rule or 
regulation you are interested in learning more about. Forget that it is easy 
for you to quickly pop up cases when all you have is a cite, party name, 
author, counsel, court, and so forth.

Forget that one of the major differences between TheLaw.net and The Two 
Headed Monster, is that everyone gets all of our highly usable, authoritative 
data with a national scope, all for a low flat rate. Finally, forget (if you 
can) that TheLaw.net delivers all of this and much, much more, on an 
unlimited use basis, directly to your desktop under the following terms and 
conditions:

--$345 annually for you; regularly $395 (Save $50 until April 30)
--$575 for you and a partner, annual unlimited use rate (Small Office Special)
--$1195 for you and four others, annual unlimited use rate (Workgroup Edition)
--April Enterprise Specials:
----$1895 for 10 annual, unlimited use rate (April Special)
----$3995 for 25 annual, unlimited use rate (April Special)
----$7995 for 50 annual unlimited use rate (April Special)
--pay only for active users
--paralegals, librarians and backoffice staff are on us
--conduct real legal research with a seamless national scope
--all subscribers install at work, at home and on their laptops
--no passwords or user names
--unlimited tech and reference attorney aftercare
--no CDs to chase around the office
--all you can eat - no surprises - no gamesmanship
--30 day unconditional money back guarantee

We recognize that West and Lexis are King when it comes to enhancing public 
records and churning them in their searchable databases. But, for all of 
these highfalutin enhancements, one rarely hears the word value uttered in 
the same sentence with the names of either of these two companies.

Which leads to some questions that you ought to be asking:

Q: How much are all of these enhancements worth to you?
Q: Are these enhancements timesaving or frustrating?
Q: Does it make sense to continue with onerous annual contracts?
Q: Can the list of expensive items be shortened with low, flat-rate options?
Q: Rather than switching, should you simply redefine relationships with 
existing vendors in light of less expensive, authoritative options?
Q: How can you ever expect to fully leverage publicly available web based 
documents and databases on behalf of the enterprise in the absence of a set 
of standards, processes and best practices for doing so?

The answer to the last question is to have a one-stop front-end to that 
subset of the more than two billion pages online that belong a click or two 
away on your desktop. That's where we come in. Proprietary searchable case 
law aside, TheLaw.net, not West or Lexis, is King when it comes to getting 
you around online.

--WEB BASED PRIMARY AUTHORITY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER

There is no longer a debate about whether publicly available web based 
documents and databases will continue to loom large in the practice of law. 
That debate was completely foreclosed when West recently bought FindLaw for a 
reported $37M and Lexis poured a bunch of money into a portal called 
lexisONE. Both companies are now attempting to brand these free sites as the 
best place to begin when you want to find authoritative information on the 
public web.

Are these web sites the best place for seasoned professionals to begin? As an 
attorney, you are, per se, a sophisticated consumer of information. 
Accordingly, we invite you to take TheLaw.net Challenge and decide for 
yourself.

--HERE IS YOUR ASSIGNMENT SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT

Using lexisONE, find Chapter 60 (Tax) of the Consolidated Laws of New York. 
Do you have a stopwatch or timer ready? Good. By the way, lexisONE is located 
at: http://www.lexisone.com. Before starting, read on for a heads up on a 
couple of key factors relevant to your assignment.

Starting at lexisONE should give you a big advantage. Why? Well, to begin 
with, this is Lexis we're talking about; the same company that just took out 
a full page ad in the current edition of Law Office Computing which claims, 
in relevant part, that if "you're a solo or small-firm attorney, the LexisONE 
service has everything you need to practice more effectively, run your office 
more efficiently, and keep up with the latest legal tools and trends."

So are you ready? Are you excited? You should be, because you are about to 
discover just how effective and efficient you can be using lexisONE since, 
after all, they have "everything you need".

Oh yes. One more datapoint before you begin. If you are lucky enough to 
eventually locate the link to the Consolidated Laws of New York that lexisONE 
provides, be forewarned that this link has been DYSFUNCTIONAL for at least 
the past two weeks.

Why? Well, for one thing, the State of New York upgraded its massive web site 
on, or about, March 23, 2001. Since then, this portion of lexisONE's site has 
suffered from a nasty case of LINKROT. Translation: lexisONE is not current 
or complete as to some critical primary authority.

At some point the people at lexisONE obviously determined that the 
Consolidated Laws of New York were indeed among the items needed to "practice 
more effectively". Today it is hard to know what they think.

--WE PROMISED YOU A CHALLENGE

Are you skilled enough to PRETEND that the link is working while trying to 
find it anyway? This way you can still get a feel for the effectiveness and 
efficiency you would have experienced using lexisONE had the link been 
working. Incidentally, if using lexisONE, you can find this link in less than 
two minutes, you are a God to us! Really.

Now snap back to reality and consider that when you have a subscription to 
TheLaw.net you can view the specific page containing Chapter 60 of the 
Consolidated Laws in six or seven seconds by simply sliding through our 
smooth hierarchy of pre-configured Federal and State Statutes Menu. Once you 
locate the law you want to know more about, you can enter the statutory cite 
into our case law search engine, check New York from among the 175+ Federal 
and state appellate jurisdictions at your fingertips and quickly pop up a 
list of relevant cases that have construed the item you need to know more 
about.

--THELAW.NET IS A BETTER MOUSETRAP. PERIOD.

Free web site portals are fine for law students or an occasional reference 
when you are not under the gun. But, unless you have complete disregard for 
your time and your clients' best interests, if you are browsing the public 
web for purposes of serious research, you should have the right tool for the 
job. Only then will you be as "efficient" and "effective" as possible. The 
last thing you need is another ill-considered free web site.

--REMEMBER THAT CASE LAW WE TOLD YOU TO FORGET?

You can stop forgetting now and consider that subscribers to TheLaw.net 
Professional Legal Browser not only get all of that great case law with a 
national scope, but they receive slick, pre-configured menu-driven access to 
more than 50,000 web based documents and databases including Federal and 
state statutes, rules, forms, regulations, executive agency databases, 
legislative tracking tools, every major metropolitan newspaper, local rules 
and forms, pattern jury instructions, court calendars and contact 
information, expedited pathfinders to most Federal dockets, executive agency 
databases, columnists, real-time national news and wire services, corporate 
backgrounders, polls, searchable dictionaries, encyclopedias, calculators, 
selected law journals and law reviews, nearly 10,000 helpers arranged across 
dozens of practice areas, and much, much more.

If lexisONE "has everything you need" how can it be that we have 30,000 more 
deep-links to web based documents and databases and 35,000 more than FindLaw? 
Hmmm.

--THELAW.NET: THE SUM OF THE ALTERNATIVES

Within one business day of New York upgrading their web site, subscribers to 
TheLaw.net were informed via a free special email alert that we had updated 
their software and that the new homepage for the Consolidated Laws is right 
here:
http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=0

As of this writing (Sunday, April 8, 2001) LexisONE is still linked to the 
old outmoded location: http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/claws

Once this message gets passed around the Net someone at Lexis will see it and 
fix the broken link. We are happy to help out, because even when the New York 
Consolidated and Unconsolidated Law links are finally functional, LexisONE 
still merely provides the following:

--one link to New York Consolidated Laws Homepage
--one link to New York Unconsolidated Laws Homepage
--one link to the New York Constitution Homepage

--Cf. THELAW.NET PROFESSIONAL BROWSER:

--Linking by Constitutional Article, we provide 22 hand-titled links to the 
New York Constitution.
--Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide 96 hand-titled links to the 
New York Consolidated Laws, plus one link to the Consolidated Laws Homepage 
and one link to the Consolidated Laws Index for a total of 98 links.
--Linking by Statutory Subject Matter we provide 25 hand-titled links to the 
New York Unconsolidated Laws, plus one link to the Unconsolidated Laws 
Homepage for a total of 26 links.
--We provide an additional separate link to the search interface for these 
laws.
--In total, TheLaw.net provides 147 hand-titled, deep-links just to this 
discrete subset of New York primary authority.
--LexisONE provides three links and two of them are broken.

TheLaw.net literally removes more than 90% of the time wasted online. If you 
begin with lexisONE or FindLaw, you need to add an additional layer of effort 
to get to specific statutory subject areas of the Consolidated Laws that we 
completely eliminate with our detailed deep-links.

--ON THE OTHER HAND, LEXISONE MAY BE "GOOD ENOUGH"

Surely, lexisONE must have some replicable process in place for maintaining 
their links. But if statutes from a major metropolitan state can disappear 
from the radar, what happens when you have a really important issue to 
research, such as: "Do Trendy Clothes Catch Trendy Clients?" We are not 
lying. See for yourself. (This link works.)
http://www.lexisone.com/lifestyle/style/040101b.html

It could be that our standards are unreasonably high. Maybe we should take 
our lead from Lexis-Nexis Chief Technology Officer Allan McLaughlin who made 
the following lexisONE observation in the recent article "Lexis-Nexis and 
West Battle Online", published by The American Lawyer and law.com: "It's not 
our best product," confides McLaughlin, "but for a lot of lawyers, it's good 
enough.'"

Good enough? Hopefully you are not one of the THOSE lawyers.

Given the inclusion, in our tool, of searchable proprietary case law, we have 
tried to clarify some of the differences between a marginally maintained free 
directory and a true best practices software solution. We thank you for 
taking TheLaw.net Challenge.

--CONSIDER OUR VISION: A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW FLAT-RATE

TheLaw.net, privately held and successful from Day One, represents the next 
logical step; a big improvement over slogging through two billion web pages 
and otherwise watching legal research costs spiral out of control at a time 
when with normal free market principles at work, such costs would be 
plummeting.

Imagine. No surprises. No meters. No printing, downloading, pay-per-view or 
on-demand fees. In short, none of the gamesmanship you have come to expect 
and never appreciated.

At your option, we can build your packages and deliver them today via our web 
site or we can ship CDs via U.S. Priority Mail or FedEx. We thank you for 
your time and we hope to hear from you soon while the April savings last!
