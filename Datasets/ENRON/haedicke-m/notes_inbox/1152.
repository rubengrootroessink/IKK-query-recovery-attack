Mark;

We were extremely pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the 
Rossell? law firm in Lima, Peru, especially while studying the possibility to 
bid for the Camisea Project.  They are excellent lawyers with local & int'l 
experience, very responsive and well connected with governmental authorities.

Rgds,

Sami

Hey guys, I have just noticed that "Enron Metals  and Commodities" has opened 
an office in the same building where we are  located.? If you know of any 
person I may contact to intend an approach, I would really appreciate it.
