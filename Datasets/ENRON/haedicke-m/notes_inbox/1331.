Before the Internet you could not Shepardize for $4 or Keycite(r) for $3.75. 
You had to be a subscriber. Today all you need is a credit card.
See, e.g.: http://www.westlaw.com/SubOptions/other.wl
see also: http://web.lexis.com/xchange/Forms/uas/Catalog.asp

In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and 
http://www.lexis.com is available on-demand whenever you cannot quickly find 
the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why 
is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors?

Simple. With everything in the "Wexis" universe always just a click or two 
away on the Internet, you no longer need to pick and choose resources and 
interestingly, you no longer necessarily require expensive subscriptions. For 
years, the management question has been whether to make that onerous annual 
commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the Internet, you can 
have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on a pay-per-view 
basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But that's easy once 
you know your options.


--USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL?

TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For 
instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and 
state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of 
cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to 
learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt 
of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored 
arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case.

For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. 
Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for 
themselves because at some point in their career something happened which 
caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing 
headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, 
high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be 
very useful or very confusing and unnecessary.


--THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE

We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work 
in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a 
relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or 
otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, 
organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, 
the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely 
where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you 
can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience 
teaches, however, that by deploying TheLaw.net in your world:

----you may discover that your online productivity increases ten fold
----the list of expensive subscription items may be much shorter
----you may discover that it makes sense to use Wexis only a transaction basis

We have subscribers who will tell you that this is a great way to run a 
business. Clients' expectations are set at the front end. You recover 100% of 
your costs on the back side and the embarrassment of finessing or eating 
unanticipated charges are added to what we hope is a long list of learning 
experiences.
See, e.g., http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

General practitioners frequently see us as a sensible, low flat-rate go-to 
resource and when necessary, they supplement with Wexis. Specialists 
sometimes choose to cling to their elegant practice or jurisdiction specific 
slice of Wexis, adding us on as "meter insurance" for those occasions when 
The Plan doesn't cut. All seem to recognize that TheLaw.net has indeed 
developed the definitive best practices software solution for getting around 
online; a solution that allows you to instantly begin leveraging tens of 
thousands of critical web based documents and databases on behalf of your 
online enterprise.


--A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW, FLAT-RATE

--------$395 annually for you
--------$575 for you and a partner
--------$1195 for your five-user workgroup
--------Unlimited access to everything we have
