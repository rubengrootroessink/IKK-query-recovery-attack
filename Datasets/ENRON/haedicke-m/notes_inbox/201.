I exchanged voice mails with Rob Pickel last week to confirm that he got the 
submission.  His tone one could describe as polite but "guarded". He said he 
would let us know.

Well we gave it our best shot and we now await their response. I suspect our 
proposal may be a bit like Cathy Freeman in the 200 metres. A win over Marion 
Jones is  possible but no more.

Everyone was intrigued that Enron submitted a proposal.  However, it is 
difficult to guess the outcome.  Mark
