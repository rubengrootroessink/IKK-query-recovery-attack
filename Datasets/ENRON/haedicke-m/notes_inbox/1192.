Terry:

Hope you are doing well.

I will e-mail to you later today a copy of the Master Purchase and Sale 
Agreement that we use here in the US for the trading of SO2 emission 
allowances or credits.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. My direct 
phone line is 713-853-3214.

Regards, Alan

A Japanese trading firm has a keen interest in the above derivatives. I
would be grateful if you could send me the Master SO2 Allowance Purchase and
Sale Agreement and any other materials you may feel appropriate for novices.
They could be the first Japanese trading firm member of ISDA.
