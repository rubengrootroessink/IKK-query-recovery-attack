Thanks Wade.  Bruce and Mark, let's discuss after the holiday.  Paul 
generally does a good job of communicating with Houston but as in all things 
there may be some room for improvement on both sides.  Have a great 
Thanksgiving.

Rob/Mark/Bruce -- I'm not copying you directly on these messages below as I 
don't want others to think they have not been doing their job and I am 
calling them on the carpet. I think the legal team has been doing exactly 
what has been expected from them, but maybe some of our newer business people 
haven't understood the need for India legal to communicate freely and often 
directly to Houston legal. I'll take care of that.  But after my recent visit 
to Houston, and discussions there with you and others, I just want 
information to flow freely and often between India and Houston. So I'm trying 
to make sure that happens by encouraging info flow below. If you ever feel 
you need more, please let me know. 

I'll also let you 3 decide how you want info to flow from the India legal 
team up to Houston. You may wish to have them deal directly with just one of 
you or all 3. Your call, and you can communicate this to the India legal team 
as to how you want communication to occur.

Wade

Paul -- I'm all in favor of going after GE, but part of that is probably 
emotions. But we will also never meet a tougher litigation opponent, so we 
better be prepared and have thought through all the ramifications. I'm sure 
you are doing this, but make sure you keep Rob, Mark and Bruce in the loop, 
and any other people they might want you to keep involved.

In that regard, after several meetings in Houston on general DPC matters, 
please ensure that you keep Rob, Mark and Bruce up to speed on all DPC legal 
matters. We need to make sure the information flow is transparent and 
seamless not only up the business side but also the legal side. This will 
only become more important as we go into our 2001 challenges.

Thanks,
Wade

Subject: Re: Re(2): 9FA Issues

For your info we have contacted Medway a plant in the UK which has had 
similar compressor blade failures on the 9FA's. This problem seems to be a 
"type fault" and along that line we have sounded out the Insurers and Medway 
whether they would be interested in taking a joint action against GE on the 
basis that the GT's GE has supplied are not fit for purpose. The response was 
a resounding yes, with the insurers wanting to set up a meeting between the 
affected parties. This was done on a confidential basis and I have not pulled 
the trigger on setting this up. (Jim Boullion, the insurance contact was 
David Way). Our legal advice is that it would be very difficult to take this 
kind of action given the extent of the no consequentials language in the 
contract, under NY law. However this point may be a reasonable Hammer over GE 
if they cut up rough and give us a bad deal. I think a joint action in the 
market could severely affect GE's sales position of the 9FA product range, 
whether we have a strong case or not. Gordon Grimes and the litigation team 
are tasked with trying to find us an angle on which to sue.

Further points to take note of below are:
Medway got stiffed by GE with the cost of repairs and extended warranty, 
whereas we got these covered in our last deal.
The insurance market dried up in the UK on the insurability of these rotors
Final insurance costs rose 300% and their deductable went over 60 days (Ours 
is currently 14 days! We negotiated it down from 45days last year on our 
insurance renewal programme.
Insurabiltiy of the GT's, including phase 2, is going to be a challenge and 
MSEB is going to resist paying any increase in premium. Insurance cost is a 
pass through to MSEB.
We need to be cognisant of these facts when dealing with GE next week.

Medway has experienced two compressor failures, the first one on CT2 in 
November 99 when an R4 tip broke off and resulted in a major compressor 
failure. The rotor was replaced with their spare one. The second failure was 
more recent in July 2000, on CT1, when five of the R2 blade tips broke off 
and caused secondary damages to rows R11 and R13. In this case, though GE 
advocated site repair of the rotor, the insurance company refused to accept 
it. Medway had to send the rotor for refurbishment to the GE repair facility 
before they could get reinsure this turbine.  The costs of repair were borne 
by Medway and; all warranties had run out.

Both gas turbines had the old design of compressor blades. Subsequent to the 
failure, robust compressor blades were installed in row 2-5 and 9-16 on both 
compressors. 

CT2 is running with the new compressor blades since December 99. A September 
2000 CI and boroscope inspection on this unit revealed minor burring of R0 
stage blades. CT1 is running with robust blades since October 2000.

Though Tim Sharp was a bit circumspect on commercial questions, he did 
indicate that their insurance deductibles had gone over 60 days, with a 
premium increase of about 300% and  the insurance market dried up in UK and 
they had to get about 20% of the cover from the US.

Raman if you have not done this contact Medway immediately and swap notes. 
Find out if it is the same problem as ours and find out what they did with GE 
to resolve it commercially. Do this as fast as you can.

Mr Raman

As you will be aware from the 9FA Users group, Medway had great difficulty
obtaining Insurance, due to our renewal coincided with the inspection of
CT1 compressor, once the rotor blade damage was identified, without
replacing the R2 through R5 (+ 17th stage fillet BBF) it was impossible to
re-insure CT1.

You must now be in a similar situation, self insure maybe the answer, a
lots the 9FA Users now appear to have gone this way.

The insurance broker AES uses is Aon Group Construction & Engineering

I have spoken to Philip Veale who is willing to discuss your situation
with you.
