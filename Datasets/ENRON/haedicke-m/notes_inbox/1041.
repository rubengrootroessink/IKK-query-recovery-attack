25th Annual CIS Conference Begins in Albuquerque; 
Complex IT Issues to Be Addressed 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]The 25th annual CIS Conference began today in Albuquerque, N.M. For 
the next three days, I will be attending sessions and workshops at the 
conference, interviewing key leaders of billing software and customer care 
management companies, and gathering information about the new trends in 
technology and IT systems that changes in the energy industry are demanding. 
Through the conference, I will write each morning's IssueAlert from the 
conference floor, so that if you are not physically at the conference, you 
can still participate through "virtual attendance."  

I am particularly looking forward to the keynote presentation scheduled to be 
delivered on May 17 by former President George Bush. Coincidentally, the 
former president will speak on the same day that his son, current President 
George W. Bush, unveils his long-awaited energy plan. This should make for 
some interesting dialogue, which I will be sure to pass along. 

Some of you who are not directly involved in CIS (customer information 
systems) may question the importance of this rapidly changing part of the 
energy industry. So let me provide a brief overview of how CIS serves as the 
foundation for much of "next-generation" business transactions in the 
evolving energy industry, which also will indicate the kinds of issues that 
will be addressed at this week's conference. 

Although customer care, meter reading and billing have always been 
fundamental parts of a utility's operation, deregulation has drastically 
changed the rules of the game. First, we have witnessed an influx of new 
energy providers (which has raised the competitive bar considerably) and 
companies that seek to manage what was once under the exclusive domain of the 
regulated utility (meter reading, billing systems, remittance processing, 
etc.). In addition, the business model of the traditional utility has changed 
dramatically over the last 10 years or so. Many utilities have become more 
horizontally integrated, meaning that they have established multiple entities 
to handle the unbundled services that they provide in new markets. Not 
surprisingly, the information systems that were employed under a regulated 
model are now rather insufficient to accommodate the needs of a deregulated 
market. Yet, at the same time, utilities often do not know how to replace 
their existing data systems (or have the time to do so). 

Nevertheless, an essential element to the utility's or energy company's 
growth is a comprehensive billing software and customer management system. 
Customers often demand online energy usage and billing data that is available 
on a 24/7 basis. In addition, deregulation has allowed utilities and energy 
companies that previously operated in a narrow service territory to expand 
into new regions. As these utilities and companies enter different markets, 
they seek to eliminate various automated and manual processes required by 
vertically integrated systems that were required by legacy systems. This can 
result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back 
office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes, 
all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software 
that is available from many competing companies. Much of the software that is 
now available is capable of handling many functions required by retailers, 
from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load 
forecasting.  

The challenges that exist within the CIS space are many. An energy company 
basically has two options with regard to billing / customer care / customer 
relationship management (CRM). The first option is for the energy company to 
purchase the billing software directly from a software provider and manage 
its own billing needs. The second option is to completely outsource the 
entire billing / customer care services to a company that will manage the 
entire service. I have seen some reports indicating that up to 80 percent of 
deployments of systems for customer relationship management fail. Thus, any 
decision that an energy company makes with regard to its CIS network 
constitutes a critical (and expensive) strategic step. 

In addition, the capability of an outsourced billing provider to handle the 
complex billing needs of a utility is still a concern. Enlogix is the largest 
application service provider with over 3 million end customers in production 
today. Orcom is the second largest, with over 1 million "live" customers. 
Peace Software and IBM Global Solutions just announced a deal to provide full 
customer management services for Xcel Energy's 3.5 million customers, which 
represents the largest contract of its kind to date. As the market for 
outsourced customer management in the utility industry is still rather 
nascent, there are lingering concerns about how effectively utility customers 
will be migrated to a new software system. Further, the variances between 
commercial and industrial (C&I) and residential billing are also a concern. 
Therefore, these two classes of customers typically are billed by different 
systems. 

There are other challenges that the CIS industry faces, including: 

California and other states are causing legislative and regulatory bodies to 
reconsider deregulation, which is providing uncertainty around the 
requirements and timing for such systems. 
Multi-jurisdictional utilities are being faced with decisions on how to 
provide customer care that is regulated (and rate-recoverable) in one state,  
while being competitive (and not recoverable) in another state. 
Public utility commissions are imposing code-of-conduct rules that disallow 
the sharing of information across the various parts of the utility business 
(in this case, wires and retail). This causes further complexity on how to 
bill these various customers. 
The new deregulated world requires new functionality such as load profiling 
at the residential level, load forecasting, wholesale-to-retail contracting, 
and settlements that did not exist in the regulated world. 

The CIS conference will offer the venue for stakeholders in this market to 
exchange information and engage in a dialogue on these and other challenges. 
Various workshops will take place, focusing on call center operations, 
outsourcing versus Web-based CIS systems, short- and long-term billing 
strategies, interfacing CRM and CIS, meter reading advances, and a technology 
forecast for the industry. In addition, more than 100 vendors are expected to 
provide overviews of their service offerings at the conference.  

The billing / customer care market is arguably one of the most competitive 
and complex businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation. Yet, it is 
certain that this market will only become more complex and competitive as 
deregulation continues to unfold in the United States and internationally. 
Hopefully, this week's CIS conference will provide valuable insights into the 
direction in which this fundamental part of the energy industry is headed.

conference (and its potential correlation with President George W. Bush's 
expected energy plan).
