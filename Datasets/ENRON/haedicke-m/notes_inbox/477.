I am hearing that it may be premature to do an ISDA energy conference in
Tokyo because almost all the products being discussed so far are physical.
What do you think?

Hi Mark,

There will be a one-day WRMA conference here (Morten Erik and Mark Tawney
are involved in these arrangements and Mr. Wani, lawyer of local derivative
fame will be talking at the conference) in late Feb or early March.  Date
will be fixed later this week, likely to be March 5.

Jane:

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard
there may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard
of the earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to
go forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the
traders.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Mark
