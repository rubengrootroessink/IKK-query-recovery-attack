Mark--Here is the legal risk memo on the PSCo PPA.  I am also excepting bel=
ow=20
the two sections of the Agreement that present the timing issue that Dave=
=20
Delaney noted regarding the PSCo  condition precedent for CPUC approval=20
having a date of Dec. 21, while the ENA conditions for Board approval and=
=20
satisfaction of due diligence having a date of Dec. 1. =20

PSCO's dates for CPUC approval:

6.4 (A) PSCo shall have made commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any=
=20
required approvals of the CPUC as described in Section 18.2(B) and, on or=
=20
before December 21, 2000, shall have provided written notice to Seller=20
stating either (i) that PSCo has obtained such approvals from the CPUC in=
=20
final form, not subject to agency rehearing, without conditions materially=
=20
modifying this PPA, or (ii) that PSCo waives the requirement for such=20
approvals; provided, that if PSCo has not provided such notice to Seller on=
=20
or before December 12, 2000, then the Commercial Operation Milestone Date f=
or=20
completion of construction and availability of the fifth and sixth turbines=
=20
in the Facility shall be extended, on a day-for-day basis, for each day aft=
er=20
December 12, 2000, through and including December 21, 2000, that PSCo has n=
ot=20
provided such notice to Seller .  Any extension of the Commercial Operation=
=20
Milestone Date for the fifth and sixth turbines in the Facility pursuant to=
=20
this Section 6.4(E) shall run concurrently with, and shall not be in additi=
on=20
to, any extension of the Commercial Operation Milestone Date under any othe=
r=20
provision of this PPA.

18.1 (A) This PPA is subject to review by the CPUC as part of PSCo's final=
=20
1999 Electric Integrated Resources Plan (=01&IRP=018).  Under the CPUC IRP =
Rules,=20
the Commission must approve PSCo's proposed resource acquisition portfolio,=
=20
of which this PPA is one part.  The CPUC may also review this PPA to=20
determine whether it is consistent with the Request for Proposals issued by=
=20
PSCo on January 28, 2000.  PSCo shall use its best efforts to obtain CPUC=
=20
approval of its IRP and, if necessary, Commission approval of this PPA, as=
=20
soon as reasonably practicable.  PSCo shall have the right to terminate thi=
s=20
PPA by notice to Seller at any time on or before December 21, 2000 as a=20
consequence of the failure of the CPUC to approve the IRP or this PPA by th=
at=20
date, and shall in any event be required to provide the notice set forth in=
=20
Section 6.4(E).  Absent such notice by PSCo on or before December 21, 2000,=
=20
this contingency shall be deemed waived and this PPA shall remain in full=
=20
force and effect thereafter.

ENA's dates fpr Board approval and due diligence:

6.4 (A) Seller shall have received all necessary internal approvals,=20
including, without limitation, the approval of Seller=01,s and Enron Corp.=
=01,s=20
respective Boards of Directors according to such criteria as may be deemed=
=20
appropriate by such governing bodies, provided that if Seller does not=20
provide written notice to PSCo on or before December 1, 2000, stating that=
=20
Seller has been unable to satisfy this condition (despite its due diligence=
=20
to do so) and that this PPA and the other Project Agreements are therefore=
=20
terminated, then this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied;
(B) Seller shall have completed, to Seller's reasonable satisfaction, a due=
=20
diligence review of the Site and all matters related thereto, including=20
suitability, access, land use, zoning, permitting, noise, environmental,=20
transmission access, fuel supply, utilities, and any similar or related=20
matters with respect to the Site, provided that if Seller does not provide=
=20
written notice to PSCo on or before December 1, 2000,  stating that Seller=
=20
has been unable to satisfy this condition (despite its due diligence to do=
=20
so) and that this PPA and the other Project Agreements are therefore=20
terminated, then this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied;=20


As I said, the deal team intends to meet with PSCo next Wednesday Nov. 8 to=
=20
attempt to amend the Agreement to match our off-ramp dates with the PSCo PU=
C=20
offramp date, but the above provisions are the terms of the existing execut=
ed=20
PPA.  If you have any questions, please call.
