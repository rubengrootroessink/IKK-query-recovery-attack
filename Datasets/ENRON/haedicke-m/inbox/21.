Nora:
 
My first thoughts are to review the Solar Noncompetition Agreement (noncompete regarding the manufacture of photovoltaic cells in connection with the sale of Enron's 50% interest in the Amoco/Enron Solar Partnership to BP Amoco), the NewPower Noncompetition Agreement and the ServiceCo Noncompetition Agreement (EES new facility services venture).  My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.
 
Regards,
Robert

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

Thanks, NJD
