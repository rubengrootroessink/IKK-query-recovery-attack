Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to "rumors" that the London Receiver is allowing for such payments--for example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London "arrangement" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the "rules" may be.

Let me know how I may assist in addressing this.
