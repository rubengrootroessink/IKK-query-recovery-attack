California Develops Plan=20
to Renegotiate Long-Term=20
Power Contracts as State=20
Faces Energy Surplus=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis





[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 bi=
llion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal=
f of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=
t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=
onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. "=
There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =
renegotiated," said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=
ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission=
 and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =
work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =
gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=
ce January.=20

Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ? remember that? For some,=
 it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill-f=
ated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating con=
sequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headline=
s in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, ev=
en though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat, =
some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continu=
e to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were taken =
to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into a =
very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs (=
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & =
Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on =
their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are far=
 from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence cau=
sing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questio=
nable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20

At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=
rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=
rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=
illiams (NYSE: WMB) to name a few back in early 2001, a time at which whole=
sale power prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primar=
y benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the state's reliance on t=
he volatile spot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a =
whole the contracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 y=
ears or more. Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the =
state to assume the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the cont=
racts at that time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solven=
cy of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue =
that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices =
were the highest.=20

Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=
ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=
mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=
ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=
ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=
ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=
te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=
h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20

As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=
e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=
t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =
the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme=
 situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=
r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=
sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=
acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20

Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=
wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =
guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=
ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=
on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=
ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =
offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =
in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =
costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=
rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=
erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=
tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=
hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=
s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=
ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=
lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds=
 of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=
ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=
-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=
arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=
ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=
iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20

The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=
ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =
California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =
that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=
cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =
conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=
ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =
state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =
the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =
sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =
to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=
sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=
ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=
ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=
llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=
each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20

Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=
tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=
rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=
ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=
dy own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be e=
asily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.=
, which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the s=
tate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it "wouldn't be an=
ything that Calpine would use." The company reportedly has finished three n=
ew power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing i=
ncentive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to re=
negotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale=
 prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been =
a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings. However, since t=
he onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have maint=
ained that re-negotiation would not be possible as they had already locked =
themselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers.=20

Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco=
urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, a=
t least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerou=
s boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that alre=
ady have long-term contracts with the state (such as Calpine) may not be en=
ticed by the financing incentive, and those companies that don't have long-=
term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl=
ants in California. All of this could create a situation in which Californi=
a has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in a=
nother shortage situation 10 or more years down the line.=20

Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt =
to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead =
of its transmission lines, however, the state now is examining its opportun=
ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network (including dams and powerho=
uses) owned by the state's largest electric utility. Note that under its re=
structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval, Pacific G=
as & Electric Co. would split from its parent, PG&E Corp., and transfer gen=
erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie=
s, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory=
 Commission (FERC). State regulators do not like this plan, and thus are se=
eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o=
f Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta=
te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control.=20

Moreover, even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo=
st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m=
arket, state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental =
parts of the state's energy infrastructure. Remember that Gov. Davis spent =
much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE=
 and SDG&E for the purchase of the utilities' transmission networks. Pacifi=
c Gas & Electric Co. never was interested in selling its transmission asset=
s, which it believed the state's offer grossly undervalued. One of the main=
 reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern =
by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume o=
peration of the complex transmission networks. Nevertheless, in addition to=
 renegotiating the long-term contracts, the state is still pursuing at leas=
t the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas & Electric.=20
