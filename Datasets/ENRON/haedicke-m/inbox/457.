Please let me know if you are working on any netting or collateral arrangements in support of our European trading businesses, so that we can maintain a consistent approach.

Similarly, please also be sure to contact Mary Cook who is the lawyer in Houston co-ordinating our netting and collateral arrangements with trading counterparties, many of whom trade in both Europe and the US.

Thanks

Paul
