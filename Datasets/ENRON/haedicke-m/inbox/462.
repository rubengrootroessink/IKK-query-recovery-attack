JANETTE: PLEASE CAN YOU ENSURE THAT MARK RECEIVES THIS EMAIL

As requested by Mark Evans, I attach the letter that West LB want us to issue in relation to Enron Corp rescinding the letter of credit request sent on Monday from Houston, which stated that we could not make the material litigation representation,  and now issuing an unqualified letter of credit request form.  I have attached an email containing the original request form for your information.

Please note that West LB have specifically demanded the inclusion of the last sentence to the first paragraph.  They are unfortunately now very sensitive to this issue and may still want oral confirmation on our change of tack. 

It should be noted that West LB is a party to the Enron Corp revolver (although through their New York branch, whereas this Facility is with West LB London Branch) and thus privy to the drawdown request given last week.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Mark Evans, Marcus Von Bock or me.

Kind regards
