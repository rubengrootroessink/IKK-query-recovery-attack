Hi Mark,
 
I hope you are well.
 
Please let me know if you have a position on my previous email. I believe the ECI contracts are with non bankrupt Enron entities (EI) and also they are linked to operating companies in Brazil and Bolivia (the cash considerations were in exchange for a carried interest and for equity options that ECI had a right to).
 
I realize a lot is going on but the unpaid amounts are very big sums from my standpoint and I need to discuss this with someone with the authority to give me Enron's official position. As I said Mark I want to do this before taking any other steps.
 
Thanks,
 
Diomedes.
