As I mentioned to you last week, there are currently about 50 EBS employees who are exempt from the Enron e-mail retention policy.  These individuals were exempted from the e-mail retention policy in order to preserve documents related to the Blockbuster litigation.  Now that the Blockbuster litigation is over, there is no reason for these individuals to continue to be exempt from the e-mail retention policy.  I propose sending the following  e-mail to the currently exempt EBS employees:

_____________

For the past several months, because of the necessity to preserve documents relating to the Blockbuster litigation, you have been exempted from Enron's e-mail retention policy.  The Blockbuster litigation has now concluded.  Therefore, beginning Monday, October 15, 2001, you will be subject to the e-mail retention policy.  As a reminder, that policy provides as follows:

Message Location - Maximum Retention
Inbox - 30 days
Sent Mail Folder - 30 days
Trash/Deleted Items - Rollover from Inbox for one day
Folders - All Email messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one calendar year. This includes public folders in Outlook.
Furthermore, it is against policy to store Email outside of your Outlook Mailbox and/or your Public Folders.  Please do not copy Email onto floppy disks, zip disks, CDs or the network.  Such actions are prohibited and will not be supported by the IT Department.

There will be no exceptions to this policy.
