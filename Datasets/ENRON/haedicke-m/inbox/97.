	Gentlemen, I need your assistance in resolving some outstanding FCC issues.  We have a license in the name of Enron Communications which I have directed to Michelle Hicks for resolution.  However, there is a company by the name of Enron Puerto Rico, Enron Processing Properties (in Louisiana), Enron Methanol, and Louisiana Resources Company for which I have had no responses from attorneys handling the FCC audit.  Jim Derrick told me that he believed, with the exception of Enron Processing Properties that the above companies were or are under your direction. If so, could you please assign an attorney to work with me to straighten out the outstanding licenses?  If you know anything about Enron Processing Properties, I would appreciate any guidance that you could give me even if it is a hunch.

	Thanks.
