Today's FT (page 6 of the European edition) reports fully and faithfully about
the debt management via swaps of the Italian Treasury, and about the Yen
transaction that was apparently singled out in the ISMA study. Eurostat has
always been aware of the transactions, that have been specifically approved. I
attach a Bloomberg release on the issue. It is interesting that the ISMA study
is no longer available on ISMA web site. Also, I don't see in today's news any
trace of the press conference announced in the ISMA press release.
