Can you please let me know whether anyone involved in EOL would be willing to speak at this ISDA conf on 4 December.  J Marsh and I are both doing slots already.  Mark Haedicke is on the board of ISDA (as you probably know) and is keen for Enron to oblige.

Fiona - do you have any views?

Paul

Paul:

I hate to bug you but I was wondering if you knew anyone from your London
office who would be keen to join the e-commerce panel discussion from 10:45
AM to 11:30 AM.  Andy Zipper, Chief Commercial Officer of EnronOnline spoke
at a similar conference we held last March in Houston.  

About 4 different firms will be represented on the E-Commerce Panel
Discussion.  The moderator will give each speaker about 5 minutes to talk
about any or all of the following: 

?	Why Some Platforms are Successful
?	The Impact of E-trading on Standardized Documentation
?	Future Challenges

Of course, we don't want this to be a marketing pitch but we do want
attendees to have a basic idea of who the speaker is and how their firm and
its services are similar or different. This should take up to half an hour.
For the remaining time, there would be an open discussion. The moderator
will pose questions, which will be confirmed to them beforehand. 

Attached is a copy of the agenda.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks - Liz

Paul,

That's great - thank you.  Both Richard and Rita have agreed to
co-present.
Rita will speak both on dealing with different documentation in Europe
for
similar products and on the benefits of a bridge.  Richard will speak on
the
benefits of using annexes to a single master agreement.  I think a
PowerPoint presentation works best.  Please coordinate presentations to
prevent duplication.  The panel will have 45 minutes to cover all topics
and
you should leave time at the end for Q&A.  Time designated to each
presentation is entirely up to the group.

Rita Pearson-Schwandt (Tel: 49 20 1171-7525)
Paul Simons (Tel: 44 20 7783-6566)
Richard Tredgett (Tel: 44 207 330-2467)

I will fax or email all the necessary speaker information soon.

Let me know if any of you have any questions.

Regards and thanks,
Liz

Sorry for the delay in responding.

I am glad to confirm that I would be delighted to give a presentation at
10-45 am on Physical v Financial Trading documentation/issues.
Unfortunately, that is all I will have time for owing to other Enron
commitments related to our financial year end that will make it
impossible to take any more time out of the office than this.  I hope
that this works for you.

A few of questions, if I may:

 - will a power point presentation be appropriate?

 - how long will the presentation last?

 - Have Rita and Richard agreed to co-present? If so, do you have Rita's
telephone number so we can liaise (I know Richard's)?

Thanks and kind regards

Paul

Paul,

I hate to be a pest but do you know yet whether or not you have a
conflict
in schedule?  

Thanks - Liz
