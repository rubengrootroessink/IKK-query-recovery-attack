Joseph

As per my voicemail, I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. Could I ask that you confirm the following regarding RMTC - Global Markets:

Mark Haedicke and yourself are directors, and therefore authorised signatories of the company
Would your signature be required on any new trading agreement?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards
