The day trading systems trade both Nasdaq and S&P futures based on 
volatility and the indexes correlation with related markets, such as energies 
and interest rate contracts.  Short-term market exposure is the systems key to 
limiting drawdowns and unnecessary equity swings while attempting to 
capture profits in the market.
