The Texas Retail Energy Summit 
The Stampede to Competition 
XENERGY'S 13th Executive Forum 
February 26-27, 2002 
The Four Seasons Hotel - Austin, Texas 
  
  _____  


The Lone Star State has been labeled retail energy's last hope. 

Texas' unique pro-competition policies and the nation's biggest electric market combine to form the most attractive market in the US. And the retailers are stampeding into the state. 

Two months after the market opens, XENERGY will assemble a leading cast of policy makers, retail executives and industry advocates to examine the current state and outlook of the Texas market. The meeting will shed light on many of the market, policy and operations issues that will dictate the ultimate success of the market. 

A who's who of industry leaders will participate, including: 

David Sibley, Texas State Senator 
Thomas Noel, CEO, ERCOT 
Jim Ajello, President, Reliant Energy Solutions 
Max Yzaguirre, Chairman, PUCT 
Carol Biedrzycki, Executive Director, Texas ROSE 
and many more
