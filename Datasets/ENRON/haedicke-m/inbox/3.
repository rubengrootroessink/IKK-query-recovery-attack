Microsoft's in-house counsel called me on my cell phone a few minutes ago.  He just wanted to let me know that they received our proposal this morning and that they have retained Preston Gates & Ellis LLP to assist them in reviewing and analyzing our proposal.  He said they would be getting back with us shortly -- hopefully tomorrow -- and said that his business folks where intent on moving "forward instead of backward," whatever that means.
 
Talk to you soon.
