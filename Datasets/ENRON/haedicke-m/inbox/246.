I have signed tax returns on behalf of all EWS companies over the past year - acting as an Assistant Secretary.  From our discussion last week I am concerned about continuing to do so.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks in advance.  SHD.

We need to talk regarding you signing returns.   The only other officer who has signature authority for EWS companies is Bob Hermann.   Let's discuss.   Thanks, John.
