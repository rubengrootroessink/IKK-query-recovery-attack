Any insights on how to get a letter?  This client wants to novate a series of SEK denominated pulp trades which would generate around $10 mm in revenue for ECTRIC.

Eric

One of our clients has requested proof of our capacity to transact on behalf of ECTRIC. Would you please be able to draft a letter to the effect that you are acting for ECTRIC and have authority the transact on their behalf? ECTRIC letterhead would be a plus!

Many thanks

Simon
