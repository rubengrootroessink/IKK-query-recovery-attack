Please find attached the Legal Risk Memo regarding the Siemens transactions.  

 

John -- The DASH has been faxed to you, please fax the signature page back to Yvette Pinero at 713.646.7001.  Yvette will then fax the DASH to Jim Hughes in London.  

Jim,  RAC says they will not sign until they view your signature. We expect to fax you the DASH (with signatures from legal and the originator) by 9am CDT.  We hope to get all signatures before 2pm tomorrow CDT so that treasury can arrange the wire transfers for Weds. a.m.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Eddy Daniels
