Mark -- If possible, I'd like to schedule some time with you (10 min) to discuss approval of a certificates transaction that involves ECE and Elektro.  Orlando has scheduled some time w/ Lavorato at 1:00 Houston time, so sometime before then would be best if you are available.  A memo has been prepared by Vicky Martinez that should have been forwarded to you by now, but I'll confirm that.  Please let me know what works for you.

Regards,
	John
