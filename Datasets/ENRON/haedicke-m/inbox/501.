Hi Mark,  

Although I suspect that you have been quite busy lately given the situation
at Enron, I would like to follow up on our conversation of a few weeks back.
Is there a time that is convenient for me to call?  Otherwise, I will give
you a call later this week and try to set something up.  As always, I
appreciate your willingness to give some time to me.  And if your schedule
is too hectic now, please suggest some future dates that might work better
for you.  

I hope you saw the Spartans beat Michigan Saturday.  What a great game!  And
to top it off, Tom Izzo signed another blue chip basketball recruit from
Flint.  There are many smiling faces here on campus.  

I assume you received my information packet and look forward to talking to
you.  Thanks again for your time.

Best regards,

John
