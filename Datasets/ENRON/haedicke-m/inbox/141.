Mirant Becomes No. 2 Gas Marketer;=20
New Acquisition Cements Canada as Top Spot for Gas Resources=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[News item from PR Newswire] Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced on Oct. 11 =
that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Ca=
lgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Limited, a move that would make the compa=
ny the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada, the largest natural-gas expo=
rter to the United States and the number-two gas marketer in North America.=
 Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, although it is expected to close=
 in the fourth quarter of this year, pending approvals from regulators, pro=
ducers and customers.=20

Analysis: It's nothing short of amazing the number of natural-gas transacti=
ons that have taken place between U.S. integrated energy firms and Canadian=
 gas companies in 2001 alone. As is often the case, what seemed like a tren=
d now appears to be an industry standard, as those U.S. power firms consoli=
dating in the natural-gas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition t=
argets. Canada, which offers seemingly abundant natural-gas resources, has =
attracted such U.S. energy companies Calpine, Devon and Duke, which have al=
so bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year. This particular a=
cquisition is significant because it positions Mirant, which already had as=
sets in the Western part of Canada, as the largest gas marketer in Canada a=
nd right behind Enron elsewhere in North America, especially in the U.S. Mi=
dwest and Northeast. Further, the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a de=
cided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the Unit=
ed States, adding upon its already-significant portfolio.=20

As always when discussing a merger or acquisition, I like to first establis=
h the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains=
 of the parties involved. Mirant is of course the recently spun off, former=
 subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of =
the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulat=
ed wholesale sector. The company's business model is founded on building a =
huge arsenal of generating assets, particularly based in natural gas, which=
 can be marketed and traded in strategic regions. Even before the announcem=
ent of this acquisition, Mirant owned an estimated 96 billion cubic feet of=
 proven oil and gas reserves, 82 percent of which are natural gas. Accordin=
g to the company, a substantial portion of its 38 million cubic feet equiva=
lent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an a=
verage fixed price of $4/MMBtu through 2002. Further, Mirant has establishe=
d a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and Sout=
h America, Europe, and Asia. The purchase of TransCanada's gas marketing bu=
siness will add 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirant's =
existing volumes (based on TransCanada's 2000 trading volumes), which as no=
ted significantly elevates Mirant's stature in the gas-marketing space.=20

The most important thing to note about TransCanada's business model is that=
 the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas fro=
m Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Canada's Mackenzie Delta into the growing North =
American marketplace, supporting two separate pipelines (one from each basi=
n). This has been a slow-growth business for TransCanada, and in fact has l=
ost money over the last year, but is positioned for strong growth in the fu=
ture given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North Americ=
a. TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for s=
ome time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas t=
ransmission and electrical power services. Last month, the company sold ano=
ther chunk of its U.S. natural-gas marketing and trading operations to BP G=
as and Power. Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively o=
n this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts b=
etween its marketing / shipping business and pipeline systems.=20

From a broad perspective, this is a good move for Mirant. As noted, the com=
pany already has assets in Western Canada, where it has operated since June=
 2000 through its management of the natural-gas marketing operations of Pan=
-Alberta Gas Ltd. and CanWest Gas Supply, Inc. The purchase of core busines=
ses of TransCanada extends Mirant's presence into Eastern Canada by gaining=
 control over TransCanada's Quebec and Ontario operations. Specifically, Mi=
rant gains control over TransCanada's natural-gas trading and marketing bus=
iness and the related transportation and storage contracts, with business c=
ontracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States. In addition, TransCana=
da has agreed to sell its "netback pool," or the part of its operation that=
 has aggregated gas supply from about 550 natural-gas producers. As noted, =
the aggregated supply should increase Mirant's marketable reserves by 5.1 b=
illion cubic feet per day. Although financial terms were not disclosed, a M=
irant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to =
establish a leading market position through minimal investment.=20

The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in v=
ery well to Mirant's growth strategy. Just this week, Mirant announced that=
 it had acquired an interest in 18 natural-gas and oil producing fields as =
well as 206,000 acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Ener=
gy. This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant =
agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corp=
oration. The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities wou=
ld bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling 35=
,000 MW in North America by 2005. Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a 640-MW=
 natural gas-fired power plant in Thomaston, Ga., and a 480-MW natural gas-=
fired plant in New Port Richey, Fla., north of Tampa. The agreement is expe=
cted to close this month, pending regulatory and third-party approvals.=20

As noted, Mirant is just the latest in a string of U.S. energy companies th=
at have made purchases of Canadian gas companies. Driven by what appear to =
be abundant natural-gas reserve fields in Canada, and uncertain resources i=
n more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the gas consolidation =
movement among U.S. energy companies includes acquiring those firms that ar=
e involved in both production and transportation of natural gas. Some recen=
t reports I've seen have indicated that, since 1991, natural-gas imports to=
 the United States (mostly coming from Canada) have doubled to about 10 bil=
lion cubic feet per day, while domestic production has increased only 4 per=
cent (although it still averages 52 billion cubic feet per day). Further, a=
ccording to the Department of Energy, U.S. imports of natural gas from Cana=
da have averaged about 15 percent of total U.S. usage (during 2000, the Uni=
ted States consumed 22.8 Tcf and imported about 3.6 Tcf, mostly from Canada=
). The other factor driving this interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is =
the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks.=20

Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy, which announced its purchase =
of Canada's Westcoast Energy for $3.5 billion in late September. Westcoast =
Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United S=
tates, which is a booming market for natural-gas demand given its use in ne=
w power plant projects. The acquisition should give Duke control over natur=
al-gas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it. It is import=
ant to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian natural-gas marke=
t by focusing on the transportation of the commodity. Mirant is taking a di=
fferent approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business. Also wo=
rth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy, which is buying Anderson=
 Exploration, which reportedly will position it as the largest independent =
producer of oil and natural gas in North America.=20

Ironically, this increased interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is taking=
 place at a time when Canadian natural-gas storage levels could be much hig=
her than reported, bringing prices down to (CAN) $1.75 per million cubic fe=
et over the next few weeks. In fact, natural-gas prices in Canada have drop=
ped about 80 percent since the beginning of 2001, with Alberta's benchmark =
AECO-C Hub prices dropping more than 40 percent in the past two months. In =
addition to the high storage levels, mild weather, a drop in consumption of=
 natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered =
to be factors in the drop in prices. However, this does appear to be a temp=
orary trend, and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once=
 again increase, starting with the imminent winter season.=20

Moreover, as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant =
the second-largest gas marketer in North America. According to the most cur=
rent data available, based on 2000 sales, Enron Wholesale Services remains =
the largest natural-gas marketer in North America, with 28.3 billion cubic =
feet / day of sales in 2000, representing an 82.6-percent increase over 199=
9 levels. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, Co=
ral Energy, and Reliant Energy round out the top companies. Interestingly, =
Mirant was not even listed on the year-2000 sales ranking because it did no=
t fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year. Conse=
quently, the ascendance into the top tier of natural-gas marketers that Mir=
ant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite imp=
ressive.=20
