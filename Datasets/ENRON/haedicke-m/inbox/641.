Lance-

We have had some discussions recently around the due diligence process and
have compartmentalized our desired search into roughly a dozen big-picture
areas.  These areas of interest are as follows:

- Corporate structure (minute books, corp secretary's function, etc.)
- Finance
- Pipeline assets (including the MLPs - EOTT and Northern Border)
- Generating assets
- Intellectual property
- Enron Broadband Services
- Insurance
- Trading book/Risk management
- Pending dispositions, plant/business closings, etc.
- Tax
- Accounting
- Human resources

If you could provide me with the names of the folks over at Enron that we
can contact for each of these areas, I would really appreciate it.  I have
not included real estate or environmental on the above list because I have
been told that Elizabeth Labinowski and David Nutt, respectively, are the
folks we should contact regarding such matters.

As for process, we are assembling a master request list that we expect to
forward to you by the end of next week.  While we think it is more
efficient to get the diligence done in small groups, we do want to get you
our request list so that you will know what we will be asking for and
perhaps be able to break the list up into its component parts for
distribution within your organization.

Thanks in advance for your assistance with respect to this process.  We
will do our best to make things as painless as possible for you.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Kevin
