Matthew,

Attached below is an update I sent to Paul Freeman regarding EBS data retention.
The most important point to make in relation to the current litigation is that we can only provide data backups as far back as March/April 2001 and email backups as far back as 2001,
EBS systems were administered by the EBS US IT team prior to these dates.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards

EBS in Europe
Prior to March 2001 EBS Europe had a independent infrastructure that was located in EH but administered out of the US by Scott Abshire and team. 
The European IT team had no access to the EBS environment and as such were unable to backup the data.

During March 2001 all EH based EBS users were migrated to the CORP domain but retained access to their US based Notes email system. 
At this time, all data files located on the EBS data server were migrated to the European S: drive, all user data was migrated to their respective H: drives.
The users continued to use their US based email system.

From the start of July, 2001 these EBS users were then migrated from the US based EBS email system to our Exchange system.

Implications for EBS litigation:
European IT Ops can only provide backups of the user data from March/April 2001 and email data from August 2001
Backups from prior to these dates would be held in the US (if they exist)

All continuing EBS employees and employees who have been redeployed from EBS to other Enron business units have had their mailbox size restrictions removed (to prevent any loss of email data relevant to litigation)
