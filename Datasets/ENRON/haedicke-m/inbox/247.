A worldwide alert is being raised about a malicious worm that has caught anti-virus companies off guard.

WORM_GONE.A is a Visual Basic- compiled Windows executable worm that is capable of propagating through Microsoft Outlook and possibly through ICQ.

According to Trend Micro, the file is packed using the UPX packer program and is compiled using Visual Basic. It arrives as an e-mail with the subject line 'Hi'.
