Here is a draft LOU and termsheet from the transaction in which we acquired an interest in oil and gas properties (this is somewhat related to the deal described in the documents that I just sent to you).  It is probably more appropriate for a transaction in which we are acquiring a direct interest in oil and gas properties.
