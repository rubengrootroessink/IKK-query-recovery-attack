Mark

As per my voicemail, I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. Could I ask that you confirm the following regarding RMTC - Global Markets and Enron Metals and Commodities Corp

That you are a director, and therefore authorised signatories of the companies?
Would your signature be required on any new trading agreement for both companies?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards
Lauren Christie
