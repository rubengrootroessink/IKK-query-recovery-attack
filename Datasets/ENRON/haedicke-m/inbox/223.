Thank you to those who attended the Documentation Committee meeting in New
York on November 29. We look forward to meeting our European members at the
meeting on December 13 in London.  

Earlier this week, we distributed the first draft of the 2002 ISDA Master
Agreement with accompanying documents to the Committee.  We strongly
encourage you to participate in the development of the 2002 ISDA Master
Agreement. To that end, please send in your comments on the first draft of
the Master Agreement by Monday, January 7.   Comments should be addressed to
Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org) and Katherine Darras (kdarras@isda.org).  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at
212-332-1200.  Thank you in advance.


N.B.  If you have not already done so you can obtain a copy of the above
mentioned draft Master Agreement and supporting documents by sending a blank
email to "Documents@isda.org" with "Documentation" typed in the subjectline
of the email.  You will then receive a copy of the documents by auto reply
email.  

Thank you
