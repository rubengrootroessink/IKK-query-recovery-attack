Per our discussions yesterday, the Omaha and Enron Center North bldgs. are owned by trustees and leased to us.  I have always heard these referred to as synthetic leases (and thus off balance sheet) , but I am not expert enough to absolutely confirm that they truly are.  Attached is the summary information on those leases.  Please call if you have any questions.  Obviously, we would consider our landlords to be critical vendors.
