I wanted to encourage your institutions to consider adhering to the 2001
Euro Protocol. The adherence period ends on November 30.  Details can be
found on our website, www.isda.org, under the Protocols page.  Please feel
free to contact me with any questions you might have. A Commentary has also
been prepared to assist in answering frequently asked questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Kimberly Summe
General Counsel
