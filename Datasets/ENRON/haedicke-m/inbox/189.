Mike,

thanks for the note. London lawyers already participate in a Houston legal trading forum at which these issues are being dealt with. I will check that there is no other forum on which Mark Haedicke needs our input.

There is also an ongoing effort in the UK, headed by Anna McAndrew and Richard Sage, contributed to on the legal front by Mark Elliott.

Mark,

Below are files regarding a presentation to the Management Committee on distressed debt and bankruptcy exposure.  In the middle of last (most recent) email it discusses a legal effort in Houston to better understand rights upon counterparty bankruptcy.

Do we want someone from London to be involved on the legal end?  I would imagine so since laws are quite diverse but I don't know the specific questions being asked.  Is there someone I can put in touch with Michael Tribolet and Mark Haedicke (or their assigns)?


Thanks

I wanted to follow up to your questions:

   Pasted below is the presentation for the Management Committee.   Rick Buy indicated there were no substantive comments.  The list is updated as new bankruptcies occur (which is almost daily).  I would imagine there will be enhancements to the format, but the one attached is what we are initially rolling out.   We are meeting every two weeks to review the list for missing fields.

I have a meeting tomorrow with Mark Haedicke to try to formalize our legal effort/team.   Currently, we tend to have some of the same originating attorneys involved.  Where we have had problems has been in the determination of termination rights upon bankruptcy.   It would make sense in Houston to have one (or two) Enron Corp attorneys that can quickly and regularly make this determination.   

We need to push the data collection responsibility into each business unit.   We would then take their reports and paste it into one company-wide sheet.     While Molly has drafted a cogent process, the implementation at the business unit level has been choppy thus far.   More to come.



Regards,


Michael


 




Mike,

Can I get a copy of whatever the final distressed workbooks / presentation looked like?  Thanks.

Also, do you have any plans going forward?  When is the next summary (special effort / reconciliation) required?  Do you have any changed formats or requirements since Buy's discussions with management?

Absent any changes you note we will continue to update and institutionalize (regular reporting system) information along the lines of that provided last week.

Attached below, please find a draft of the Bankruptcy Presentation that Rick Buy will present to the Management Committee on Monday morning.  The last page is notes only, and not intended to be distributed to the Management Committee.
 << File: Bankruptcies.ppt >> 
Attached below, please find the detail to support the # of bankruptcies by business unit.  The first tab is a "summary page" by Business Unit Classification for the presentation above.  Several counterparties have some relationship with more than one business unit.  I have included each of these only once for the presentation above (as classified on the summary page), but the detail of the business unit relationships is included on the summary page for your information.  If you would like more detail, please go to the second tab titled "Bankruptcies".   
 << File: New Distressed CP V3.xls >> 

As you know, this information has been consolidated from many sources.  If you have any questions, additions or deletions that need to be made prior to Monday morning's presentation, please call me as soon as possible on Sunday.  My cell # is 713 305 4883.

Thanks,

Sharon
