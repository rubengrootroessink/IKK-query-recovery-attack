Mark:. We're slogging through all of this--it was apretty brutle weekend but progress is being made.  There are still open issues on both the NNG and TW credit facilities--but the goal is to have the TW credit agreement signed sometime today and get it funded by Wednesday, while NNG will probably close later in the week -- likely Friday--once the Dynegy issues are melded with those of the bank.
