	Greg Markel, our outside counsel,  just received a phone call from Sempra's outside counsel informing him that, as a result of Enron's current financial condition, Sempra was no longer interested in pursuing a commercial resolution of the parties' disputes. Sempra's counsel said that Sempra was still interested in pursuing mediation if Enron was willing to consider paying Sempra money.
