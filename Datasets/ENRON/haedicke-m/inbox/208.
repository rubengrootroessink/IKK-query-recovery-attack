Hi Mark.  I know that you are busy with critical Enron business matters now.
I don't want to intrude on your time at this critical juncture.  I do want
to wish you much luck and success in getting things worked out.  

When things settle down, I would enjoy having an opportunity to continue our
discussion.  I appreciated your willingness to speak with me earlier this
fall.  Thanks for your consideration.  And if I may ever be of help to you,
please don't hesitate to contact me.  

Best regards,

John
