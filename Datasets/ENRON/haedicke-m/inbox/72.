Hello All -- wanted to let you know that we have scheduled the next NA
Energy & Developing Products Committee meeting for Friday, November 2.
(Meeting details will be circulated to the entire Committee today but  I
have attached them for your information).

We are in the process of finalizing the agenda, which will largely focus on
documentation initiatives to address standardizing netting provisions across
energy commodities and to also address physical and financial trading.
However, I wanted to ask if there are any Canadian energy issues we should
include on the agenda.  Would you let me know your thoughts?  Meg gave an
update on the Ontario Electricity Market at the July 27 meeting -- is an
update in order for the Nov. 2 meeting?  Thank you. -- Stacy
