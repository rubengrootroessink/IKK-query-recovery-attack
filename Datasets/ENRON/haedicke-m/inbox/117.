Bill Swanstrom from Locke Liddell & Sapp referred me to you.  Bill has
been effective in helping us establish our company and is a client of
ours.

We offer a wireless data subscription service we call Wireless Shuttle
which provides real time access into your corporate computer desktop
functions like email, calendars, tasks and the global address book.  We
are able to let you have this access by using any web enabled wireless
device (like a cell phone) on any network (Verizon, Cingular, Nextel,
Sprint, etc.).

This service can be implement immediately.

	?	Requires no upfront capital outlay
	?	Requires very few IT man-hours (no software
configuration necessary, not one line of code is placed on your MS
Exchange server and we provide end-to-end management of the service)
	?	Works with any wireless data carrier (no special
networks) and any web enabled wireless device (no special hand held
device required)
	?	Features corporate level security and SSL encryption

Detailed information may be accessed on our website

I'd like to meet with you and demonstrate Wireless Shuttle and discuss
ways we can help keep you connected with your data in real time.

Regards,
