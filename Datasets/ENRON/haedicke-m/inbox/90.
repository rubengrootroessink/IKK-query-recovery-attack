[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a c=
oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo=
rnia under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving=
 electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state.=
 Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Ener=
gy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be=
 completed by as early as summer 2004.=20

Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the sum=
mer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weath=
er patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of=
 a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often get=
s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines=
 that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primar=
y role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market=
. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winte=
r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Dep=
artment of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing=
 a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a =
positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes =
for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th=
e hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential co=
nflicts.=20

Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there a=
re some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pac=
ific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission =
capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif=
ornia. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became r=
ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission c=
ould not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of=
 power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, whic=
h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor=
nia cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly=
 acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as w=
inter approaches.=20

The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last =
piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat=
e's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminen=
t problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou=
ld have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which=
 has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous=
 winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is n=
ot as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then No=
rthern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heav=
y dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability pro=
blems for California.=20

Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problem=
s that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus=
 of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, =
there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to f=
ederal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national ener=
gy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that =
would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, =
Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo=
nses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path=
 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 1=
5, is the result of that previous directive.=20

At present, it appears that PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific G=
as & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially su=
pport the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project =
are the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kind=
er Morgan Power Co., PG&E National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing =
and Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal ag=
ency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 wester=
n states and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines.=20

Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t=
he state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diabl=
o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power pla=
nt. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would =
boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when t=
he upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of =
5,400 MW of power.=20

Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the=
 upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 1=
0-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for=
 acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The rema=
ining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d=
ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of i=
nvestment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in=
 a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these comp=
anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. Th=
e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr=
ough fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a =
hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably ant=
icipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge =
amounts of power will need to be transported.=20

As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th=
is upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal reg=
ulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over powe=
r line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had =
already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary A=
braham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed=
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck =
spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that =
there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator=
y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali=
fornia. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t=
he state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's ve=
nture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seem=
ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta=
in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca=
pacity. If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is no=
t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In any=
 event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating companie=
s, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state (=
and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for the=
 upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccessf=
ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California E=
dison earlier this year.=20

Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for=
 Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a =
major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, u=
nlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject t=
o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, bec=
ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n=
ew line, these companies will be able to charge "tolls" to the power market=
ers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of c=
ontention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sou=
ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p=
rivate-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positiv=
e side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private c=
ontracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to "=
either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am=
erica."=20

As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a n=
ew transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow In=
terconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until=
 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmiss=
ion line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation =
near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo=
w, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new =
transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's an=
d SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofr=
e Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver a=
pproximately 1,000 MW.=20

Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California l=
ower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation developme=
nt, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but=
 the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors=
. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represe=
nts a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 b=
illion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for whi=
ch remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase =
the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponso=
red project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands=
 of private companies.=20
