Mark, I was told this morning by Karen Barbour at RAC that Jeff Skilling has 
sent some of our DASHes back to Rick Buy with some questions, and that these 
will be sent to Greg Whalley.  I do not know the specific questions yet, but 
have been asked to get ready to brief Brian Stanley to have a discussion with 
Greg.


These are the DASHes for the Pemex EPC 63 and 64 workouts (attached here) and 
the DASH for the restructured AES Wolf Hollow/Granbury Texas project 
(attached below).

AES is on the cusp on financing, and would like to sign their EPC documents 
as soon as financing. Scott and team are in Austin negotiating with AES this 
week, but understand they have no signing authority yet.

Please call if you have questions.
