Liz:

Greg is scheduled to speak on Friday, October 12 at 8:30 am for 30-45 minutes.  No slides are necessary.  The lawyers will be interested in where Greg sees the growth in the company and where the business is strong.  There will be Q&A and I think he will get some good questions.  Some possible questions:  What does Greg expect from the legal department?  How will the attacks impact on our business?  What will be his focus in his new job?  It should be a very friendly crowd -- since Greg knows most of the lawyers and they know him.

I miss you too!  

Mark Haedicke

Hi Mark,

Boy, I'm missing you and Janette!

 I wanted to drop you an email to get more information on Greg's talk at your conference on 10/12.  I believe he's going to address your group on business updates.  Are there particulars you wish for him to cover?  How long is he speaking and at what time?  Do you wants slides?  Will there be a Q&A and if yes, any thoughts on what people will be asking?  

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
