This e-mail from Bradford worries me.  Can you take a look.

It appears the cash margin may not be a problem.  Initial feedback from EES legal is that we may not be able to cut them off immediately due certain provisions in the EES Masters.  I have a call in to Haedicke to address.  I have also attached the current exposure information.  I am currently in discussion with New Power to better understand the liquidity risks they face.

Let me know if you would like to discuss.

Bill

Cadwalader confirms their opinion that margin postings under the netting arrangement (inclusive of forwards and derivatives) are excepted from preference provisions and that this should not be altered merely by having an insider position, absent other claims.  I have touched base with Tribolet and Sanders to let them know that Cadwalader is available to discuss the netting agreement/bankruptcy issues as desired.
