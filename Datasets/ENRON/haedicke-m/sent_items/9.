Our board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, November 13, in New York. It is
our annual budget meeting so it is an important meeting. I am aware,
however, that some firms have instituted temporary bans or limitations on
travel. It would be helpful to know for planning purposes whether you will
be able to make it to New York for the meeting. George James is hosting the
meeting here at the Morgan Stanley offices.
