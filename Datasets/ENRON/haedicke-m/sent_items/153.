I am doing well!  I look forward to catching up.  I do plan to play golf so it would be great to play together.

Regards,

Mark

Mark:

How are you?  From what I can tell from talking to others, it sure sounds like you have been buried on a whole host of difficult matters the past few months and traveling a lot.  I hope that at some point you are able to come up for some air, although it does seem like "your world" just seems to be getting bigger and bigger which, I assume, will keep making that harder to do.

I am looking forward to attending the EWS legal Conference at the end of next week, and appreciate the invitation to make a presentation with Elizabeth.  Lisa told me she scheduled our presentation on Thursday afternoon, but I thought if it was ok with you I might also attend the morning session as well on Friday.  Are you planning to play golf in the afternoon on Friday after the Conference ends?  If you were, and you had room in your foursome, I thought I might play a quick round before I headed back to New York like we did a few years ago.  I thought that might give us a chance to catch up on things in general  since I would imagine you will be pretty tied up during the Conference.  I'll touch base with Janette on Monday or Tuesday to see if something like that might be possible.  If that does not work out, I'll try to get on your calendar the next time I am in town.

I hope that you and your family are doing well.  I hope that no one in the immediate circle of you, your family and your friends was directly impacted by the tragedy of September 11.  It has been a very difficult time up here the past two and a half weeks and it will no doubt take a fairly long time for things to start to heal since the devastation that was wrought will continue to be a daily reminder for the foreseeable future.  But, hopefully, the coming together of numerous groups of people in New York City and the country in general that has occurred since September 11 will continue well into the future and make it a bit easier for people to try to move on, as difficult as that will be.

Best regards, Mark.  I'll be in touch, and I look forward to seeing you in a week or so.

John
