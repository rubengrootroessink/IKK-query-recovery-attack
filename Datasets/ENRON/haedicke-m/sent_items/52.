Mark: a suggestion re email to specialists. my assistant has list and we can send for you or janette could do from there. let me know...

As you know, our group of attorneys within the Enron Wholesale Services legal department has recently grown substantially.  As a result, our space at the previously scheduled EWS legal conference at the Woodlands in October has become constrained and we have outgrown our budget. Instead of having legal specialists attend the conference this year, we have scheduled a lunch on October 26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel from 12 to 3. We are scheduling several outside speakers to talk about current topics at the lunch. You will be getting further information from Lisa Mellencamp about the details, but please mark your calendars and plan on attending!


Mark: the doubletree hotel has a room available and charges $500. there are 35 specialists (including ebs and ees). they will serve mexican style buffet lunch for about $24 a person, plus tax/service charge. thinking of 2 outside speakers (local--i liked the ve guy the other day on privacy and documents e.g.) and for you to speak as well. janette booked you for 12-1:30 so you can eat lunch and speak and duck out if you want. i will go and think will have a couple other attorneys to sprinkle around at tables (let me know if you have view or i will just do). my assistant will handle details and i will arrange speakers etc. total cost: about $1,800 (tho having pr people see if can get any cheaper...).

 i have revised budget for conference which i will send you within next day (waiting on one thing from woodlands re it) and the lunch will be on it as well in a second category so we can get turned in and approved. i want to send this email out on the same day as a reminder of date on the woodlands to applicable people. steve kean not available but rick shapiro/ jim steffas are. bruce lundstrum signed up with skadden lawyer. klauberg signed up with elizabeth.i  were you going to talk to evans? i have call into vicki re retail ideas.
