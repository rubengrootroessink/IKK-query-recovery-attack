John, thanks for the message.  I think, I would like to plan a trip and discuss the issues in person at GE.  Early October would work for me.

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

Mark:  I caught up with Henry Hubschman, the President of the GE Aircraft Leasing subsidiary, last week.  He spoke to Ben Heineman who said he would be happy to discuss with you some of the issues you mentioned concerning the management and organization of GE's legal department.  Ben told Henry that he was just heading out on vacation for a good portion of August (apparently, this is the practice for most of the GE senior executives since Welch has historically done the same thing for most of August), so he suggested touching base in early September. If you want, I could follow up around that time and then get back to you. As I noted in one of my prior e-mails, Henry thought you may want to also touch base on these types of issues with the Chief GE Transactional Counsel (and/or the Chief Litigation Counsel) and, if you wish to do that, Henry said he would be glad to make contact with either or both of them for you.

I hope that you are doing well, and I'll be in touch.  Thanks.  John
