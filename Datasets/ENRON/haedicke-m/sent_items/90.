Subject: Strategic Planning 2002 and Other Upcoming Dates


We discussed at the Kyoto session the dates for the strategic planning
session next year and agreed on the last week in May 2002. The specific days
would be Wednesday, May 29, to Friday, May 31. We will go back to our
typical strategic planning schedule of gathering on Wednesday evening for
dinner, a full day on Thursday (meeting, activity and dinner) and a half-day
on Friday, ending with lunch. This is the week of Memorial Day in the U.S.
and Monday bank holiday in other countries, but the timing of the schedule
should mean that people would not need to travel on the Monday and, in most
cases, could travel on Wednesday.
 
As for location, we have made arrangements with the Ritz Carlton Resort in
Palm Beach, Florida. The resort is a smaller Ritz Carlton property and is
one of the top U.S. resorts according to a number of travel publications.
The website is

<http://www.ritzcarlton.com/html_prop/resort.asp?Property_ID=13&PageNo=9>
&PageNo=9. Additional information on the resort will be in the September
board book. 
 
Domestic flights to Palm Beach are plentiful and there are a number of
international flights to Palm Beach (very near), Ft. Lauderdale (near) and
Miami (1-1/2 hours away). There are many activities of different sorts
(recreational and cultural (yes, even in Florida!)) nearby.
 
For your information, the schedule for upcoming Board meetings is as
follows:
 
Thursday, Sept. 13            London (tentatively at Deutsche Bank)
Tuesday, Nov. 13               New York (location tbd)
Thursday, Jan. 17              City and location tbd
Wed.-Thurs., April 17-18    Berlin, Intercontinental Hotel (AGM)
Wed.-Fri., May 29-31        Palm Beach, Ritz Carlton Resort
 
You may also wish to note our member update schedule in September and
October. Board attendance at these sessions is encouraged, particularly for
the Tokyo and Hong Kong updates since they are our principal events for the
year in those regions. If your schedule permits, please join us for all or
any part of the day. I would be happy to provide further details.
 
Wed., Sept. 12        London, One Whitehall Place
Thurs., Sept. 20       New York, Windows on the World
Mon., Oct. 15          Hong Kong, Conrad International Hotel
Thurs., Oct. 18        Tokyo, Royal Park Hotel
 
I hope your summer is going well.
 
Bob
