Hello Mark: 

That is a great article in this month's Corporate Legal Times on the Enron legal department.  I know that the wholesale group has been critical to the company, and your role has been critical to the success of the legal department. 

Thanks for looking to Milbank on PG&E and EBS this year, among other things. 

In order to review where we are, and what we ought to be doing to better service your group, I would like to arrange a meeting with you at your convenience.  To suggest dates: do any of 10/19. 10/26, 11/2 or 11/8 work for lunch or an afternoon meeting?

Hope to hear from you soon. 

Regards,
