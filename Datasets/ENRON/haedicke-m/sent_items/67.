Subject:	West Coast Power Matters

Per our conversation yesterday, I propose we send out the following memo:

In order to better coordinate the various west coast power matters, effective immediately, Jim Steffes and Richard Sanders will jointly take the lead role.  Jim and Richard will be responsible for preparing a comphrehensive strategy for all the matters, reviewing the strategy with the California Committee and seeking approval of the California Committee before taking any material action.  Please do all you can to assist Jim and Richard on the west coast power matters.

I would copy only the people working on these matters including Steffes, Sanders, Belden, Mellencamp, Shapiro, Sharp, Williams, Tribolet, Lavorato and Delainey.
