Just do the best you can.  We will probably end up moving it to a different day.  Mark

It will be hard for me to make these meetings on time, since Dave's meeting often ends after 10 and he/Janet often do followup meetings right after.   If others have a similar problem, I would like to suggest reconsidering the afternoon or  Tuesday am slot.

	It has become necessary to change the starting time for our Monday morning staff meetings (Policy Committee and Office of the General Counsel) from 11:00 am CDT to 10:00 am CDT.  Also due to the time change, we will need to return to meeting in EB38C2.  

	The next Policy Committee meeting will be on Monday, August 27.

	Monday, September 3, is the Labor Day holiday; therefore, the next Office of the General Counsel meeting will be on Tuesday, September 4.

	The call in numbers have not changed.  

	Thank you.
