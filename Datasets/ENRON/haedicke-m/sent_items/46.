Mark:  I have been so busy with all the legal issues relating to all the changes going on at the Company that I forgot to congratulate you for your appointment to the Management Committee---Congratulations!  I think that's great, and certainly well deserved.  I will endeavor to keep you off the Section 16 list!  Rex
