Mark-I met with you a couple of weeks ago regarding the legal position for the new freight group. After we met, I visited with Dan Reck (I had already met with Shawn Cumberland). I am very interested in the position and in Enron. I think my general corporate experience and my specific experience in freight forwarding from having been with Eagle Global Logistics readily adapts to the position.  I am used to a fast pace in a changing corporate environment. For your convenience, I have attached a slightly revised copy of my resume.
 
Regards, Donald Duncan
