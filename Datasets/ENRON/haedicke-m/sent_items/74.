We had a glorious morning of golf at the Fazio and then rushed to the
Traverse City airport, made the puddle jumper to O'Hare and had the
flight to Houston cancelled due to mechanical problems. We may get into
Houston by 10:00 tonight if we're lucky.  Captain Pear and I just
decided no more trips that involve connections. I hope you guys had
better luck. We really enjoyed the trip and look forward to a game in
Houston soon to check progress. Talk to you soon.
