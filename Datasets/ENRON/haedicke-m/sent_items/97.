Hello Mark - Attached is an updated agenda for the July 27th Meeting.  I
would like to get your sign-off on the agenda so I can circulate to the
members with the meeting invitation tomorrow.

Would you let me know your thoughts about which items to cover and how long
we want the meeting to last.  The attached agenda will likely lead to a 2
hour meeting.  This might be an adequate time frame since this is the first
meeting in a while but let me know what you think!  Many thanks!  -- Stacy
