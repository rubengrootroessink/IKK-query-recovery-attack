Hi  Mark;

We just started discussions with Duke and El Paso regarding the execution of a Master Trading Agreement for Brazilian spot market deals (physical power deals).  I have already been informed by Duke's local counsel that Enron and Duke have executed some sort of a worldwide master trading agreement which may or may not cover Brazil.  Haven't heard from El Paso yet.  Who, in North America, could provide me with information on these Duke and El Paso agreements ?

Hope all is well.

Tks & Rgds,

Sami
