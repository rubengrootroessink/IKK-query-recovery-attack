I have a few thoughts on the offsite.  I think we could have a theme of restructuring and change.  We would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future.  The presentations could include the following:

1.   What we learned in CA -- Sager
2.   Preparing for workouts -- Mellencamp
3.   Lessons learned in international -- Lundstrom
4.   Deregulation of energy markets -- Kean/Shapiro
5.   Managing Legal Risks -- Haedicke
6.   Executives -- Frevert and Whalley
7.   Europe presentation
8.   Retail presentation
