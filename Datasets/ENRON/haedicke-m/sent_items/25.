Mark -

FYI - I have attached below a screen shot of the proposed new look and feel for the site.  We have a couple of tweaks to make, but I believe this is a much cleaner look than what we have now.

Unfortunately, because of the virus we lost a good part of development time last week.  This has pushed back the completion schedule at this time by at least a week, which means that the site will not be updated and operational by the time the law conference comes along.  If you want information about the site disseminated, I can provide an overview of the new look and feel and new functions that we anticipate having.  I believe a new target release date is realistically Nov. 1.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark
