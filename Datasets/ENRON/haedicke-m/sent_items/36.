Dear Mark:

As you may know already, the American Chamber of Commerce - Rio de Janeiro Chapter postponed the Brazil Energy Seminar into November 16. In view of such postponement, we have cancelled our trip to Houston next week.

Nevertheless, Jos? Luis Freire, Marcio Baptista and myself have already scheduled to be in attendance of such Seminar. Therefore, we will keep you posted on our travel arrangements later so that we are able to reschedule our visit with you.

Best regards,
Jos? Emilio
