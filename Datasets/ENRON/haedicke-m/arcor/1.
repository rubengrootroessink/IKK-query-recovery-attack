I am of the opinion it will close Wednesday. Legal teams meeting tomorrow for 
final review. Municipal Resolution received and accepted by our legal today. 
Bank transfers being set up tomorrow for Wednesday 2 pm. But we have been 
here before. Will advise.  

MFG

The municipality approved the outstanding issue and produced a resolution.  
Haedicke needs to review the resolution.  If no issues in the resolution then 
we should close on Wednesday.  Mike is working the details...anything to add 
Mike?
