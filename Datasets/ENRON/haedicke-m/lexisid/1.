Mark:

Thanks for attending Lexis Luncheon last week!   Your Lexis ID is:  50971PB 
and password to lexis.com and nexis.com is your last name.   Your ID/PW gives 
you access to 

Lexis-Nexis online (Lexis software on your server)
lexis.com   -             http://www.lexis.com          (legal, news, public 
records)
nexis.com (fka: Lexis Universe)  -  http://www.nexis.com/research       (for 
business news and company dossier)

Lexis' new product - CertiFinder access needs to be approved by the state 
since it gives users access to criminal records and driver license/vehicle 
registration information.  I am currently working with Lexis Corporate 
Attorney to get our users approved for CertiFinder access.  In the meantime, 
you may search public records via www.lexis.com.  

Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions on Lexis 
service.   Happy searching!

Thanks,
Sylvia
