Thanks for your patience!  You now have a Lexis CertiFinder ID :  and the URL 
to log on to CertiFINDER is http://www.lexis-nexis.com/certifinder. I have 
attached a CertiFinder user guide FYI.




Lexis CertiFinder is a new service not covered in our current Enron 
contract.   While Enron is not ready to cover CertiFinder in its' global 
contract, I initiated a new service agreement for 34 legal people who have 
signed up for 9/27 training to access the service.  The flat rate is set as 
$42 per ID per month for unlimited usage.   Lexis defers billing to 1/2001.  
Basically, You are given two month free trial.  If you find it useful and 
would like to keep the ID, I'll start billing you, 1/2001.  If you don't find 
it useful, please notify me to cancel your ID.  

Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions or if you need 
further training!  You are welcomed to refer anyone in your group to me if 
he/she is interested in CertiFinder access.  

Thanks!
