LAST CHANCE for Open Enrollment!

If you would like to make changes to your 2002 Health Benefit selections, you have until this Friday, 11/30/01 at 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Central).  The systems are open for one week only to make changes, additions, and deletions.

You can access the web site address at enron.benefitsnow.com   or  by calling 1-800-332-7979.
