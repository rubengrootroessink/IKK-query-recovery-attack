Where are the aggie headlines????  This is no big deal. A 20 year old gets drunk,some asshole cops treat them like shit and they mouth off to the asshole cops, who being the only ones able to excercise the power trip, get the last word.  Same thing happened to me in Lincoln and I was not a football player.  I had no sanctions and my charges were dropped.  He will miss the opener because he's a player.  When will espn give equal time to all of the other teams who have drunk 20 year olds getting into trouble.

How are you by the way?  I really miss having you around, especially this time of year.  OUT
