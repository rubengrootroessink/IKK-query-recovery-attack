I'm glad you had a good time. No mention of Pappasito's though.  Kemah is always fun, watching the boats, drinking a longneck.  We all walked in the Enron MS walk last weekend. It was fun but I had to carry Ben half of the way which gave be a better workout than I anticipated.  Had a date with Deanne Sat night . We went to "Bridget Jones Diary". It was a good chick movie.  Went to church and The Woodburn Tulip festival on Sunday.  Pretty neat to see fields of tulips.  

Tell the kids we love them and are looking forward to good reports on their various activities.


Love U


Phil
