 I just wanted to drop you all a note and let you know that I arrived  safe=
 and sound into Dulles Airport tonight at about 6:00. It was an interesting=
  flight. The airport in Denver was almost spooky, it was so empty and quie=
t. No  one was in line for the security check point when I got there so tha=
t went  fairly quickly, just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to b=
e sure  nothing explosive was on them. Then I waited 2 1/2 hours to board t=
he plane.  What happened after we boarded was interesting and thought I wou=
ld share it with  you. The pilot/captain came on the  loudspeaker after the=
 doors were closed. His speech went like this:  First  I want to thank you =
for being brave enough to fly today. The doors are now  closed and we have =
no help from the outside for any problems that might occur  inside this pla=
ne. As you could tell when you checked in, the government has  made some ch=
anges to increase security in the airports. They have not, however,  made a=
ny rules about what happens after those doors close. Until they do that,  w=
e have made our own rules and I want to share them with you. Once those doo=
rs  close, we only have each other. The security has taken care of a threat=
 like  guns with all of the increased scanning, etc. Then we have the suppo=
sed bomb. If  you have a bomb, there is no need to tell me about it, or any=
one else on this  plane; you are already in control. So, for this flight, t=
here are no bombs that  exist on this plane. Now, the threats that are left=
 are things like plastics,  wood, knives, and other weapons that can be mad=
e or things like that which can  be used as weapons. Here is our plan and o=
ur rules. If someone or several people  stand up and say they are hijacking=
 this plane, I want you all to stand up  together. Then take whatever you h=
ave available to you and throw it at them.  Throw ! it at their faces and h=
eads so they will have to raise their hands to  protect themselves. The ver=
y best protection you have against knives are the  pillows and blankets. Wh=
oever is close to these people should then try to get a  blanket over their=
 head--then they won't be able to see. Once that is done, get  them down an=
d keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land the plane at  the c=
losest place and we WILL take care of them. After all, there are usually  o=
nly a few of them and we are 200+ strong! We will not allow them to take ov=
er  this plane. I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with =
the words  "We, the people"--that's who we are, THE people and we will not =
be  defeated. With that, the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud,=
 people had tears in their eyes, and we began  the trip toward the runway. =
The  flight attendant then began the safety speech. One of the things she s=
aid is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace. She=
 asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce =
themselves, tell  each other something about your families and children, sh=
ow pictures, whatever.  She said "for today, we consider you family. We wil=
l treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us." Throughout the =
flight we learned that for the crew, this was their first  flight since Tue=
sday's tragedies. It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and toge=
ther everyone was stronger than any one person alone. It was quite  an expe=
rience. You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles=
 and we heard "welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport, where the local time =
is 5:40". Again, the cabin was  filled with applause. It has been a  very l=
ong day and one that I am glad is over. I have been constantly reminded  th=
is day of the ar! ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where=
  she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like, "Do we g=
et mad  and shake our fists at God in anger? No, we go on and conquer our f=
ears and  continue our lives." It is my hope that is what we do now. Last n=
ight I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at =
their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles, i.e., African-American, =
etc., everyone is just an  American. No one will ever be able to take that =
pride away from  us.=20
