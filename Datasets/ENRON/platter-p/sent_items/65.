Phil,

Here are our EES positions as of 12:00 today. Please let me know if you agree with these numbers. I marked the Palo Verde sale as an export from SP-15 on our schedule. Do you want this aggregated in SP in our EESSCTrade template? Also, my understanding is that the APX is the schedule coordinator for the New Power deal. I will not include this in the EESSCTrade template and will instead mark it separately as a sale on the APX template (part of the Daily Forecast template). Is all of this correct? Please let me know. Thanks.

Mike
