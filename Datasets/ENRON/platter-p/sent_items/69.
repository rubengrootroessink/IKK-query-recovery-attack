yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute.
How will the aggies be?

What's up with the huskers?

didn't look very husker-like on Saturday.
