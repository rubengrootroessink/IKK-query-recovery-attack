Dear Don,

I enjoyed your article. You are right, we are a little sensitive.  That's a=
 natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must=
 admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irr=
itates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had =
trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not somethi=
ng any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program w=
ho have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have=
 the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU p=
layer messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star re=
porter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners, just waitin=
g for some "news" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such=
 a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay f=
or them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every scho=
ol.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stic=
k to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defend=
ing and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman can=
didate in the backfield.  The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news be=
cause of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He b=
ecame the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but en=
ough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another Law=
rence Phillips.

Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your p=
ost game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans =
are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue =
to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams =
do well.  Take care.
