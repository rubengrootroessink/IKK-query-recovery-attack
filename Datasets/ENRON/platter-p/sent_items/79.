Subject: American Heart Walk



Hello everybody. You'll recall last year I raised over two thousand dollars for the American Heart Association in honor of my good friend Mitch Platter who died of a heart attack in last February.  He was only 36.  The actual diagnosis was something called "left main disease", but for you and me that just means a clogged artery at a very young age.  He left a beautiful wife and four great kids.  He was the best man in my wedding.  We even went to kindergarten together.     

While I can't bring my friend back, I can do something small to help fight heart disease and stroke.  The American Heart Association, along with the USG Corporation, is again holding its annual Heart Walk America in Grant Park on September 14th, and I'll be walking in the event.  Since the walk is on a Friday, most people can't take time off work to participate.  But you can take part by sponsoring me for this walk. 

I'm asking each person to consider a $25.00 pledge, but any amount will do.  Please e-mail back letting me know the amount you wish to pledge or call me at (312) 606-4507 and just leave a message.  Your donation is tax deductible to the extent provided by law.  I'll send each of you a return envelope and receipt for your tax records.  Thanks again for supporting the American Heart Association.
