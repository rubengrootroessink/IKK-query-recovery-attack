Hi Everyone! 
I'm writing to tell you about an adventure I've committed to this fall! I've registered to participate in the Komen Portland Race for the Cure on September 16th. The Race benefits the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and supports the Komen Foundation's mission of eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing research, education, screening and treatment.
Last year's Portland Race was the most successful ever - more than 40,000 women, men and children participated and helped raise more than $1.5 million for the fight against breast cancer! And while a number of strides have been made in breast cancer research and treatment, the fact remains that approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime. And although much less common, men also get breast cancer. That's why I'm racing for a cure.
The Race is especially important to me because my step-mother, Carol Cutsforth, died from complications associated with her breast cancer on January 14th, 2000. I am personally contributing to this cause, because I have seen first hand how this disease can cause a life time of suffering and sorrow for those who were close to breast cancer victims, and more than ever I want to help find a cure and help those who are in the fight for their life. 
You can join me in my fight against breast cancer without even breaking a sweat!
Would you please consider at least a $5 pledge to support my effort & The Komen Foundation?
My personal goal is to raise $1000.
Donations must be received by October 18th, 2001.
Your contribution is tax-deductible.
The tax number ID of the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Koman Breast Canver Foundation is 93-1068897.
Receipts will be issued for contributions of $100 or more, or upon request.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this opportunity. Please contact me if you have any questions, want to learn more about the Komen Portland Race for the Cure, or if you'd like to join us on September 16th!
Thanks again!
Diane Cutsforth
