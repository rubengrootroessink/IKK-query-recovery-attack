Merger Q&A
Nov. 9, 2001 
THE DEAL
What are the deal terms?
The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. 
The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. 
Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. 
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. 
Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. 
Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
What approvals are required?
This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron's and Dynegy's wholly owned subsidiaries.
From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?
Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.
When do you expect the deal to close?
The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.
Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?
The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.
What is the ownership structure of the new company? 
On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.
What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? 
A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.
Has a new management team been identified?
Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEO
Steve Bergstrom - President and COO
Greg Whalley - Executive Vice President
Robert Doty - CFO
Watson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company's Office of the Chairman.
Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?
Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.
How will the Board seats be allocated?
When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy's designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.
How will the merger impact customers?
We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.
Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?
No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.
Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?
No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.
What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?
They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.
FINANCIAL ISSUES
Why is Enron merging at this price?
Enron's Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: 
Stand-alone execution. 
Private equity infusion. 
Strategic partner infusion. 
A merger with a strategic partner.
The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value.

Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.

The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.
What does this merger mean for Houston?
We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES
Will Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?
The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.
How many lay offs will there be?
Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.
If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?
If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.
What happens to our bonuses this year?
The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.
What will happen to my stock options?
Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:
The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.
Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?
Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron's salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.
What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?
There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.
Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?
As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy's PACE program with Enron's Associate/Analyst program.
Where do I go if I have a question?
A detailed general Q & A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page. Additionally, Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q & A to address HR-related questions. This will be posted on the same website as the general Q & A. In the interim, if you have a specific question or concern you may email questions@enron.com.

Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks.

Will there be a year-end PRC?
We are still reviewing the year-end process.
Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron?
Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enron's.
Will there still be a Chairman's Award?

Will any early retirement packages be offered?

We are currently evaluating this program.

We are currently evaluating this program.
What happens to the Enron childcare center?
