Gentlemen,

Looks like we are going to add a new generator to our program very soon.  We will be the SC for Bay Environmental Management, hopefully starting on the July 3rd flow date.  They have 3mw in NP15, and their unit ID is NOVINV_1_RICHMD.  I will keep you posted on the initial flow date.

Thanks,
Stan
