ISO Market Participants:

Thank you all for showing such interest in the recent series of Symposiums
on Basic CAISO Control Area Principles.  The meetings were full of very
useful discussion that we hope has increased awareness of Grid reliability
issues and the impact of each Market Participant.

The Symposium presentation materials have now been posted to the ISO Website
at http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/meetings/clientmeetings/.
