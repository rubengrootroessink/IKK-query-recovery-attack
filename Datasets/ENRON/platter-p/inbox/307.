Hell yes! 
  
Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone.
