Stack prices for hourly aggregate Mw. 
2.	On November 16, 2001, ISO stopped providing to CERS the PG&E, SCE
and SDG&E Hour-Ahead Schedules. 
B.	Schedule to Stop Additional Market Information Relating to
Forecasts, BEEP Stack and OOM Costs 
1.	At HE2400 on November 30, 2001, the ISO will stop providing to CERS
information on:

Forecasted net short in the BEEP Stack;
b.	CERS will no longer engage in OOM purchases; and
