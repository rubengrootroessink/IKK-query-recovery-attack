Good Afternoon FSP users,

We have just finished a comprehensive FSP rebuild & testing phase for the next release of FSP.  The rebuild should address all the issues raised in the previous go-live as well as some additional capabilities for robustness.  Please note that we have already executed several hundred different test case scenarios & performed some stress testing using data before the Enron collapse.

What we need now is help from you to continue to identify enhancements and/or bugs with FSP so that we can go-live with FSP once the new company starts trading.  Susan Amador will be available to help in any testing.  You should probably also coordinate with her when you are about to start testing so that our continuing testing doesn't interfere with your testing.  PWRTESTN & PWRTESTP should be all setup for your use.

Here are some of the bug fixes & enhancements we have rolled-out with this latest release:
1.  Bid Curve - Ability to bid on zero volumes (for import, export, and wheels)
2.  Rebuild of all FSP application utilizing Direct Oracle Access components for faster database access & higher reliability.
3.  Bug Fixes on database commits to eliminate database "deadlocks".
4.  New aggregation scout to "stream-line" the template writing process & improve template writing performance.
5.  SQL tuned "Hour Ahead" template writing.  Confirmed performance of 1min 30 seconds on heavy transaction volume days.
6.  And many other small previously unidentified bugs.

We are very excited about this newest release and are looking forward to your feedback over the next couple of days.  Susan will probably be your best contact but please feel free to contact me at anytime.

Thanks,  David Poston
