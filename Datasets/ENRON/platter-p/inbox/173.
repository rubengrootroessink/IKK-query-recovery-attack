The new California Scheduling sheet is located at

P:\Trading\California\EES\joh2\SCH

There are 2 sheets, one for Newco and one for the Estate.  If you could please test out the Estate sheet and make sure it correlates correctly with the current old sheet, that would be greatly appreciated.  Both sheets point to different databases. 

There is still the known "holiday bug" where all holidays from 2002 and on will not show up correctly.  THis will be fixed in the new upcoming sheet.

The Newco sheet seems to work but there is no valid data in the Enpower database (all data for newco in the Enpower database has been truncated).  Hopefully, Phil and I will have the new system up and running before we have to revert back to the old Newco sheet.
