Here is some information:  One of the spreadsheets below has a list of counterparties that have not terminated their contracts with us.

Guys,

Thinking of preserving value for the estate, I believe we need to focus on any in-the-money positions that have not been terminated.  Specifically, do any of them have collection risk due to contractual issues (one way termination upon bankruptcy or delivery default).  I am aware of the WAPA deal - are there others that should be a priority?

The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.  If there are other counterparties that you know of that have not appeared on these lists, let me know and we will move them to the 'Bankruptcy Portfolio' we have set up.

   

Please let me know what other details you need and we will be happy to provide.

Thanks,
