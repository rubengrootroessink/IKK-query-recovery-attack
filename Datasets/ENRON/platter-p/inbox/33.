Peter,

Who are you going to use as "scheduling coordinator" when you start scheduling?  If it is someone other that Enron Power Marketing, Inc. I think that you need only send the schedule to me, however we will ultimately need to be provided with the actual production to verify the amount of production that is ultimately invoiced.  

If Enron Power Marketing, Inc. will continue to be scheduling coordinator then resume the same list of people that you were previously sending the schedule to.  I am not sure how many of the previous list of individuals are still with Enron but if you can provide the list of individuals I can try to determine which individuals are still here and who, if anyone else, to sent the schedule to.

Richard

i'm back.....  hope that all is well.  based on conversations with mike smith, our legal cousel has advised us that our original contract with you may still be in effect until you notify us to the contrary.  in light of this information, we have decided to resume scheduling our power.  could you please provide me with an updated list of people that i need to submit the schedules to (including e-mail addresses and phone numbers).  i would like to be able to start scheduling this coming Monday(4th) for production on Wednesday (6th).  please let me know if you are the right person to handle this request.  again, thanks.
