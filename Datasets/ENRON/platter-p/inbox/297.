Important Information for CFP? Program Students
Considering a Master's Degree
As you may know, the CFP? Professional Education Program is also the foundation for the Master of Science Degree (in the Financial Planning Specialization) from the College for Financial Planning. The courses CFP1101 through CFP1105 receive master's-level credit when you enroll in the master's program, for a total of 15 of the required 36 credit hours (41%). This accreditation is about to change.

Now is the time to enroll in the College's master's program to receive full credit for all of your CFP? courses. You must enroll in the program before December 31, 2001, in order for all of your credits to be transferable. Keep in mind that the enrollment process can take a few weeks, so don't wait until the last minute.

Even if you are just beginning your CFP? course work, you may still enroll in the master's program and receive full credit for all courses, but you must enroll prior to the deadline. 

To enroll in the master's program, or for more information, call an Enrollment Advisor at 1-800-237-9990 (option 3), or visit the College's Web site <http://www.fp.edu/adclick.asp?ciid=32>.
