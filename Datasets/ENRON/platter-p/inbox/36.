David,

As with all of the estate accounts, just add an est_ prefix to the id to get the estate id.  The initial password for all the accounts is s3cur34u!
If you have any problems, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks!
Leah

Good Morning Corry,

Based on my most current information, it looks like all the UBS employees will have their user ID's switched to the new security groups next Wednesday or Thursday, February 6th or 7th.  When that occurs, your NT logon (ex. cbentle) will connect to UBS's version of the O:, M:, W:, R: drives as well as UBS's version of Enpower, Portcalc, etc.  If there are any Power schedulers on your team that need access to the Enron Estate versions of these devices, please let me know their names & NT logons.  We will then create duplicate accounts using an "est_" prefix.  Example: cbentle will log you into the UBS devices.  est_cbentle will log you into the Enron estate devices.

Thanks,  David Poston
