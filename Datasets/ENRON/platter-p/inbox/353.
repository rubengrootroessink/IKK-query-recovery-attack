  FERC is holding a week-long conference on Regional Transmission Organizations in Washington  DC.  The conferences will generally be broadcast from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT.  A copy of the conference agenda and broadcast sound to the conference will be near my desk (behind Tim Belden).  The picture will be on the far-right big screen.

Thanks to Dave Steiner for setting this up.
