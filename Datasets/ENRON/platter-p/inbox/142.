Steve & Christian,

After talking with the Southwest desk here is what is happening with Azusa.

 Deal #831407.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Purchase from Azusa at $32.50  1/1/02 thru 3/31/02
 Deal #537901.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Sale to Azusa at $139.00         1/1/02 thru 12/31/02

	These two deals are the only ones active for January  and are being performed on.  They are booked out financially. All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.  

I hope this clarifies some things.
