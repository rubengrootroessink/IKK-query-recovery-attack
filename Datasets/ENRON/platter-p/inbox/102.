Dear Ms. Kapustka,

Last year I believe you had a conversation with my sister Molly Elvig about
any opportunities for me at OPPD.  I got in touch with Dave Dietz ( it may
have been Dave Ried) at that time and it was apparent then that there
weren't opportunities available. Since then, I have expanded on my
experience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon.

As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in very
uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.  While I am still
employed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back trading
as soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other opportunities.

I believe my experience at Enron, especially in power trading and
scheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at OPPD.

The past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the California
market.  My primary responsibilities included making markets on EnronOnline
for off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for these
products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had responsibility for
managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the prior
3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market fundamentals
including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices, weather, and
Hydro flows.

Over the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in scheduling
all trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with the
California ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.  I also am a
C.P.A. with experience in budgeting and earnings analysis with Northern
Natural Gas Company, an Enron subsidiary.

I am primarily interested in opportunities you may have in energy marketing
and trading, but would consider other areas in your company. I have attached
my resume' for your review and want to inform you I will be in Nebraska from
December 26th thru January 3rd.  I realize the Holidays are a busy time, but
if you feel it may be beneficial to meet, I would gladly arrange to be
available. I can be reached at 503-624-7995 (home),503-464-3934(work), or
503-701-9736(cell). I have also sent this information to David Ried and Dave
Kulisek.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and I appreciate any assistance or
advice you may provide me.

Sincerely,


Phillip Platter
