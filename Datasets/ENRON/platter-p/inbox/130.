MARKET NOTICE
January 17, 2002
Changes to RMR Conformed Dispatch Notice
ISO Market Participants
SC Settlement Contacts
Effective February 1, 2002 the ISO will implement an updated version of the
Conformed Dispatch Notice (CDN) that is sent to RMR Generator Owners and
Participating Transmission Owners.  We have added eight new columns to the
end of the CDN to provide a way to document Voltage Support and Unit
Substitution.  Attached to this Notice is a sample CDN to illustrate these
changes.
The first additional column on the CDN, VOLT SUPP, will be used as a flag to
determine whether or not a unit has been called for Voltage Support.  A "0"
in this field will signify the unit was not dispatched for Voltage Support,
and a "1" will signify the unit was dispatched for Voltage Support.  The
second additional column, VOLT SUPP MW, will be used to record how much
energy is associated with a Real Time Voltage Support dispatch given to
Non-Synchronous Condensers.  This column will contain a positive value,
which signifies the amount of energy that the unit needs to decrease its
Market Schedule.
The next six columns, SUB UNIT1, SUB UNIT1 MW, SUB UNIT2, SUB UNIT2 MW, SUB
UNIT3, SUB UNIT3 MW, will be used to list the Unit ID(s) and number of MWs
that were substituted for the Unit with the original Dispatch Notice.  These
six additional columns will record each unit(s) that was(were) substituted
and how much energy was generated hourly.
The modifications to the CDN will not affect any other systems, since there
are no formulas associated with these columns.
