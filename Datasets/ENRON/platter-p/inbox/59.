In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett
