If Santa answered his mail honestly...

Dear Santa I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud
boy all yeer.
Yer Frend, BiLLy

Dear Billy, Nice spelling. You're on your way to a career in lawn
care. How about I send you a f....... book so you can learn to read and
write?
I'm giving your older brother the space ranger. At least HE can spell!
Santa


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I
ask for is peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love, Sarah

Dear Sarah, Your parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas,
I'd like for my mommy and daddy to get back together. Please see what
you can do.
Love,Teddy

Dear Teddy, Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen
door in a hurricane. Do you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give up
that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. Santa

----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I.
Joes, a dog, a drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love, Francis

Dear Francis, Who names their kid "Francis" nowadays? I bet
you're retarded. Santa

----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I
left carrots for your reindeer outside the back door.
Love, Susan

Dear Susan, Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart
in my face when riding in the sleigh. You want to do me a favour? Leave
me a bottle of scotch. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are
you busy making toys? Your friend, Thomas

Dear Thomas, All the toys are made in China. I have a condo in Vegas,
where I spend most of my time making low-budget porno films. I unwind
by drinking myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail
waitresses while losing money at the craps table. Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know
when we're awake, like in the song?
Love, Jessica

Dear Jessica, Are you really that gullible? Good luck in whatever
you do. I'm skipping your house. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I really really want a puppy this year. Please please
please PLEASE PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Timmy, That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but
that crap doesn't work with me. You're getting a sweater again. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dearest Santa, We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you
get into our home? Love, Marky

Mark, First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're
getting your ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house,
you live in a low-rent apartment complex. Third, I get inside your pad
just like all the burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet Dreams, Santa
