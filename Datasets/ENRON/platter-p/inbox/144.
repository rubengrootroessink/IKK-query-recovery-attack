Phillip -
Thanks for the e-mail.  I spoke with David Reid (Division Manager -
Energy Marketing & Trading) regarding open trading positions.  He
indicated that he has one opening for a energy marketer (shift position)
that will be posted internally first.  If he doesn't get any qualified
applicants, he will look externally.  I would suggest you contact our
Human Resources area and complete an application so a current one will
be on file.  I will watch for the position to be posted and let you know
when it is opened to current employees - that will give you an idea of
the time frame for filling the position.  Good luck!
Laura Kapustka
