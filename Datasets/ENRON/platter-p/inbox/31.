In other upcoming events, the Oregonians for Nebraska 3rd Annual Founders 
Day celebration is scheduled for Saturday, March 9th.   The festivities
will kickoff with an exclusive social hour for Blackshirt Club members
only from 6 to 6:30 pm.  A social hour with a no host bar including a
silent auction for all others will start at 6:30 with dinner served at
7:30 pm.  Throughout the evening, there will be door prizes and an
exclusive raffle for those attending who are Alumni Association members.  

The event is taking place at McMenamins Edgefield Manor in Troutdale.
Edgefield is a unique 
European-style village, which includes lodging, a pub with a movie
theater, fine dining, a winery, a brewery, distillery, golf course,
gardens, vineyards, artwork, meeting, wedding and banquet space, and
special events year round. Edgefield, built in 1911, served for several
decades as the Multnomah County Poor Farm. Residents operated a
self-sufficient environment, raising hogs, poultry, growing a variety of
fruits and vegetables, operating a dairy, cannery and meat packing plant
as well as working in the laundry, kitchen and hospital.  In 1947, it was 
renamed the Multnomah County Home and Farm and in the late fifties the
farm operation was eliminated. In 1962, the facitity was renamed
Edgefield Manor and for the last two decades of operation, functioned as
a nursing home and eventually closed in 1982. McMenamins purchased the
property from Multnomah County in 1990. In phases lasting over four
years, the condemned buildings and land were transformed into a place
that is quite special.  

Edgefield also offers over 100 bed and breakfast rooms creating a unique
lodging experience.   Spacious rooms are furnished with cozy and inviting 
decor from the turn of the century. Televisions and telephones are absent 
from the rooms, encouraging a tranquil retreat atmosphere.  If you are
interested in spending the night on the 9th, contact Edgefield directly
at 503-669-8610.  Be sure to mention that you are with the Oregonians for 
Nebraska for discounted room rates.  

Our speakers this year include the dean of the Nebraska football coaching 
staff, George Darlington and Chancellor of the University Harvey Perlman. 
Coach Darlington is the only remaining member of Tom Osborne's original
Husker staff.  Darlington is just finished his 29th season with the
Huskers and his 16th as Nebraska's secondary coach. Darlington originally 
tutored the defensive ends for 13 seasons.  Chancellor Perlman took over
the reins of the University in 2000.  Come hear about the future of both
the University and the football team!  

The theme of this year's Founders Day is The Road to Number One.  The
Alumni Association is hoping, with your help, to become the number one
alumni association in the country.  You can help by joining the Alumni
Association - contact them at www.unl.edu/alumni.  When joining be sure
