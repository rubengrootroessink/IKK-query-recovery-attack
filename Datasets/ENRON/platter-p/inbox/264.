MARKET NOTICE
December 5, 2001
In Re:	California Independent System Operator Corporation
		Docket Nos. ER01-3013-000 and ER01 889-009 Compliance Filing
		Changes to Provision of Data to CERS
		Modification to November 30, 2001 Market Notice
Modified Implementation Schedule  - Changes to Provision of Data to CERS
ISO Market Participants:
On Friday, November 30, the ISO issued a market notice providing the ISO's
schedule for complying with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC") November 7 and 20, 2001 orders, that require the ISO, among other
things, to stop providing information to the California Department of Water
Services, California Energy Resource Scheduling ("CERS") which is not also
provided to other Scheduling Coordinators ("SCs").  
The ISO has accomplished all milestones as listed through December 3, 2001.
The transition planned on December 6 has been shifted until next week.  The
ISO is making every effort to insure that the transition is a smooth one and
seeks some additional time to work with the resources in the California
market to gain their cooperation with provision of inc and dec bids at
reasonable prices.  
Specifically the items that were listed in Item 4 of the November 30 market
notice to begin at HE 2400 on December 6, 2001 will now occur at 23:59
Wednesday night December 12, 2001.  They include:  
a.	The ISO will halt the preferential provision to CERS of the ISO
Forecasted net short in the BEEP Stack;
b.	CERS will no longer engage in OOM purchases; and
c.	The ISO will dispatch all available Energy from bids in the BEEP
Stack for both resources prior to the ISO making OOM purchases.
