MARKET NOTICE
December 3, 2001
Enron's Financial Security in the ISO's Markets
ISO Market Participants:
In response to inquires from ISO Market Participants, including suppliers
and Scheduling Coordinators, the ISO confirms that Enron is not in default
of any obligations due the markets as of this date.  Further, the ISO has
requested and has received from Enron cash security in an amount estimated
by the ISO to be sufficient to meet Enron's load requirements in real time
for a period of three days, in the event that Enron defaults entirely on its
market obligations.  The security amount is based on Enron's average daily
metered demand in recent weeks, the current average market clearing price,
ancillary service charges and grid management charges.  The ISO will monitor
Enron's transactions on a daily basis and will require additional security
if needed.
