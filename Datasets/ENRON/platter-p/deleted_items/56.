ISO Market Participants:

As you know, the ISO has scheduled four Focus Group meetings on January
14-17 to present the Market Design 2002 (MD02) preliminary design.  Although
we have suggested primary stakeholder groups for each meeting, the focus
groups are completely open.  We have structured the meetings as focus
groups, rather than large stakeholder meetings, for two primary reasons:

*	We have better communication with smaller groups (~20) than with
larger groups (~75).  The ISO used this approach in a recent series of
meetings on uninstructed deviation pricing and had very good success.

*	We expect to have better-focused discussions by concentrating those
with similar interests into the same meetings.

The ISO does not want to exclude any stakeholder and would like any
interested entity to participate in one of the four meetings.  If your
organization is not represented directly by one of the four identified
stakeholder groups, you may attend whichever meeting you desire.  We do ask
that entities participate (either attend or actively participate by
conference call) in only one meeting, although you may listen in to as many
as you desire.  If you would like to attend one of the meetings, please RSVP
to my Assistant, Julia Payton at jpayton@caiso.com or (916) 608-7069.
