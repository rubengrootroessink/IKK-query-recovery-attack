Louise, I know the investment is not liquid but should the investment will
do well and with the tax deferral most clients will want to defer the
gains.  The company in in the business of reinsuring the life business not
property and casualty.

Thanks anyway

   Louise, I am sending you some information on a hedge fund investment
   called
   Hampton RE.  The returns will be tax deferred and any gains subject to
   long
   term capital gains treatment.  I call you in a few days to get your
   thoughts on the investment.  Hope you and your new baby are doing well.
   Susan
