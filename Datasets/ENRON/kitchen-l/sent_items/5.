Can you redraft in light of how I redrafted the other one - removing Enron's name from the first paragraph.  And resend to me

Thanks

Louise -- Could you review and approve the attached draft of the cover letter for the direct mail pack?  The letter will be sent under your name.  I will come by tomorrow to get your signature on a piece of paper.  We will scan it and print on the letter electronically.  

Thanks

Kal
