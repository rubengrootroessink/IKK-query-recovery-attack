Louise -

We've negotiated an MOU with Alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for CFB based power plants.  It does not commit us to spend any money today; it's really just a strong guideline for what the EPC will look like.

Having said that, Alstom considers it a BIG deal, and they are flying in some heavies from Paris for the signing ceremony.  The guy below is the lead person from Paris.  Additionally, Fritz Gautschi, Alstom's Country President will be coming.

Bottom line:  It's tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 October here in Houston.  If you and Dave are available, I'll coordinate.  You won't need to sign, just provide some presence.  There's still some flexibility if that day doesn't work for you.

Thanks,

Mitch
