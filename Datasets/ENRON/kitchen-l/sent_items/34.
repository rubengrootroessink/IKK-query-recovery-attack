Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.
