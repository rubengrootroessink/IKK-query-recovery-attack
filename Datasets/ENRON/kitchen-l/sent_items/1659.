Here's what I have received so far.
This is an incomplete list.
There are still several traders I have not talked to.

Vince is still compiling his list for Research.

Central and West Logistics, east orig & trading, west gas orig, structuring and canada have not submitted.

Central and west gas trading is incomplete.

I have weather, fundies, arnold's group, fred's group, laura's group, gosset's, and all the apps.

Lloyd Will is handling all of power including Portland.

I will be out all next week but available on cell (412-4632).
