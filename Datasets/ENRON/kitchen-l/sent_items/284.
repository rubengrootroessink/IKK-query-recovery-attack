> For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and
the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on
this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to
complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial
groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start
the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.
 The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something
we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's
about it on the non-commercial side.
