With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
 
Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.

my order is actually future p\l based.  if it wasn't in enron n.a. i would put calger way higher.  ie - if it was pulp and paper and i knew that we wouldn't have the opportunity to trade size, chris would be in the top 3.  Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.

I think we have 3 that are on my list and not on yours.  We have big differences in order.  I'm very concerned about this process.  I'll send you dave's email and you might understand why.
 
Call me or resend me an email.
