Actually, it will go "live" internally on Thursday morning for the simulation, prior to which time all substantial changes must be locked down, in order to allow for data cleanup prior to Friday's book to book transactions.

Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning.

Kal,

Below are preliminary comments from Communications and Marketing on the Web content. We will be making more minor
changes on Thursday, during the final review process, and review the site once it goes live next week.

I sent comments from Legal to you earlier today.

Please let me know if you have questions.
