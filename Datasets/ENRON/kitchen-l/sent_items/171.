Dear Linda

I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.

I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.

I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.

I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.

Regards

Louise Kitchen

I have an important question, so I'll e-mail it to you so you have time to
respond accordingly. I'm creating the final list of which of the "Key Women
in Energy" will be attending the awards ceremony in Essen, Germany on 14
February, and don't have a response from you yet. If you'd like to attend,
we'd love to have you. At the same time, I understand your world is changing
daily. All the same, it might be nice for you to meet the other women and
for the other women to meet you. Please do let me know if you plan to
attend, or, given your schedule, if there is the possibility you could
attend.

So far, I think there are 15 women who have committed to attend - from as
far away as Australia, the US, the UK, Bulgaria and Germany. We're all
gathering for dinner on Feb. 13, and many of us are meeting earlier than
that to explore the German countryside. I've been taking German lessons all
winter so hopefully we'll get by.I'd be glad to help better understand the
conference setting and details if you'd like. Several of us are gathering in
Essen over that weekend and early that week to meet one another, share a
meal, and get to exchange stories. You've personally done much for the
energy industry and might be surprised what a warm welcome you could receive
for your extensive efforts to lead the team that built EnronOnline.

Please do let me know so I may complete reservations, etc. Many of us are
staying at the same hotel, so it should be interesting.
