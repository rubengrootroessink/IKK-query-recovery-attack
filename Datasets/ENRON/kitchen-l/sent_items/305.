Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.
  
Thanks

Louise
