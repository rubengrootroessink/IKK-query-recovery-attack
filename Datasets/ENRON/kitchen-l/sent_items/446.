Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all "reasonable" costs.

Chris will obviously be relocating to Houston in the near future.  We need to make sure we cover all of the expenses.  How do you intend to do this under the proposed contract?
