Hi Tammie,

Nice to speak with you this afternoon.

As I mentioned, currently Sloane Apartments do not have a two
bedroom apartment available from January 1 - 5, however they feel
that it is likely that a cancellation may come in which would allow
them to accommodate Ms Nettleton.

In the meantime, they shall be pleased to reserve a one bedroom
suite plus an adjoining deluxe double bedroom at their sister
property Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge.  The rate per night of
Slaone Apartments 2 bedroom apartment is GBP195 per night, and
although the rates at Parkes Hotel is considerably higher, they will
be pleased to reserve both the suite and double bedroom for the
same rate.

Parkes Hotel is located at 41 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3.
Below is a brief description plus I have attached a few pictures.
Could you please confirm that Ms Nettleton would be happy to
accept the suite and deluxe double bedroom at Parkes Hotel and
should a two bedroom apartment become available at Sloane
Apartments they will amend her reservation.

The One Bedroom Suite Parkes Hotel has:-

Comprisesof separate bedroom with double bed. Separate
    lounge with Sofa (sofabed on request at additional cost),
    armchairs, coffee table, desk with data port and extensive
    personal bar. Has a full bathroom with shower. Also has small
    kitchen with fridge/freezer and combination oven, together with
    tea making facilities
Can combine with either Deluxe Double or Junior suite

Parkes Hotel has the ideal location. Only 100 metres from Harrods
and within walking distance of many of London's exclusive shops
and restaurants. Heathrow is a mere 30 - 40 minutes away. Let us
arrange a limousine and enjoy the trip in comfort.=0F
