Subject:	9:30 run  -  Rafferty Update 

Our little Rafferty was very pleased to see her mum and Personal Trainer Rita.

She was calm and sleepy and did lots of stretches and she stood still when we put her collar and leash on - gooood girl! No mess in her kennel either.

She did not go potty, but we had a good walk about. It's cool and shady up there - no problem with the temp.

She got an extra nice treat for being a good girl going back in her kennel - no cries - she's the best.
