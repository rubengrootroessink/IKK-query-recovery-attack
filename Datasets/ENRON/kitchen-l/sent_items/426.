Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.
