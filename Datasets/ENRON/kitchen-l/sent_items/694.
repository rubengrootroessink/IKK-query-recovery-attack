In case you hear - Wayne Mays' son had an anthrax scare (white powder in back pack).  Hazardous Materials unit and FBI went to the school.  Most certainly a hoax, but FBI suggested they may come to our office.  Although highly unlikely they come here, we alerted local building security and Enron Corp. security just so they are aware.

what a wonderful world...
