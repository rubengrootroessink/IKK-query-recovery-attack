Yes - cancel Power origination

Yes - cancel them going forward - John doesn't need them either at the moment

Are you attending the Employee Mtg. on Tues. at the Hyatt?  If so, should I reschedule the weekly Power Origination mtg. or cancel it?

Also, the weekly Wed. Power Mtgs. w/Presto and others-should all of these be cancelled or should John be meeting with these guys instead of you?

Thanks!
