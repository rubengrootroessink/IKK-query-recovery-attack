Unless I am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal, does this mean we can do without this.

Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, the need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cleansed.

Why is this necessary in the first place? I really do not understand why it is necessary.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?
