Louise

Jeff would like me or you to do this.  I'm grounded.  Let me know if you can do it.

John,

Louise would be great on this panel.  (Jon Corzine is a NJ senator, which in our country is pretty high in government.)  Also, I think the PG&E speaker is scheduled to be their CEO  (tentative).  It is a pretty high profile panel and important to Wharton we participate.  I need to know pretty quickly.
