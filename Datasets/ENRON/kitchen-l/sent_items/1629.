Shouldn't we have let this group go?  Why are we retaining them?

Anne and David,
   Apparently some or all of my TAC group are on the "lay off" list, effective today.  We are working on a project that will require their presence until at least next week, longer for some.  
  For now, please ensure the following 9 individuals are on the RETAIN notice until further notice:
1)  Chris Clark
2)  Angie Wingo
3)  Jason Loup
4)  Junichi Sugiura
5)  Brian Mihura
6)  Richard Boehm
7)  Dan Orbeck
8)  Don Chancey
9)  Ken Kooser 

Thanks,
Scott THolan
