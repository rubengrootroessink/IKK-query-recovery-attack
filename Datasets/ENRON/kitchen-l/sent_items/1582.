I just called Colin at home and although he was still half asleep, he seemed up for it.
 
He'll call me a little later this morning once with a final decision, and in the meantime I'll get the HR machine rolling.

We need to also add Colin Tonks to the list in Jeff's groups.

Louise / Greg,
 
here is the updated spreadsheet (password 5555).... we miscounted slightly the total is 131 not 126. 
 
Geoff Storey asked me to make sure Larissa Sharma was included in the group as well.
 
The area colum hasn't been altered to reflect the 'new' role yet...... we've had to stop for a moment to find over 700 telephone numbers.... :(
 
regards
 
Steve
