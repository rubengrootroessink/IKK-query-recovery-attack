Subject:	Continuance of SFA individual registration

Hi everyone

This is the regular review of all Enron SFA registered representatives who are currently based outside the UK or who are not directly employed by Enron.  I would be grateful if you could simply respond in the affirmative to this message, in order for me to maintain your current registered status.  If you have moved house in the past four months, I would also appreciate receiving this information.  

I would appreciate a quick response as, in the event that I receive no response from you by 22 October, steps will be taken to withdraw your individual registration.  

Thanks for your attention
Best regards
Julie
