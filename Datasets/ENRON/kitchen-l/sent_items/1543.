2. Cancel

Thanks

PRC is something we should do all in one day.

I'll let you know. Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps.

1.  Not good.  His mom was only 61 and they had just moved to a resort community outside San Antonio.  His father is very bad.  Russell broke up talking to me about him.

2.  Inappropriate to cancel or proceed?

3.  O.K.

4. O.K., I have to ensure we do not make a unilateral decision that effects Peoples choices.

5.  O.K.

6.  Hear you.  

7.  O.K., new item.  Am I to be doing any type of ranking/review/PRC/appraisal/etc. of my employees?  Seem to have time on my hands and desperately need to remain focused and productive.

And... please let me know if I can help you...  Louise the person.

1. Poor guy - how is he?

2. Inappropriate.

3. No intercompany moves at the moment.

4. No interest.

5. See Jeanie Slone - she has it.

6. Get cash in.

Thanks

Louise

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura
