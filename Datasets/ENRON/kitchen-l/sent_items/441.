I definitely had a black mat last time.

I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.

So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
      Freight $250.00  

Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.

Thanks for your help

Louise

Good afternoon Louise

Thanks for your email.  I have outlined some costs below for you.

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
Louise, you have mentioned a black mount - the mounts are the board that the
image is adhered to and is not visible.  Do you mean a black mat.  Your last
image was mounted with a cream mat, however in this instance I would use a
mist mat as cream would perhaps be a little yellow for this image.  Mist is
not as yellow.  There will always be a small black border between the image
and the mount.
Freight $250.00  - you will be happy to notice that the rates for shipping
have decreased a little.

Total cost $1366.45.

Louise, I hope the above information is helpful and if there is anything
else I can assist with please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from
you with your final decision.

Cheers
Fay
