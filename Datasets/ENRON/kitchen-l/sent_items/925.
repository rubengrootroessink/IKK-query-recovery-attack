Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.

But definitely put a list together.

Thanks

Louise, there are several universal issues that span the entire gas origination business.  I would like to put together a list of discussion topics for dinner to make sure that we table those items which are of most importance.  However, you may want the discussion to be more free flow.  If I pull together the topics it will be a list from all regions not just my own.  Would you prefer to take this in another direction or should I prepare the list ?
