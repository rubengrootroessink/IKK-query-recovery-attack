This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.  Thanks.  --Sally

I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

thanks

bob
