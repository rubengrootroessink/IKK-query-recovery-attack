Happy new year!!!   Hope you had a nice  Xmas and new year.  Thank you so much for lovely presents.  Alice  adores her frog...it's a great idea.  When are you coming over?  We  are off to Megeve ( I think...) from the 15th March, kids at ski  school/creche.  We can fit more people into flat if you are in the  area.  
 
Later alligator
