Did Montovano clarify things for you? Also, Roy Boston may give you a call. I know you may be skeptical( at best) of me at the moment, but I care as much as anyone about salvaging this company and its enormous talent and I also "get it" in terms of what's necessary to get there( the perception last week  that I was trying to hang on to an organization and organization structure that was obsolete is just dead wrong....I was trying to salvage as much of an organization that I and others are convinced has always produced bottom line value far in excess of its cost( unfortunately, I failed on this point with two of the most important people at Enron, you and John...and I'm talking before this "crisis" set in)...I do recognize the need for the cuts we're about to make. Hopefully, in time, I can regain the confidence of you and John. Thanks.
