Went VERY well.  Lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you.  People most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too, but everyone needs to get over it.  Big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better....

Side note:  JL uses the word "I" a bit too much.
