Can we meet after we are sold - things are very hectic now.  How about some time in February?

Happy New Year. 
I know you must be very busy, but I would enjoy the  opportunity to spend a few minutes with you to discuss the former CommodityLogic  group, now CLPartners.
Please let me know where and when would be  convenient for you.
 
All the best,
 
Tom
