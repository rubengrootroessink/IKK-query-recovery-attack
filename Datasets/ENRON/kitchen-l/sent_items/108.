Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).
 
Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).
 
Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.
 
Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day.

Is it okay if I get Jesse(our clerk) to pack your files?  I want to confirm what you wanted packed.  All files except your EOL files.  Does this mean all binders in bookcases as well in your cabinets?

Is it okay to tell people that are calling for you that you are in London?  I told Pat O'Donnell you were in London but reachable.

Also,  do you want someone to sit in for me while I'm out?  I talked to Liz and she thought she would be fine but I wanted to check with you.
