Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.
