EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

Louise

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

Thanks

Rick

The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online
trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are
accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as
they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but
simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions
will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further
information.

Louise
