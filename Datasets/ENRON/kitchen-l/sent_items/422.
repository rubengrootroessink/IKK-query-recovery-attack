Hi Louise.

This spreadsheet has life-to-date transaction counts for all counterparties for North American Gas and Power.  There are separate tabs for gas and power.   The top 50 in each case are highlighted.  Legal entitites are rolled up where it seemed appropriate (for instance, there are about 10 Aquila entities which are rolled up to a single Aquila count).
