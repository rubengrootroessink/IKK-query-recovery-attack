Would you mind doing the following
1.  Ring Teresa at Jaegar and ask if she can get me another plum top (sleeveless)
2. Could you check on my appointment at Manos y Mas that I have a standing appointment every two weeks. 9:00am every second Saturday with Michelle.  I would like to have a pedicure every 4 weeks at the samr time as my manicure.  So I have an appointment every two weeks going forward for amanicure and a pedicure every 4 weeks.  The pedicure needs to be with someone else so its at the same time.
3.  Could you start working on the Trip to the uk at xMas. I need a chauffeur when we arrive to take us either to Kings Cross to get a train or go all the way home.  
Depends on price.  Kelly Ferrari will have the name od ac chauffeur company.
I also need the name of some apartments in London to stay in from Jill Whitehead - could you try ringing her - she has a web address.

I am not expecting any of this today, but its nice to have things to look forward to.

Thanks
