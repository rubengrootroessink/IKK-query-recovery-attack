Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.  We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.  We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.

Are you going?

Louise
