I suggest we kill this before the week-end.  Thoughts?

Louise:
This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.  

It is my understanding that they run on the same ERMS/TAG systems.  They still run their phys on TAG rather than SITARA which I think could continue.

John,


This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.

Risk Book:	1 full time
Logistics:	1 full time

Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs

Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.
