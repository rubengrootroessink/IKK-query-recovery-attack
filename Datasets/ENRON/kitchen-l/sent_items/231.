Ellen-

Please find below information on each item you have requested.  I can give a
credit card number to most vendors or just bill you for everything at the
end.  Please let me know your preference.

*Car Pick up- I have reserved a private vehicle for 4.  Vail Limo
confirm#4163.  They will be met at the gate by the driver.  Cost $360 +
gratuity.

*Ski rental- I need a shoe size, weight and skier ability for Ellie(b/c she
is the only one renting boots)  Also what time would you like the skis to
arrive, we need to have everyone there.  The car above should arrive approx
7:30 pm.  The latest we can schedule on arrival day is 8:00 pm.  The
performance package without boots is $34 per day + $1 day insurance.

*Ski Pass- I have attached pricing on multi day tickets, you do not need a
passport photo.  It will simply have your name on it.  You may set up
individual accounts for each skier, or I can run them through our company
account and have them at the home for your arrival.  I will need full names
of each skier, skiing start date, and number of ski days.

*Snowmobile- I have reserved 7 people on 6 machines for the 3:00 pm Tigiwon
Tour Feb 12.  I'm sorry I sent you last years pricing, the cost will be
$116.95 for the 5 single riders and $157.20 for the double machine.  This
price includes tax, forest users fees, and gratuity.  Please note that the
3pm tour will return at 6:30-7:00pm and it will be dark.

*Baby Equipment- I have reserved a crib w/bumper pad and high chair for
Scott.  The cost for everything including tax and delivery is $140.67.  We
can add a "tub of toys" appropriate to his age for $36 for the week.  They
also offer crib gyms, strollers, monitors, etc.

*Table and Bed- I will make certain that both these items are attended to.
There are sufficient linens for this set up.

*Telephone number-  for you information the telephone number at the home is
970-845-7479.  If you need to receive and faxes you may direct them to our
office and we will deliver them to the house.  The fax number here is
970-476-7861.


I look forward to your additional details.
