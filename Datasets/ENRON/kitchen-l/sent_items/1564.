The tickets will have expired but you should be able to get a refund on the return portion them.  Here's what Ayscough have said:-

Having spoken to Continental in London, they say that Houston may not
entertain a refund or reissue, but London would certainly action a refund
only back to the original card. If they need assistance get them to forward
documents direct to us.

Best regards
