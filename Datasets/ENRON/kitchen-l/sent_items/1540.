Louise -

Any chance you're available on the 3rd?  I recognize you're heavily tied into credit issues right now, but a quick "intro" meeting might help convince them that we're still in the origination business.

Thanks,

Mitch

Mitch,

As we discussed last evening, Mike Barnowski, President & CEO,  Alstom,
Inc. (North America), will be in Houston Dec 3 and Dec 4 to introduce
himself
to several Houston based executives.  Mike replaces Fritz Gautschi, who
retired in September.

Mike would now be available to meet with yourself and Louise Kitchen and
others as you recommend:
Windows:
Monday, Dec 3 -  2:00 p.m. or later  (Dinner is still open as well)
Tuesday, Dec 4 -  8:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m.

Please let me know as soon as you can - as you can appreciate I have to
fill in the above windows very soon.

Thanks,

Larry
