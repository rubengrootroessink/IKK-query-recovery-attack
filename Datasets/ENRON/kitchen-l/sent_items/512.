Just talked to Leslie Reeves about the meeting today.
 
Did I miss something?  Did we ever talk about a presentation
around readiness for a January 20th implimetation?
 
Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.
 
After the holidays, I would like to get in your calendar and 
discuss how Operations gets included more upfront.
 
thanks

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

Subject: Integration Meeting 

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday. The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule. This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive. I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense. 

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.
