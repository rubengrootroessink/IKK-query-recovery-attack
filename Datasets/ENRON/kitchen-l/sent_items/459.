Does seem a bit of an issue - who is in charge of this?  Robert?

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.
