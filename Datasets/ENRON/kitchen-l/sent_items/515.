Louise,
It was good talking with you today.  Please find attached a map giving
general directions to our office complex.  Note that there are several
buildings in the Westlake Complex, so best directions to find us at the
right building are:

Exit I-10 west at Eldridge Parkway
Left on Eldridge under I-10, following Eldgridge to first light (Memorial
Drive)
Right on Memoria to first light (Westlake Park Blvd.)  [do NOT turn left
before the light at a BP building..that is a different office than ours]
Righ on Westlake Park and right again at the first entrance into the greyish
building complex (Westlake One)....go under breezeway and park in visitors'
area.  Go to reception just under the breezeway, and ask for me...we will
have to come and get you.  They may have trouble reaching me at my office
extension, so in case either they or you may have to call my cell number
below.

We look forward to seeing you at 9 a.m. tomorrow.  Can you confirm you've
successfully received this email by reply? thanks.
