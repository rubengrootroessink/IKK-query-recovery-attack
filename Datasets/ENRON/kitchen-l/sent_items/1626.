Please see attached spreadsheet.  Total Headcount at 874 and Total Bonus $s at 13,019,750 
Couple of things to note:
 Based on Zufferli sheet, I added 11 names to the Canada number but could not split btwn trading and orig
Probably need to verify Canda number with Milnthorpe.  I noticed Disturnal was not on the list.  Is that an error?
Did not see tax listed on Master cover sheet.  Tax would result in an add of 4 headcount and $220,000.
Portland had several changes adds in blue  

Please call with any questions.
