Everything has been somewhat confusing recently and I made a hasty decision to put you reporting through Legal (decision prompted by the community relations comment) - there will a dotted line into the desks.

I hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks - it really has been Lou Eber dealing with all the reg issues.  

I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in  UBS.

Did you get your contract?
