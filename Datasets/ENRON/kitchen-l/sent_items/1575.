Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.

Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders.

Don't know if this will still reach you - over here Enron staff have all
been denied access to terminals.  Will try and phone.

Worried about you both - will the Standard Power offer mean you might still
be ok?  What has the collapse meant for you both?  Is there anything I can
do to help?

Thinking of you - can't really believe it
