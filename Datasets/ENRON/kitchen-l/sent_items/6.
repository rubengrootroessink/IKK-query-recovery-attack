Louise,

David asked that review the attached requests in his absence.  Both are replacement contracts at equal or less value than what we offered in original contracts.  Thanks.


Jenai-Kari will send the info as soon as we receive it from the estate.  Please place priority on the contract for Schields as we would like to have a fax as soon as possible on Thursday.  Call me on Thurs am if you still do not have what you need.  Thanks.

Jeanie
