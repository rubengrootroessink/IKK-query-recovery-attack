As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.
 
Thanks

Steffes is looking for some direction on getting FERC license and pool agreements.  Among other things, he needs the go ahead from UBS and legal to start an application process for UBS while he is still employed by Enron.  When you have a moment, I might suggest a meeting with key legal, reg and commercial people so we know what we can do and when.  This is also relevant to transmission agreements and ultimately to customer agreements.
