Hi Louise,

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

Regards

Mark Pickering

Anything here?  I think that at one time prior to filing IBM was looking to buy or monetize or loan against all out hardware so we could get cash but I am not sure where that went.
