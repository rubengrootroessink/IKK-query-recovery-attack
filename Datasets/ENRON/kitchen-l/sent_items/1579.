Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.

Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.

I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.

If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.

Take care & I will keep in touch.

Louise

Dear Louise . . .

I am so very, very sad for Enron.  It must be quite heart-breaking for
you--you made such an amazing contribution to the company!!  I am sure
there are many who must still be scratching their heads and trying to
figure out just what happened.  I don't know what your short-term plans
are, but I wanted to let you know that I'm very keen to stay in touch.
You are an extraordinary woman and I'm hoping that our paths will cross
again at some point.  Perhaps you would be good enough to keep me
informed of your e-mail address, should it change, and of your plans.

All the best in whatever comes next.

Gary.
