Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.

Take care

Louise

Happy New Year Louise.   Hope things are going okay down in Houston with the bidding process for NetCo. etc., and that you were able to take some holiday.   I want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to Canada.  I was really enjoying working in the Toronto office; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the Ontario market is definitely massive and exciting.  

For now, I'm going to be working on the 'estate' side of things for Enron Canada, but meanwhile, I've also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside (i.e. retail opportunities, online platforms, etc.). 

Anyway, per below, are you okay with ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK getting transferred over to Centrica ?

Please let me know when you get a chance.  All the London IT guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone, so I'll follow up as appropriate. 

Thanks, 
Paul

Centrica are not connected to TXU (aka Eastern Group) to my knowledge. At least as of October when I left London, they were competitors in the marketplace.

Is Centrica somehow related to TXU UK Limited?  I seem to remember that they were granted a license to use the name EnronDirect for 6 months in connection with a sale of Enron Direct (UK).

	I think that is a good idea.  Louise should be able to tell you if she still has interest in the name.

That's fine. If you like I am happy to respond to him, but I'll run it by Louise Kitchen first to make sure she is happy with the domain name being transferring over to Centrica.

Thanks,

	This is a business decision not a legal one.

Mark (and Mark) - Happy New Year, I hope you are doing well.   Could one of you get back to Josh Bourne at Register.com about this?  Register.com has been helping us manage our corporate suite of domain names.  My assumption is that provided the acquisition of Enron Direct (UK) by Centrica plc has been finalized, we should allow the domain name transfer to occur (though only for ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK as opposed to ENRONDIRECT.CA, ENRONDIRECT.COM, or other Enron Direct URLs). Will leave it to you to decide next steps...

Thanks,
Paul

Dear Friends,

I realize that some of you may no longer be at Enron.  I am very sorry about
what has happened and wish you all the best for a pleasant and productive
2002.  I need to make you aware of a situation that makes me very nervous.

We have been contacted by Nominet, the Registry for .UK domains.  Nominet
has asked us to free the domain ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK and allow it to transfer
away to a third party: Centrica Plc

Please advise whether we should follow these instructions at your earliest
(most urgent) opportunity.

Furthermore, if you have a moment, call me in order to sort out some open
domain matters.

Best regards,
Josh
