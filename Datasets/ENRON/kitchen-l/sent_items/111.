Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster
 
Hello
 
I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  
I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Louise: 

We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.  

Regards, 

Mark Haedicke
