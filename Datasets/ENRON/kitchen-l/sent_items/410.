The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.  
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further information.

Louise

introduce myself and Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of
the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a
relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be
met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As Mark probably
already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.
Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.
