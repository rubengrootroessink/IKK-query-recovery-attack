I can bring back probably $45-50mm on Friday, by switching to Paribas.  Maybe more, Shankman is working on his margin too.
On Peoples -I'll get back to you tomorrow.

Clarification:
(i) Broker Margins: How much margin do we think we can bring back via Paribas? The full $60mm?
(ii)  Peoples:  Can I sweep the $10mm to Enron and agree to put it back with a gty? Can we put the $40mm back to Peoples if necessary? What is the prepay - they possibly prepay us?    
Others I've got.

Thanks.

Joe
(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.
