Subject:	NETCo - HR Arrangements for the weekend

Appreciate there will be a great deal of activity over the 3 day weekend in relation to the contracts and offer letters we just distributed. Here are arrangements for the weekend to ensure you know how to get things done:

Contract or offer letter Changes
UBS will be keeping a team in Houston (at the Houstonian) to continue to produce contracts in the event we find errors or we need changes. Any changes to compensation terms, title or alteration to contract wording (ie not errors), need to be discussed and approved by Louise, John and Greg. In the event of their agreement or the need for simple correction, please contact following:

			Enron HR Rep					UBS Contacts
Houston Commercial	Jeanie Slone		713-553-7049 (cell)	see attached.
Portland (all) 		Amy Fitzpatrick		713-859-6266 (cell)	
Calgary  (all)		Either of above
Houston Support	Mandy Curless		713-516-0324 (cell)
			Neil Davies		713-857-4507 (cell)
									 << File: ubscontacts.xls >> 
They will complete attached form and shepherd the changes through Anthony Brown (UBS HR - cell phone 1-646-244-6311) and keep you in loop on any issues arising and the ETA of the revised document.
 << File: CONTRACT CHANGE FORM.doc >> 
Where any discussion takes place around whether we should change the wording of agreements, I will work with Michelle Cash and the UBS HR and legal team to agree and propose solutions. In this regard please contact me (713-922-2991) or Michelle (713-302-5522). 

Questions about offer letter or contract wording
Where aspects of the contract appear unclear or requiring explanation but not necessarily a change, please DO NOT refer the individuals directly in the first instance. But Michelle will again be on point to address these.


Questions about benefits or Comp or other HR issues referred to in above
Many individuals may want to discuss UBS compensation, benefits, policies or procedures. Below is the contact list for people to call to get answers to their questions:

Enron Estate Issues including Non-Competes and Benefits

In relation to Enron pension, savings or general benefits matters, please call Tony Jarrett on 713-853-7829 (he will be in the office).


Return of signed contracts and completed application forms

Please return these as follows:

Houston	directly to the Houstonian. The Magnolia Room on the 3rd floor.
Calgary		via fax (Anthony will supply) to above or return in person Tuesday to the local UBS HR representatives.
