Let's get some time tomorrow.

Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.

Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too.

Louise,

I would like to chat regarding Netco's risk group and your anticipated role for me on this team.   Let me know when you have a chance to discuss.
