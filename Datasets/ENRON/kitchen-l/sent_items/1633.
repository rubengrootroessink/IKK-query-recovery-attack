I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Thanks
