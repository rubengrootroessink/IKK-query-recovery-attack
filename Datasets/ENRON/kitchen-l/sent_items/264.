 For all you guys who had dealings with Structure ...

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"
