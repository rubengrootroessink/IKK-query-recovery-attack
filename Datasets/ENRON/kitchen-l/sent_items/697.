Louise and Marcus:  I received confirmation from Tindall & Foster today, that there is no new news to report at this time.

Louise: Congratulations!!!  One of the Most Powerful Women in Business!  What a complement to you and to women as a whole.  Thank you for the great inspiration to all the young women and girls!  I am proud to work for you.  (P. S. Almost done with the blue.)

Best Regards,
Bobbi
