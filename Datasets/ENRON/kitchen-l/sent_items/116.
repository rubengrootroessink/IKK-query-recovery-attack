I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.
 
I am contatable on 07778757656.
 
Thanks
 
Louise

Louise, I understand that you are currently in the UK.  On the chance that

you are picking up e-mails, here is a quick update:

1) As I was not in the office on Friday, I had a draft sent in the post to

   you at the address provided in the UK.

2) Upon review this morning, changes were required and the final copy is

   being forwarded to you by courier to arrive at the UK address today.

   You can just discard the draft copy which came in the post.

Any questions, please ring me on 020-7804-1791.

Thanks.
