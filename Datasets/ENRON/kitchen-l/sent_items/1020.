I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
											Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA
											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)

I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally
