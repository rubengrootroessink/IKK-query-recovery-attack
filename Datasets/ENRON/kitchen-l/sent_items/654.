TX Gas Marketing - (mid marketing, structured transactions, market area Hubcos): Gary Bryan, Mark Knippa, JD Buss (Assoc)

TX Gas Supply - (mid marketing, structured transactions, supply area Hubcos): [Jill Zivley, Morris LaRubbio]

TX Gas Network Development - (HubCos/Transportation/Regulatory/Outsourcing): - Brian Redmond, 

TX Gas Fundamentals/Support - (Analyst, Admin Assistant)

Lets talk if this does not work for you.

I was referring to all cost centers excluding HPL.

Regulatory does not need to  be covered by you.

Here's my cut on Texas - do we need more?

Director
Manager
Associate

Laynie:

Per my swapped voice mails with Louise last week, I have reduced the group to 6 commercial people (not including my cost center).  
Please let me know if this is what you need. 

Regards,
Brian

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows the positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.

Thanks,
