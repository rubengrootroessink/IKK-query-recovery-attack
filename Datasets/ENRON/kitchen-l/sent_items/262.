Louise

I hope you and the family managed to get home for Christmas - I know Swift thought it was uncertain when we last spoke to you.  Judging from the papers, you must be in the thick of it - I hope you do better than BP's published offer for the Enron Online software!

If things don't work out and you find yourself homeward bound, spare a moment to ensure than any taxes due to be paid by Enron are up to date - we have been struggling to get someone to focus on a UK tax liability created in April 2000 when Tom exercised options (in the US) and for which a much greater US dollar tax withholding was made by Enron at the time - but no-one bothered to pay the Inland Revenue!  It seems that we are making some progress at last in that it is being submitted to the Cash Management Committee for consideration - do you know whether its possible to lobby that body???!

Best wishes to you all - just got back from Gymboree's exercise class for 2 year olds!  Tom is at his career transition counselling service - I've got my fingers crossed that his next career isn't too bizarre!

Anna
