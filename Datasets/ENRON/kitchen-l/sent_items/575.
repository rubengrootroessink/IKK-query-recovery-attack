In the budget numbers we had a headcount of 638.  I would like a list of all of those employees of Enron North America, with work numbers, home phone numbers, cell phones and pagers.

I would also like the same for EES wholesale.

It may be easy to do this by looking at the floor plans for the new buildings.
