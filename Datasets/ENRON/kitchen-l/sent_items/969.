FYI,  I have invited a couple of my marketers and their customers to go to this on Sunday.. ENA ( my RC ) will not be charged back.

Who is paying the bills.... and how much are they? You would have to believe it is a lot.

I will be distributing the tickets no later than Monday, October 1.  (No charge will be allocated to your CO and RC.)
The main race begins at 1:00 pm on Sunday.
