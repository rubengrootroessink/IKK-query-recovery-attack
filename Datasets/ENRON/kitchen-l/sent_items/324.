Louise,

IT needs source code and documentation for all Exotica library functions. In addition, we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality. We need documentation for all models used by traders and risk managers. Naveen has a list of those models. My group can help maintain those models and the exotica library and provide IT expertise. I will help get a complete list of models used. Following is the list of Exotica functions.

Thanks

Zhiyong
