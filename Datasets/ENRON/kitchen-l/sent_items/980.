Maybe running Mexico replacing Max Yzaguirre - but it really comes down to cost.

Subject:	Executive Referral from Ken Lay - Gerardo Segura

I have attached the resume of Gerardo Segura who is interested in a position at Enron either in Europe or in the US, he currently lives in London.

Please review the resume and let me know if you see a possible fit within your worlds or know of anyone else that might be interested in him as I need to update Ken Lay within a week on his status.

Thank you,

Andria Stevens
