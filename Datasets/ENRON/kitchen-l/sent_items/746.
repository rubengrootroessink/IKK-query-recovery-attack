I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.  

Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.  Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub.
