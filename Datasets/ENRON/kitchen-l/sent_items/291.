We need to get the Exotica library - it's in the docs.  How do I get this done - it is in the deal.

Louise,

It looks like someone needs to talk to Jim Fallon for the Research software. Please let me know if you want me to talk to Jim.

Hello,

I talked to Jim Fallon and he told me not to release any software etc. to NETCO without a formal letter from him.

Please, make sure that we get this request ASAP, so that we can guarantee an orderly transition.

Vince
