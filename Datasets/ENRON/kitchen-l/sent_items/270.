Louise,

I know you are appropriately focused on the Netco sale, yet I had Tammie place me on your calendar for 4:30 p.m. today.  I want to discuss my withdrawal as a potential employee of Netco and my desire to remain with the Enron estate.  Consistent with my ongoing concerns regarding the Chicago office, I also want to ensure those employees remain with that business to preserve value to the estate.  They have done an amazing job on behalf of the joint venture and PEC has voiced their desire that they are retained on PEC's behalf, no matter the counterparty.

I wanted you to know my direction even if your schedule would not permit for our meeting today.

Thank you,

Laura
