I have been in contact w/ the candidate and I will have comp/ HR details for your review shortly.  Who would you assign the business unit interface to be?  I assume this is sensitive and would not be routed through the current staff in Mexico.  After I have the compensation details etc.,  I need someone to have an initial phone screen/ touch base with the candidate.  Thank you.
