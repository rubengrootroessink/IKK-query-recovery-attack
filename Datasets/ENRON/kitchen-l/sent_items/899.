Please be advised that we will be changing the format of the EnronOnline Weekly Marketing report to better reflect trends in EnronOnline usage and provide more accurate measures of progress in commodity activity. The benchmark date for percentage traded online will be updated to January 1, 2001, and historical information for trend analysis will be added. Finally, distribution will change to bi-monthly. 
For questions about the changes, please call Jennifer McQuade at 5-3614.

Thank you,
Teresa Mandola
EnronOnline Marketing Manager
