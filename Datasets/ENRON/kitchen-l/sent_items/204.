Louise, as per my conversation with John Lavorato, I will not be available this weekend to participate in the conference call.  The only concern I have at this point is that Derek Davies has not committed.  I strongly support and recommend moving his number up.

Regards, Rob

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise
