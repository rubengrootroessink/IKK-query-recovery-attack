Hello Pat,

We would like you to price:

Chairs (2) 
The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.

SOFA
The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).

PILLOWS
3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).

Would the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?

Please could you let me know the prices.

Thanks 

Louise Nettelton
