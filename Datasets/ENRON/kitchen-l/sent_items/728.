Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise
