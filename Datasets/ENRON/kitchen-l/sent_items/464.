Louise,

The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.

Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so.

If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know.

Thanks,

Dave
