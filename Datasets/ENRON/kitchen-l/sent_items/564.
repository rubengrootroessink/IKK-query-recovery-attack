Attachment shows where we ended up.  I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL. How does that hurt us?  It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too .
We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.


AEP sent us a very threatening letter.  Way outside of their contractual rights.
