Hi Louise - just wanted to say thank you so much for your help getting me set up in my new role.   Definitely looking forward to Canada , it will be a refreshing change, though no doubt I will miss EOL and London.    Planning on telling the broader EOL team on Friday. Angela Connelly will most likely be taking over the Marketing here though this is still be confirmed (likely later today). 

Thanks again,
Paul

Hi Paul - my apologies for not getting in touch earlier to let you know the latest.  Yes, all the details were finalized earlier this week, I've accepted the offer and happy to say I'm definitely coming to Toronto.   I will be starting Monday, October 29.     I will give you a call later today if that suits as well. 

Thanks and really looking forward to working with you,
Paul

Paul, I have not heard from you in a while.  My understanding is that you had a couple of discussions with our HR people about transfers, salary etc....

Please give me a call or E-mail as to what your current thinking is...

Cheers, Paul D
