Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though.

Greg/Louise: Our best middle marketer, Howard Sangwine ($5MM orig - 2001) is considering leaving to Reliant. If we were to offer him a contract with $25/25, I believe he would stay. This guy is critical to our start-up plans (ie getting contracts signed) as he has relationships with the entire Cdn E&P sector. Pls advise

I'm fine but ask Louise and Greg.  I'm just a gas trader.

Lavo, we may lose sangwine to Reliant (promo to director, $50K sign-on). I think we could keep him if we gave him a contract with $25/$25. pls advise
