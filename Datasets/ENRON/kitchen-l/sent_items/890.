I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way. 

I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise.

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year.
