 << File: excluded prepays run on nov 22.xls >> 

Louise,

Here's what we've got. This list of MTM values is based on a list of prepay deals #'s from Greg Whiting and shows value as of COB 22 Nov 01.

Global Finance has the rest of the details we need to complete the picture. 

Give me a call if you need more.


Debbie
