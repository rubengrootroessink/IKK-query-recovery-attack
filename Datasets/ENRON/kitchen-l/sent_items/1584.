Louise,
 
Colin came in this morning, spent some time with the Gas team, HR and then with me, and has decided he doesn't want to come back.
 
He intends to go back to UK in Q2 and intends to chill out untill then, do some travelling etc....
 
We had a long conversation about this, and it was evident that his mind is pretty much made up.
 
He was very flattered about being asked to stay on and he wanted me to pass thanks to you for thinking of him, and is sorry to have to let you down by not accepting....
 
regards
