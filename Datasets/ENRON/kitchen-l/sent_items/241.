So far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.  Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 -  15 less in Jay's area).  I think it would be a good idea for you to come down and have dinner with either myself or myself, Jenny and Jay together tomorrow.  Hutch is coming down tomorrow night.

Regards

Louise
