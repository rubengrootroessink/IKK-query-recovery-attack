Tammy

Let's get together for 5 mins on Monday

In general:

Commercial and Energy Ops on 6.

5 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops.

Also we need a resort of the commercial teams

Can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again.

Thanks

Louise

Attached is the first draft of the 6th floor plan.  If you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups, we'll ask department leads to put final names on seats.  

 << File: 6th floorplan 01.04.xls >> 


The 5th floor would accomodate IT, Accounting and Energy Op's (excluding logistics/scheduling).

Phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case Tues/Weds pm.
Phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case Weds/Thurs.
Phase three will include moving people from the Enron North building over - best case to be determined. 

Regards,
Tammy
