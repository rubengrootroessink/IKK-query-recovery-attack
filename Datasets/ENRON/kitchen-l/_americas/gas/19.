Due to recent events, mixed messages are permeating on what is appropriate business protocol.  Specific to my activities I need the following clarification:

1)	Travel Limitations - Is there an unspoken move to limit travel and business expenditures?  Is this business smart (as I currently manage) or specific to Enron's current status?

2)	Strategic Asset Development - I currently have no employees committed to this group, yet my prior group is transitioning to Frank.  Do I have the continued authority to build a business which includes new employees,  new infrastructure, etc.?  If I need to wait for some specific timeline (5 - 10 days), please give me a nod.  Especially during this time, I need to be busy/head down/about business... 

I would appreciate your response.

Thanx,
Laura
