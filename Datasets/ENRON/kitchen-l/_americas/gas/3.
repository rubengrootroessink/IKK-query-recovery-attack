Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura
