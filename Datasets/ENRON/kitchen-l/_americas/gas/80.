Oustanding issues:

1.  Need copy of NUI's bank revolver documentation. (Laura Falk to provide; left her a VM)
2.  Execute Master Firm Purchase & Sale Agreement - The only outstanding issue to my knowledge is the cross default threshold. I told Rudwell that we should negotiate all the relevant credit terms at one time. We need Jennifer Fornos to confirm there are no other issues.
3. Execution of NUI Corp gty for $50MM -final format sent back to NUI this afternoon.
4. Draft additional covenants required for loan structure. ( Tanya and Dave to complete once we receive the bank revolver documentation from NUI.)
5. Draft customized confirmation including #4 above as well as deleting non applicable Master language. (Stacy Dickson)
6. Complete DASH (Tanya)
7. Circulate DASH for signature
8. Execution of confirmation by ENA and NUI.


I think that's everything.  Let me know if I left anything out.

Tanya
