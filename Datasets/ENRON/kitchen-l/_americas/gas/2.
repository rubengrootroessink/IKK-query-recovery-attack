1.  Not good.  His mom was only 61 and they had just moved to a resort community outside San Antonio.  His father is very bad.  Russell broke up talking to me about him.

2.  Inappropriate to cancel or proceed?

3.  O.K.

4. O.K., I have to ensure we do not make a unilateral decision that effects Peoples choices.

5.  O.K.

6.  Hear you.  

7.  O.K., new item.  Am I to be doing any type of ranking/review/PRC/appraisal/etc. of my employees?  Seem to have time on my hands and desperately need to remain focused and productive.

And... please let me know if I can help you...  Louise the person.

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura
