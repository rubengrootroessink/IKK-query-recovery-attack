Per my lengthy e-mail yesterday, I am requesting the ability to hire Deirdre McCaffrey from the freight group to my new group.  Deirdre is top 5 on any list I would compile on employees I want in any group.  Jeanie Slone is preparing Deirdre's bio for your review.  Earlier in the year she worked for Hunter and I and wanted an opportunity outside of ENA to understand new product development.  She is currently in EGM and was the trader who developed and marketed their diesel product.

So, I need to ensure you are still green lighting the strategic asset group.  I am requesting the ability to bring over Deirdre.  I would like to bring her over as a director (ask anyone - she's there) and place her under a two year contract with ENA.  She is the caliber of Mike Curry and is amazingly rounded for origination - structuring, trading and customer.  Delainey and Janet have attempted to get her in EES consistently and Ed has already approached her about a move back to structuring.  Hunter and I have spoke with Deirdre and we are both strong on the bid.

Give me your thoughts.  I want to talk to Dan (her current supervisor) quickly.  She and I have been discussing this move for the last month and for the opportunity she is ready to make this move.
