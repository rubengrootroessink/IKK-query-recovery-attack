Louise,

Frank departed for the day due to illness and our 2:00 p.m. meeting did not occur.  It is not my agenda to create a 3-way problem specific to a customer, yet this customer happens to be the NE in a singular bundle.   

As a mentor of sorts (I know you didn't ask for that job), I need you to tell me a 1) back off 2) re-group 3) run.  Run is my instinct, but not at the risk of jeopardizing the transaction that I believe merits an aggressive stance by Enron.  This is your business and your call.  

Laura
