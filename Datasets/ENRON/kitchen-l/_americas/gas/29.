I understand.  The money out the door is approximately $1.8mm, however we have dollars in excess of that amount reserved.  The $1.8mm will be paid out of that reserve and will not be "new" dollars.  I will keep you posted.

Thank you
Frank

Louise, I am moving forward on the TBG settlement.  I see that our meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been cancelled.  No problem, I will find you if this appears to be ready to close to give you an update.  Structure remains as we had discussed.
