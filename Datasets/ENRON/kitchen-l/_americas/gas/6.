Louise, difficult week for all of us. I hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances.  

I expect to have the fully executed documents back from TBG on Monday.  We will be paying them approx. $1.8 million to settle Jan 1, 01 through Oct 01 and convert the agreement to a baseload transaction beginning Nov 1, 01. In addition it eliminates a $14mm liability.  Payment will be made from combination of Schedule C and deferred account.  Will then book between $700k and $1mm.  As you are aware, John reviewed this situation several weeks ago and gave the go-ahead. I will contact you Monday prior to execution.


Frank
