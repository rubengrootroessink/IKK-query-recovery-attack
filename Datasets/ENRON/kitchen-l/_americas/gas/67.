Louise,

This social e-mail is from Rich Montenes who runs the entire gas control room for Keyspan.   We worked together diligently on the first year of the Brooklyn transaction and I focused on his organization as critical to daily flexibility for Enron.  We have kept in touch over the last 4 years.  As we discussed today, the MPSC (Michigan Public Service Commission) wanted to "verify" with Brooklyn our record.

As he stated from below:
I will give Enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured! It's an easy thing for me because I'm very sincere about it. Our working relationship with Coral is non- existent. Nothing like Enron from my point of view.

I believe Aquila may be our competition on this deal with Coral being in the outside lane.  Kevin Fox, head of trading at Aquila, is an ex-employee of Chuck and has been spending a significant amount of time with him.  

Just an FYI... 

Laura

And the term we were both trying to remember is "stalking-horse".

Laura,

  Always good to hear from you. I've asked Bobby several times how you are so I know you're well. Hope being back in Houston agrees with you. As far as a chance of seeing you on Thursday/ Friday - I'll be in Hershey PA. with our friends at Duke (Customer/Golf Meeting). If you find yourself up and about NY some other time please let me know if you have some spare time. I would love to see you.
My oldest daughter won the Hamilton Fellowship at Columbia University Law School. She started in August. That's great but I find she doesn't have much time for her old man as she's apparently knee deep in work. Sound familiar?  The good news is it's not costing me anything and I can put up with it to save $100,000.00 +.

Great news about Di - she certainly deserves to be recognized for her talents. She was lucky to have you as a mentor!

I will give Enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured! It's an easy thing for me because I'm very sincere about it. Our working relationship with Coral is non- existent. Nothing like Enron from my point of view.

Yes - we still have roasted pepper pizza's nearby!

Stay well and give those 4 going on 10 babies a kiss for me.
