Thanks againg for sharing your thoughts and opinions in our 10/3 meeting.  In an effort to make our 10/8 meeting as productive as possible, I have put together an agenda (attached) for the Monday afternoon meeting.  It would be most helpful if you could review the agenda prior to the meeting and come ready to discuss your thoughts related to the discussion items.  If the discussion items do not address your primary issues, please let me know so I can either modify the agenda or include it in the next meeting.  If you have any questions, plese ask.
Regards,
Ed
