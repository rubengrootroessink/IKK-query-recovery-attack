Louise/John:

These changes are consistent with providing a strong Enron relationship at the top of the organization.  Dick will be stepping down in the next few quarters due to mandatory retirement.  Bill Morrow (our stronghold) is over all unregulated business (enovate, power, retail, etc.) and the utility gas supply function.  Don Field the new President, is over the utilities (operations, systems, etc.) and is a 2-3 year assignment until Bill Morrow reaches "seniority" i.e. his 50's.

These changes complement our objectives with PEC in the following manner 1) Upon Dick's departure, Tom wants to aggressively grow the company and imprint his direction/objectives, including taking the regulated assets into non-regulated business, M&A activity, and regaining ground on NICOR 2) Bill will now set the course for the retail business which will potentially provide Enron the ability to leverage EES via Peoples namesake in Chicago 3) Tom/Bill's legacies are directly tied to growth in the non-regulated business which were provided the $.268 of EPS from Enron business.  All other business at PEC provided negative contributions.

Please advise if you have further questions.

Desiree Rogers, 42, currently chief marketing officer of Peoples Energy, was promoted to senior vice president of the corporation and its utility subsidiaries. In her new position, Rogers will lead the utilities' marketing, sales, rates and customer care operations, reporting to Field. Rogers will also continue to direct corporate marketing and communications under Patrick.

With this move, Morrow assumes oversight of all the company's Midwest diversified businesses. Morrow will also retain responsibility for gas supply activities of the utilities. 
``Bill Morrow has done a superb job building our power generation and midstream services businesses into substantial income contributors,'' said Patrick. ``Putting all Midwest-based diversified energy concerns under his direction will maximize synergies.''
