Brian -

Attached is the listing of items that we have accrued but not paid as of Sept 30th.  We do have several items due to Bridgeline from Enron.  The first is that we have not received 16 months of the CES asset management payments from Enron (16 X $50,000 = $800,000) and the second is the Btu conversion adjustment to PAD gas for Aug and Sept that Jean has agreed to.  This amount is $274,000.  Net net, we owe Enron approx $226,000.

Give me a call if you want a detail explanation on any of this.

Thanks

Trevor
