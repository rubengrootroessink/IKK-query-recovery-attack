Is their anything I can do?  I am sitting in the upper Midwest and could go see any of these clients if it would help.  People's will be reviewing their situation every 3-4 days.  Tom came out strong for us, Dick continues to be the conservative and concerned one.  I still believe a call from you to Dick is merited.  His direct number is 312/240-4300.

Let me help you where I can.  Hope your holding up...

Laura
