Louise, need to ask a question for clarification.  TBG is ready to sign.  The settlement is structured to change the transaction beginning Nov 1.  If we delay, they may revert in Nov to operating and scheduling volumes according to the existing agreement and not the settlement agreement, which is bad for ENA.  A bit of a balancing act but I think that I have it under control.  My question is this.  Can I move forward with the execution of the Settlement IF the payment is not required until Nov 30 ?  I am sorry and I may be splitting hairs, but don't want this to slip away.  If I need to hold off on everything I will do what is needed.

Frank
