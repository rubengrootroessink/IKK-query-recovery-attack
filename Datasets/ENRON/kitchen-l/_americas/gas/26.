Louise, I just received a request from Sequent Energy ( marketing arm for Atlanta Gas that owns VNG) requesting that we provide them with "representations, warranties and assurances of performance" as it relates to our VNG asset deal.  Jeff Hodge and I are formulating a response.  I do not  anticipate a problem.  A copy was accidentally forwarded to Mark Haedicke. Mark has been contacted and asked to forward his copy to me.
