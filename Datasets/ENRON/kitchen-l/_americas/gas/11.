I have spoke with Tammie several times trying to get Russell, you and I together prior to his departure.  It has been my understanding that you are behind closed door meetings.  I wanted him to give you his take on today's events.

Please respond if you can still meet.  We are here on 32 and it is 6:09 p.m.  Hoping to catch you on your Blackberry.

Laura
