Hi Louise;  I know things are tough in all areas and this is a difficult time for everyone. I just wanted to let you know that I don't know what my destiny will be around here especially since we are shutting Broadband down and I have not received any word if I will be part of the work out team.  If you know of anything that might be fit for me either for the short term or the longer, please keep me in mind.

Best regards & good luck,

Arshak.
