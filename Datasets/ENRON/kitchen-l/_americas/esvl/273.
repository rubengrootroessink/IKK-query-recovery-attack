Michelle/Jeff,

John Donnolly, Head of HR this potential partner, asked me this afternoon for the following data. We have this and can send it, but can you confirm that it is ok:

Employment agreements for "top 5"
Summary of last 12 months total compensation (including Base, Bonus, LTI, Keysop, retention and contracts payments).

I promised to get this to him tonight or tomorrow.

Seems to me if they have signed a confidentiality agreement and we are close to a deal with them this maybe appropriate. I'd volunteer to take the names off and just have  our GIS numbers as a code, but suspect this will confuse everyone.

David
