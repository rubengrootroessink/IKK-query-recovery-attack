received this afternoon by CIBC (our Bank) at about 2:50pm.  We just got
notification a few minutes ago.  We are still unsure as too why the delay.
FYI, value date for wires was for today, even though you sent wires out on
20th?  Robin (Enron cash management) and your Calgary traders have been
informed.

Thanks
Kenny
