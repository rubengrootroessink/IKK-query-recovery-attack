Please see the attached reports detailing the gross and net payrolls for 11/29 (weekly/biweekly) and the 11/30 (semi) paydays.  I have also included the breakout by tax company for the Gross Amounts.   This first version has the tax company numbers as I wanted to get it to you as soon as possible.  We are in the process of including the names and will send you an updated file.
