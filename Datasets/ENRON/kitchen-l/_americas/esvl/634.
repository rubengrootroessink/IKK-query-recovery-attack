Hi Louise,  I've added my best guesses below.  They are probably pretty good, but I could be way off on Unify.

Hi Louise, 
 
Beth has reorganized the front and back office groups enough now that I don't know all of the key individuals anymore.  But in most cases, there is someone I trust still around who knows the details about a particular system, so I've tried to identify that person and how many extra people (probably best chosen by that individual) would be needed at a minimum.  
 
I have included at the bottom a small list of "cannot lose" individuals.  In such a small organization, it would be critical, of course, to have people that can solve problems in any system.  If EnronOnline was shut down, I would also put Belmont, Guadarrama, Hillier, Jenson in the "cannot lose" group, and I would make sure that Amanullah was one of the remaining Oracle DBAs. 
 
Excluding Jenny and SAP (currently this is not in Mark's organization and I cannot find any data on it), I have listed a total of 33 people.
