Michelle,

As discussed we are planning 200 lay-off's in ENA effective Dec 15. Can you confirm that the $4500 payment is applicable to them, on account of WARN, accrued vacation, etc., If it does presumably we will pay within 7 days of Dec 15.

I am getting a lot of questions and at this stage and simply send we will "confirm it's applicability in next few days".

David
