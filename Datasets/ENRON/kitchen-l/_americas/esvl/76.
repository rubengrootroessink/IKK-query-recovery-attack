I have been notified that TD Securities will be coming Wednesday morning for due diligence on NetCo.  They will arrive between 8 and 8:30am with a team of 9 people and plan on being here through Thursday night.   I will be coordinating things for them on the corp dev side.  Please let me know who your commercial coordinator is and the schedule for the first day presentations.  

The data room is currently located in ECN3371; however we are trying to find a room that would be more accomodating for such a large group.

I will send you the names and titles of TD's team as soon as I get it.

Thanks,
Mari Capestany
