Doug,

I believe that we should also extend the time period for the reference of disputed items on the Working Capital Statement since we may not resolve everything by the 4th of December (given the holidays), which by my calculations would be the date for referral of disputed working capital items to the independent auditors.  Perhaps we could go ahead and build in an extension period for the working capital items that would coincide with the extension for the inventory.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks, Anne
