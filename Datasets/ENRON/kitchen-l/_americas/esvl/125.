Based on my discussions with Jeanie Slone, I believe she has been severed.  I consistently followed the sitiuation to ensure she was retained and it was my understanding this was the way it was to be handled.  I know there is not a policy manual on this situation, but I spoke with Jeanie to ensure coverage.  It is my understanding Jeanie was discussing this matter with David Oxley or you.

Deirdre McCaffrey was in Global Markets.  We (Hunter and I) believe Deirdre is an extremely strong asset to be in Netco.

The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.  Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).  I assume there are no problems but if so let me know.

Larry Hunter    - Documentation 
Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination 
Larry Cash - Gas Settlements 
Jon Lewis - Risk
