Some things to be ready for:
Please forward to john if appropriate.

1. Buyer will likely require netco to use their form of isda and related contracts.  We won't know winner and form of contract until monday.  Earliest we could trade would be next friday.  Is 4 or 5 days enpugh to make platform changes for EoL and related systems?

2 I just learned that under the DIP documents that became effective last monday we cannot execute any new trades except in connection with liquidating old book.  St.clair is running this down for your benefit and clarification.

3.  Alberta ppa was sold?  When is closing?  Depending on canada bankruptcy ruling in next day, we may be able to access these funds to help support newco ops.  Needs furtther investigation.
