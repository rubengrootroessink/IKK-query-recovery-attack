Faith:

Please find the attached budget for TX Gas Orig per Louise's request.  I have compared the budget distributed by David Vandor to the budget submitted to the Office of the Chair last September (adjusted for a smaller head count).  This is located under the Natural Gas Orig - Texas tab in the attached spreadsheet.

My main comments are as follows:

1.  Travel and Entertainment seems a bit low as we need to be meeting with/signing up/marketing to a new customer base. 
2.  NetCo will need to pay for outside engineering and technical services as our in-house staff has been reduced (pipeline mapping, flow analysis)
3.  The Supplies number for NetCo seems low given past expenditures.

Please call or email me if you need anything else.
