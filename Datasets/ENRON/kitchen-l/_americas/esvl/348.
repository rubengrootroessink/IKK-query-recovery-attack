Per your instructions, I have reduced staff for Newco based on the following assumptions:

750 total employees in Newco
Smaller phone switch, sized for 750 people organization
Email supported out of a larger corporation and not stand alone
No Help Desk, coverage from trading floor support techs
No 7x24 support, coverage for 5x12 (7am to 7pm)

Call with questions.  Thanks.   JR
