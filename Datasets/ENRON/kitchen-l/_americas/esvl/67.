I would suggest that based upon the conversations last night we need to advise them of the same facts re all North American offices re the trading business gas and power:  to my knowledge, NY, SF, Denver, Monterrey, Chicago.  Is Omaha only the pipes these days?  Any other offices of which anyone is aware.  Please respond with all information to Eddy Daniels.

Citi's counsel has requested a summary of our trading ops in Mexico:  when did we open the offices, how many folks did we have there, when did we close the offices, are there any liabilities remaining related to the ops., did we use the US legal entities or create new entities, etc.

Can we discuss this tomorrow morning at your convenience.
