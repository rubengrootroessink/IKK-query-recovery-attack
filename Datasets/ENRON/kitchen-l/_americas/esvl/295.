Hi Louise.  A few questions/issues when you have a moment:

1. Will NetCo need a copy of Infinity for interest rate/fx trading and risk management?  I pitched the question to Jeff Golden.  He thinks the bank will provide this function and the technology, but he wasn't 100% sure.

2. We have a potential problem with visas.  Bob Hillier is on an L1 visa, and many of the development staff are on H1B's.  Once we get a letter from the new entity stating that these people have employment, the transfer process can begin, but it will take at least a week for L1 and 2-3 weeks for H1B (this is what I am told).  If closing happens very quickly after the actual party is chosen, we are going to be squeezed.  One solution may be to let all these people continue to work for Enron until the visa transfer is complete.  Otherwise, we will have to send them home without salary or benefits in the meantime.  

3.  When you have a moment, I would like to talk to you about two EES people.

Thanks!
