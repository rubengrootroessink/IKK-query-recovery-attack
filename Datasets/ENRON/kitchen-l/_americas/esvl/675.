The Amoco netting Agreement has been finalized and will be circulated for signature tomorrow as soon as I get execution sets from their attorney.  On the Coral side, the EEI and Guaranty issues have been agreed to and documentation will be executed no later than tomorrow.  My understanding from Harlan Murphy, a colleague of mine, is that Coral is NOT requiring the Netting Agreement in order to do the ring trades.
