Please let me know if you guys are still willing to do 3-way offsets/netting/sleeving or whatever you call it. Your pjm trader wants to charge  about $100k for 600mw in summer 02 with el paso.

Thanks. Also my assistant was checking with yours to see if any alternative to 9am tomorrow. If not we will still take it.
