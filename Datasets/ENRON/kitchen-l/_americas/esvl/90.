Here is what our model looks like from a cash needs prospective.  It varies with VAR.  It also assumes that the duration of the portfolio is short.  Less than 1.5 years.  It also assumes the we are profitable (it is tied to the GM and EBIT assumptions).  The business would also require the availability of L/C's and Corporate Guarantees.  The numbers are in Millions.
