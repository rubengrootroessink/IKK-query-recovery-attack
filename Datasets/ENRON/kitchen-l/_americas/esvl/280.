I didn't realize that was an option!

In all seriousness, we need to put some type of structure in place to deal with OldCo.  I understand Kyle's concerns, and would like to do something.  Unfortunately, we won't have details about the retention package for a few more days.  In the meantime, all I can do is hope Kyle will give us the benefit of the doubt and do his part while we pull the details together.

Kyle Kitagawa will be responsible for Canada.  However, it is unlikely that he will be willing to do anything unless and until he is compensated either through bonus or retention pay.

Rob,

Louise just told me that you have pulled together the org. chart for the management of OldCo.  If it is available, would you please send it to me.

Thanks,

Don
