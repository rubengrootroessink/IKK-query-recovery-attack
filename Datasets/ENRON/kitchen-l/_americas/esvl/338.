Louise,

Further to my previous e-mail, attached is a revised version of the letter with additional changes from Weil, Gotshal & Manges.  The second paragraph has been changed.   We plan to send this around at approximately 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.  Please let me know (ext. 66423) if you have changes or concerns.

Thanks,

John
