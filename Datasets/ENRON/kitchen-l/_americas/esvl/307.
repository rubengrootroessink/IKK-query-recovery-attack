Louise,

As I mentioned yesterday, I would like to have a meeting with all the ENA Estate troops some time mid to late morning today. Prior to that meeting, I believe that it is important for someone to have spoken with Ed.  Also, it would be great if you could be at the meeting (at least at the beginning) to, in a sense, toss me the "hot" potato.  I need to send out an email and wanted to know if you have a preference for the time?

Thanks,

Don
