Louise,

Can you please confirm to Treasury that we can send the wire originally scheduled for Friday on Wednesday (amount of (9,000,000 CAD).  Mike needs to have all of the cash with NGX by tomorrow morning so that be can trade the 5 day block tomorrow.  I have discussed with Robin in Treasury, but she needs your written authorization to amend the date in the system.  We are also sending them a wire for $6MM tomorrow as originally planned. The total wires for the week will be CAD 24,000,000.

Thanks,
Tanya
