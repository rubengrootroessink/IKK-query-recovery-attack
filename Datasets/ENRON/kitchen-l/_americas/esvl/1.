Louise,

I would like to schedule time with you, when your schedule permits, to discuss my decision to not proceed with UBS.  I spoke at length with Hunter this morning to ensure the appropriate parties were aware of my decision.  I subsequently left a message with Rob Milnthorpe.

I appreciate your support over the last few months and wish you the best of luck.

Sincerely, 

Laura Luce
