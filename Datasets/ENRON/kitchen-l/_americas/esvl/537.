Louise --

Mark mentioned you had called regarding EnronOnline comments.  Here is the currently approved EnronOnline statement:


For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of more than 5,700 transactions with a notional value exceeding $2.7 billion.


Does this meet with your approval?  In light of the merger, we are getting away from the daily regurgitation of numbers and back to our former policy.

Eric
