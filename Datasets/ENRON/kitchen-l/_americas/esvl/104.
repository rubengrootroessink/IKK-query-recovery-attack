introduce myself and Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of
the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a
relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be
met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As Mark probably
already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.
Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.
