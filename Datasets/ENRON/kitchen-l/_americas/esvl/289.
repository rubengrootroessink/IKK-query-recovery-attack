Altered it so that your list was correct, or altered it via instructions to HR?

i.e. Is the list you gave me correct for Bob?

Bob was shown at 150 on the HR list, which did not agree with what was on the list you gave me. 

I am going with what was on the list you gave me. Please confirm you did not intend otherwise.

Thanks,

Dave
