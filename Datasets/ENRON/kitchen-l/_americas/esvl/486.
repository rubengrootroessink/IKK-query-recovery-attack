Earliest is first week in December, but overall deal is at risk - they are having consent issues due to QF Status.  Basically, this acquisition puts NRG's interest up to 65%; NSP owns 64% of NRG but has 90% of the voting shares.  If you count the 64% ownership, NSP is below 50% and OK.  If you consider the 90% then NSP is over 50% and the QF is bust.

Our counsel (LaBeuf) didnot see a problem with this, but apparently they are the only firm that will give a good opinion.  The bank's counsel has set up an informal FERC meeting.  If the FERC staffers nod approval - we can get it done.  If not, we have a probem. Our original solution to this potantial problem was to sell them the loan, but this looks a little difficult for NRG to swallow in light of our now infamous innovative financing structures.
