Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?
