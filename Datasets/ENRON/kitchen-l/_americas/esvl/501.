I spoke to Steffes this afternoon.  I don't know what the FERC workload looks like.  He can answer that better than me.  We will need good representation at FERC during the next 12 months due to the California refund case at a minimum.  Steffes recommended keeping Alvarez.  I'm not sure that I need him 100 percent of the time.  But I am willing to go with Jim's recommendation.
