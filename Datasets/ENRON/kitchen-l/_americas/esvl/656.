With respect to my assignments  JP Morgan and Dominion -

There is apparently some confusion regarding whether a Master Netting Agreement should be prepared for the J.P. Morgan group or for the Morgan Stanley group.  We have been unable to obtain confirmation regarding the correct entities.  

For Dominion, I await the Master Physical agreements from Canada and the credit information from Credit.  Other agreements have been reviewed and the form of Master Netting Agreement marked up with the information available.
