Louise,

John Donnelly said his deal guys would like to see a slightly more detailed org chart which addressed what the org structure and main functions were under each of the technical and support areas. He gave me impression he wanted to understand for example what Accounting/CFO team did exactly. I think the chart we sent them previously was fairly detailed on the main commercial, senior management and EOL areas, but was silent below Webb(dev'lp), Hall, Rub, Colwell, myself, Headicke/Taylor, Bradford, Buy?, etc.,

Should I send a request around or would you prefer to send it?
