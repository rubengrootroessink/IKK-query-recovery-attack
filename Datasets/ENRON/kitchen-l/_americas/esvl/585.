there are 3 (AEP,HETCO, and Phibro).  The first number is the amount originally called for, and the second is what the call should be today based on last night's marks.  I have also attached a spreadsheet with the same data.

All numbers in millions:

AEP 		19.25	22.5
Phibro		16	16
HETCO		17.25	9.5

Thanks,
Tanya
