I neglected to spell out that at 5:30 we hope John or Louise will walk through the details of physical delivery, so that
everyone on our due diligence team will have the opportunity to ask questions that may arise.

Team:
	
We have set up two conference calls for this afternoon, the first at 5 pm (NY time) and the second at 5:30 pm. We are
currently confirming participation from Enron - either Louise Kitchen or John Lavoratto from the Wholesale trading
business.  You are each invited to join, either at 5 or 5:30 (the same call in number will work for both) depending on
your needs.

At 5, Ernie Pittarelli (Operations) plans to review with Louise or John the scope of the business going forward. This
may be of in interest to Pat O'Donnell (IT) and Per Dyrvik (Finance) as well.

At 5:30, the topic will turn to physical delivery. I would anticipate that Lou Eber (legal) will want to participate, as
well as outside counsel from Covington & Burling and Sullivan & Cromwell. Bill Glass (credit) and Mike Stockman (risk)
may also want to participate on this call.

The dial-in number, for both 5 and 5:30, is (888) 446-5348 (domestic) and (913) 338-9600 (international).

Conference Moderator:			James Brennan

Conference Passcode/Reservation#:	138925
