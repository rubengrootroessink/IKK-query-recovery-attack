With respect to the master netting agreements, Aquila does not want to enter into one.  We have forwarded Aquila a new Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement with revised collateral provisions which is the way they want to go.

I hope this meets your current needs.

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.



Cordially,
