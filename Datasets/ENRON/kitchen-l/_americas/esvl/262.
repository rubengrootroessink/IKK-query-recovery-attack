Anne

We have the following items that are contained in several key directories/servers that we are assuming will be moved.  If this needs moving or changes prior to the sale then we will require a team from networks that can work with each of us to properly document and transfer these items to a clean environment.  I will follow up tomorrow with you to ensure we have met your needs.

m:fundamental analysis directory
Contains all of the fundamental analysis and application.   The fundamental analysis/databases contains documentation of all the process and applications we use.

m:electric directory & power2 directories
This directory contains the some of our trading information and regional data.  A directory under this one call swapco has been created and a all key apps used by traders that were on their hard drives and home directories have been moved here.
This directory also hosts the traders models, position managers, one off spreadsheets and custom databases.

These server/servers host and contains all of our fundamental material and applications.
