Hi Everybody.

Just a short note to provide an update as to where we are with all this $$
flying around.

As of right now, NGX is holding the following (in millions):
Cash:
CAD$22.25
USD$2.88

On Nov 26th, we will be holding back CAD$2.8 from Oct.
settlement/deliveries.

NGX will be registering its interest in the Collateral (cash) provided by
Enron Canada Corp early next week.  I left message for Greg Johnston, legal,
Enron Canada Corp.  Our lawyer is away today but will be in Monday.

Have a good weekend all.

Thanks
