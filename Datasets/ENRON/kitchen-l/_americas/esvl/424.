Here is the file for PRM estimated cashflow as of 11/21.  We are working to get commodity breakout for tomorrow's data.  The file now consists of 4 sections with three tabs each.  The sections are:

All Data - EWS / EES / London
ENA Only
EPMI Only
Other - Entities other than ENA and EPMI

The three tabs are:

Data by month thru contract end
Data by month thru Dec 2002 
Data by month thru 2002 and summarized by year thereafter

If you have any questions please call.
