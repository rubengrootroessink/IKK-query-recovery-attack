Ray -

Per our conversation, see the informational requests that will be essential
as we head down the next path.

Andrew Feldstein and Dinsa Mehta are coming in tomorrow and will be focused
on the trading book aspect of our analysis. They will be in town and ready
to go by noon.

See you tomorrow

Rick

Subject:Information on Trading Book

In order to advance the dialogue on any structures which involve taking
risk to
the trading business, we'll need to start out with the following
information.
I was hoping you could communicate this to the company.   Jeff had
previously
requested some of this; but we haven't gotten anything.  If you know of
people
internally who have some of the information, we can get it from them;
although
it's kind of important that all the information is recent and from the same
(or
very close) date.

1.  Break down of the balance sheet positions(unrealized gains and
unrealized
losses) by trading book and product type.

2. List of UG/L of largest counterparties on both the UG and UL side
(hopefully
20-30% of cpties make up 70-80% of UG/L)

3.  Break out balance sheet by type of contract (ISDA vs other contracts).

4.  Risk positions/sensitivities based on their standard units of
measure/methodologies; eg,
- price sensitivities
- vol sensitivities
- VAR
- stress tests

5.  Historical P&L statements for each trading book (monthly) going back
2yrs.

6.  Analysis of collateral/margin provisions.  How much currently posted.
What
happens with downgrades/upgrades.


Jeff - have I missed or misstated anything?

We shld discuss how it would be best to go through the info (over the
phone, we
go there, they come here, etc).  But first step is having them pull it
together; or tell us what they can/will provide.

Thanks a lot.

Andrew
