Louise,

I got your note regarding the estimated costs in CGS Physical Statement Of Work. According to my knowledge, the Indirect Expense includes overheads of HR, Corp, Accounting, Tax, Legal, Infrastructure, etc. The estimated Indirect Expense of the project for EA is $281,415. There are direct expenses associated with Steve Stock's and Beth Perlman's cost centers. The estimated Direct Expense of the project for EA is $184,107. The estimated Cost Center & Indirect Expense for EA is the sum of those two types of expenses and is equal to $465,522 that is presented in the document.

Therefore, I am afraid that my estimated project costs presented in the document do include all corporate and cost center overheads. Would you please let me know if I missed anything else?

Thanks

Zhiyong
