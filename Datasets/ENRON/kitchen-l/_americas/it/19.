Louise, 

I heard you were looking for a contact list for applications, and had been passed a spreadsheet to update, that had all the business areas, leads and their directs....

We already have an escalation list for applications (see attachment),  and people are supposed to maintain it in LiveLink.... will this do as is?, or would you like it in the same format as the spreadsheet? 

I've attached a Word Doc version, in case you can't get to the LiveLink URL below.

regards 

Steve

Did you know that  Application Development & Support has a list of escalation contacts for all applications we support?


The Application Escalation Contact List provides information on who to contact (and how to contact them) regarding issues with applications supported by Application Development and Support. 

To view the Application Escalation List, click here -> http://edms.livelink.enron.com/ena/livelink.exe/10703143/Application_Escalation_List.doc?func=doc.Fetch&nodeid=10703143. It can also be found in the "Trading Applications - Internally Developed" section of the Need To Know Website (<http://needtoknow.corp.enron.com/>). 

How to Update the Application Escalation List
Since the list is a valuable tool for both the Resolution Center and other developers, it is critical the list be kept up-to-date. Please note that changes to the Application Escalation List are also made in the new IT Contacts Website, which is primarily used by Infrastructure. You only need to request a change to the Application Escalation List.  Please email me your changes as they occur and I will ensure both the Application Escalation List and the IT Contacts Website are updated.

Below are a few reasons you may need to update the Application Escalation List:
?	Staffing/Organization Changes
?	New Applications
?	Applications No Longer in Existence
?	Contact Method Changes (New Numbers, etc)

Thanks!
