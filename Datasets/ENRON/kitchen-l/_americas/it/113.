Louise -

Hope all is well. As per my voicemail, would you please consider
partcipating in a 20 minute conversation with Rai Archiboldn regarding his
report on Transaction Management Infrastructure (see attached
questionaire). If not yourself then perhaps someone on your team at EOL.

Give me a call with the appropriate name and number and I'll get Rai to
arrange a time with that person.

Thanks
