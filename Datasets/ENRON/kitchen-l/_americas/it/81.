A new directory (m:\eprojects directory (\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\Eprojects) has been created to house all of the related documents that will be used to manage the east trading enhancement projects. The intent of this directory is to store all of the business requirements, documentation and project management for this project as well as all future work on our systems.

There has been 5 directories set up, Accenture, North East, Mid West, South East and Ercot.  Below these main directories there is three directories for Risk Systems (Casey/Stacey), Settlement Systems (Thresa) and Trading Systems (Correy).  A draft scope and action item document has been created for managing business requirements and progress.  The Accenture directory will be populated with the material that is in the initial Accenture report for our ongoing enhancement.

You have been given access (r/w) to the m:\eprojects directory (\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\Eprojects).  If you have additional staff that require access please submit an erequest for my approval.
Thanks.
