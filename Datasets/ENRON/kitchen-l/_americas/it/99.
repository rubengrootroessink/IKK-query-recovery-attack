Notes
?	Position roll-up process hangs sometimes in the production environment. This bug has been fixed in the parallel environment. The developer is now applying the fix to the production code.
?	The performance of loading curve to the position manager has been improved in the parallel environment. The same change will be applied to the production code.
?	We need to look into the current way of computing curve shift for Gas Daily options because it creates a large second order amount.
