Budget update/suggestions:
=20
Piper, Richter, and Webb met with Whalley this Saturday for a few hours on =
overall EnronOnline strategy and budget.  We showed him the development com=
pleted to date and the general development list going forward.  We also sho=
wed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 1=
2 months.  We also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forwa=
rd.  Finally, we showed him the same suggested EOL budget plan we showed yo=
u, including 2001 plan vs. 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan as well as the alloc=
ation methodology.  Greg is generally OK with the total 2002 plan number fo=
r EOL ($37.7 million fully loaded with bonus, indirects and depreciation), =
why we want that money and where it would be spent.  What he did not like w=
as the allocation methodology, which is currently cost based and based on d=
evelopment and products.  He suggested a charge that included a fixed fee p=
lus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transacti=
on charge, etc.  Richter and Webb are researching that and will try to see =
if it will work.  I think you and I can agree the $37.7 million is good for=
 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for EA.  The current cost bas=
ed suggestion for EA for EOL for 2002 is about $22 million.  A question is,=
 will you and Lavo accept any charges for 2002 for EOL based on transaction=
s?  Sheriff also has the entire EOL suggested budget and his part.  We meet=
 EIM and EGM today on their total ENW charges.

On Operations, the current suggested 2002 EA charge is $44.7 million, which=
 is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast (Sal=
ly and Bob and I can explain that in detail this week).  What I would like =
to do is agree between you and I that you will accept that as EAs budget nu=
mber for 2002 plan for Operations.  What we still need to work on is how we=
 would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes tra=
nsaction counts.
=20
On infrastructure, the current suggested EA plan number for 2002 $40.9 mill=
ion.  This is down from 2001 forecast.  This does not include the $10.5 mil=
lion of controllable expense you budget directly for EA.  The issue left he=
re is what is EAs headcount, what is the headcount in IT development and wh=
at is the server infrastructure charge related to IT development that would=
 effect the EA number.  On the first issue, we have the EA headcount as rep=
resented by HR.  The current EA infrastructure charge assumes that complete=
 number.  It is larger than the number you have.  You have requested we dea=
l with some of that additional headcount differently since EA can't bill ou=
t those on a fully loaded basis.  We will work with Wes and his team on tha=
t today and tomorrow to come up with a plan.
=20
On IT Development, the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for EA, f=
ully loaded, is $$44.5 million vs. a 2001 forecast of $34.4 million.  Also,=
 the 2002 suggested capital number for EA is $50.1 million vs. a 2001 forec=
ast capital number of $50 million.  The question is, what did you get for y=
our $84.4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $94.6 million in 2002?=
  First, Mark and Sally and I met on Sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbe=
rs to be down from 2001 forecast.  What we need to do in the next three day=
s is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development project=
s for 2002 for EA.  Our team is Bob Hall, Mark Pickering (Mark will call on=
 Stock and Perlman and Rao and Hotte as he sees necessary) and Greg Piper w=
ith Pickering having the final say for ENW. Can you tell me who you want fr=
om your side (Story? Belden?) to work with us three over the next few days =
until we agree?  We want to work on it around the clock until it is at leas=
t approximately right.
