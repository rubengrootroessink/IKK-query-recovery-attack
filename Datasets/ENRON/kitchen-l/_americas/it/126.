Hi Louise,

I tried to call a moment ago, but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting.

I wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team, as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week, and Geoff Storey himself was wondering how we could even get to Transport Valuation in ERMS in that time frame.

They are heading for a draft by the end of the week, but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through  it.

Could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week?......or can I let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead?

best regards

Steve

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Louise

Incompatibility of TIBCO version 5.x and 6.x. The single point of deal entry is done using TIBCO 6.x. Some users are still using TIBCO 5.x. Upgrading to either TIBCO 6.x or Windows 2000 is needed.
