Louise,

at the moment.......Beth Perlman, Zhiyong Wei and Dave Nommensen are out of the office for a few days, so it's a little difficult to work through the resource issues. However, I've got some dialog going with some of the other technical resources (like Francis Lim, and Sanjay Gupta) at the moment.

As the TAGG/ERMS team has a large task list (prioritised by the business on a bi-weekly basis), I've asked them to produce a list of all North America tasks, paying particular attention to those that may have been poorly prioritised. I'm doing this so we can identify which resources are working towards the GTV.

I'd still like the opportunity of getting a Global Valuation presentation to you before we dismember the team though, and would appreciate 1/2 hour of your time if you can spare it, over the next couple of days. Would this be possible ?

regards

Steve
