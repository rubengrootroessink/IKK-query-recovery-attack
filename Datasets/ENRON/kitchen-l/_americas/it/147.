FYI...  Tim requested this info as part of trying to get the Razorfish SOW signed.  Good one-page executive summary of the cost and time associated with the FSP/VMS product development and rollout across multiple markets...

Glad to discuss...

Steve

Murray / Tim,  Latest version attached.  The actuals have been verified...  Murray,  I'll give you a call to discuss estimating assumptions.  I'm heading to CA around 3:00 this afternoon (Cal Recruiting Career Fair), so I need to wrap this up...

Thanks.   Steve
