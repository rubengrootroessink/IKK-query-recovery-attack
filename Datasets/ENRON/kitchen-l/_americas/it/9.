Louise--
 
I would like to meet with you in order to lay out our plans for each of the groups within EnronOnline, specifically Origination.  While I plan to aggressively look at expenses, my belief is that with a reduced staff our Origination team can create significant strategic and monetary value.  And since it's becoming more apparent that EA will be paying the lion's share of EOL in 2002, your input into our plans is critical.  Please let me know if you have time on Monday before we need to finalize our headcount plans on Tuesday.
 
Thanks in advance,
Brad
