After consulting with the personnel of the remote team, we have assessed their needs, and are prepared to begin the initial swap-out of CRTs for Flat Panels to the various locations.

Our first targets are Toronto (10 18" flats) and Calgary (25 15" flats). 

As we receive more through additional moves, we will include Portland, New York, Chicago, and other locations as needed.

I just need to know that everyone's okay for us to begin this process.  Thanks.

Regards,
