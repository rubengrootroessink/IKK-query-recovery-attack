Louise,

with regards to the TIBCO compatability issue.....

If you dont want to wait for the Windows 2000 migration in mid May, it appears that migrating to TIBCO 6.5 in NT4 requires running a migration script that takes about 15 to 20 minutes, but there is a risk that there would be some interruption if the migration doesn't go to plan.

We could go for this Friday, and the Infrastructure team are already working on modifying a version of the migration script to work on Windows NT4, in anticipation.

Another option would be ask the  Windows 2000 migration team to switch their roll-out schedule around to pick up the single-deal entry users earlier

Please let me know if you are prepared to wait for the Windows 2000 roll-out. 

regards

Steve
