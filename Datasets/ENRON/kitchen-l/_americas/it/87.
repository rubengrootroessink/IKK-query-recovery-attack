I will talk to George.  

I am not sure Philippe stopped using them but I thought he shut off their carte blanche building access.

Do you remember the problems you guys had with PWC and Enron Offline when they remarketed without your permission.  Philippe told me you guys had cut them off but I saw George Wasaff bring them in to see Mark today and George told me that he is using themin several different locations.  You and George may want to discuss as they did stepway out of line with you guys.
