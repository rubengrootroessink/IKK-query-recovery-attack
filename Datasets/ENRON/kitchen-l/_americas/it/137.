Beth,

Per my other note, see enclosed the computational science related projects.
The point here was to explore the possible development and marketing of very
high bandwidth services such as teleimmersion, telepresence, and various
collaboratory techniques. Computational power on demand from large
computational grids which could be bought and sold like electricity is
another project under development at the Lab. Again both ideas involve
collaborations between our organizations to develop new approaches that
ENRON could transform into new commodity items that could be traded.

I also am interested in exploring new approaches in energy storage via new
generation flywheel energy storage systems that would be installed at
substations. These units would allow companies to store power at night while
rates and demand are lower and then use it during peak periods. The idea
here is that this would provide more power as needed without new electrical
infrastructures. These systems could be used again as a new commodity,
electric power storage space.

All of these items are in the development stage, but with sufficient
additional funding and technical collaboration from ENRON and its partner
companies, new value from new services could be generated.

We also are a leader in developing high temperature superconductivity wire
for use in electric power cables which will enable considerably more power
to move through the same "space". This will enable areas that are power
strapped (and space constrained such as in large urban areas) to push more
electricity without very expensive upgrades to the related infrastructure
such as roads, sidewalks, buildings,etc.

I have provided a few URLs below for your associates review. Our homepage is
at http://www.anl.gov which is the launch site for much of the information
on the labs capabilities. We also have a software shop under the technology
transfer button on the top row, middle section which might be of interest to
you.

Ross,

My eyes must have crossed when I was typing the URL's. I'll give you the
corrected URLs below:

http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/DOE2000/collabs.html

http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/research

I've also added one additional URL below.

http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/fl/projects.htm


You also may want to go to the Mathematics and Computer Science Home page at
http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov. Select either the research or collaboration
buttons and take a very quick tour through the topics of your interest.

Thanks again,

Steve Lake

Stephan--

Thanks for the message and I enjoyed our discussion yesterday  -- I do want
to investigate your collaboratories a bit, but the links you bring me to a
page that cannot be displayed.  Do you have an alternative URL address?

Thanks
Ross

   Ross,

   I enjoyed talking with you today regarding your business. As we
   discussed
   I'm attaching a few URL's that describe our research in various
   collaboratory and immersive environments.

   http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/DOE2000/collabs.html

   http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/research.html


    The goal of this work is develop technology to assist collaboratory
   actions
   over high bandwidth environments. Scientists, engineers, designers, and
   probably bankers, lawyers, accountants and other professional staff will
   have significant new tools in forming and working a collaboration forum.
   The
   bulk of this research is done in our mathematics and computer science
   division.

   You may also notice an additional collaboratory activity which is
   telepresence. In this case scientists can remotely manipulate scientific
   equipment such as electronic microscopes as well as discuss the results
   with
   others as the experiment is underway. This approach actually allows
   collaborating parties to reach out and control machines safely over the
   internet. This is far beyond just changing a camera angle or moving a
   microscope stage.

   I've also included a URL on the computational grid concept which
   provides
   heavy computational power on demand in a way not dissimiliar to the
   electric
   generation and distribution business.

   http://globus.org

   If your clients are faced with the need to access enormous files of hard
   copy information that needs to be put in a manner that can used easily
   over
   the internet, we have developed an interesting approach. DOE has over
   250,000 pages of hard copy documents from various sources on the human
   radiation experiments conducted over many years. These documents can
   easily
   be accessed and manipulated through an special search engine. Our other
   information research division, the Decision Information Sciences
   Division
   built and operated this application. You can view it at:

   http://www.dis.anl.gov/disweb/datt

   As a side note, this division has unique skills in developing technology
   to
   solve problems that have enormous amounts of date. The division also has
   developed energy planning software, and trained many foreign government
   energy planners on the use of that software.
