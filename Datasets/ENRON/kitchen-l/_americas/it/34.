As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter
