Please find attached a revised list of staff to be retained in Beth Perman's group that I submitted to Sally and Marla earlier this evening.
Password "5555"
 
After discussions with Power, Gas and RAC several names have been added to the original list of 190 and are highlighted in red.
 
Sally originally asked me to prepare this in the same style as an earlier sheet from Anthony, but Beth's world is just too big to re-work the sheets we have been using so far. (although I'm happy to do this tonight once we've settled on the list.... I just don't want to miss anyone).
 
Instead I've used our master list, filtered out the severs and EGM/EIM, added comments and an 'Area' field to help sort the list meaningfully.
 
I've also added two extra columns 'Primary' and 'Hedge' to distinguish between the needed staff and those that we have added to account for attrition and an increased demand for reporting activities.
