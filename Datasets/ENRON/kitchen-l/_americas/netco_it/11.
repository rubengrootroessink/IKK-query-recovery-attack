Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.
