Hi Louise,
=20
just thought you should know...=20
=20
we've kept the mixed Estate/NetCo Application Development teams bound toget=
her for these migration efforts and its just remarkable how hard these peop=
le are working. Most of the DBA team, headed by Mable Tang(Oracle) and Char=
les Brewer(SQL Server) have been putting in very long hours and last night =
most didn't go home! (really). The LiveLink team were here untill the small=
 hours too.
=20
The Infrastructure Server people in particular (Charles Ballmer and Michael=
 Barber) and their team members have worked very hard over the last week, g=
etting ready.=20
=20
They are all set to pull off the NetCo migration during the latter part of =
next week and through the weekend, and everyone seems to be very confident =
that we'll pull it off.=20
=20
I'd like to make special mention of one young lady called Jane Henry (just =
a Specialist!) who has more front than Sainsbury's (can't explain that to a=
n American!), who has been acting as anchor and project co-ordinator for al=
l the activities and working long nights. She manages to keep control of al=
l those strong personalities and kept us all on track. I'd be very grateful=
l if you could find time to drop her a quick line.... she'd be impressed at=
 the recognition....
=20
regards
=20
