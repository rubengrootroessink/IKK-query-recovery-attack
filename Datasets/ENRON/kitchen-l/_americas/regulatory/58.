The Senate Energy Committee's meeting to consider and vote on Chairman Bingaman's electricity restructuring legislation and amendments to that proposal -- originally scheduled for tomorrow -- has been CANCELLED.  No new date has been announced.  Given the tragic events yesterday, at present we expect congressional activity to be suspended following today's sessions until into next week.  We will keep you posted on further details as they become available.
