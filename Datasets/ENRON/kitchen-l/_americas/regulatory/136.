Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today. 

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.  

Please call me with any comments at 37007.
