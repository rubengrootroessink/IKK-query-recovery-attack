Am I insane or am I just a highly paid preparer of FERC summaries for those who cannot read or comprehend FERC decisions?   AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!   P.S., I hope wee Scott is doing well.

Tom:

Linda has asked that we put together a paper, similar to the format you used for one of the California orders, for the FERC's recent RTO orders.  This is somewhat difficult because FERC issued 6 RTO orders plus two procedural orders establishing this new mediation procedure to produce one Northeast RTO and one Southeast RTO.  And, unfortunately, I'm going to be at FERC all day tomorrow.

Attached is a compilation of the summaries we prepared on the various RTO orders.  I worked a little on the opening paragraph, but after that it's just a cut and paste from the summaries prepared by several of us.

Do you have time to work on another great Tom Paper?  I tried to include all of the substance, but it really needs revisions and restructuring in order to be helpful to the uninformed reader.

I'll call you during a break to see if you're available.

Thanks Tom

Sarah
