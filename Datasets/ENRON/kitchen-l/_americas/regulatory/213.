We executed final documentation on sale of the Noram rig for $9 million ($4.4 million net to Enron).  Although the purchaser has until April 13th to fund, there are no contingencies in the contract and SCF Partners controls the entity.  The delay in funding is required since there is a 21-day period for them to make their capital calls.

A number of things came together for us this week, which is good.

The week is now over.

Excellent - it has been a great week for you guys.  Three dashes and a handshake deal.

Have a good week-end.

Today we negotiated a handshake agreement with Smith Properties to buy out JEDI's position in Inland for $2 million ($1 million net to Enron).  The DASH minimum was $1.25 million ($612,500 net to Enron), the original offer.  Documentation will be simple:  our rep is limited to we own it and we can sell it.  Expect to close and fund next week.

Given the Inland situation and the absence of any foreseeable payment on our preferred, I view this outcome as very favorable.

Brandi Morris' work on this transaction was outstanding.
