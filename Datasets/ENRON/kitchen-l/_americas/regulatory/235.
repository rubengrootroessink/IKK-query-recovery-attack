On Tuesday, February 27, we have been invited to a cocktail party in honor of Vincent Viola of Pioneer Futures. Vince is currently running for Chairman of the NYMEX. His competitor in the upcoming election is Joe Rafferty of Rafferty and Associates. Personally, I have no preference who is the next Chairman, but due to the adversarial nature of Enron's recent relationship with Dan Rappaport and the NYMEX this may us an opportunity to meet and talk to Vince. Rumor has it that Vince is the current frontrunner for the position. The party will be held at 5:00-7:00pm at Sambuca Jazz Cafe, 909 Texas, (713) 224-5299. Let me know if you are interested in attending.
