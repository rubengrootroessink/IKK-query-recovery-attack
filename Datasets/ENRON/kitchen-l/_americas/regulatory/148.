Louise --

We had decided that not having Mark in the room gave us the ability to wiggle if questions on CFTC vs. FERC regulation arose.  As you can imagine, FERC is starting to grapple with the issue that financial trades in energy commodities is regulated under the CEA, not the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act.  

Thanks,

Jim
