Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will get back to you asap with further information.
