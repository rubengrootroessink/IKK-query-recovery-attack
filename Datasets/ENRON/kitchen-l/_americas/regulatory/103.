Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occur=
ed with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest ver=
sion of an "Edison MOU":

The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet=
 that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen unti=
l they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether=
 they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it=
 appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal:
Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be pres=
sured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance)
Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with sma=
ll customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's =
transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider b=
uying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly)
Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but=
 place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed t=
o suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provision=
s.)
Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to =
the one created in Texas).
The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill=
 passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the ne=
w version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newe=
st proposal.
If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficul=
t time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate =
has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the As=
sembly version.
Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for =
recess as soon as we hear.

Best,
Jeff

Details are still rough and the situation is very fluid, but here is what i=
s currently going on:

Senators Hertzberg and Keeley are amending both SB 78XX and AB 82XX.  Upon =
an initial read, it appears that they are doing the following:
?=09AB 82XX has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the=
 renewables portfolio.  (The core/non-core business provisions, the transmi=
ssion asset purchase, etc. all appear to have been deleted.)  Both of these=
 provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by member=
s last week when the bill was first debated.=20
?=09It appears amendments have been made to SB 78XX but the extent of these=
 changes are not yet known. =20
?=09At the beginning of both amended bills, it states, "As proposed to be a=
mended into SB_XX."   This means that amendments to SB 78 could be incorpor=
ated into AB 82, and vice versa.  Another possibility is an entirely new bi=
ll. =20
