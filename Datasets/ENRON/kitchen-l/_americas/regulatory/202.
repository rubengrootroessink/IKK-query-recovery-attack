ubject: CPUC News -- From Press Conference as we Speak=09


Lynch started out castigating FERC for the "failure to act", sellers for hi=
gh prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press packag=
e.  Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net shor=
t is 34%.  Sellers "have us over a barrell" for those sales.  Attorney Gen =
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=
ts -- this doesn't address the "$ for the hot dog, which is being taken car=
e of in Sacramento."  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=
 Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call=
. Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- "our cries have fallen =
on deaf ears"

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order that the IOUs to pay the QFs begin=
ning 4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Secti=
on 390 (Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the S=
RAC gas index from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) =
to Malin, where prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
 purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power fo=
r purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that t=
he payments are for going forward costs. "It's time to pay the power bills =
for California."  CPA calculated based on the "residual" method, rather tha=
n the proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method=
, however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
. (The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge pe=
rmanent (we believe that this is additive with the 3 cents - 4 cent total) =
Believe this covers ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX =
1, small customers with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers=
 with 200% increase, get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  A=
dopted TURN's accounting proposal implying that the Rate Freeze is not yet =
over.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes IOUs 30-45 d=
ays to charge the rates (although could come earlier); will conduct a rate =
design proceeding during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e if it is best for the public utilities to be outside holding companies.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate st=
ructure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  Nee=
d information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided it. =
 Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above -- w=
ould expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=
o after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable price=
s.
