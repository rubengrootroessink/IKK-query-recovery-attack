I gather you heard about 6 to 7 for Cornhusker for this quarter.  About 4 in cash and about 2 in reval accretion.

East Coast s/b essentially flat.  Cash in and lower reval netting.

Any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estimate or actual from me.  We do need to discuss ECP debt today if you're available.
