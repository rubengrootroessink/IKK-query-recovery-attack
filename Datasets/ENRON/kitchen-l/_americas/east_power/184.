Dear Enron Friends

Some of you may know that I have been recently diagnosed with non-small cell
lung cancer.  This Wednesday May 23 I will have this cancerous tumor removed.
Hopefully that will be it and all will return to normal shortly and you will see
me again soon.  It is my understanding that I will be in the hospital for about
1 week and they say I will be down for another six (6) weeks after that.
Apparently they have not dealt with anyone that has the same tenacity and
inability to sit still as me.  At any rate I'll be out for a while.

During my absense my assistant, Karla Hesketh,  will continue to do the same
wonderful job that she has done for all of us throughout the years.  I have a
very good friend, John Vollen who is a rep for ABB out in the Great Northwest
that has graciously volunteered to come to Houston for 2-3 days a week for as
long as necessary to help us with the Enron business.  Randy Hayes will also
help John and will provide introductions when necessary and appropriate.  Please
welcome John as you have me in the past.  You will find that he is eager to help
and very capable.  He has been in sales for ten years and is a graduate
engineer.  Just don't get to used to him as I will return.

After I get home I'll call to check on all of you and make sure that all is well
with business and you personally.  I am very grateful to have the Enron account
and I have grown close to many of you and enjoy working on the interesting, and
yes, sometimes challenging projects that we are faced with.

Again, please continue to work with John and Karla as you have worked with me in
the past.  I'll keep you updated as to my progress.

Best Regards,
Mike
