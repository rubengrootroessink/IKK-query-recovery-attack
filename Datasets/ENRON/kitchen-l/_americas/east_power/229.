Peggy - could you please look this over and make sure it looks good to you?  As you can see, we need to get this to Max for David to sign by 3:00pm today.  Here's how the new dates work out:

ABB Guaranteed Completion Date:  July 15, 2002
COD under DeAcero Contract = 502 days from April 6, 2001, or August 21, 2002

Thanks for your help.

DTT

Drew:

Attached are the latest DeAcero docs (clean plus redlined).  I need to have the green light by 3pm today, so that I can send them to David to sign.  He is travelling today, so if we miss him, we'll have to wait until Monday.

Best regards - Max
