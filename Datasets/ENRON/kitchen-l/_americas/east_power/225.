They are supposed to be in the process of preparing pro-formas for us, since they hadn't done any real economic analysis before talking to us.  I put a call into Dana Litman, the Controller, who is pulling these numbers together, but have not yet heard from him.  I'll let you know the status as soon as I hear from Dana.
