We have a verbal okay from El Paso to go to the insurance wrappers and get structure/pricing.  The insitituions will then pitch this back to us both (El Paso and Enron) for a decision.  Once the decision is made, the process should be fairly swift.

As a back up plan, Joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality/guarantee and using an Enron to fill any potential holes.  We'll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk.

Don't we still need the approval of El Paso?

I have been working with Lehman and BofA this morning in an attempt to get a letter by close of business today so as to be in front of the insurance wrappers this week.

Cornhusker on track.  Ultimate (or perhaps penultimate) meeting on transaction docs this afternoon.
