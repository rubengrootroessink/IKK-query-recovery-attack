Thanks for the note about Dave.  I do not know Dave but will probably pay him a visit in Boston to see what we might do with them.   Acitivity out of their northeast office has primarily been on the nat gas side, but with their recent acquistion of Central Hudson's generation assets in NY they have been getting more active in power.  

I have been meaning to swing by and introduce myself on one of my trips to Houston, and will be sure to do so on the next trip.


Regards
John

Just in case you meet him - there is a guy who left Enron yesterday to join Dynegy in Boston.  Dave has been with Enron since 1996 (I think), joining as an associate and leaving as a VP.  Dave wanted to relocate back to the North East.

I've worked with Dave for about 4 years and he a very straightforward guy, I have no idea how much we do with Dynegy but Dave may be a good contact for you.

Regards

Louise
