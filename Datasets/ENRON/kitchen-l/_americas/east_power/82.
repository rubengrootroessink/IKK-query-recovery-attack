FYI, Wind is asking for changes to our PPA that we do not want.  AEP is putting the pressure on them for these changes.

We are not interested in these changes to the PPA.  These changes will weaken the language in the contract for us (i.e. improve it for AEP that is probably why they are asking for the "clarifications").  I will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to Kevin Presto.  Regards, - Mike

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It deals with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailment clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amendment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that the ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, but would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  That e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks

Regards

John
