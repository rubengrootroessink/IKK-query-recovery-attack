Louise:

Our proposal is for ENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.

The nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with respect to the turbine. 

The carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME as part of this proposal is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on CALME based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.

The continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.

Please let me know if you need anything else to resolve this, or if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

OK.

By the way, did you have a discussion with CALME on the carrying costs on the Westinghouse 501D5A?

Regards,

Ben

EEL is now selling its 9FAs (previously mentioned for Arcos), I referred John Sherriff to you to see if you have any potential outlets for these turbines. So in case someone telephones you, that is where the call comes from.
