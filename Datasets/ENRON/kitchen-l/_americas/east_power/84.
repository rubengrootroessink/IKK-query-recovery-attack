Per your request, I will start providing a daily status report on the Wind PPA MTM value.  As of the close of Thurs. 9/13, the PPA value was approx. $24.0 MM (after reserves).  When I receive the $100MM guaranty cost I will start incorporating this into a net calculation for an Enron Corp. view of the value.
