During our meeting on Loretta (gas play version), you suggested we get a consultant opinion regarding the ability to permit a coal plant in Texas.  I've selected URS, a large, Texas-familiar company.  In fact, their lead air quality attorney used to work on the other side, processing air permit requests for Texas.

I expect a written opinion on Tuesday; however, their verbal feedback has been very favorable.

In the interim, please let me know if you have any questions/comments regarding the proposal.

Mitch
