Working on 3 deals  - a full services RFP with CVEC, service offering for Cogentrix (would be more imp. now that we're not doing any asset deals with them), and a "blend and extend" for 600-800MW of load. Cogentrix and CVEC are slated for this year, while the last one is for '02. Trying to give them a push for this year though.
