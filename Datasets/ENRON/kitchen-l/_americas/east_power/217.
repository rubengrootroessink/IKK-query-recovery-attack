Louise,

In response to Tina's e-mail here is a quick list of the pipeline.  I am having the pretty hot list sheet updated and re-sent to you and Dave.

Tex-Mex    Pursuing other MOUs to become anchor or fill the HVDC capacity.  Max continuing negotiations with DeAcero and CFE.  ABB to visit in the next two weeks.  Possibility of magnetizing with TECO's Frontera.

Clarksdale/Yazoo  Finalizing asset mgt contracts.  To start May 1.  40MW long this summer in SPP.

AIG  Sale docs in progress.  Most work centered around asset mgt and brokerage agreement.

Ft. Pierce  forward movement on agreements this week.  Looking to revise cost estimates and timeline for Tuesday meeting.

Homestead  Switched permit application to 501Fs.  FPL still interested in 3yr tolling.  Need to present opportunity.

The rest will be included in the official hotlist memo.

Regards,
Ozzie

Yes - but I am still looking for something similar for the rest of the groups - Baughman, Pagan, East Power and South East Power.
