We finally connected.

Beau Normark (sp?), ABB President is coming for a visit to the local ABB office and wants to meet with Enron as part of a general meet n' greet (as suspected).

They don't have any particular agenda in mind, but will probably want to talk a bit about the business relationship Enron and ABB have enjoyed in the past, our current projects (e.g. TexMex) and any plans we might care to share about the future.
