I just learned from the IT dept atr the MPUC that the session will not be broadcast live over the internet as they have been having some technical problems.  However, it will be posted right after the session is over.

As you requested, here is the link for the audio broadcast of the Maine commission deliberations for 1:30 EPT this afternoon.  It uses the Real Audio plug-in.
