Since you are reading E-mails , I thought I would let you know how things went with Ozzie. I met with him on Saturday and made the proposal we discussed. He said he was interested and wanted to follow up with a conversation on resources and compensation. I would suggest flexibility on compensation and also help in getting additional resources. I would like ,however for Ozzie to recognize that he would be part of the team. This is critical to integrating and optimizing the market /opportunistic approach of the regions with the product approach of Generation Investments. I believe that the synergies(terrible word I'm sorry) here could be substantial. If he wants to be autonomous I don't need him. He said he was meeting with you tomorrow. I'll call you on Monday.
