We currently have an EPC contract with the City of Austin to develop a project using the LM 6000's that we sold to them. This is followed by a 2 year PPA at a fixed heat rate. It is currently being managed by Mike Curry. Doug Gilbert-Smith and I are both ready to elevate Drew Tingleaf to a leadership position in ERCOT. We both think that his leadership would be valuable for the group and that the Mike Curry issue can be managed. Any problems?
