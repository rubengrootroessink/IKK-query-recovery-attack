WASHINGTON -- If Enron Corp. goes under, the government is unlikely to thro=
w it a lifeline.=20
At its peak, Enron was a major participant in the country's financial and e=
nergy markets. But economic and financial policy makers say they aren't wor=
ried about any broader blow to markets or business activity. Despite freque=
nt comparisons to Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose 1998 n=
ose dive panicked global financial markets and triggered an unusual bailout=
 brokered by the Federal Reserve, there has been so far no public sign of a=
ny attempt by the Fed, the Treasury or energy regulators to take similar ac=
tion on behalf of Enron or its creditors.
Officials from a range of economic and regulatory agencies have insisted in=
 recent days that while they have been closely monitoring Enron's situation=
, they haven't seen any reason to be concerned about possible ripple effect=
s. Enron "is just one piece of a very big market," said John Mielke, chief =
of market surveillance at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Mr. Mie=
lke said he saw no evidence that Enron's problems have disrupted trading on=
 the futures exchanges monitored by the CFTC.=20
"These are deep and pretty big markets that Enron is in," echoed William Gi=
lmer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.=20
It is too soon to say exactly what the total damage from Enron's potential =
demise will be. One danger is that a blowup in the company's complex, large=
ly unregulated portfolio of derivatives could infect financial markets in w=
ide and unpredictable ways, just as LTCM's did. Another worry: that the col=
lapse of a major middleman in natural-gas and power markets could disrupt s=
upplies.=20
Enron does share some characteristics with LTCM, including widespread activ=
ities in complicated financial instruments in numerous markets, with little=
 detailed public explanation of those activities, and little regulatory ove=
rsight of those trades.=20
Its public disclosures suggest Enron's exposures are substantial. A quarter=
ly filing listed $18.7 billion in assets and an equal amount of liabilities=
 related to "price risk management activities" as of Sept. 30. The filing g=

As Enron's woes deepened, the government's hands were tied in even assessin=

Those are relatively small hiccups. The betting is the impact of Enron's tr=
oubles on the financial system will be widespread but thin. Enron was a fav=

icated among the banking system, both at home and abroad. For example, a $2=
.25 billion credit facility arranged for Enron in May by Citigroup Inc. and=
 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. was distributed to 50 different institutions, acco=

 a banker at one of the underwriters.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase said in a statement that it has $500 million of unsecured=
 exposure to Enron entities, including loans, letters of credit and derivat=

represents a small fraction of J.P. Morgan Chase's total assets of $715 bil=
lion. Citigroup declined to comment on its exposure to Enron, but officials=
 familiar with the matter said the bank's exposure is similar to that of J.=
P. Morgan Chase.=20
Beyond financial fallout, a concern is the potential impact on energy marke=
ts and what that could do to the economy. Enron's troubles could hamper eff=
orts to end the recession if the company's difficulties make it impossible =
for it to deliver natural gas or electricity to its customers.=20

Enron's Woes May Ripple Out to Others --- If Energy Company Files For Bankr=
uptcy, Results Are Likely to Be Messy
By Henny Sender and Richard B. Schmitt
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The sudden, deep financial troubles of Enron Corp., the once aggressive, ma=
ny-tentacled energy conglomerate, could have widespread consequences for sc=
ores of companies across the economy.=20
If Enron files for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Co=
de, as many investors and financial experts now expect, it is likely to be =
one of the messiest, most complex bankruptcy cases ever, lawyers say.
That is because of the multifaceted nature of Enron's once highflying opera=
tions, which combined a global energy business with a massive financial-tra=
ding operation involving tens of billions of dollars in complex contracts. =
Yesterday, amid the unraveling of a last-ditch merger with Dynegy Inc., the=
 company's credit was downgraded to "junk" status by rating agency Standard=
 & Poor's Corp. Enron has about 800 trading partners or creditors.=20
The stock market, signaling that a bankruptcy filing is expected, hammered =
Enron stock, which was halted for a time yesterday, and knocked lower some =
of its financial backers' shares. Enron shares closed at 4 p.m. in New York=
 Stock Exchange composite trading at 61 cents, down $3.50, or 85%. Enron bo=
nds also fell sharply, dropping to 50 cents on the dollar from around 55 ce=
nts, reflecting concerns over how much creditors might receive if the compa=
ny does seek bankruptcy-court protection. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, =
which have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of keeping the=
 Enron-Dynegy deal alive, also saw their stocks fall. At 4 p.m. in NYSE com=
posite trading, J.P. Morgan shares were down $2.30 to $37.50, while Citigro=
up shares were down $2.75 to $47.80.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase said in a statement it has about $500 million of unsecure=
d exposure to Enron entities, including loans, letters of credit, and deriv=
atives. It said it also has secured exposures, including $400 million in lo=
ans secured by Enron pipelines.=20
Other companies also disclosed their exposures to Enron. Exelon Corp., an e=
nergy concern in Chicago, said its power-trading arm has a direct net expos=
ure to Enron of less than $10 million, based on its current book of busines=
s and existing market prices. Exelon said its direct gross exposure based o=
n sales to Enron is less than $20 million. Exelon said this is partly offse=
t by $10 million that it owes to Enron.=20
Still, while the fallout from a potential bankruptcy filing would be widesp=
read, federal regulators appear little concerned that it could inflict sign=
ificant damage to the U.S. economy. (See related article on page A10.)=20
The scale of the Enron collapse is huge, experts say. "There is nothing to =
compare it to," said Edward Tillinghast, a bankruptcy specialist with Coude=
rt Brothers in New York. "The business was so large. There were so many dif=
ferent kinds of operating entities under the Enron umbrella."=20
In a way, he added, a filing would represent all the challenges of two of t=
he biggest bankruptcies in recent years -- this past spring's Chapter 11 fi=
ling by PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric utility unit, and the demise of=
 Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street securities firm that failed more t=
han a decade ago. A filing by Enron, with about $13 billion in debt, would =
rank among the largest bankruptcy filings ever.=20
Bankruptcy lawyers and creditors' rights specialists, already swamped with =
a wealth of work from a boom in Chapter 11 filings during the last 18 month=
s, said they had been contacted by worried banks and other lenders to Enron=
, seeking to retain them in the event of a Chapter 11 filing. Enron spokesw=
oman Karen Denne said the company is exploring its options and wouldn't com=
ment on whether it has retained bankruptcy counsel.=20
But lawyers said the company was already in discussions about retaining its=
 own counsel. Among the likely advisers is New York law firm Weil Gotshal &=
 Manges, which has been doing mergers work for Enron but also specializes i=
n representing debtors in Chapter 11 proceedings. Lawyers at Weil Gotshal d=
idn't return phone calls yesterday.=20
Ironically, Enron's trading arm, which fueled huge profits over the years, =
could end up creating some unusual problems in any Chapter 11 case. One of =
the messiest aspects of any potential filing would be unwinding the myriad =
swaps, repurchase agreements and forward agreements that Enron entered into=
 with bankers, Wall Street and numerous municipalities and utilities. Such =
transactions aren't subject to the automatic freeze that governs most contr=
acts when a company files for Chapter 11; the idea is to protect all partie=
s from market risk as the value of those contracts can fluctuate from day t=
o day, and to avoid a larger financial meltdown.=20
That means Enron's counterparties are free to close out such transactions, =
rather than file claims in a bankruptcy proceeding reflecting the total not=
ional amount of any trades. In other words, a securities firm that is a cou=
nterparty to Enron in many financial contracts would tally up how much it o=
wes Enron under such contracts and how much Enron owes it, offsetting the a=
mounts against each other. But this process is ripe for conflicts, as dispu=
tes easily could arise over the value of the contracts.=20
"It is an incredibly complex piece of financial engineering," Andrew Rahl, =
a bankruptcy lawyer at Anderson Kill & Olick in New York, said of the proce=
ss.=20
How much collateral those counterparties could seize isn't at all clear, ei=
ther. Enron was considered very aggressive in negotiating agreements such a=
s swaps, where a party trades an obligation to pay a floating interest rate=
 for a fixed interest rate on given securities. The speed with which the co=
mpany's finances have deteriorated further reduces the odds that its tradin=
g partners will be able to get paid anytime soon. Without any security, cou=
nterparty claims would go into the probably massive general pool of claims =
from unsecured creditors.=20
Besides banks and bondholders, dozens of companies, municipalities and util=
ities that had signed multiyear power contracts with Enron may be left in t=
he lurch. Over the years, the likes of retailer J.C. Penney Co., and shoppi=
ng-mall company Simon Property Group, of Indianapolis, signed on with Enron=
, as it undercut local utilities in newly deregulated markets.=20
Any bankruptcy also is likely to trigger collateral lawsuits, as aggrieved =
parties look for alternative deep pockets. One possible target, analysts sa=
id, could be advisers that helped Enron establish off-balance-sheet vehicle=
s and other debt related to troubled investment partnerships, which have tr=
iggered massive losses in recent weeks. Moreover, Enron directors themselve=
s could be vulnerable, too.=20
Yesterday, Enron named Raymond S. Troubh, a New York financial consultant, =
to its board as chairman of a newly formed Special Litigation Committee to =
evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.=20
At the same time, any filing would give Enron some advantages, most notably=
 greater ease in securing financing. This is because once companies file fo=
r protection, any new cash infusion from the banks has an overriding claim =
on any of the company's assets, at the expense of previous lenders.=20
In addition, potential buyers for Enron businesses may be more likely to em=
erge once the company is operating with court protection and the depth of i=
ts problems are known.=20
"There is a certain comfort level that buyers have when buying a business i=
n a Chapter 11 case that doesn't exist when a company is struggling outside=
 of bankruptcy," said Keith Shapiro, a bankruptcy lawyer at Greenberg Traur=
ig in Chicago.

Enron's Meltdown May Also Be Felt By Big Mutual Funds

NEW YORK -- Some of the largest mutual funds in the country that jumped on =
Enron Corp. shares when they were soaring now may be feeling the pain of th=

The energy-trading company's stock was held in funds managed by Fidelity In=
vestments, Stilwell Financial Inc.'s Janus Capital Corp., Alliance Capital =
Management and Putnam Investments, according to the funds' most recent Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission filings. Vanguard Group held the stock in va=

ing to its filings.
One of the biggest supporters of the stock has been Alliance Premier Growth=
 Fund, an $11 billion portfolio that had about 4% of its assets in Enron sh=
ares as of Sept. 30, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. Based on th=
e Sept. 30 filing, the fund's stake had dropped in value by about $445 mill=

Of course, Alliance Premier and other funds may have sold or bought Enron s=
hares since they made their latest government filings. An Alliance spokesma=

Other funds reporting big stakes in Enron recently included Janus Mercury F=

Credit Markets
Why Credit Agencies Didn't Switch Off Enron --- S&P Cries `Junk,' But the W=
arning Comes Too Late
By Gregory Zuckerman and Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

At 10:57 a.m. EST yesterday, an announcement came out that effectively scut=
tled Dynegy Inc.'s proposed takeover of Enron Corp. It was issued not by th=
e two companies or their bankers, but by a behind-the-scenes player that wa=
s pivotal in the deal from the start.=20
The news came from Standard & Poor's, which lowered Enron's credit rating t=
o "junk" status, because of concern about the energy trading company's fina=
ncial condition. The move, followed by similar downgrades by Moody's Invest=
ors Service Inc. and Fitch Inc. several hours later, prompted Dynegy to ann=
ounce that it was walking away from the multibillion dollar deal.
The downgrades highlight the key role that credit-rating agencies -- which =
are sometimes only bit players -- are having in one of the biggest Wall Str=
eet dramas in years. Before they became deal breakers, the ratings agencies=
 had emerged as unlikely deal makers just a few weeks ago, by leaving Enron=
 little choice but to seek a merger partner or face a downgrade that would =
have made it difficult to keep running its business.=20
Throughout the Enron saga, the rating agencies found themselves the target =
of repeated and intense lobbying by Enron, Dynegy and their bankers at J.P.=
 Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. All tried -- and ultimately failed -=
- to come up with assurances that the merger would bolster Enron and thus p=
rotect bondholders and lenders from suffering losses.=20
The dramatic downgrades are sure to increase scrutiny over the role of the =
rating agencies in the Enron situation. Critics say that, in waiting until =
Enron's bonds already had plummeted in value, the ratings agencies failed i=
n their job of anticipating a company's financial problems and giving inves=
tors an early warning.=20
It now seems clear that the rating agencies, like most securities analysts,=
 seem to have too easily accepted Enron's murky financial reporting, which =
gave the impression that the company's balance sheet was stronger than it w=
as. As recently as late October, both Moody's Corp.'s Moody's and McGraw-Hi=
ll Cos.' S&P had a solid investment-grade rating on Enron's debt.=20
But since credit-rating agencies often have access to company information t=
hat securities analysts often don't have, the rating agencies could take so=
me heat for not anticipating the financial difficulties. Bond investors, fo=
r instance, say S&P was prematurely upbeat about Enron's outlook earlier th=
is month, and long ago should have demanded more information from the compa=
ny. "If the rating agencies were privy all along to information that, as ne=
ar as I can tell, was nonpublic regarding these off-balance-sheet liabiliti=
es, then their judgment looks even more faulty," says Carol Levenson of Gim=
me Credit, a Chicago-based analyst.=20
Others wonder whether the ratings executives should have lowered the rating=
 to junk days ago, when Enron's problems became obvious. While such a move =
would have crippled the company's ability to find a suitor, holding off on =
the ratings move hurt stock and bond investors left holding the securities.=
=20
"I don't think the consequences of a rating action should have anything to =
do with whether one takes that rating action or not, if one feels it's warr=
anted," Ms. Levenson says. "I don't think there was any doubt Enron was a j=
unk credit."=20
The ratings agencies counter that Enron's financial condition, while weaken=
ed, became precarious only in the past few days, and given the consequences=
 of a downgrade they needed to be prudent.=20
Indeed, every party to the deal -- until yesterday -- kept working to provi=

re particularly desperate to hold off a ratings downgrade. Once the debt wa=
s lowered to junk status from investment grade, a whopping $3.9 billion of =
debt immediately became due, jeopardizing Enron's ability to stay afloat.=
=20
Worries about such a debt downgrade weeks ago pushed Enron into the merger =
with Dynegy, despite reservations from some Enron executives about whether =
the deal was right. Enron pledged some of its best assets to secure a $500 =
million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup's Citibank, and agr=
eed to strict terms demanded by banks to get an emergency $1 billion credit=
 line from various banks. In recent days, the two companies worked to restr=
ucture their merger and to raise still more liquidity for Enron.=20
By 4 p.m. Tuesday, the credit agencies agreed to hold off on a downgrade, c=
onvinced the two sides were making progress in restructuring the deal and d=
rumming up new money for Enron. In a conference call, Ron Barone, a managin=
g director at S&P, told Enron executives he was willing to wait on a decisi=
on, aware of the serious consequences of a downgrade.=20
"We'll be very patient and diligent" because of the progress being made, he=
 told them, according to someone familiar with the conversation.=20
As late as 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, a new deal still seemed in sight. But at abo=
ut 2 a.m. yesterday, the talks broke down. Instead of being briefed about t=
erms of a new merger agreement, the credit-agency executives became doubtfu=
l a resolution would ever be reached.=20
In a late morning phone call to Jeff McMahon, Enron's chief financial offic=
er, Mr. Barone broke the news that the company's credit would be downgraded=
. "We lost confidence the deal would be consummated in a way that would kee=
p the rating intact," Mr. Barone says in an interview. "Enron's credibility=
 and viability continued to diminish. They were aware of our concerns."=20
S&P downgraded Enron's corporate-credit rating two full grades to single-B-=
minus, near the lower end of the junk-bond world, from triple-B-minus, the =
lowest investment-grade level. Moody's lowered the debt to B2 from Baa3.=20
In a late-afternoon conference call with investors, S&P executives said the=
 rating could still be lowered further, on the heels of the official announ=
cement that the merger with Dynegy was off.=20
Responding to criticism that the credit agencies should have downgraded Enr=
on's debt sooner, Mr. Barone of S&P notes that the rating agency wasn't "pr=
ivy to everything." Still, he adds, until yesterday "we were confident it w=
as an investment-grade company, and that the merger would give it the secur=
ity to enable Enron to function at an investment-grade level."=20
On the flip side, of course, if Enron is forced into bankruptcy, the rating=
 agencies may well catch heat that their impact was too drastic, effectivel=
y killing the deal.=20
Treasurys=20
Treasurys ended slightly higher. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year Treasury =
note was up 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 face value, at 100 15/32 to =
yield 4.938%. The 30-year Treasury bond's price also was up 1/32 point, at =
100 9/32 to yield 5.355%.=20
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of 160.74 points. Invest=
ors often shift funds to the relative safety of the government securities m=
arket at times when stocks are weak. A Treasury sale of $21 billion of two-=
year notes drew less demand than expected. The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge =
of demand comparing the dollar value of bids received with those awarded, w=
as 1.51, well below the 2.53 average of the past 12 auctions.=20
Also somewhat bearish for the bond market was release of the Fed's beige bo=
ok report, an assessment of economic conditions around the country in advan=
ce of policy meetings. Policy makers are to meet again Dec. 11.=20
Although the report cited weakness in the economy, it didn't encourage peop=

Why Credit Agencies Didn't Switch Off Enron --- Energy Trading Bears the Br=
unt Of Enron Woes

Less than a month ago, Enron Corp.'s electronic trading system was the larg=
est of its kind in the world, accounting for a quarter of all the natural g=
as and electricity delivered in the U.S.=20
Yesterday, the system was shut down, a victim of Enron's failed deal with D=
ynegy Inc.
While the rise and sudden fall of Enron rippled throughout financial market=
s yesterday, nowhere was it more immediately evident than in energy trading=
, an arena utterly transformed by Enron in recent years.=20
Since the late 1990s, EnronOnline had established itself as the dominant el=
ectronic energy marketplace -- and major competitor of the traditional futu=
res exchanges -- as it grew to handle an average of 5,400 trades a day, wit=
h a value of about $2.8 billion.=20
But a flight away from Enron began weeks ago, as initial news of the compan=
y's woes began to spread. Because Enron itself guaranteed trades on its pla=
tform, fears grew that the company might not be able to complete many of th=
e transactions.=20
The exodus of trading activity from EnronOnline accelerated throughout the =
day yesterday, culminating in the system's shutdown around midday, when quo=
tes on the system's Internet trading screens simply went blank.=20
By 3:30 p.m. EST, some trading had resumed in natural gas, though spokesman=
 Eric Thode declined to say whether Enron's markets would be open today. "T=
hat's part of an evaluation that's ongoing," he said.=20
On the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a traditional floor-based=
 futures market, natural-gas trading volume almost doubled yesterday to 116=
,000 contracts. While Enron's woes were the main driver behind the surge, t=
he market also reacted to important storage data from the American Gas Asso=
ciation.=20
Natural-gas prices jumped about 25 cents yesterday morning on an initial re=
action to the Enron news, near $3 per million British thermal units, then s=
lipped back as the AGA announced that gas storage had grown by 16 billion c=
ubic feet to an all-time high. The nearby December contract fell 29 cents t=
o $2.315 per million BTUs.=20
"Anyone who jumped into the gas market on the Enron news is praying right n=
ow [that prices recover]," Guy Gleichmann, senior energy trader at Barkely =
Financial. "It should only be a short-term factor in the market."=20
He said Enron's collapse has helped gas prices because it is mainly seen as=
 a threat to the overall gas supply. Traders assume EnronOnline's problems =
won't affect actual energy deliveries, because whoever takes over Enron's a=
ssets is expected to honor those commitments.=20
Meantime, anticipating potential fallout from the Enron problems, energy fi=
rms also have been reducing their financial risk in the energy markets by u=
nwinding complex derivatives bets, either by hedging against them or taking=
 delivery of the physical commodity.=20
In the future, those firms are likely to favor straightforward cash transac=
tions for energy as a result of the Enron meltdown. "If anything, the Enron=
 situation has really simplified this market," Mr. Gleichmann said.=20
Yesterday on the IntercontinentalExchange, Enron's primary electronic rival=
, traders waited up to five minutes to log in, said Jeff Sprecher, the onli=
ne market's chief executive.=20
He said it seemed most traders were just jockeying for position at first, a=
ssessing the newfound risk before actually making any trades. Within the fi=
rst 15 minutes after Standard & Poor's initial downgrade of Enron, Mr. Spre=
cher said, the number of bids and offers on IntercontinentalExchange droppe=
d by almost a third, to 2,200.=20
"By the end of the day, though, we expect this will probably be a record da=
y for us," said Mr. Sprecher, who estimated the system's overall volume is =
up 45% this month.=20
He expects much of that gain to be permanent on ICE, although he cautioned =
that a loss of EnronOnline from the marketplace would have a downside, sinc=
e its presence created opportunities to trade spreads between the two platf=
orms.=20
Nymex President J. Robert Collins warned it is still too early to declare E=
nronOnline dead. But he said its difficulties bode well for his exchange's =
Internet-based system, dubbed eNymex, now in development.=20
"Because of credit issues involving Enron, companies might be more hesitant=
 to trade there," he said. "So we have a better shot with eNymex than we di=
d three or four months ago."=20
Ronald J. Barone, managing director for energy research at UBS Warburg, sai=
d EnronOnline's value to prospective acquirers will drop quickly in coming =
days, if the business continues to decline.=20
"Dynegy really liked EnronOnline, but look at how much business the platfor=
m's been losing," said Mr. Barone, who downgraded Enron's stock yesterday t=
o a hold. "There's also a question of how many more skeletons there are in =
the closet."=20
In commodity trading yesterday:=20
GRAINS: Futures prices on corn, wheat and soybeans all fell again at the Ch=
icago Board of Trade as what was described as a technical-based selloff acc=
elerated. December-delivery corn futures sank to $1.9850 a bushel late in t=
he session, which wiped out the old contract low. The contract ended up set=
tling down five cents at $1.9875 a bushel.=20
CRUDE OIL: Crude-oil futures slipped 26 cents to $19.22 a barrel after week=
ly inventory data showed a larger-than-expected five-million-barrel build i=
n distillates supplies, which include heating oil. High refinery runs and i=
mports were behind the build, analysts said. The contract might have fallen=
 even more, except for a modest drop reported for crude-oil stocks.=20

Abreast of the Market
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Slide Along With Plunge in Enron Stock
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

11/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- The collapse of Enron dominated stock trading yesterday, as a h=
ost of the power generators and energy merchants exposed to the firm tumble=
d.=20
Shares of Dynegy, the suitor for Enron that pulled out of a deal after debt=
-rating agencies lowered their ratings on Enron's bonds, fell 4.92, or 12%,=
 to 35.97. ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, slid 1.07, or 1.2%, to =
84.55.
Shares of Enron itself were ground down more than 85%. The loss of $3.50 br=
ought the closing price of each Enron share down to 61 cents. This from a s=
tock that, as recently as August 2000, commanded more than $90 a share.=20
A host of other energy merchants, such as El Paso, which lost 3.59, or 7.4%=
, to 44.91, Williams, which shed 1.80, or 6.2%, to 27.05, and American Elec=
tric Power, which fell 2.03, or 4.8%, to 40.44, all got caught in the backl=
ash against the energy market.=20
The Dow Jones Utility Average finished the session down 8.48 points, a drop=
 of 2.94%, to 279.95, which brought it down to a 52-week low.=20
Shares of two giant financial-services providers also got caught by their e=
xposure to Enron, and paid the price. Shares of Citigroup fell 2.75, or 5.4=
%, to 47.80, while J.P. Morgan Chase slid 2.30, or 5.8%, to 37.50.=20
With those two components in decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fini=
shed the session 160.74 points lower, a loss of 1.63%, to 9711.86. The Nasd=
aq composite slid 2.48%, or 48 points, to 1887.97.=20
The Dow industrial average's finish at 9711.86 represented the lowest close=
 the average has posted in more than two weeks, since ending at 9554.37. Tr=
aders insisted that the speed and apparent ease with which market averages =
have managed to lard on gains over the past several weeks has stretched val=
uations, and left equities vulnerable to events, like the Enron sell-off, t=
hat a sturdier market might have more handily absorbed.=20
"One of the most important overriding factors has been the performance of t=
he market itself," Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, said. "=
The market has moved straight up seven weeks in a row, and when it moves up=
 in a straight line like that, it doesn't take much in the way of a catalys=
t to tip it over."=20
Whether it was excuse-making or profit-taking, the market did have to absor=
b some fundamental challenges in the session, including an especially pessi=
mistic assessment of economic conditions from the Federal Reserve. The cent=
ral bank released its Beige Book report on economic conditions, which showe=
d, overall, the economy tilted more toward further slowing than it did towa=
rd recovery.=20
That helped further puncture shares of some of the retailers that got wayla=
id in Tuesday's trading by a bearish consumer sentiment reading. Shares of =
Gap, stung by a reduction in its investment rating by Prudential Securities=
, lost 79 cents, or 5.5%, to 13.61. Shares of another apparel retailer, Ame=
rican Eagle Outfitters, lost 1.3, or 5.9%, to 24.40, while Talbots dropped =
1.25, or 3.6%, to 33, and discounter Kohl's fell 84 cents, or 1.2%, to 67.8=
6.=20
Meanwhile, some of the classic cyclical stocks that have had good runs over=
 the past several weeks as investors bet on an eventual economic recovery g=
ave ground. Shares of Boeing fell 1.33, or 3.7%, to 34.17, after J.P. Morga=
n reduced its earnings forecasts for 2002 and 2003. Whirlpool lost 1.12, or=
 1.7%, to 64.98. Auto-parts maker Eaton declined 1, or 1.4%, to 69.60. Gene=
ral Electric, also subject to some downbeat comments from J.P. Morgan, fell=
 1.72, or 39.35.=20
Continental Airlines lost 2.40, or 10%, to 21.70. The air carrier completed=
 a public offering of 6.74 million shares of stock priced at $22.50, a disc=
ount to Tuesday's closing price of 24.10.=20
Coca-Cola declined 1.06, or 2.2%, to 46.75. J.P. Morgan said it expects slo=
wer volume growth ahead for the beverage maker's bottlers. Shares of Coca-C=
ola Enterprises, Coke's biggest bottler, eased 40 cents, or 2.3%, to 17.=20
Magna International rose 1.54, or 2.6%, to 61.51. Salomon Smith Barney star=
ted coverage of the Canadian auto-components maker with a buy rating.=20
Medtronic gained 1.74, or 4%, to 45.78. The Minneapolis medical-device make=
r reported fiscal second-quarter results that matched Wall Street's project=
ions, and said it expected to live up to third-quarter forecasts.=20
Foot Locker eased 19 cents, or 1.2%, to 15.70, after mixed views from rival=
 brokers. RBC Capital Markets started coverage of the stock with a strong b=
uy rating, but Jefferies reduced its coverage of the stock to accumulate fr=

Dollar Declines Against Yen and Euro Amid Growing Doubts on U.S. Economy
By Grainne McCarthy
Dow Jones Newswires

11/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Growing doubts about the U.S. economy's ability to rebound quic=
kly from recession weighed heavily on the dollar, pushing the currency down=
 almost a full yen and helping the euro regain some lost ground.=20
Weakness in U.S. stocks -- due partly to news that Dynegy Inc. decided to w=
alk away from its deal to buy Enron Corp. -- also put pressure on the dolla=
r, while Enron's debt woes added to general skittishness about the ability =
of U.S. business to bounce back quickly.
"We know there are companies out there in trouble," said Lara Rhame, econom=
ist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, who said that while the Enron d=
evelopments weren't having a direct impact on foreign-exchange markets, suc=
h reports do "limit the kind of superdollar that we saw back in 1999."=20
The dollar selloff kicked off in Asian trading, when dealers used a Standar=
d & Poor's downgrade of Japan's sovereign rating as an excuse to buy the ye=
n. The downgrade to double-A from double-A-plus was better than the market'=
s expectations of a two-notch downgrade, rendering it good news of sorts.=
=20
The selling continued in New York trading, as traders continued to price in=
 the possibility that they may have been far too optimistic about the dolla=
r.=20
The two-pronged catalyst for this change of heart was the weak November con=
sumer confidence index released Tuesday, and subsequent gloomy comments fro=
m Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer pointing to more downside risks t=
o the economy. The release of the Federal Reserve's beige book report yeste=
rday served only to flame this pessimism.=20
The Fed said that further slowing outweighed signs of recovery for the U.S.=
 economy this autumn, noting that economic activity generally remained soft=
 in October and the first half of November.=20
"People wanted greater signs of recovery than they got from the Fed," said =
Alan Ruskin, research director at the 4Cast financial consultancy in New Yo=
rk.=20
The beige book, a summary of economic activity prepared for use at the cent=
ral bank's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting Dec. 11, is widely vi=
ewed as an indicator of future monetary policy decisions and the report hel=
ped to solidify expectations of a rate cut of at least a quarter percentage=
 point.=20
Late yesterday in New York, the euro was at 88.84 U.S. cents, its high for =

Options Report
Dynegy's Move to Disconnect Enron Merger Powers Volatility Spike as Investo=

NEW YORK -- Anxiety crept back into the options market, as investors watche=
d the major stock indexes slip and Enron's already-decimated stock slide be=
low $1 in record trading volume.=20
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market-volatility index, or VIX, rose =
2.54 to 27.75. The 10.1% increase marks the largest one-day percentage jump=
 for the options fear gauge's since Oct. 12, a long spell during which vola=
tility had subsided while stocks rallied.
Strike prices on Enron options had tumbled to once-unimaginable levels as t=
he energy company's woes mounted and its stock skidded. Yesterday, as Dyneg=
y called off its proposed acquisition, volatility of Enron options spiked t=
o well over 300%, mirroring the instability of the underlying stock. Many i=
nvestors scrambled to sell calls -- either to unwind prior positions or to =
pocket any income they could -- while others bought puts for downside prote=
ction. Calls and puts are options to buy or sell a security at a specific p=
rice, usually within a limited period.=20
Dynegy's implied volatility also jumped, as its stock fell $4.92, or 12%, t=
o $35.97. The near-month calls traded more heavily than the puts, likely be=
cause the high premiums made it costly for investors looking to buy puts. S=
ome investors sold out-of-the-money calls to take advantage of the volatili=
ty level. At the CBOE, Dynegy's out-of-the-money December 40 calls fell $2.=
25 to $1.35 on volume of 6,581 contracts, while 3,241 contracts traded at t=
he American Stock Exchange.=20
As investors sought downside protection, the ratio of equity puts traded to=
 calls at the CBOE continued to rise, from 0.53 Monday to 0.66 Tuesday to 0=
.7 yesterday, the highest reading this month.=20
In recent months, investors have treated market pullbacks as opportunities =
to hunt for bargains; in fact, such "buying on the dip" has helped propel s=
tock prices. With stocks up substantially from their September lows, invest=
ors still are browsing but are seeking added insurance, with many buying de=
fensive puts to lock in a minimum selling price for the stock.=20
Sprint's January 25 puts traded more than 13,000 contracts at the Amex as a=
n investor bought stock along with those puts. Specifically, the investor b=
ought about 5,000 contracts of the puts, then bought a put spread by buying=
 8,000 contracts of January 25 puts that expire 2002 and selling the same n=
umber of January 25 puts that expire 2003.=20
Shares of Sprint's PCS unit fell $1.14 to $25.90. At the Amex, the January =
25 puts were at $1.15 on volume of 13,005 contracts, compared with open int=
erest of 2,799. The January 25 puts that expire in 2003 were at $4.40 on vo=
lume of 8,005 contracts, compared with open interest of 8,826.

Enron Asks Staff to Drop 401(k) Suits for Severance

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the subject of four lawsuits filed over losses in i=
ts employees' 401(k) retirement plan, is asking laid-off workers to waive l=
egal claims against it in exchange for some of their severance payments.=20
Attorneys for some of the employees sought to block that requirement. Plain=
tiffs are seeking an "immediate preliminary injunction prohibiting Enron fr=
om soliciting any releases which would affect the participants' rights vis =
a vis the plan," according to an amended complaint filed by Seattle firm Ca=
mpbell Harrison & Wright.
The complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, asks the court "=
to appoint a neutral fiduciary to manage the plan." The suit claims Enron i=
s laying off as much as 60% of its staff in some departments.=20
An Enron attorney, in a statement, said laid-off employees aren't required =
to sign the waiver to get severance pay, but will get "additional severance=
 in exchange" for signing. She said Enron hadn't modified the waiver "in re=
sponse to the current economic circumstances of the company," but added tha=
t Enron "continues to evaluate its options regarding the severance-pay plan=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
ENRON COLLAPSES AS SUITOR CANCELS PLANS FOR MERGER
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron, the champion of energy deregulation that grew into one of the nation=
's 10 largest companies, collapsed yesterday, after a rival backed out of a=
 deal to buy it and many big trading partners stopped doing business with i=
t.=20
Enron, based in Houston, was widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection.=
 With $62 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, it would be the biggest America=
n company ever to go bankrupt, dwarfing the filing by Texaco in 1987. Late =
in the day, though, Enron's chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said tha=
t the company was still talking to banks about a restructuring and consider=
ing other options.
Talks with its would-be rescuer Dynegy, also of Houston, about salvaging th=
e deal ended in acrimony.=20
Dynegy, which had agreed on Nov. 9 to buy Enron but had second thoughts as =
Enron disclosed more financial problems and investors pummeled its stock, a=
ccused Enron of misrepresenting the health of its business. Enron, meanwhil=
e, was weighing whether to sue Dynegy for breaching the terms of the deal, =
a person close to Enron said.=20
Enron's swift collapse left the prospects of 21,000 employees in doubt and =
wiped out what was left of the holdings of stock investors, including some =
big mutual funds, as shares that sold for $90 in August 2000 crashed to clo=
se yesterday at 61 cents. It roiled the Treasury market and tarnished the s=
tanding of the big New York banks that both advised on the deal and poured =
their own cash into the company. And it left in tatters the reputation of E=
nron's chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, a confidant and campaign backer of =
President George W. Bush. [Page C1.]=20
The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission said they had monitored Enron's impact on the financial and =
energy markets yesterday; officials who would comment said they saw no dang=
erous ripple effect.=20
''The markets are functioning normally,'' said Peter Bakstansky, a spokesma=
n for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.=20
From a pipeline company in the 1980's, Enron grew into the world's largest =
energy trader, using the Internet to buy and sell natural gas and electric =
power supplies for utilities and industrial power users and helping them he=
dge against fluctuations in power prices.=20
But Enron was undone by shaky accounting, too much borrowed money and an un=
willingness to provide information to investors who grew to doubt its finan=
cial reports.=20
Five weeks ago, the company disclosed that, to fuel its growth, it had shif=
ted billions of dollars in debt off its balance sheet and into an array of =
complex partnerships. The Securities and Exchange Commission began an inves=
tigation, and Enron restated five years of earnings, wiping out nearly $600=
 million in profit.=20
Enron was teetering close to insolvency before Dynegy, a smaller cross-town=
 rival, agreed to acquire it for $9 billion plus the assumption of $13 bill=
ion in debt, with additional financing from ChevronTexaco, a major Dynegy s=
hareholder.=20
But Enron subsequently disclosed even more debts, and its financial plight =
continued to worsen. Energy-trading companies reduced dealings with the fir=
m; doubting its creditworthiness, some forced Enron to pay higher prices fo=
r natural gas and other products or required it to post large cash deposits=
 to back trades.=20
For four days, Enron and Dynegy worked to salvage the deal. But yesterday m=
orning, Dynegy pulled out. ''We knew when to say no, and this morning, we s=
aid no,'' said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman.=20
In an interview, Mr. Watson said Enron's energy-trading business had deteri=
orated. He also cited ''surprises'' in the quarterly report to the S.E.C. t=
hat Enron filed on Nov. 19, including the disclosures that a credit downgra=
de meant Enron had to pay or refinance a $690 million obligation and that E=
nron had less cash on hand than Dynegy had expected. ''Confidence and credi=
bility, which is what this business is all about, deteriorated after that,'=
' he said.=20
Mr. Watson said he called Mr. Lay yesterday after a meeting of Dynegy's boa=
rd to call off the deal. By then, S.& P. had downgraded Enron's debt to jun=
k status, accelerating up to $3.9 billion in debt payments.=20
But last night, Mr. McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, took strong i=
ssue with the notion that Dynegy could have been surprised by Enron's finan=
cial report.=20
''I believe Dynegy was aware of everything that was encapsulated in that,''=
 Mr. McMahon said, explaining that Dynegy had been given advance copies of =
the filing.=20
The companies even disagreed about whether they had reached agreement on a =
renegotiated deal that would have cut Dynegy's purchase price and pumped hu=
ndreds of millions dollars more into Enron.=20
''There was never a global settlement that all parties agreed to,'' Mr. Wat=
son said.=20
Mr. McMahon had a very different view. ''It's fair to say that we thought w=
e had a deal several times,'' he said, ''and the goal posts definitely kept=
 moving on us.''=20
As for Enron's future, Mr. McMahon said: ''We are looking at every option u=
nder the sun, as you can imagine.'' Those options include the Chapter 11 fi=
ling for bankruptcy reorganization that analysts and competitors widely exp=
ected. He said that a Chapter 7 filing -- in short, the liquidation of the =
company -- ''is not an option we are pursuing.''=20
An executive close to Enron said it had not yet done the advance work neede=
d to seek protection in bankruptcy court. ''It's a last resort, but not a l=
ast-minute kind of thing,'' this executive said. ''If you go in and file fo=
r Chapter 11 like this without having everything done, it's like walking in=
 a bank lobby and throwing a dozen eggs on the floor.''=20
A bankruptcy filing would give the company some breathing room to deal with=
 creditors' claims, but it would be complicated, and many creditors -- incl=
uding stockholders -- would be likely to come away empty handed. Enron has =
relatively few hard assets, and those it has -- including an extensive netw=
ork of natural gas pipelines -- are already pledged to lenders.=20
In any case, by the end of the day Enron was a shadow of the colossus that =
politicians blamed for California's energy crisis and analysts promoted as =
an innovator that epitomized the free-market swashbuckling that the Interne=
t could unleash.=20
Yesterday morning, Enron shut down its Internet-based trading platform, Enr=
onOnline, its screens going blank. Other major energy traders announced tha=
t they would trade with Enron only in cash -- effectively meaning that virt=
ually all trading with the company had stopped, they said.=20
Late yesterday, Mr. McMahon said that Enron was doing some trading by phone=
, but he declined to say how much or whether EnronOnline would be reopened =
today.=20
Yesterday, shares of Enron, which peaked last summer at $90, fell to 61 cen=
ts, down 85 percent for the day; Dynegy shares fell $4.08, or 10 percent, t=
o close at $36.81.=20
Other big energy traders, like the El Paso Corporation, Reliant Energy, Mir=
ant and Aquila, also fell. But Enron's gradual decline over the last month =
gave many energy companies time to reduce their exposure to Enron, and many=
 operate rival trading operations that would benefit from its collapse.=20
Yesterday morning, as news leaked out of Dynegy's plans to cancel the deal =
and S.& P. announced its downgrade of Enron's credit, prices for natural ga=
s futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange soared more than 10 pe=
rcent. But they quickly reversed, plunging about 15 percent from the highs =
reached before noon. Traders said volume fell off sharply as word of Enron'=
s problems spread.=20
Mr. McMahon said Enron was working with J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, i=
ts lead banks, to restructure the company's debts. ''We are optimistic we c=
an get a restructuring,'' he said. Earlier in the day, Enron said that it h=
ad begun a ''temporary suspension of all payments other than those necessar=
y to maintain core operations,'' but Mr. McMahon declined to comment on wha=
t bills Enron was paying.=20
The two banks had hoped that by helping arrange Enron's rescue they could p=
rove the merits of their strategy of providing both loans and advice in the=
 merger business. Now, not only have the banks lost bragging rights for pul=
ling off a difficult deal, as well as millions in fees, they are also left =
holding hundreds of millions in loans to Enron, analysts said.=20
Dynegy may come out better. Under terms of the initial merger deal, the $1.=
5 billion it injected into Enron earlier in the month gave it preferred sto=
ck in Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline that can be converted into owne=
rship of the pipeline. Dynegy said yesterday that it would exercise its opt=
ion to acquire the pipeline. Enron said it was reviewing the ''assertion'' =
by Dynegy that it could claim the pipeline.=20
The person close to Enron said that Dynegy might have been seeking control =
of the pipeline all along. ''You've got to wonder if they ever wanted to go=
 through with this agreement from the get-go,'' he said of Dynegy. ''Certai=
nly, this was a way to take probably the world's largest energy player out =
of the market.''=20
Mr. Watson said that Enron had never leveled that charge at Dynegy in the c=
ourse of their talks.=20
Enron executives believed they had successfully revised the deal with Dyneg=
y on Monday afternoon.=20
Mr. Lay was in a private plane preparing to fly out of Teterboro Airport in=
 suburban New Jersey. He had just signed new merger documents and was hopin=
g to announce a deal on Tuesday in Houston, executives close to the talks s=
aid.=20
But Mr. Watson, who had just returned from a trip, had become deeply involv=
ed in the talks earlier that day and kept raising the ante, one executive c=
lose to Enron said. ''All the parties were flipping out because Chuck was c=
hanging the terms by the hour,'' this executive said.=20
As Mr. Lay's plane was taxiing for takeoff, the executives said, a call cam=
e in from Mr. Watson asking to change the terms once again. That, they said=
, was when it became clear that the deal might unravel.=20
In the end, Enron's uncertain finances and evidence that its customers were=
 fleeing sealed Dynegy's decision. ''Sometimes,'' Mr. Watson said, ''a comp=
any's best deals are the very ones they did not do.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LAST RESORT
A Bankruptcy Filing Might Be the Best Remaining Choice
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron, facing the collapse of a deal with Dynegy that might have rescued it=
 from disaster and a tidal wave of debts suddenly coming due, may now have =
little choice but to enter bankruptcy, lawyers and analysts said yesterday.=
=20
Filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code would=
 give the company some much-needed breathing room to deal with creditors' c=
laims, as well as afford any eventual buyer the advantage of a court's appr=
oval.
But bankruptcy would also be complicated by the fact that some of Enron's m=
ost valuable assets, including its Transwestern Pipeline linking Texas natu=
ral gas fields with California energy markets, are already pledged to lende=
rs. The value of other assets available to satisfy unsecured creditors is u=
nclear.=20
Still, Enron's creditors will not necessarily lose everything, said Robert =
J. Rosenberg, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins, which is expected to represent =
some of the creditors in any Enron bankruptcy. ''It depends on whether ther=
e is a good ongoing business'' that could make payments in the future, he s=
aid.=20
Once they decide bankruptcy is unavoidable, lawyers said, one of the first =
critical issues Enron executives face will be where to file for Chapter 11 =
protection. Enron has its headquarters in Houston and receives significant =
attention from news media in Texas, but it is incorporated in Oregon and fi=
ling there might lead some creditors to decide that participating in bankru=
ptcy proceedings there would be too costly.=20
Delaware might be a preferred location. The courts there are very experienc=
ed in handling large bankruptcies and are known to be relatively friendly t=
o debtors, said Jay Westbrook, a professor at the University of Texas Schoo=
l of Law in Austin. ''On the other hand,'' he said, ''I am told that recent=
ly Delaware has gotten so busy that they have been sending cases back where=
 they should be.''=20
Enron could file in Delaware if a subsidiary were incorporated there, he sa=
id.=20
Secured creditors would be paid first. If the assets backing the loan have =
been valued accurately, those creditors would be paid in full. Unsecured cr=
editors are likely to receive only a fraction of the value of their outstan=
ding loans. If anything is left, it would go to stockholders, lawyers said.=
=20
Enron would have to line up lenders fairly quickly to pay for its continuin=
g operations, several lawyers said. One lawyer who has worked with the comp=
any in the past estimates that it would need a $1 billion credit line to co=
ntinue to operate its energy-trading business.=20
Continuing to operate would be important if the goal is to sell the busines=
s as a whole -- perhaps to Dynegy -- in a court-supervised auction. The alt=
ernative would be to sell the company's various assets and operations in pi=
eces, Professor Westbrook said.=20
Entering bankruptcy would be bad news for shareholders who have filed lawsu=
its accusing Enron of violating securities laws; any awards would not be pa=
id until after creditors were satisfied. And like Enron's other shareholder=
s, they might end up with nothing, said Robert D. Albergotti, a partner at =
Haynes & Boone, a Dallas law firm.=20
If Enron files for bankruptcy, this is not likely to prevent litigation aga=
inst Arthur Andersen, the company's outside auditor, said Jeffrey N. Gordon=
 of Columbia University Law School. Indeed, bankruptcy proceedings could gi=
ve both the company and investors an opportunity to figure out exactly how =
its profits came to be overstated and to look for potential fraud.=20
A special committee of Enron's board has already retained Deloitte & Touche=
, another big accounting firm, to help.=20
''It's going to be a while before they figure it all out,'' Professor Gordo=
n said.

An Implosion on Wall Street

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 34, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron, the energy-trading company, may be on the verge of extinction with t=
he collapse yesterday of its proposed acquisition by Dynegy, a smaller comp=
etitor, and the downgrading of its debt to junk status. But its name has at=
tained immortality on Wall Street.=20
Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm. Take a high-flying =
company terribly impressed with its sense of unique mission and ingenuity, =
and correspondingly contemptuous of its obligations to fully comply with th=
e spirit of accounting rules. Then add fawning investors, Wall Street analy=
sts, journalists and accountants unwilling to allow a company's lack of tra=
nsparency about its business to get in the way of a dizzying ride, until th=
ey realize the destination is the top of a steep cliff. What you have then =
is an Enron.
There have been plenty of other once-unfathomable implosions on Wall Street=
, but perhaps none so sudden or of such magnitude. Jittery financial market=
s now have to contend with the possibility that an Enron bankruptcy could u=
ndermine the financial health of banks and other energy companies. Enron ra=
nked seventh on the list of Fortune 500 companies last year, and remained o=
ne of the most hyped stories on Wall Street well into this year. A pioneer =
in creating private marketplaces for newly deregulated commodities, Enron w=
as touted as a revolutionary force, bridging the dot-com world and stodgy e=
nergy markets.=20
Now Enron may become one of the largest bankruptcy cases in history. Its st=
ock closed yesterday at 61 cents, as investors rushed for the exits in reac=
tion to the fatal news that, without a bailout from Dynegy, Enron is unlike=
ly to be able to meet its crushing debt obligations.=20
The company's autopsy will be a complicated affair, entailing numerous laws=
uits. What is already clear, and will come as a shock to millions of trusti=
ng individual investors across America, is that the financials of a Fortune=
 500 company were essentially a mystery. Enron's death watch began last mon=
th when it grudgingly disclosed that $1.2 billion of its market value had v=
anished as a result of ''related-party'' transactions with private partners=
hips that enriched company insiders. Then Enron admitted that it had overst=
ated its profits over the last five years by $600 million. Dynegy cited Enr=
on's lack of forthrightness as a reason to walk away from the merger agreem=
ent.=20
Not very long ago, competitors and Democrats in Washington were worrying wh=
ether the close ties between Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and George W. B=
ush would give the company too much influence. Enron has aggressively lobbi=
ed, with some success in recent years, to limit regulation and disclosure o=
f its trading operations.=20
Now Enron is the best argument for the need for stronger supervision of pub=
lic companies' financial data. The Securities and Exchange Commission shoul=
d make sure that the energy trader's saga puts an end to any talk of lessen=
ing disclosure requirements faced by public companies. Moreover, Arthur And=
ersen's failure to uncover flawed accounting by Enron, or to forcefully que=
stion some of the company's shadier transactions, raises serious concerns a=
bout auditors' commitment to be sufficiently diligent in reviewing the acti=
ons of major companies.=20
There is a certain irony that Enron, a champion of deregulation, now become=
s a poster child for the need for strong regulation on Wall Street.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE LENDERS
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Are Left With Bruised Egos and Exposure to Loans
By RIVA D. ATLAS

11/29/2001
The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Dynegy's decision to walk away from Enron leaves Citigroup and J. P. Morgan=
 Chase licking their wounds after an effort to burnish their reputations as=
 deal makers.=20
As lead advisers and lead bankers for Enron, the banks had the chance to bu=
ild influence in the merger business. Unlike other Wall Street firms, Citig=
roup and J. P. Morgan have large balance sheets and have boasted of their a=
bility to provide both loans and advice. J. P. Morgan, in particular, ''has=
 been saying that providing financing is an advantage they have in terms of=
 building their investment banking franchise,'' said Richard Strauss, a Gol=
dman, Sachs analyst following brokerage firms.
Now, not only have the banks lost bragging rights for pulling off a difficu=
lt deal, as well as millions in fees, they are also left holding hundreds o=
f millions in loans to Enron, which is trying to stave off bankruptcy. Enro=
n owes the two banks anywhere from $800 million to $900 million each, altho=
ugh some of it may be hedged through derivatives contracts, analysts estima=
ted.=20
In bankruptcy, of course, creditors come well ahead of shareholders, who ha=
ve now been virtually wiped out. Janus Capital was the biggest shareholder =
for most of the year, but Alliance Capital surpassed it as of Sept. 30, acc=

Worries about the money Enron owes the banks punished their stocks yesterda=
y. Citigroup's shares closed at $47.80 each, down $2.75, while J. P. Morgan=
 fell $2.30, to $37.50.=20
Even if Enron files for bankruptcy, neither J. P. Morgan nor Citigroup is t=
hought to have enough exposure to be at serious risk. Executives of the ban=
ks declined to comment on the estimates of their exposure. While the banks =
had each promised to make equity investments in the companies of $250 milli=
on each, those investments have been canceled along with the Dynegy deal.=
=20
About half of the money owed to J. P. Morgan and Citigroup consists of a $1=
 billion loan the banks made earlier this month that is secured by one of E=
nron's pipelines. Citigroup lent $600 million, and J. P. Morgan provided th=
e rest, according to an executive close to the Enron negotiations. The rema=
inder owed to the banks is in various loans, trading positions and other in=
vestments not secured by Enron assets.=20
Given that there are assets backing much of the banks' loans, some analysts=
 said the stock market had overreacted. ''The net exposure could be very sm=
all,'' said Andrew Collins, who covers bank stocks at U.S. Bancorp Piper Ja=
ffray and is recommending Citigroup and J. P. Morgan.=20
Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, said the company was stil=
l working with J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup to restructure Enron's debt=

Several other banks may own large amounts of Enron debt. Bank of America ha=
s $200 million to $300 million, according to estimates by Lori Appelbaum, w=
ho follows bank stocks for Goldman, Sachs, and Ruchi Madan, a stock analyst=
 at Salomon Smith Barney. Other banks identified by the analysts as owed mo=
ney are the Bank of New York, Bank One, FleetBoston Financial, SunTrust and=
 the Wachovia Corporation. A spokesman for SunTrust did not return calls; e=
xecutives at the other banks declined to comment.=20
In what appears to have been bad timing, Alliance Capital Management, a sub=
sidiary of AXA, increased its stake in Enron late this summer. Janus, a uni=
t of Stilwell Financial, had been the biggest shareholder, but was pruning =
its stake. Alliance's position grew 71 percent in the report filed in Septe=
mber, to 5.8 percent of Enron's outstanding. Jane Ingalls, a spokeswoman fo=
r Janus, said last night that Janus had since sold all its shares, but did =
not say when or at what price. A spokesman for Alliance would not comment a=
bout its stake in Enron.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE MARKET
In Turbulent Bond Market, Enron's Woes Exacerbate Turmoil
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The swift downfall of Enron has contributed to extreme turbulence in the Un=
ited States Treasury market in recent weeks, causing violent swings in inte=
rest rates not seen since Russia defaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Ca=
pital Management hedge fund nearly collapsed in late 1998.=20
Even though the exact makeup of Enron's large trading portfolio remains a m=
ystery, traders said that the energy company had bet that interest rates wo=
uld continue to decline because of continuing weakness in the economy.
Then two weeks ago, the economy began to show signs of revival. As investor=
s decided that the days of Federal Reserve rate cuts were over, rates began=
 to rise and prices on Treasury securities fell. The move out of Treasuries=
 crushed traders who still expected the weak economy to push interest rates=
 lower. Scrambling to cut their losses, those traders sold even more, depre=
ssing prices and pushing up rates further.=20
The sense among many market participants is that Enron's woes made a bad ma=
rket excruciating. ''I think the Street in general lost half of its year or=
 more in the last week or two,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director at Fima=
t USA, a broker dealer. ''Everyone was long the bond market, thinking the e=
conomy was going to be bad. Then everything shifted, and Enron drove it to =
extremes.''=20
How extreme? In the two weeks beginning Nov. 12, two-year Treasury notes pl=
ummeted in price, pushing their yields up to 3.18 percent, from 2.41 percen=
t. In the same period, yields on Treasuries with five-year maturities went =
to 4.4 percent, from 3.62 percent.=20
The trade that appears to have gone awry for Enron, market participants say=
, involved the sale of hundreds of thousands of Eurodollar futures, some of=
 which matured in two or three years. Such contracts are frequently used to=
 bet on the direction of interest rates. Enron could also have used the Eur=
odollar contracts to hedge against fluctuations in oil prices. In a weak ec=
onomy, oil prices usually fall. But so do interest rates, so a bet on lower=
 rates would produce gains to help offset the decline in oil prices. When d=
ata showed signs of life in the economy, traders surmised that Enron began =
to sell its Eurodollars and started an avalanche of selling among other tra=
ders.=20
There were huge Eurodollar positions being liquidated, said Gemma Wright, d=
irector of market strategy at Barclays Capital. ''We don't know for certain=
 who it was, but the amount of the loss was high.''=20
One reason that traders suspect Enron may have been forced out of such a po=
sition was that the company had neither the cash flow nor the bank credit t=
o meet calls for additional cash from traders at other firms. Typically, co=
mpanies have cash reserves to meet such calls or have access to temporary l=
ines of credit to cover shortfalls. Enron appears to have neither. Yesterda=
y, the company said it was suspending all payments except for those ''neces=
sary to maintain core operations.''=20
In addition to the recent interest rate spike, Enron has had to contend wit=
h falling oil prices. The price of crude oil has dropped 28 percent since t=
he end of October.=20
Caught in a vise, Enron has almost certainly been selling securities to rai=
se cash. Treasury securities and Eurodollar contracts, because their market=
s are large, are among the easiest to sell. In both cases, Enron was probab=
ly selling into a falling market.=20
Adding to the turmoil in the bond market, traders said, was less participat=
ion by Wall Street firms, which were unwilling to take on big new trading p=
ositions near the end of their fiscal year. Several firms end their years o=
n Nov. 30.=20
Some traders say Enron's problems started with comments on Tuesday by Laure=
nce H. Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Meyer suggested that a=
dditional rate cuts might be coming, and that remark helped stabilize price=
s of Treasury securities. ''It's my view that there are no coincidences,'' =
Mr. Jonas said. ''Laurence Meyer is a big hawk on interest rates, and he ba=
sically talked a 180. That was their big gun. The only bigger gun would hav=
e been Greenspan.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MARKET PLACE
A Big Fall Evoking Nasty Old Memories Of a Run on a Bank
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The final collapse of Enron amounted to something that few living Americans=
 have ever seen: a bank run like those in the days before deposit insurance=
.=20
Enron appeared to become a wildly successful company by creating a new, lar=
gely unregulated financial business, that of energy trading. That business =
ran on credit, and required suppliers and users of energy to sign contracts=
 that called on Enron to meet obligations months or years later.
Enron became something like a bank, which takes depositors' money and promi=
ses to pay it back later. But unlike banks in the current era, this institu=
tion had no federal deposit insurance to reassure customers when rumors beg=
an to spread that it was in trouble. That proved to be its Achilles' heel. =
Enron's collapse is a reminder for big players in unregulated markets that =
their financial health must be beyond doubt.=20
Before the advent of deposit insurance, bankers knew what was needed to hea=
d off a bank run. It was cash, so much cash that it would be clear that pan=
ic was unwarranted. Nearly a century ago, J. P. Morgan took the lead as he =
and fellow banking tycoons put up the millions needed to keep the Trust Com=
pany of America open. Thus was halted the Panic of 1907.=20
As it happened, corporate descendants of two major institutions involved in=
 that rescue -- J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup -- were major players in t=
he Enron debacle. But they did not try the strategy this time.=20
Instead, Enron kept arranging an additional billion or two in loans, clearl=
y struggling to find the money. Morgan and Citigroup allowed the word to sp=
read that they were ready to put in more money on their own, but the amount=
s were relatively small, and somehow the money was never invested.=20
When Dynegy agreed to buy Enron, it put up $1.5 billion in cash only after =
it was assured that it would get control of the company's crown jewel, the =
Northern Natural Gas pipeline system, or its money back, if the deal collap=
sed.=20
The final straw came on Tuesday, when negotiations on a revised Dynegy take=
over deal came down to efforts to find $250 million or $500 million of Enro=
n assets that could serve as collateral for a new Dynegy cash advance. The =
message to companies that traded with Enron was clear: even its rescuer is =
demanding collateral, and is having trouble finding it.=20
Given that, Enron's financial business could not continue. Public haggling =
over the terms of the rescue assured that no rescue was possible, something=
 that would have been obvious to the original J. P. Morgan but that seemed =
to escape his corporate heirs. As Walter Bagehot, the British financial jou=
rnalist and historian, wrote in 1873, ''Every banker knows that if he has t=
o prove that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in =
fact his credit is gone.''=20
The markets Enron helped to create will endure, but probably without Enron.=
 It will be interesting to see whether participants in them continue to res=
ist regulation as much as they have in the past. Unregulated markets, espec=
ially when they are relatively new, can be very profitable for those with s=
uperior market knowledge, as Enron seemed to have. But when prices are visi=
ble to all, the value of that knowledge plummets. Regulation could bring mo=
re openness, but it could also bring structures, like clearing systems, tha=
t reassure traders they need not worry about the credit of those with whom =
they trade.=20
If the markets continue to be unregulated, Enron's collapse makes it more l=
ikely that the big players in those markets will be companies that are alre=
ady regulated enough to assure customers that they are secure -- companies =
like major banks and brokerage houses. That would be bad news for Dynegy, w=
hich was Enron's major competitor before it tried to become its acquirer.=
=20
The crisis at Enron may have exposed a ''flaw in the business model'' of en=
ergy trading companies, said John Diaz, a managing director at Moody's, in =
an interview yesterday. ''Companies in this industry need to think carefull=
y about their liquidity management,'' he said. ''We're going to be looking =
very hard at this.''=20
The litigation over Enron seems likely to be prolonged and expensive, but i=
t may boil down to Senator Howard H. Baker Jr.'s famous Watergate-era quest=
ion about President Richard M. Nixon: What did he know and when did he know=
 it?=20
That question will be asked about Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, and abo=
ut its corporate officials, past and present. But it will be asked most par=
ticularly about the banks and investment banks that served Enron and its af=
filiated off-balance- sheet entities in recent years.=20
Enron's disclosures last week showed it needed to pay far more in debts ove=
r the next year than most people had understood to be the case. But the new=
ly discovered loans did not materialize out of thin air. The money was lent=
 by banks and bond buyers to the off-balance-sheet entities. Those who were=
 stuck with losses on the known Enron debt may claim the financiers who syn=
dicated the loans should have told them of all the other debt.=20
Among those who do not come out of this looking very good are the bond rati=
ng agencies. Just six weeks ago, after Enron put out an earnings release sh=
owing strong pro-forma profits, as it defined them, two of the agencies, Fi=
tch and Standard & Poor's, reaffirmed Enron's rating of triple-B plus. Mood=
y's, the agency that was the most skeptical about Enron, put the rating und=
er review and hinted it would, at worst, cut it one notch.=20
None of the rating agencies seemed overly concerned about a detail disclose=
d by Enron at the time: a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity rela=
ted to what it later said were accounting mistakes involving a partnership =
run by Enron's chief financial officer. But that disclosure set off a casca=
de of questions that Enron could not answer in a reassuring way. It ran thr=
ough billions as companies demanded more protection to keep trading with it=
.=20
Enron could have been saved, if an institution that was trusted -- whether =
that was Chevron Texaco, which put up the $1.5 billion cash that Dynegy inv=
ested, or J. P. Morgan Chase or Citigroup -- had made it clear that it was =
willing to stand behind Enron. A credible backer would have ended the run.=
=20
But no one was willing to do that, and their hesitance as they learned more=
 only accelerated the run. Whether they were wise to avoid that exposure ma=
y become clear as it emerges how much creditors will eventually get.=20
Finally, the rating agencies yesterday downgraded Enron to relatively low l=
evels of junk. They knew that was likely to force Enron into bankruptcy in =
the near future, but they also knew that no one was willing to rescue a com=
pany that the agencies had viewed as solid only weeks before.=20
Yesterday, as Dynegy walked away from the merger, it said that it was no lo=
nger willing to trade with Enron -- unless Enron put up ''sufficient credit=
 support.'' It knew that support was nowhere to be found.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
Foundation Gives Way On Chief's Big Dream
By JOHN SCHWARTZ and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Well before anyone could imagine that Enron might collapse, Kenneth L. Lay =
was stumped. In an interview in August, he dismissed questions about a vagu=
e clause in the energy company's annual report that hinted at bigger proble=
ms if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels.=20
''I just can't help you on that,'' he said. Pressed further on questions ab=
out a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved Enro=
n's former chief financial officer, he said, ''You're getting way over my h=
ead.''
At the least, Mr. Lay -- a man of big ideas, a crusader for free markets, a=
 risk taker in the Texas wildcatter tradition -- had taken his eye off the =
ball. While he was busy befriending the nation's most powerful politicians,=
 erecting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and pasting Enron's logo =
on the city's new ballpark, the little things were turning out to be Mr. La=
y's big problems.=20
One after another, disclosures spilled out of his company over the last mon=
th: the partnerships had hidden billions in debt; years of Enron's reported=
 profits had been exaggerated; the government was investigating. Rivals wer=
e shunning Enron's energy trading desks, which Mr. Lay had built into the w=
orld's leaders. And sure enough, the stock price tumbled day after day, and=
 credit agencies lowered Enron's ratings once and then yesterday again, tur=
ning the company's debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock.=20
Three weeks ago, Mr. Lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to Dyn=
egy, his Houston rival. Yesterday, Dynegy pulled out of the deal. Deprived =
of enough information, and then repelled by what they learned, the free mar=
kets in which Mr. Lay had put so much faith all but destroyed, in a matter =
of weeks, everything he had built.=20
''If they had been going a slower speed, the results would not have been di=
sastrous,'' said Bob McNair, a Houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bul=
k of his own company to Enron three years ago. But Enron, he said in an int=
erview this month, was like a race car, and the markets like an unforgiving=
 track. ''It's a lot harder to keep it on the track at 200 miles per hour,'=
' he said. ''You hit a bump and you're off the track.''=20
From his youth, Mr. Lay, 59, had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets' =
wisdom. He studied economics at the University of Missouri, living at home =
to save on room and board, and eventually earned a Ph.D. in the subject. As=
 a naval officer serving in the Pentagon, he worked to develop more efficie=
nt accounting systems. Later, he served as an aide to a federal government =
regulator for the natural gas industry -- a market that Enron would come to=
 dominate.=20
Moving into the private sector, he worked his way up the ranks of the natur=
al gas industry, becoming chief executive in 1984 of the Houston Natural Ga=
s Corporation, a big regional pipeline operator. He engineered its merger w=
ith Internorth, an Omaha pipeline company, and then became chief executive =
of the combined company and changed its name to Enron.=20
Mr. Lay saw Enron's mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel. At t=
he time, gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passiv=
e role; buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly. But as oil price=
s plunged in the mid-80's and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil=
, Mr. Lay returned to Washington to argue, successfully, for rules changes =
that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop=
 for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities.=20
The new flexibility brought the threat of chaos, however, as natural gas pr=
ices began fluctuating wildly. That is when the new Enron was truly born. T=
o help customers shield themselves from risk, Mr. Lay's Enron developed hed=
ging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper=
 and winter wheat. Its innovative ''gas bank'' let utilities lock up the lo=
ng-term prices that they craved; Enron lined up the gas supplies from produ=
cers, arranged for delivery -- and took a cut of every deal.=20
That business became the forerunner of Enron's entry into hundreds of other=
 markets, helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ra=
nging from electric power to pulp and paper and, most recently, fast broadb=
and access to the Internet. Trading soon provided more of the company's pro=
fits than the traditional natural gas business.=20
While other companies, including Dynegy, focused on accumulating hard asset=
s like pipelines, turbines and gas fields, Enron increasingly saw itself as=
 a pure trading company with an almost limitless future.=20
''There is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corpora=
tion in the world,'' Mr. Lay's handpicked successor as Enron's chief execut=
ive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, told the authors of a book, just published, about=
 business on the Internet. Even the book's title, ''Radical E: From GE to E=
nron -- Lessons on How to Rule the Web'' (PricewaterhouseCoopers), showed t=
he cachet the company had attained. Enron, the authors wrote, was ''creatin=
g a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and reward=
ed.''=20
Mr. Skilling abruptly resigned in August, after just six months on the job,=
 propelling Mr. Lay back into the gritty details of Enron's businesses that=
 he had sought to leave to others.=20
As the company grew, he had become increasingly involved in public affairs,=
 serving as host when a global economic conference was held in Houston in 1=
990 and when the Republican National Convention came to the city in 1992.=
=20
Like the leaders of many big Texas businesses -- the construction colossus =
Brown & Root after World War II or Ross Perot's Electronic Data Systems in =
the 1960's -- Mr. Lay knew the value of courting politicians and policy mak=
ers.=20
He played golf with President Bill Clinton; became good friends with the Te=
xas governor, Ann Richards; and supported Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, whos=
e wife, Wendy, a former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commi=
ssion, joined Enron's board.=20
''He's a stand-up guy,'' said Ms. Richards, now a business consultant in Ne=
w York. Asked to be more specific, she said, ''He's at the meeting'' -- mea=
ning she could count on Mr. Lay to become directly involved with whatever s=
he asked him to do, and not just sign onto a project for show.=20
Mr. Lay's deepest political ties were with the Bush family. In the 1980's, =
he became a major fund-raiser for George H. W. Bush. When Mr. Bush lost his=
 1992 campaign for re-election as president, Mr. Lay brought a number of se=
nior Bush aides to Enron as directors or consultants, including James A. Ba=
ker III, the former secretary of state, and Robert A. Mosbacher, the former=
 secretary of commerce.=20
Mr. Lay also cultivated Mr. Bush's son George W. long before he was conside=
red a serious national candidate. After the younger Mr. Bush's election as =
Texas governor in 1994, Mr. Lay became head of the Governor's Business Coun=
cil, an important advisory post.=20
The bond with President Bush is personal. As governor, Mr. Bush sent Mr. La=
y a kidding note in 1997. ''One of the sad things about old friends is that=
 they seem to be getting older -- just like you!'' he wrote. ''55 years old=
. Wow! That is really old. Thank goodness you have such a young, beautiful =
wife,'' he added, a reference to Mr. Lay's wife, Linda.=20
In 1999, Mr. Lay sent a handwritten Christmas note to Mr. Bush and his wife=
, Laura. ''Linda and I are so proud of both of you and look forward to seei=
ng both of you in the White House,'' he wrote.=20
Yesterday, the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said the Treasur=
y Department was monitoring Enron's downfall for its effect on the market. =
Asked if the president himself had any reaction, Mr. Fleisher said, ''The p=
resident's reaction is that it should be monitored.''=20
In some ways, Enron's collapse was one more example of the bursting of the =
Internet bubble. But Mr. Lay was not some stylish dot-com brat; by all acco=
unts, he is an immensely likable product of Middle America. Growing up in t=
iny Rush Hill, Mo., he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting away sav=
ings. By 16, his sister Sharon recalled this week, ''he was bucking bales''=
 -- that is, loading hay -- ''and had two jobs in the summer, painting hous=
es.''=20
''I don't think you could ever say that he did something the easy way,'' sh=
e said.=20
That work ethic ran in the family. Mr. Lay's father was a minister who also=
 sold farm equipment. The family's finances were spotty, ''at times no mone=
y, at times some money,'' Ms. Lay recalled. Still, the Lays took in people =
from their church who were in need.=20
Over the last decade or so, Mr. Lay earned some $300 million from Enron, mo=
stly by exercising stock options. Earlier this month, when employees grew i=
ncensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the =
company's sale to Dynegy, he volunteered to walk away from $60 million in p=
ayments.=20
Mr. McNair, the Houston entrepreneur, who has known Mr. Lay for years, sugg=
ested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him. ''Maybe the pe=
ople who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear, but they we=
ren't telling him everything,'' he said.=20
Mr. McNair said he spoke to Mr. Lay recently and found him ''somewhat in a =
state of shock.'' Mr. McNair added, ''He's devastated.''=20
In the end, it seems, the man whose company did so much to help others mana=
ge their risk could not manage his own.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE DERIVATIVES
Market That Deals in Risks Faces a Novel One
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

When members of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association gathere=
d in Washington last April, the man they all wanted to hear was Jeffrey K. =
Skilling, then the president and chief executive of Enron.=20
Enron had helped create the global market for energy-based derivatives -- c=
ustomized risk-swapping contracts that enable companies to hedge their expo=
sure to changing energy prices and supply fluctuations. Even among traders =
more familiar with interest-rate swaps or currency hedges than energy contr=
acts, Mr. Skilling's presentation did not disappoint.
''He dazzled everybody -- it seemed he could figure out a way to trade the =
minutes on this phone call,'' one industry executive said.=20
But yesterday, many of those same executives were crossing their fingers an=
d hoping that Enron's crisis would not spread into the energy swaps market =
that the company had done so much to enliven.=20
As the day ended with fairly stable trading, there were a few cautious sigh=
s of relief. But nobody is quite sure just how much money the energy-relate=
d derivatives markets will have at risk if Enron fails.=20
According to Swaps Monitor Publications, which collects data for the deriva=
tives markets, Enron ranks among the top energy-swaps traders in the world,=
 on a par with financial giants like Bank of America and Barclay's.=20
At the end of September, Enron's gross derivatives trading liabilities -- t=
he amount of money it would owe to other market players if it filed for ban=
kruptcy -- stood at $18.7 billion, up slightly from June levels but about $=
1.3 billion less than at the end of last year.=20
But that level may overstate the risk to other companies. ''These numbers d=
o not take into account the unknown amount of collateral that Enron may hav=
e posted,'' said Paul Spraos, Swaps Monitor's president. Such collateral sh=
ould, in principle, diminish Enron's actual liabilities to the derivatives =
market, he said.=20
In a typical energy swap, a company will enter into a contract to lock in a=
 fixed price of a certain commodity, like natural gas or electricity. The o=
ther company, the counterparty, in the deal assumes the risk of future pric=
e changes and quotes a fixed price that includes its own profit. The effici=
ent trading and pricing of these contracts requires a marketplace with larg=
e, active traders.=20
As of last night, there were no signs of a major panic that would drive maj=
or participants to the sidelines, industry executives said.=20
''It's not likely that Enron's problems will cause serious difficulty for a=
ny other sizable counterparty,'' said Mark C. Brickell, a veteran swaps-mar=
ket executive and the chief executive of Blackbird, a technology firm that =
operates an electronic swaps-trading system. ''While there may be some smal=
ler firm that didn't manage its exposure as well as it might, that won't ca=
use any major problems for the system as a whole.''=20
Michael Williams, managing director of TradeSpark, a rival to Enron's onlin=
e energy-trading system, agreed that there was ''no sign of shrinkage'' in =
the marketplace yesterday. ''So far, we've seen no complaints about a lack =
of liquidity,'' he added.=20
Most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contr=
act that was developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Associati=
on and is recognized in the courts. The contract clearly specifies the righ=
ts each party has in the event of a default, said Robert Pickel, the associ=
ation's chief executive. As of late yesterday, he added, the markets appear=
ed ''to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments =
regarding such a major player.''=20

Investors Pull Back as Enron Drags Down Key Indexes

Stocks sank yesterday as Enron teetered on the brink of one of the biggest =
corporate implosions in United States history and added to the debate swirl=
ing around the market's powerful run-up.=20
''The market has come awfully far, awfully fast,'' said Jon Brorson, direct=
or of equities for Northern Trust, which manages more than $300 billion. ''=
Enron is weighing on it, too. I think people are a little squeamish as to t=
he reverberations, and it's a great excuse to take some profits.''
Enron fell $3.50, or more than 85 percent, to 61 cents, in frenzied trading=
 after Dynegy pulled out of its $9 billion takeover. Shares of Dynegy were =
off sharply as well, dropping $4.08, nearly 10 percent, to $36.81.=20
Credit rating agencies sharply cut Enron's bonds, to junk status, pushing t=
he company, a once mighty energy trader, another step toward bankruptcy.=20
Enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants, including Citigro=
up and J. P. Morgan Chase, which might suffer losses of more than $400 mill=
ion combined on the loans that they made Enron, an analyst said. Citigroup =
was off $2.75, to $47.80; J. P. Morgan fell $2.30, to $37.50.=20
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average surrendered 160.74 points, or 1.=
6 percent, to 9,711.86, the largest drop in about a month and the lowest cl=
ose since Nov. 12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 20.98 points,=
 or 1.8 percent, to 1,128.52. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index d=
ropped 48 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,887.97.=20
Enron dragged on the market as Wall Street questioned the rally that had li=
fted stocks well off the Sept. 21 lows. Investors, still expecting an econo=
mic recovery in 2002, pocketed profits on worries that share prices were ge=
tting too far ahead of prospects for corporate earnings.=20
Milton Ezrati, a senior strategist at Lord Abbett & Company, which oversees=
 $40 billion, said, ''The market felt it was getting a little too optimisti=
c a little too quickly and there's recognition of the many, many risks in t=
his environment.''=20
Economic conditions were still sluggish in late October and early November =
after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a Federal Reserve beige book repor=

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE RATING AGENCIES
Debt Rankings Finally Fizzle, but the Deal Fizzled First
By ALEX BERENSON

11/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

In the end, the rating agencies hardly mattered.=20
For weeks, Wall Street wondered whether Moody's Investors Service, Standard=
 & Poor's and Fitch's, the three major agencies rating corporate debt, woul=
d drop Enron's rating below investment grade.
Enron and Dynegy warned that cutting the rating might jeopardize Dynegy's a=
cquisition of Enron. Executives at big securities firms that stood to profi=
t from the deal pressed Moody's to keep ratings at investment grade, even a=
s Enron bonds fell to levels indicating that the debt was highly risky.=20
But even an investment-grade rating could not save Enron's business from co=
llapse over the last month. After a series of damaging revelations about En=
ron's finances, the company's partners demanded extra capital for its trade=
s or stopped trading with it. By the time the rating agencies decided yeste=
rday that Enron might well default on its debt, Dynegy had decided on its o=
wn to walk away.=20
''It wasn't really the reason that Dynegy backed out of the deal,'' said To=
dd Shipman, the Standard & Poor's analyst who was the first to cut Enron's =
rating yesterday.=20
The cuts dim the hopes Enron had of avoiding bankruptcy. All three agencies=
 slashed Enron's debt far below investment grade. Moody's cut Enron's ratin=
g 5 notches, Standard & Poor's lowered it 6, and Fitch slashed it 10, to CC=
, its third-lowest grade.=20
''Default is a probability,'' said Glen Grabelsky, the senior director of c=
redit policy for Fitch. Enron has $13 billion in debt outstanding and about=
 $10 billion more in loans, made by partnerships, that the company has guar=
anteed.=20
The aggressive rating cuts may not mollify the investors who have sharply c=
riticized the agencies for being slow to act in recent weeks. Officials at =
all three agencies defended themselves yesterday, saying they had acted pru=
dently.=20
After Dynegy agreed to buy Enron, Moody's tried to calculate the chances th=
at the deal would go through, that Enron would remain strong until it was c=
ompleted and that the combined company would carry a strong rating, said Jo=
hn Diaz, managing director for Moody's power and energy group.=20
At first, those questions seemed to have reassuring answers, Mr. Diaz said,=
 so Moody's kept Enron's investment-grade rating.=20
But in recent days, other companies have shied away from doing business wit=
h Enron, and its losses have soared. ''Basic cash flow was slowing down at =
the same time that the cost structure of the company was the same,'' Mr. Di=
az said. Enron's mounting losses discouraged Dynegy, he said.=20
''Over the last 24 hours, the probability that we've assigned to these thre=
e key issues was looking to be a lot smaller,'' Mr. Diaz said.=20
Mr. Grabelsky said the acquisition uncertainty presented the agencies with =
a situation where Enron's debt could be very strong, if the deal worked, or=
 highly risky.=20
''There is no middle ground,'' he said. ''It's one or the other.''

GLOBAL INVESTING - Bond mutual funds suffer as Enron's troubles deepen.
By ELIZABETH WINE.

11/29/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

According to the mostrecent filings, about 125 investment-grade bond mutual=
 funds - or about 12 per cent of US bond funds - held the debt of Enron, th=
e troubled energy trader whose bonds were downgraded to junk status yesterd=
ay.=20
The company was abandoned yesterday by its takeover partner Dynegy, the com=
bined blows sending Enron's bonds to 15 to 25 cents in the dollar, down fro=
m 53 cents before the news broke.
According to fund tracker Morningstar, three bond funds held 4 per cent or =
more of their portfolios in Enron debt, as of the most recent regulatory fi=
lings. They are the $162m-asset WesMark Bond Fund, which allocated 4.1 per =
cent of its portfolio, or $6.6m, to Enron bonds as of September 30; the $76=
m ARK Short Term Bond Fund, which had a 4.05 per cent position, or $3.4m as=
 of September 30; and the $50m First Focus Short/Intermediate Bond Fund, wh=
ich had a 4.15 per cent slice of its portfolio in the bonds, worth $2.07m a=
s of September 30.=20
Although these are just single-digit positions, a loss from par value to 20=
 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent holding could trim off half of a fund'=
s return, said Scott Berry, Morningstar bond fund analyst.=20
The average intermediate bond fund has returned 7.3 per cent so far this ye=
ar, according to Morningstar. A loss from par value to 20 cents on the doll=
ar in a 4 per cent stake could reduce a 7.3 per cent return to roughly 3.3 =
per cent, Mr Berry said.=20
"With bonds, there's much more downside than upside. Typically, the downsid=
e is never realised because these investment-grade bonds are strong enough =
to weather the storm, but Enron just caught everybody by surprise over the =
last couple of months," he said.=20
Other large investment-grade bond funds that held Enron's debt as of their =
most recent filings include the $13.6bn Fidelity Short Term Bond fund, whic=
h held 0.77 per cent, worth $27.7m as of April 30, and two of the Strong Fu=
nds - the $1.36m Strong Corporate Bond fund, which held 0.77 per cent as of=
 September 30, or $10.5m, and the $1.43bn Strong Short Term Bond fund, with=
 a 0.63 per cent holding, also as of September 30, worth $9m.=20
Mr Berry said managers of investment-grade bond funds that still held the d=
ebt were probably selling it, although most had the latitude to hold a bond=
 once it lost its investment-grade status. However, they also said junk-bon=
d fund managers were unlikely to buy it, because other "fallen angel" bonds=
 such as Xerox had not performed well.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - SEC filing triggered merger crisis.
By SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/29/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron went into "crisis mode" 10 days ago, said Chu=
ck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive.=20
In a filing to the SEC, Enron revealed a previously undisclosed $690m note =
payment due this week, as well as that it had $9.15bn in debt due by the en=
d of next year. The news provoked another round of selling in Enron's alrea=
dy plunging share price, forcing Dynegy into 18-hour a day talks that ran t=
hrough the Thanksgiving weekend and up to midnight on Tuesday..
"That may have been the last straw to some shareholders," Mr Watson said ju=
st hours after withdrawing from Dynegy's $9bn merger with Enron. Enron had =
been the biggest energy trader in the US until a crisis of confidence, begi=
nning in October, that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy.=20
"Every time we thought we had the pieces," he said. "Every time we put the =
puzzle together it wasn't a clear strategy to go forward."=20
He said the talks resumed yesterday at 7am, but when the rating agencies be=
gan downgrading Enron to junk status, Mr Watson called Ken Lay, Enron's cha=
irman and chief executive, to say "it wasn't going to work".=20
"Once they downgraded the company, we thought, what was already an uphill b=
attle, was too difficult," he said. Mr Watson said he offered to help any w=
ay he could and the two men - who have long been friendly, cross-town rival=
s - parted amicably.=20
Mr Watson has received several calls from other counter-parties in the busi=
ness, thanking him for saving them from a meltdown by giving them the time =
to limit their exposure to Enron. "I don't feel like a saviour, I feel tire=
d," he said. But he acknowledged he provided a vast number of Enron's count=
erparties, partners and customers a chance to better protect themselves aga=
inst Enron's demise.=20
"There was a really strong effort to make it happen," he said. "In the end,=
 we couldn't find a solution that didn't risk Dynegy's responsibility to it=
s shareholders and to its employees."=20
He says the merger agreement allows it to walk away with Enron's most valua=
ble asset, the Northern Natural Gas pipeline, though if Enron disputes that=
, at worst, it would leave with money invested in saving Enron. "We are as =
solid as we were going into (the merger) and, maybe, better for the experie=
nce," he said.=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Financial system braces for a chain reac=
tion.

GARY SILVERMAN.=20
Enron's woes are raising risks for the financial system, threatening to set=
 off a chain reaction in the markets that could damage any number of partic=
ipants in unforeseen ways.
Individual banks could lose hundreds of millions of dollars apiece on loans=
 to Enron, but regulators are confident the lenders have sufficient capital=
 to weather such a storm.=20
The bigger worry is that Enron's difficulties could trigger ripple effects =
in much the same way as Russia's default in 1998 destabilised the Long-Term=
 Capital Management hedge fund.=20
Prices for banking stocks tumbled yesterday in New York and London, in larg=
e part because no one really knows what would happen if Enron were removed =
from the financial scene.=20
Enron sat on a massive trading book, made up of complex derivatives transac=
tions, some meant to stay in place for decades. On the other side were a ho=
st of counterparties, many of them energy companies that are not supervised=
 by banking regulators.=20
The counterparties, in turn, have their own set of borrowing and trading re=
lationships with banks that may be completely unaware of their customers' t=
ies to Enron. Bankers also fear that because so many of these counterpartie=
s were new to sophisticated trading, they may have been lax in collateralis=
ing their deals.=20
For leading banks, Enron's woes could result in big hits to profits. Just a=
bout every big lending bank has exposure to Enron, according to members of =
the bank group.=20
At a meeting of Enron's creditors last week, one banker estimated there cou=
ld have been 500 bankers representing 20 or more banks.=20
JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are the most prominent members of the bank gr=
oup, but Barclays, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Ba=
nk and many others are exposed.=20
It was understood that JP Morgan Chase's direct exposure to Enron approache=
s $900m, about $500m of it unsecured by the energy company's assets. Citigr=
oup's direct exposure could reach $800m, about half unsecured.=20
European banks also could take hits. According to data from Loanware, for e=
xample, WestLB, the German state-owned bank, has a $580m bridge facility ou=
tstanding. This was extended as trade financing last year and does not appe=
ar to have been syndicated.=20
However, analysts caution that determining the exposure of a particular ban=
k to Enron is virtually impossible for outsiders. Many loans are syndicated=
 or sold, and bankers are also making increasing use of credit derivatives =
that enable them to buy insurance against default from counterparties.=20
Barclays, for example, is one of the most active arrangers of finance for E=
nron but it has syndicated most of its initial exposure. Its exposure is es=
timated at less than #250m ( $356m). On the other hand, banks could be expo=
sed to firms that dealt with Enron, which sold credit default insurance to =
its trading partners, according to market participants.=20
Investors rerated banking stocks yesterday to account for expected exposure=
s. Citigroup was down $2.75, or 5.4 per cent, to $47.80, while JP Morgan wa=
s down $2.30, or 5.78 per cent, to $37.50. In London, shares in Barclays fe=
ll 4 per cent, or 86p, to 2093p. Additional reporting by Joshua Chaffin in =

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Traders avoid exposure to junk status fa=
llout.
By ADRIENNE ROBERTS and ANDREW TAYLOR.

Energy traders on both sides of the Atlantic were doing very little busines=
s with Enron even before credit rating agencies demoted the debt of the wor=
ld's biggest power trader to junk status.=20
Rivals have been anxiously calculating their potential exposure to an Enron=
 collapse for at least a month - since the true extent of the company's cri=
sis emerged.
Most traders before yesterday were only prepared to be buyers of electricit=
y and gas from the group, on the basis that it was better to owe than be ow=
ed in these circumstances.=20
"There would have been very few sellers to Enron," said one trader last nig=
ht.=20
The group accounts for about 25 per cent of energy trading in the US with a=
 similar market share in the smaller European market.=20
The loss of such a large player could cause liquidity problems in the US, s=
aid one analyst.=20
Europe-based energy groups, however, felt there was sufficient capacity in =
their market to fill the gap.=20
More worrying is the knock-on effect particularly on smaller companies shou=
ld Enron be unable to honour long-term contracts, said Brian Senior, direct=
or of trading and asset management at Innogy, the UK arm of the demerged Na=
tional Power.=20
The collapse of Enron's credit rating means that it may have to provide a l=
ot of cash as collateral to cover long-term liabilities, with money being d=
ue as early as next Monday, said Mr Senior.=20
Most large energy groups stopped trading with Enron in European markets two=
 days ago.=20
"The simplest thing is to pull the plug until they've figured out what's go=
ing on," said one analyst.=20
Martin Stanley, president of European energy trading for TXU, another large=
 US energy group, said: "We have halted trading with Enron. We are sorry to=
 see it happen because they are a very innovative company."=20
Even before yesterday's events, TXU, like other large traders, had been add=
ing up how much it could be owed and how much it would owe, should Enron fa=
il to honour its obligations.=20
"We have been looking at various scenarios and have implemented our credit =
event management process designed to minimise our cash exposure," said Mr S=
tanley.=20
"We are comfortable with our cash position," he added.=20

Negotiations over the fate of Enron, the US energy trading group, had been =

Enron's survival since its much smaller rival, Dynegy, launched a rescue bi=

co (which owns 26 per cent of Dynegy and backed the bid), Enron's lenders, =
its trading counterparties and the rating agencies. The logic of this pact =
was essentially circular.=20
When Dynegy stepped in three weeks ago Enron was in the early stages of its=
 crisis of confidence. Shareholders had been shocked by Enron's admission t=
hat it would have to shrink shareholders' funds by $1.2bn to end a transact=
ion with an off-balance-sheet vehicle established by Andrew Fastow, former =
chief financial officer. Suddenly, the lack of transparency they had been p=
repared to forgive while the shares rose was a liability.=20
Searching for a way to arrest the downward spiral, Ken Lay, Enron's chief e=
xecutive, linked up with Chuck Watson, his counterpart at Dynegy. Dynegy's =
all-stock bid - valuing Enron, on Tuesday's closing prices, at $9.4bn - was=
 dependent, however, on the rating agencies not downgrading the energy's gr=
oup's substantial debts to junk status.=20
Such a downgrade, as Enron explained in a regulatory filing last week, woul=
d require the group to repay, refinance or provide extra cash as collateral=
 for some $3.9bn of debts owed by off-balance-sheet trusts.=20
Under pressure from Enron and Dynegy's bankers, the agencies refrained from=
 downgrading the debt, and Dynegy went ahead with its bid. The agencies jus=
tified their position by citing the pending bid.=20
It was an uncomfortable position for the agencies, however, and their resol=
ve began to crumble last week as Dynegy and Enron talked about renegotiatin=
g the deal.=20
In a tersely worded note issued last Wednesday, Fitch, another rating agenc=
y, pointed out that if Dynegy "steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's=
 credit situation seems highly untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly po=
ssible".=20
Yesterday, S&P, then Moody's and Fitch, finally broke the fragile ring of c=
onfidence that was holding lenders, bidders and Enron itself together. In i=
ts note, S&P explained in stark terms how the virtuous circle of confidence=
 might now become a vicious downward spiral.=20
The collapse of Enron securities in capital markets made Dynegy less likely=
 to complete its takeover, S&P wrote. At the same time, Enron's franchise i=
n the energy markets had "sustained significant damage", making it a less a=
ttractive target.=20
If Enron does now disintegrate, the question is whether the chain reaction =
will extend beyond the Houston company and drag in other energy traders, or=
 even the banks that finance them. Analysts had already begun to liken its =
situation to that of Long-Term Capital Management, whose demise in 1998 pro=
mpted the Federal Reserve to co-ordinate a rescue by Wall Street banks to a=
void a financial crisis.=20
However, the head of one large commodities trader said the biggest market p=
articipants had had long enough to protect themselves from the collapse of =
Enron.=20
But smaller groups could be affected and the fear is that the complexities =
of its balance sheet may still contain the seeds of a wider crisis. Additio=

The collapse of Enron securities in capital markets made Dynegy less likely=

If Enron does now disintegrate, the question is whether the chain reaction =

situation to that of Long-Term Capital Management, whose demise in 1998 pro=

Collapse of Merger Pushes Enron to Brink of Ruin Energy: Bankruptcy filing =
is likely as stock value withers and bonds fall to 'junk' status.

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s lifeline merger deal collapsed Wednesday, and the=
 once-mighty energy trader slid toward all-but-certain bankruptcy.=20
Its Houston rival and neighbor Dynegy Inc. called off its planned takeover =
after Wall Street's major credit-rating agencies slashed Enron's bonds to "=
junk" status Wednesday morning.
Investors and Enron's trading partners had lost confidence well before the =
rating agencies did. In fact, it was the recent erosion of Enron's trading =
business and the harrowing slide in its stock and bond prices that forced t=
he ratings cut and triggered Dynegy's decision to back out of the deal.=20
Informed sources said Dynegy ultimately balked after coming across much mor=
e debt than it expected in evaluating Enron's finances and watching helples=
sly as the value of its would-be acquisition shrank dramatically when energ=
y customers fled the firm.=20
With the merger called off, Enron was "exploring other options to protect o=
ur core energy businesses," Kenneth L. Lay, the company's chairman and chie=
f executive, said in a brief statement that skirted the topic of bankruptcy=
.=20
The lack of a decent credit rating cripples Enron's ability to run its trad=
ing business, the franchise that made it one of America's most admired comp=
anies but also gave it a reputation for arrogance and greed, particularly f=
or its role in California's energy crisis.=20
Computer screens went dark nationwide Wednesday as the widely used EnronOnl=
ine Internet-based trading system shut down.=20
Enron's stock, already down 95% for the year, tumbled $3.50 to close at 61 =
cents on Wednesday in a trading stampede on the New York Stock Exchange. A =
one-day record of 339 million shares changed hands.=20
The whole company, once worth $63 billion, now is valued at less than $500 =
million, or about twice the cost of Enron's new headquarters under construc=
tion in downtown Houston.=20
Dynegy shares, meanwhile, sank $4.92 to $35.97, just below where they stood=
 when Dynegy agreed to acquire Enron on Nov. 9.=20
Dynegy exited the deal because it was "unwilling to risk our franchise, our=
 credit or our credibility," President Stephen Bergstrom said in a news con=
ference Wednesday.=20
"We know when to say no, and this morning we said no," he said.=20
Wall Street had been saying no for days, hammering Enron's stock to less th=
an half the $10.41 a share that Dynegy originally agreed to pay. Dynegy was=
 in the process of renegotiating its price downward when it finally threw i=
n the towel.=20
The deal's lack of credibility with stock and bond investors prompted the t=
op two rating agencies--Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service--to=
 cut their ratings on Enron, knowing that they probably were pronouncing a =
death sentence.=20
The ratings downgrade triggered clauses in Enron loan agreements that requi=
re the company to immediately pay its creditors some $3.9 billion--money th=
at it doesn't have, analysts said.=20
The ripples from Enron's collapse spread far and wide, even to the U.S. Tre=
asury market, where some investors fled for safety as Enron's bonds plunged=
 in value.=20
Enron led a trend in energy trading, creating an Internet-based network tha=
t allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity, natural gas,=
 oil and coal to do business with one another. The trades of contracts, oft=
en spanning many years at a fixed price range, are intended to protect majo=
r users and suppliers of energy from fluctuations in fuel prices.=20
Energy market experts are split on the long-term effects of Enron's collaps=
e. Some say the fallout will be slight, noting that rivals already have ste=
pped in to take over business with trading partners who were too nervous to=
 continue dealing with Enron.=20
"The whole industry should thank Dynegy for basically buying them two or th=
ree weeks' time to unwind their deals with Enron," said analyst Andre Meade=
 of Commerzbank Securities in New York.=20
But Enron was noted for the complexity of its long-term deals, and the effe=
cts of its withdrawal as a key player could be far-reaching and unexpected,=
 other analysts said.=20
Banking companies, dozens of which lent money to Enron, saw their shares di=
p on worries about whether those loans will be repaid. Shares of rival ener=
gy companies, too, lost value.=20
Enron's chief lenders--Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.--each hav=
e about $800 million in loans that may be at risk in a bankruptcy, said Ric=
hard Strauss, a bank analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co. Some of those loans =
are secured by Enron assets, with an unsecured portion of about $270 millio=
n for each bank, Strauss said.=20
Thousands of Enron employees around the country have had their retirement n=
est eggs decimated.=20
They and other investors have filed a brace of lawsuits alleging that Enron=
 misled them about its financial condition, inducing them to buy stock that=
 company executives knew was overvalued.=20
Then-Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling cashed in $62 million worth of sto=
ck and options last year, when the stock was near an all-time peak. His bos=
s and mentor, Lay, took stock and options gains of $123 million last year, =
according to SEC filings.=20
In August, in one of the first outward signs of Enron's troubles, Skilling =
abruptly resigned, citing unspecified personal reasons.=20
Last month, a series of revelations began surfacing about its dealings with=
 partnerships set up and run by Enron officers.=20
Analysts say the deals, now under investigation by the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission, appear to have been orchestrated in part to hide the size o=
f Enron's vast debt and to artificially pump up its reported profit.=20
Enron was forced to restate its earnings, admitting that it had over-report=
ed profit by more than $580 million since 1997. Its previous financial stat=
ements, it said in a humiliating admission, "should not be relied upon."=20
Those statements were examined and certified by the accounting firm Arthur =
Andersen, one of the industry leaders, itself now named in lawsuits by aggr=
ieved Enron shareholders.=20
Meade said Enron's biggest problem may have been that it began to believe i=
n its own bulletproof reputation.=20
"The core business--energy trading and marketing--produced a lot of cash, a=
nd Enron took that cash and basically squandered it on a lot of investments=
 that didn't pan out," Meade said, referring to a troubled power generation=
 project in India and Enron's failed attempts to become a trading powerhous=
e in water and in broadband communications capacity.=20
Losses on those ventures left the company awash in debt and vulnerable to t=
he credit crunch of recent weeks, when lenders and trading partners suddenl=
y demanded cash, and Enron couldn't pay.=20
In California, Enron and Dynegy were among the big, mostly out-of-state ene=
rgy companies vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and others as "gougers" and "pira=
tes" that manipulated the market and overcharged for electricity.=20
Enron tried to influence California's electricity deregulation when utility=
 regulators began talking in the early 1990s about opening the power indust=
ry to competition.=20
The company's lobbyists pushed for a secretive market in which power custom=
ers could sign direct deals with energy companies. Instead, the California =
Public Utilities Commission and Legislature designed an open market in whic=
h the hourly price of electricity could be seen by all buyers and sellers a=
nd the state's utilities were required to buy nearly all of their power day=
 to day in that spot market.=20
Enron executives have blamed that structure for the demise of California's =
deregulation experiment , saying it foolishly prevented utilities from sign=
ing long-term contracts that would have buffered them from market price spi=
kes.=20
But Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) argues that a bigger factor in the disast=
rous unraveling of the California electricity market was the influence of E=
nron on federal watchdogs.=20
Peace, who fine-tuned California's deregulation plan as chairman of a joint=
 legislative committee, argues that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n acted too late to curb alleged market manipulation and price gouging. FER=
C held off, he said, because of the influence of free marketers such as Enr=
on CEO Lay, a longtime confidant of and political contributor to President =
Bush.=20
"It should be apparent to all observers that the kind of market Ken Lay pro=
moted operated under the same principles that his company operated under. I=
t's a kind of anarchic capitalism, in which there are no rules and no refer=
ees," Peace said.=20

Enron Failure's Ripple Effects Analysis: Observers say consequences could b=

HOUSTON -- The likely bankruptcy of Enron Corp. could lead to a host of tro=
ubling consequences, including higher wholesale prices for electricity and =
natural gas and financial distress for banks and other firms as well as maj=
or bondholders and other investors, analysts said Wednesday.=20
However, energy trading markets were calm as Enron competitors picked up th=
e slack while looking for opportunities to build or expand their own tradin=
g operations and acquire Enron assets.
The concerns and maneuvering came as Dynegy Inc. on Wednesday canceled its =
proposed acquisition of Enron, once the world's largest energy trading comp=
any, after Enron's debts were downgraded to non-investment "junk" status, m=
aking a bankruptcy filing highly likely.=20
"Banks are starting to worry about a financial meltdown from an Enron colla=
pse," said Peter Fusaro, president of Global Change, a risk management cons=
ultancy in New York.=20
Enron's debts, which had been partly hidden in off-balance-sheet partnershi=
ps, could total $5 billion more than the company's assets, experts in New Y=
ork and Houston estimated.=20
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, major commercial bankers to Enron, will fa=
ce losses if Enron files for bankruptcy, analysts said. Shares of Citigroup=
 and Morgan declined more than 5% on Wednesday. Other experts warned that i=
nvestment banking firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that had b=
een part of Enron's sophisticated trading network also could run into probl=
ems.=20
As Enron, which rose rapidly in recent years to almost $200 billion in annu=
al revenue, neared bankruptcy, shareholders faced being wiped out and inves=
tors in about $9billion in Enron bonds may get only cents on the dollar, an=
alysts said.=20
Enron's employees, 15,000 of whom hold Enron stock in their 401(k) retireme=
nt plans, stood to be among the biggest losers in the company's collapse. M=
any probably also will lose their jobs.=20
Major lawsuits against Enron claiming lack of loyalty and prudence in deali=
ng with its employees are among scores of lawsuits now confronting the comp=
any and Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that approved Enron's financia=
l statements. Enron is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission for its handling of disclosure of the partnerships and subsidiari=
es.=20
And yet as Enron's crisis approached a possible bankruptcy filing, a brisk =
optimism prevailed among energy traders. Enron competitors were as enthusia=
stic about opportunities to buy parts of Enron as they were fearful of the =
consequences of the big trader's collapse.=20
Stephen Baum, chief executive of Sempra Energy, the San Diego-based utility=
 holding company, said EnronOnline, the Houston company's highly successful=
 Internet-based trading operation, would be acquired by other companies and=
 carry on energy trading in the future.=20
Sempra itself would be interested in discussing formation of such a new onl=
ine trading firm, Baum said, "although its name would not be Enron Online."=
=20
Baum added that Sempra could be interested in acquiring several Enron asset=
s, in the U.S. and abroad.=20
Energy markets were calm Wednesday. Kevin Fox, manager of commodities and t=
rading for Aquila Energy, a Kansas City, Mo.-based energy trader, described=
 markets as "surprisingly orderly."=20
Enron's troubles have been building for well over a month, Fox explained, a=
nd so the halt of Enron Online came as no surprise. Fox saw no difficulty i=
n his firm and other trading companies fulfilling Enron's contracts should =
the energy company cease to operate.=20
Still, others saw disrupted markets and price volatility. Fears about the a=
ftermath of Enron's collapse centered on long-term commitments the firm has=
 made in recent years to handle all the energy needs of giant entities such=
 as the University of California system or to supply 10 years of natural ga=
s at a fixed price range to an electricity generating station.=20
Problems could arise because long-term contracts typically become encrusted=
 with related transactions that hedge against price movements over time or =
the interest cost of financing. Such complexity could make it difficult for=
 other firms to pick up Enron's long-term contracts.=20
If Enron in bankruptcy "can't cover its obligations, maybe other wholesaler=
s can't either," said Gordon Allott, vice president at KW International, a =
trading and risk management firm in San Francisco.=20
"And then you have customers going out into the spot market, which could dr=
ive prices higher. That's the big bogey monster out there," Allott said.=20
However, any effect on consumers from such disruptions could be slight. Ger=
ald Keenan, head of the energy practice at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, noted th=
at Enron's collapse would not "affect the basic supply and demand for elect=
ricity and natural gas," the true determinant of prices.=20
One major factor reducing the effect of an Enron collapse on markets and en=
ergy supplies is the growth in recent years of energy trading into a broad =
industry, with more than $300 billion in annual activity in contracts for e=
lectricity and the natural gas and oil fuels that produce it.=20
The Intercontinental Exchange, a consortium of six trading firms, handles m=
ore energy trades today than did Enron.=20
If Sempra and other companies acquire and operate EnronOnline, the industry=
 will have two major groups to rely on. The need for energy trading has bee=
n growing out of deregulation and change in the electric utility industry.=
=20
"Trading absorbs risks of fuel-price movements and the like that used to be=
 passed on to retail customers in the form of adjustments to monthly bills,=
" Fox explained.=20
The breadth and expertise of this new industry, as well as the months of En=
ron's decline that gave competitors and markets time to adjust, could promi=
se a relatively stable aftermath of Enron's downfall.=20
However, the post-Enron future is likely to see closer regulation of energy=
 contract trading to increase disclosure of terms and risks.=20
But Enron and its top executives, along with the Arthur Andersen accounting=
 firm, face months and possibly years of lawsuits from shareholders who suf=
fered losses as Enron's stock lost more than $60 billion of market value in=
 a single year.=20
And lawsuits by Enron employees, challenging the firm's treatment of 401(k)=
 accounts, will go forward even if Enron is in bankruptcy, said attorney Ly=
nn Sarko of Keller Rohrback, a Seattle law firm that is bringing one of the=
 suits on behalf of employees.=20
"There is still liability faced by fiduciaries, officials who were administ=
rators of the savings plan and by the companies that insured it," Sarko sai=
d.=20

Stocks tumbled Wednesday amid investors' nagging uncertainty about the econ=
omy and as energy giant Enron headed toward financial collapse. Meanwhile, =
Treasury bond yields were little changed. After sliding early in the sessio=
n, they rebounded after the government got a tepid reception for a record s=
ale of two-year notes.=20
On Wall Street, the Dow industrials slid 160.74 points, or 1.6%, to 9,711.8=
6. The market was in a steady decline most of the session.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite suffered a 2.5% decline, off 48 points =
to 1,887.97.=20
Losers topped winners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and on=
 Nasdaq.=20
Early in the week the market seemed poised to retake the 10,000 level on th=
e Dow and the 2,000 level on the Nasdaq index. Instead, sellers have gained=
 the upper hand.=20
Analysts noted that many investors aren't convinced the economy will improv=
e in the first half of 2002. For weeks, hopes that business will improve ea=
rly next year have been boosting the market.=20
"We're not out of the woods yet" with the economy, said Richard Jandrainof =
Banc One Investment Advisors Corp.=20
The Federal Reserve's latest report on conditions by region, released Wedne=
sday, painted a generally somber picture of the economy.=20
Still, many analysts said stocks' sell-off this week doesn't appear to be a=
nything special.=20
"The reality is, we were due for some pullback," said Barry Hyman, chief in=
vestment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.=20
Hyman and other analysts were actually pleased to see investors take a caut=
ious step back after fearing that the market was rising too much and too qu=
ickly.=20
The market's softness was spread across most sectors, but one of the weakes=
t spots was utilities, which dropped after Dynegy backed out of its planned=
 merger with Enron.=20
NYSE-listed Enron broke the record for heaviest trading in a single day wit=
h more than 339 million shares changing hands, as it fell $3.50 to 61 cents=
. The previous volume record was the 304 million shares of Intel traded on =
Nasdaq on Sept. 22, 2000.=20
Investors were selling most utility stocks Wednesday. The Dow utilities ave=
rage fell 2.9% to a 52-week low of 279.95.=20
Financial stocks were slammed on worries about spillover from an Enron coll=
apse. J.P. Morgan Chase sank $2.30 to $37.50, and Citigroup dropped $2.75 t=
o $47.80. Both are in the Dow.=20
Retailing issues remained vulnerable to concerns that this holiday shopping=
 season will be the worst in a decade. Gap stumbled 79 cents to $13.61 afte=
r Prudential Securities reduced its rating on the clothier to "sell" from "=

y fell $1.18 to $69.90, and Bed, Bath & Beyond declined 74 cents to $32.34.=
=20
Technology also was weaker as investors fear there is still too much invent=
ory and not enough demand. Chip equipment maker Altera fell $1.83 to $21.83=
 ahead of its update on business in the fourth quarter. After the market cl=

Enron on edge of collapse=20
Stock value plunges as Dynegy bails out; bankruptcy expected=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
After Dynegy pulled out of its deal to buy Enron Corp. Wednesday morning, i=
t appeared the most likely option for Enron was bankruptcy protection.=20
From Wall Street to Houston, it was widely expected Enron would file for ba=
nkruptcy, perhaps as soon as today.=20
"It's probably imminent," said Andre Meade, a stock analyst with Commerzban=
k Securities in New York.=20
Jeff McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, said Wednesday night that En=
ron was evaluating all its options for restructuring its balance sheet and =
debt, and ways to return its business to health.=20
McMahon said Enron wasn't considering a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which =
would involve a liquidation or selling of all assets.=20
He didn't rule out a Chapter 11 filing, which lets a company protect assets=
 while it works out a reorganization plan, but he stressed that Enron was a=
lso reviewing other options.=20
He declined to describe what the options are, but said he prefers to fix En=
ron without a bankruptcy.=20
Earlier Wednesday, Enron said it had suspended making payments other than t=
hose needed to maintain core business operations and it was working to reta=
in employees needed for its trading and other core energy businesses. No la=
yoffs were announced.=20
Wall Street doesn't believe Enron has real choices other than bankruptcy. S=
hares in Enron lost much of their value Wednesday, closing at 61 cents. The=
 company, which was dropped from the Standard & Poor's 500 index, also brok=
e the record for most shares traded in a day.=20
Before Oct. 16, a buyout by Dynegy, let alone a bankruptcy, were unthinkabl=
e for Houston's largest company and the world's largest energy trader. But =
that day, Enron disclosed millions in financial losses related to investmen=
t partnerships it did business with and were run by Enron's since-ousted ch=
ief financial officer.=20
In the days and weeks that followed, the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 started investigating Enron, a stack of shareholder and employee lawsuits =
were filed, Enron restated earnings and made disclosures about its balance =
sheet that Wall Street found troubling.=20
Dynegy swooped in to rescue Enron when the two companies agreed to a merger=
 deal Nov. 9. But continuing bad news surrounding Enron put pressure on tha=
t deal.=20
Until Wednesday morning, it appeared Enron and Dynegy would find a way to r=
escue the merger by revamping its terms.=20
After several days of talks among the companies, bankers and others, Chuck =
Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview he conc=
luded a solution wasn't reachable.=20
The final confirmation for Watson was when Standard & Poor's Wednesday morn=
ing cut Enron's credit rating to so-called junk status, effectively halting=
 Enron's ability to run its core business of energy trading and marketing, =
which is dependent on access to cash and credit. That trading franchise was=
 a key reason for Dynegy's interest in Enron.=20
S&P said in its rating report that it cut Enron's credit rating because it =
didn't believe the merger, which wasn't expected to close for six to nine m=
onths, would go through.=20
When the companies inked the deal on Nov. 9, Watson said he expected no mor=
e surprises about Enron's financial state. But the deal included escape cla=
uses just in case.=20
Among reasons Dynegy cited for ending the merger were "breaches of represen=
tations" by Enron. It also invoked an escape provision that let Dynegy to w=
alk away if Enron had a "material adverse change" in its business.=20
"We have never been willing to risk our franchise, our credit or our credib=
ility," Watson said. "We knew when to say no and this morning we said no."=
=20
Since Nov. 9, Enron made new financial disclosures and saw significant drop=
s in its stock price and trading business. All of that caused Dynegy to see=
k new terms for the merger agreement, including a lower price, cash infusio=
ns to stabilize Enron and a restructuring of Enron's debt repayment schedul=
e.=20
Watson traced the beginning of the end to Nov. 19, the day Enron filed its =
10Q with securities regulators. Companies must file their 10Q every quarter=
 with details of their earnings and balance sheet with the SEC.=20
Dynegy was hit by surprise when Enron disclosed it would have to pay off a =
specific debt obligation worth $690 million almost immediately and when it =
saw that Enron's cash situation wasn't what it expected, Watson said.=20
Those disclosures, he said, caused Enron's trading business, which had some=
what of an uptick after the merger announcement, to go "down again and down=
 again."=20
"That was sort of a blow that we never really recovered from," Watson said.=
=20
Watson said he worked hard to rescue the deal, but would only go for a "glo=
bal solution" that would take care of all the problems. For one, he said, E=
nron needed another $1 billion-$3 billion infusion to keep going.=20
Sources told the Chronicle that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup were =
willing to kick in $500 million or more. Watson said he "absolutely" tried =
to raise more money but couldn't find willing parties.=20
He also said he didn't get the definitive agreements he needed from the rel=
evant parties on restructuring Enron's massive debt load.=20
However, sources familiar with the situation said every time Enron and Dyne=
gy were close to a deal, Dynegy changed the terms.=20
One source said that while Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive of=
ficer, was present at a lot of the negotiating meetings, Watson wasn't.=20
Another source said at one point on Monday, Lay was taxiing on a plane to l=
eave New York after signing a term sheet faxed to him by Dynegy. But before=
 the plane took off, he was called back with the news a deal hadn't been re=
ached.=20
"I think it is fair to say we thought several times over the past weekend a=
nd early this week, we thought we had renegotiated the deal," said McMahon,=
 Enron's chief financial officer.=20
"The goal post seemed to keep moving on us," he said.=20
With Dynegy out of the picture, Enron's ability to run its core business of=
 energy trading and marketing is close to zero after three rating agencies =
Wednesday cut Enron's credit status to so-called junk.=20
Other traders aren't interested in doing business with a company that has a=
 junk credit rating. Enron shut down its EnronOnline trading platform Wedne=
sday.=20
The credit downgrades also make due almost immediately repayment of about $=
3.9 billion Enron owes in certain obligations. The company, which already f=
aces billions in near-term debt obligations, can ill afford the extra bill.=
=20
Enron employees worried Wednesday about what kind, if any severance package=
s, they might get, the possibility of mass layoffs and a bankruptcy filing.=
=20
Little work got done as employees spent the day riveted to their computer s=
creens watching Enron's stock price tumble and their hopes of a bailout cru=
mble.=20
Several employees had loaded up boxes of their personal belongings.=20
"I'm just preparing," said one financial analyst, who was carrying a box of=
 personal finance books and notebooks out of the building.=20
The outlook for Dynegy was much better even though its stock also took a hi=
t Wednesday. It closed down $4.92 cents at $35.97.=20
Dynegy is expected to gain business that would have gone to Enron and could=

Enron trading screens go blank; other firms reassuring investors=20
Another jolt=20
By MICHAEL DAVIS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Shortly after Enron Corp.'s bond ratings were cut to junk status Wednesday,=
 energy trader Charlie Sanchez watched the company's trading business simpl=
y vanish from his computer screen.=20
"I watched their different markets just peel off my screen, one by one," sa=
id Sanchez, energy markets manager at Gelber & Associates in Houston.=20
Although Enron's troubles were well-known, the collapse of Enron's trading =
business Wednesday still jolted traders. Sanchez just said, "I'm in shock."=
=20
The downgrade of Enron's debt was the first domino to fall Wednesday, follo=
wed by the shutdown of Enron's online trading business and then the announc=
ement that Dynegy had called off its deal to buy Enron.=20
EnronOnline, the company's Internet commodity trading platform, went down e=
arly Wednesday, signaling that the company had temporarily halted trading a=
ltogether. EnronOnline handles about 60 percent of the company's trading bu=
siness, or about $2.8 billion a day in deals.=20
Enron's Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said he didn't know when Enron=
Online would be up for trading again. However, the company continues to do =
telephone transactions, he said.=20
The commodities markets appeared to weather the event. But the shutdown of =
the company that was by far the biggest player in the market led other comp=
anies that regularly dealt with Enron to hastily issue statements assuring =
investors they were not going to be dragged down as well.=20
With EnronOnline down, many traders had to revert to calling around to nume=
rous sources to find out what the market was doing rather than simply loggi=
ng onto EnronOnline and clicking on a single tab to size up the market wher=
e they wanted to trade.=20
But as far as the overall impact on commodities markets and the New York Me=
rcantile Exchange, the loss of Enron's trading business for whatever period=
 likely will not be that big, said Kyle Cooper, oil analyst with Salomon Sm=
ith Barney in Houston.=20
"It could widen the bid-ask spreads in a few places, but in terms of liquid=
ity on the Nymex, you're talking about a few thousand contracts out of 60,0=
00 to 70,000 contracts in all," Cooper said.=20
One trader described Enron as "a needle in a haystack in terms of the total=
 long-term capital markets."=20
Nonetheless, the shutdown prompted a call for closer monitoring during a br=
iefing at the White House.=20
U.S. Treasury department officials kept a close eye on the credit and energ=
y markets Wednesday but discerned no upheavals from the troubles at Enron.=
=20
"We are monitoring credit markets as we do every day" Treasury spokeswoman =
Michele Davis said. "We haven't seen anything extraordinary."=20
The exit of Enron will lead to a change in the balance of power in the trad=
ing business. Traders said companies that likely will benefit from the loss=
 of Enron's trading activities include El Paso Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant=
 Energy and Duke Energy.=20
The market appeared more worried about possible losses connected with Enron=
.=20
El Paso Corp.'s stock took a beating Wednesday -- down $3.59 to close at $4=
4.91 -- over concerns that it had too much exposure to Enron through its tr=
ading business. The company issued a statement saying it had "systematicall=
y reduced its trading with Enron" over the past few weeks.=20
"Due to Enron's loss of investment grade status, any new business will have=
 to be supported by cash collateral. El Paso foresees no material disruptio=
ns in the energy trading markets resulting from today's downgrades or the p=
otential of an Enron bankruptcy filing," according to the company's stateme=
nt.=20
El Paso's natural gas and power trading exposure to Enron is about $50 mill=
ion, the company said, adding that it does not expect any adverse earnings =
impact from Enron's difficulties.=20
Atlanta-based Mirant said its exposure to Enron is $50 million to $60 milli=
on, noting that it too had begun limiting its exposure risk early in what i=
t described as "the Enron crisis."=20
Calpine Corp. said it had no "net exposure" to Enron, which means that what=
 Enron owes Calpine for gas and electric trading is offset by Calpine's lia=
bilities to Enron.=20
Enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading partners lost confid=
ence the company would have the cash to pay bills. As a result, they were e=
ither demanding more collateral to ensure it delivered on trades or restric=
ting dealings with the Houston-based company.=20
"Each company is going to have to evaluate what their situation is from pro=
ducers to utilities, it's going to be a case-by-case situation. It's going =
to take a long time to figure it all out," said one trader who asked not to=
 be quoted by name.=20
Shortly after the news of the company's latest problems broke, a flood of h=
uge trading orders came out of Enron, leading traders to speculate that the=
 company was scrambling to clear its accounts before filing for Chapter 11 =
bankruptcy protection.=20
A typical order from the company would be for 100 contracts in a single lot=
 to buy or sell commodities such as natural gas. After the debt downgrade w=
as announced, single orders for 1,000 to 2,000 contracts began coming from =
the company.=20
The flood of large orders out of Enron caused the near-month futures contra=
ct on the New York Mercantile Exchange to spike up and then fall off just a=
s quickly in late morning trading.=20
"They could not leave this exposure to the whims of the market," one trader=
 said. "They needed to get out."=20
Enron reportedly has been working over the past few weeks to line up altern=
ate parties to hand off their thousands of contracts the company handles da=
ily, many of which are for long term periods such as 10 to 15 years.=20
But some of the more obscure contracts on items such as emissions credits a=
nd weather derivatives may be more difficult to unload. In addition to natu=
ral gas, power and oil, Enron trades such items as broadband, paper, metals=
 and water.=20
"I really think that a lot of the kinds of stuff that is foreign and esoter=
ic that Enron has been making a market in will take a while for others to p=
ick up," Sanchez said.=20

Bankruptcy filing by Enron could be largest ever=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
If Enron files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week, as many observers expec=
t it will, it may be the largest such event to date.=20
With $61.7 billion in assets on its books as of Sept. 30, the deal would to=
p Texaco's 1987 bankruptcy, which sought protection for a company with $35.=
9 billion in assets. It would also beat the 1988 bankruptcy of Financial Co=
rporation of America, which had $33.9 billion in assets.=20
The value of the assets and liabilities on Enron's books continues to be a =
moving target, however. While Enron's unaudited quarterly financial report =
indicates $61.7 billion in assets, $27 billion in liabilities, $6.5 billion=
 in long-term debt and $15.3 billion in deferred credits, the turmoil of th=
e past month has changed much of that.=20
On the asset side, for example, the company says properties like its natura=
l gas transmission lines, fiber optic network and electric generation facil=
ities are worth close to $14.6 billion. Much of the gas pipeline properties=
 have been encumbered in recent weeks, however, by the company's efforts to=
 raise additional cash and credit from banks.=20
And the likelihood the company could find buyers to pay its asking price fo=
r assets like the fiber optic network or overseas power plants is highly un=
likely, said Ralph Pellechia, a credit analyst with rating agency Fitch.=20
"It's really a buyer's market, not a seller's market," Pellechia said. "It'=
s anticipated a lot of their assets, particularly their international asset=
s, would go for a lot less than the initial investment in them."=20
The company also counts $7.1 billion in investments and advances to "uncons=
olidated affiliates" as assets, which could include Enron equity that was u=
sed to back some of the complicated off-balance-sheet financing partnership=
s that led to the company's current woes. Given the constant surprises surr=
ounding those partnerships and the company's steeply dropping stock price -=
- now worth less than a cup of coffee -- that $7.1 billion figure is also s=
uspect.=20
Several unexpected debt obligations related to the partnerships Enron opera=
ted have also changed the tally since Sept. 30. Analysts say debts for the =
company range between $13 billion and $17 billion, including another $3.9 b=
illion in debt repayments related to two special partnerships, Osprey Trust=
 and Marlin Water Trust, that will come due more quickly than expected foll=
owing the credit rating agency downgrades on Wednesday.=20
"All these changes are making the situation like sand falling between their=
 fingers," said Bill Porter, chairman of Houston law firm Porter & Hedges. =
"The only alternative left to them to stabilize their situation is bankrupt=
cy protection."=20
Company officials say they're still reviewing options, but on Wednesday sai=
d they are temporarily suspending all payments to creditors other than thos=
e needed to maintain core energy trading operations.=20
"With Dynegy's termination of the merger and the ratings agency downgrades,=
 we are evaluating and exploring other options to protect our core energy b=
usinesses," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement.=20
Sources familiar with the broken Enron-Dynegy deal said the paperwork for a=
 bankruptcy filing has been in the works for weeks, and even preceded the N=
ov. 9 merger announcement. They say if the preliminary deal had not been se=
cured that day, Enron would have had to file for bankruptcy the following M=
onday.=20
Recent efforts by Enron's bankers, including J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigrou=
p, to get creditors to hold off on demanding payments may mean the pending =
bankruptcy filing will be what is known as a prepackaged deal.=20
In a prepackaged bankruptcy, creditors agree beforehand how the sale of the=
 company's assets would be divided among them. It would save all parties un=
told millions in legal fees that would be spent fighting over the company w=
hile assuring at least some recovery of their investments.=20
Prepackaged bankruptcies are common, said Jay Westbrook, a professor at the=
 University of Texas School of Law, because they allow companies to buy par=
ts of the faltering business they want without the hassles of long, drawn-o=
ut legal battles.=20
"The purchasers will essentially just pay their money and walk away, with t=
he proceeds getting divided up among those holding claims," Westbrook said.=
=20
Chapter 11 bankruptcy has the added benefit of freezing the many lawsuits t=
hat have been filed by angry shareholders. Those lawsuits would eventually =
be handled by the bankruptcy court, including determination of the validity=
 of the claims in the suits.=20
If Enron's bankruptcy is not prepackaged, it's almost assured that the valu=
e of Enron's remaining businesses, such as its energy trading, will disappe=
ar, said Bob Chapman, a principle with Houston management consulting firm K=
ing, Chapman & Broussard.=20
"The only guys that do well in bankruptcies are the lawyers," Chapman said.=
 "What you usually see is a long period of people trying to carve up the be=
ast where what remains of the business will continue to atrophy."=20
Because the company will most likely look to simply liquidate its assets, w=
hat would at first be a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing could later be convert=
ed to a Chapter 7 filing, where a court-appointed trustee overseas liquidat=
ion of the remaining assets.=20
"From our perspective, a lot of the future rests in the hands of the banks,=
" said Fitch analyst Glen Grabelsky. "What their intentions are in granting=
 forbearance, what kind of liquidity they're willing to extend to Enron, on=
ly they can answer."=20

Ballpark Place project stopped dead in tracks=20
By RALPH BIVINS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Construction of the Ballpark Place tower has been postponed, partly because=
 of the uncertainty surrounding Enron Corp., the project's developer announ=
ced Wednesday.=20
Trammell Crow Co. had anticipated breaking ground this week on the 34-story=
 tower across from Enron Field, said Matt Khourie, who heads Trammell Crow =
operations in Houston.=20
Ballpark Place was planned for a parcel of land owned by the developer, bou=
nded by Preston, Prairie, Crawford and La Branch streets.=20
The $108 million Ballpark Place was expected to be a dominant skyline featu=
re, rising over left field at Enron's namesake stadium.=20
Ballpark Place would have included 253,000 square feet of office space, 216=
 apartment units, ground-level retail space and several levels of covered p=
arking.=20
Questions surrounding the future of Enron Corp., a major employer in downto=
wn, was key in encouraging Trammell Crow to shelve its plans, Khourie said.=
=20
Enron has about 3 million square feet of downtown office space, including a=
 40-story building under construction. As Enron's need for space decreases,=
 the downtown office market is sure to feel the aftershocks.=20
"Given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated wit=
h the future availability of Class-A space springing from the recent events=
 at Enron, we have decided to delay our construction start until the future=
 visibility improves," Khourie said in a written statement.=20
It has been widely speculated that Dynegy, another Houston energy firm, wou=
ld move into the new Enron building.=20
But Dynegy's plans to buy Enron fell apart Wednesday, leaving questions abo=
ut the the new 1.2 million-square-foot tower.=20
Trammell Crow has not abandoned its plans for Ballpark Place.=20
Khourie said the company intends to start construction, perhaps next year, =
after the economy improves.=20
"We are still very bullish on the project's residential/office mixed-use co=
ncept for our unique location and also are optimistic on the mid- and long-=
term prospects for Houston's Central Business District," Khourie said.=20
"The decision to delay relates directly to the short-term environment that =
we are currently facing."=20
