WRAP: Dynegy Terminates Troubled Merger Pact With Enron

11/28/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) terminated its troubled merger agre=
ement with Enron Corp. (ENE), backing away from the deal despite frantic la=
st-minute attempts by both sides to save it.=20
Dynegy Wednesday cited Enron's breaches of representations, warranties, con=
venants and agreements, including the material adverse change provision.
The announcement came after Standard & Poor's cut the beleaguered energy tr=
ader's debt rating to B-minus, essentially rendering it to junk status.=20
The downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that=
 Enron will be forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federa=
l bankruptcy code. That could be a fatal blow for Enron, which needs huge s=
ums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive.=20
Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term rating on Enron to B-minus from tri=
ple-B-minus, citing fears that Dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase o=
f Enron.=20
The collapse of the Dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on Enron=
's credit profile because of Enron's limited access to capital at a time wh=
en extensive debt restructuring is necessary, S&P said.=20
"While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, =
this doesn't reflect a failure for the energy merchant business," Dynegy sa=
id in announcing its decision.=20
However, Dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are so=
lid, and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added v=
olatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of Enron=
.=20
In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down=
 $2.91, or 71%, to $1.20. Dynegy, meanwhile, was down $4.08, or 10%, at $36=
.81, also on the Big Board.=20
Top executives of Enron and Dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine t=
he two energy-trading companies amid growing signs that Enron faced cash-fl=
ow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business.=
=20
Talks between Enron and Dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the=
 price of the all-stock transaction after Enron's share price had plummeted=
 in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn't be as high as=
 originally anticipated. Last month Dynegy agreed to buy Enron after the em=
ergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed E=
nron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its =
shareholders. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange =
Commission investigation.=20
Citing a person familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal said W=
ednesday that Enron's board late Tuesday had informally agreed to a new sha=
re-exchange ratio of 0.12 shares of Dynegy for each Enron share tendered, d=
own more than 50% from the original offer of 0.2685 Dynegy share for each E=
nron share.=20
That latest proposed share-exchange ratio valued Enron at $4.91 a share, or=
 a total of $4.17 billion. That would compare with the original value of $1=
0.98 a share, or $9.33 billion. In exchange for reducing the purchase price=
, some members of the Enron team were insisting on more control over the me=
rged company. Dynegy also was considering an additional $250 million cash i=
nvestment in Enron. Dynegy, together with ChevronTexaco Inc. (CVX), has alr=
eady injected $1.5 billion into Enron in an effort to stabilize the company=
.=20
While struggling to keep the planned merger alive, Enron also has been seek=
ing to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings. Enron has a tot=
al of about $13 billion of debt, of which about $9 billion comes due by the=
 end of next year. Last month Enron said in a filing with the SEC that a cu=
t in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit =
rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain lev=
els - would trigger the need to repay, refinance or cash collateralize faci=
lities totaling $3.9 billion.=20
Dynegy said Wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of Enron=
 natural gas pipeline unit Northern Natural, Omaha, Neb., and said it has e=
xercised its right to acquire the unit's common shares.=20
ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, contributed $1.5 billion to the pr=
oposed Enron merger, and Dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline uni=
t.=20
Northern Natural, which owns and operates 16,500 miles of interstate natura=
l gas pipeline spanning from the Permian Basin of Texas to the Great Lakes,=
 has historically been a strong earnings contributor.=20
Dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to Dynegy's own energy del=
ivery network.

Enron's Fall To Spark Volatility On Pwr, Natural Gas Mkts

11/28/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- The potential demise of energy marketing giant Enron =
Corp. spells a drop in liquidity and increased volatility in electricity an=
d natural gas markets across North America, analysts said Wednesday.=20
"There will be an impact on liquidity here in Canada and everywhere because=
 Enron accounted for such a huge volume of trades," Denis Lawrence, with Fi=
rstEnergy Capital Corp. said from Calgary.
"Over time, the volumes will come back but it will take some time, in the o=
rder of months," he predicted.=20
Stress levels in traders across the country vaulted with the news Wednesday=
 Dynegy Inc. backed out of a proposed US$4.17-billion merger with the belea=
guered Enron, citing the energy trader's breach of representations, warrant=
ies, convenants and agreements.=20
The move came on the back of Standard and Poor's downgrading Enron to junk =
bond status Tuesday. Enron now faces filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy prote=
ction.=20
"This is totally bad for everyone," an East Coast trader said. "Anyone who =
has positions with Enron is screwed, and little companies that put all of t=
heir production with Enron could go under, too," the trader added.=20
Enron confirmed Wednesday in a press release it has temporarily suspended a=
ll payments other than those necessary to maintain core operations.=20
Companies heavily invested in Enron face the possibility of becoming credit=
 risks themselves and being shunned by other marketing and trading entities=
, further reducing liquidity on natural gas and power markets.=20
Energy majors like Aquila Inc. and Mirant had said at the beginning of Enro=
n's troubleds that they were sticking by the corporation to keep the market=
place from floundering. Representatives were not available for comments.=20
Just hours before Enron's lifeline was pulled, the Houston-based company sh=
ut down its electronic trading platform which accounted for a quarter of No=
rth America's natural gas and electricity trades.=20
The blank EnronOnline screen represents a loss of price discovery that is n=
ot covered by alternative trading vehicles such as Atlanta-based Interconti=
nentalExchange, or ICE, an electronic over-the-counter commodity exchange.=
=20
"People are used to trading at a click of the mouse," one West Coast trader=
 said. "EnronOnLine always showed two-way trades, but ICE doesn't always sh=
ow bid/offers because it just doesn't have the volumes."=20
Power traders in Alberta have a bit of an edge over other regions because o=
f Alberta Watt Exchange, or Watt-Ex, has been supporting liquidity in the m=
arket.=20
Watt-Ex, an independent on-line exchange for trading forward and real-time =
contracts, gained more volumes last month after recruiting Dynegy Canada In=
c. to maintain bids and offers on forward contracts traded on its system.=
=20
And volumes on ICE have picked up substantially since Monday, other traders=
 said, giving credence to a more optimistic picture one analyst painted.=20
"Other companies will rise up and swallow Enron's share of volumes," Bill G=
wazd, with Ziff Energy Group, said. "The world will blink but trading will =
not stop."=20

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said it is taking actions to preser=
ve value in its core trading and other energy businesses, in response to Dy=
negy Inc.'s (DYN) decision to terminate a merger with Enron.=20
In a press release Wednesday, Enron said it has temporarily suspended all p=
ayments other than those necessary to maintain core operations.
Enron said it is reviewing Dynegy's actions earlier Wednesday, including an=
 assertion that Dynegy is entitled to exercise an option to purchase Enron'=
s interest in Northern Natural Gas Co.=20

Earlier Wednesday afternoon, Dynegy terminated the merger agreement with En=

 agreements, including the material adverse change provision in the merger =
agreement. Also, Enron's long-term debt was downgraded to below investment =
grade.=20
"Uncertainty during the past few weeks with respect to the merger has drama=

Energy Markets Seen Surviving Enron's Woes, But Changed
By Mark Golden, John Edmiston and Andrew Dowell

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The energy markets built by Enron Corp. (ENE) will s=
urvive the company's troubles, but they won't emerge unscathed, traders and=
 analysts said Wednesday.=20
Energy companies have had weeks to adjust to serious concerns about the Hou=
ston-based giant's creditworthiness, allowing a more or less orderly withdr=
awal of Enron from the market before ratings agencies Wednesday downgraded =
Enron's credit to junk-bond levels.
Nevertheless, liquidity in the North American natural gas and electricity m=
arkets is expected to suffer and credit requirements are likely to be tight=
ened in general, creating difficulties for some energy traders.=20
"This doesn't spell the end of energy trading," said one trading manager fo=
r an independent power producer. "The market is much bigger than Enron, and=
 that's why Enron fell. This does spell the spell the end of trading for co=
mpanies that don't have a strong physical asset base for at least a year or=
 two as credit requirements are generally tightened,"=20
Moreover, small producers of natural gas or electricity that hedged their 2=
002 output with Enron earlier this year - when prices were much higher than=
 they are now - will suffer if Enron has trouble fulfilling those commitmen=
ts.=20
Enron warned in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last w=
eek that its ability to continue as a going concern would be threatened if =
its credit ratings were downgraded to noninvestment grade levels.=20
News of Enron's downgrade added 5 cents to 10 cents to natural gas futures =
at the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders covering short positions se=
nt the December contract to $2.82 per million British thermal units, trader=
s said.=20
Midwestern and Southeastern power prices were also said to have risen due t=
o trading inefficiencies after Enron turned off its Internet-based trading =
platform EnronOnline and higher gas prices.=20
Prices have in all those markets have since fallen, but the moves point to =
the increased volatility and lessened efficiency some analysts and traders =
expect should Enron exit the market entirely.=20
Kyle Cooper, energy analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said traders will have=
 to present wider bid-offer spreads in order to get deals done in markets i=
n which Enron provided critical liquidity.=20
"One less player, one less market, because of the illiquidity," Cooper said=
.=20
At one time, Enron accounted for about a quarter of all trade in the North =
American gas and power markets.

UK: Enron - a pioneer of Europe's new power markets.
By Stuart Penson

11/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. group Enron , on the brink of collapse on W=
ednesday, has been a pioneer of energy dealing in Europe and its demise wou=
ld rob utilities across the continent of a key trading partner.=20
With a European staff of 5,000, offices in most major cities and a lavish h=
eadquarters overlooking London's Buckingham Palace, Enron created the tradi=
ng culture now embraced by previously sceptical European utilities as marke=
ts open up to competition.
Until recently, Enron had accounted for about 30 percent of German wholesal=
e power trading. It was also a major player in UK gas and electricity and N=
ordic power, and was driving forward a fledgling French power market.=20
"On average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterp=
arties," Enron's director of continental power trading Gregor Baeumerich to=
ld Reuters in an interview last month, days before the group was plunged in=
to its current crisis.=20
Britain's forward gas market rallied on Wednesday as it emerged that a resc=
ue deal from smaller rival Dynegy had unravelled and Enron looked to be ska=
ting dangerously close to bankruptcy.=20
Enron's list of trading partners included major utilities such as German gi=
ants E.ON and RWE and the UK's Innogy and British Energy=20
U.S. companies with trading desk in Europe, such as TXU , AEP , Dynegy and =
Duke Energy , also traded with Enron.=20
The company's EnronOnline Internet trading platform, suspended earlier on W=
ednesday, set the standard for online trading, offering a blueprint followe=
d by utilities and brokers.=20
Enron did about 60 percent of its trade through the platform.=20
The group's presence in Europe is not confined to trading. The company has =
around 4,000 megawatts of power generation, spanning Italy, Poland, Greece =
and the UK where it owns one of the biggest plants at Teesside.=20
The company built a reputation for hard-nosed trading expertise in Europe's=
 previously pedestrian utilities industry and its approach seemed almost ev=
angelical.=20
In the summer, flushed with confidence, the company placed a BMW sports car=
 in the lobby of its London office, a prize for employees successful in rec=
ruiting fresh talent for the Enron cause.

USA: WRAPUP 2-Enron near collapse after Dynegy pulls out.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. swooned at the edge of one of the b=
iggest corporate collapses in U.S. history on Wednesday as its rescue by ri=
val Dynegy Inc. blew apart.=20
Dynegy accused Enron of breaching the representations it made when a takeov=
er agreement was negotiated on Nov. 9, invoking an escape clause that let i=
t pull out of the all-stock deal valued at $9.3 billion at the time.
Shares of Enron, recently ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of the bigge=
st U.S. companies, had lost most of their value in the past three weeks, an=
d all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on Enron=
's bonds to junk status by the time Dynegy made its announcement.=20
Enron's latest disaster marked another low in a stunning free-fall that beg=
an innocently enough with the announcement of a $638 million quarterly loss=
 six weeks ago. Surprise disclosures, including the admission it overstated=
 earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and kept huge debts off its bal=
ance sheet, led investors to rapidly lose faith in a company valued at almo=
st $80 billion a little more than a year ago.=20
On Wednesday, its market value was less than $500 million.=20
In response to Dynegy's announcements and credit rating downgrades, Enron s=
aid it will temporary suspend all payments other than those necessary to ma=
intain its core operations.=20
Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said the company was =
evaluating and exploring other options to protect its core energy businesse=
s.=20
The loss of Enron's investment-grade credit rating forces some $3.9 billion=
 in debts to come due immediately, a major problem for a company that has s=
pent most of the $5.5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat. Enr=
on said in a recent regulatory filing that it was unlikely to "continue as =
a going concern" were its credit rating to be slashed to junk status.=20
It became increasingly clear, as Dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal, tha=
t Enron's tricky and often indecipherable accounting was becoming a stickin=
g point, sources close to the negotiations said.=20
"While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, =
this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business," Dynegy Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said in a statement.=20
Dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy Enron's Northern Natural Ga=
s Pipeline with the $1.5 billion it and partner ChevronTexaco put into the =
deal.=20
Dynegy said it stopped trading with Enron as of Wednesday morning, pegging =
its exposure at $75 million.=20
A bad sign came earlier on Wednesday, as energy traders said operations had=
 stopped at Enron's once highly lucrative online trading system, EnronOnlin=
e. The unit accounted for up to 90 percent of Enron's earnings, and was con=
sidered the jewel of the trading franchise that Dynegy coveted most in its =
planned $9.3 billion all-stock takeover.=20
RISK MANAGEMENT FAILURES=20
Enron, which touted itself as an agile risk manager, found its credit and d=
ebt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hid=
e debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent we=
eks.=20
The partnerships, which included top Enron executives and are the subject o=
f a U.S. Securities and Exchange investigation, provided financing in excha=
nge for guarantees that Enron's stock stay above certain levels and its cre=
dit remain investment-grade. But they came back onto the balance sheet with=
 a vengeance, as Enron found it would have to meet massive debt obligations=
 as its shares and credit fell.=20
Enron shares plunged $3.53, or 85 percent, to 61 cents on Wednesday, as the=
 New York Stock Exchange twice halted trading of Enron shares before announ=
cements affecting the company. It's stock has fallen more than 98 percent t=
his year.=20
The stock peaked at $90.56 in August 2000, riding high on the cresting wave=
 of the technology boom after Enron took its trading outfit online and prom=
ised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena.=
=20
"They (Enron) entrapped the sophisticates," said Robert Stovall, senior str=
ategist at Prudential Securities, referring to what was once an almost fawn=
ing admiration for Enron by institutional investors. "I think this is going=
 to become a classic case."=20

recall any previous corporate unraveling that matches that of Enron.=20
"You would have to go to pre-SEC days for that," he said, referring to the =
creation of the SEC in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929.=20
THE FINAL CUTS=20
Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch all cut their rating=
s on the fallen energy trading giant's debt to junk status. S&P said it had=
 lost confidence in Enron's ability to complete the merger with Dynegy, and=
 said bankruptcy was a "distinct possibility" if the merger fails.=20
Andre Meade, a Commerzbank analyst who has been consistently bearish on Enr=
on and the deal, said its core business deteriorated at an increasing pace =
in recent weeks, and the ratings agencies could not find the liquidity they=
 wanted inside Enron.=20
"The numbers were not enough to soothe them," said Meade, who downgraded En=
ron to "sell" from "hold" on Wednesday. "This company should have been down=
graded to junk weeks ago. The ratings agencies had given them several weeks=
, and they just couldn't hold out anymore."=20
Dynegy on Nov. 9 said it would take over Enron in a deal valued at about $1=
0.41 per Enron share. ChevronTexaco Corp., a major Dynegy shareholder, pled=
ged to immediately pump $1.5 billion into Enron to bolster its withering fi=
nances.=20
Deal advisers J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup have already contributed $1 b=
illion to the deal, and were expected to have to put up after Enron was reb=
uffed by private equity firms it had approached seeking more cash.=20
Representatives of Dynegy and Enron had haggled over new terms for the take=
over late into Tuesday, including a buyout offer half the original price, s=
ources close to the talks said.=20
Enron's crash began when it said it would take $1.01 billion in writedowns =
and charges against its third-quarter earnings for failed investments. It l=

Tauzin noted that Enron had been a "very big contributor" to energy supplie=

"We've got to watch that very carefully, obviously. We don't want to be in =
another session next year trying to deal with energy problems in California=
 as a result of some of the events that are occurring right now with Enron,=

The underlying cause of California's problems last winter was widely seen a=
s the state's badly written electricity deregulation law, which did not all=
ow power companies to pass through higher wholesale electricity costs to co=
nsumers.=20
Tauzin said Enron's decline was unfortunate. "It's a sad story. It's been a=
 hugely successful enterprise."=20
"I would hope they could work it out. We can't simply step into every bad m=
arket decision and every bad financing decision that occurs in American cor=

Dynegy calls off $8.4 billion takeover of Enron after credit downgrade
By KRISTEN HAYS

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Embattled Enron Corp. lost its savior Wednesday when smaller=
 rival Dynegy Inc. called off its planned $8.4 billion acquisition of the e=
nergy giant after two agencies downgraded Enron's credit rating to junk sta=
tus.=20
It was not immediately clear how the development would affect Enron's subsi=
diary in Oregon, Portland General Electric, which Enron had hoped to sell t=
o Portland-based Northwest Natural Gas, or several lawsuits by PGE employee=
s to retrieve retirement savings lost when Enron stock tanked this fall.
The downgrade triggered immediate payment of billions of dollars in debt th=
at Enron likely can't pay, leaving the once-mighty energy trader facing alm=
ost certain bankruptcy, analysts said.=20
"It's the end of Enron, no question about it," said Gordon Howald, an analy=
st at Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York. "I don't know who else could =
step in."=20
Trading in both stocks were halted on the news. Enron shares had plunged $2=
.91, or 71 percent to $1.20 in extremely heavy trading Wednesday on the New=
 York Stock Exchange; less than a year ago, they were trading at $84.87. Dy=
negy shares were off $4.08, or 10 percent, to $36.81.=20
In a statement, Dynegy said Enron had breached its acquisition agreement, t=
riggering a "material adverse" clause and causing it to call of the deal.=
=20
"While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, =
this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business," said Dyne=
gy chairman and chief executive Chuck Watson.=20
The Dynegy move came after Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service =
both cited a loss of confidence that the deal will be consummated, and said=
 that Dynegy's willingness to go through with the buyout has been compromis=
ed by continued erosion in investor confidence and Enron's core energy trad=
ing business.=20
The downgrades make $3.9 billion of Enron debt due immediately, and up to $=
16 billion in other debt originally due next year could come due earlier.=
=20
In its statement, Dynegy also said it would exercise its right to purchase =
Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline, an option it received after it and C=
hevronTexaco - which holds a 26 percent stake in Dynegy - pumped $1.5 milli=
on into the ailing Enron.=20
Despite Dynegy's claim to the pipeline, analysts are anticipating a battle =
over Enron's assets in bankruptcy court.=20
"It's going to be a fight" between Dynegy and Enron's creditors, Howald sai=
d.=20
Spokesmen for both Enron and Dynegy didn't immediately return repeated call=
s seeking comment Wednesday, though Dynegy scheduled a conference call for =
later in the afternoon.=20
Enron and Dynegy, both based in Houston, had spent the last several days tr=
ying to hammer out a revision to their Nov. 9 merger agreement, which value=
d Enron stock at more than $10 per share.=20
"This comes in response to the fact that they weren't able to craft a deal =
last night. They were working on getting more cash (from banks shepherding =
the merger) last night, but they didn't get it," said A.G. Edwards & Sons a=
nalyst Mike Heim said. "I think bankruptcy's not too far away."=20
Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright predicted Dynegy will survive wit=
h a few battle scars.=20
"I believe we all misunderstood how dramatic a credibility crisis can be in=
 a recession in a bear market," he said. "The speed at which Enron collapse=
d caught us all off guard."=20
Enron last month revealed that partnerships run by its executives had allow=
ed the company to keep about half a billion in debt off its books and allow=
ed the executives to profit from the arrangements. Enron's dealings with th=
ose partnerships are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=

Dynegy Pull out of Enron Purchase; Credit Ratings Cut (Update6)
2001-11-28 13:09 (New York)

Dynegy Pull out of Enron Purchase; Credit Ratings Cut (Update6)

     (Updates to add Dynegy comment; share price.)

     New York, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. abandoned its
proposed purchase of Enron Corp., said Dynegy in a press
statement. The decision threatens to force Enron, once the
country's largest energy trader, into bankruptcy.

     Standard & Poor's Corp. cut Enron's credit rating to junk as
bankers failed to raise $1.5 billion Enron needed to operate until
the deal was completed. The lack of funds and the prospect of a
downgrade contributed to Dynegy's decision to scrap the
acquisition, which was valued at $23 billion on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares fell as much as 71 percent to $1.20, its lowest
level in at least 19 years. The company's 6.4 percent bonds, which
mature in 2006, were quoted at 20 cents on the dollar, down from
53 yesterday. At that price the bonds yield 57 percent.

     ``The reality is Enron's going bankrupt,'' said Michael
Willingham, a risk manager at Itochu International Inc. ``Enron
touted themselves as the king of risk management, but it doesn't
look like they've managed their risk very well.''

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee tried for for two weeks to raise the cash Enron needed.
Investors including Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the
Blackstone Group LP and the Carlyle Group Inc. turned them down
because of concern Enron wouldn't be able to pay its debts. That
concern was heightened after Enron disclosed a previously
undisclosed $690 million interest payment due this week.

     Dynegy said in a statement distributed by Business Wire that
it terminated its agreement because Enron breached covenants.
Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson said Dynegy would invoke its right
to purchase Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy used an
investment of $1.5 billion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns
one quarter of Dynegy, to purchase the Enron unit, which operates
16,500 miles of natural gas pipeline.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls for
comment.

                          Trading Doubts

     Enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading
partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay
bills. As a result, they either demanded more collateral to trade
or restricting trading with the Houston-based company.

     EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s online trading system, stopped
allowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas
late this morning, say traders who use the Web site. Enron said
yesterday that EnronOnline handles about 60 percent of its trading
business, or about $2.8 billion a day in trading on average over
the last 30 days.

     ``We can log in, but there is nothing there, nothing to buy
and nothing to sell,'' said Juha Laiho, an energy trader at
Finland-based Fortum Oyj in Houston. ``It went down some time
this morning.''

     S&P cut its rating on Enron to ``B-'' from ``BBB-'' and
Moody's lowered its rating to ``B2'' from ``Baa3.'' Both ratings
are below investment grade. Enron has $15.4 billion of debt.

     Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Securities, said that
Enron's junk credit rating would ``effectively shut down the bulk
of their trading and marketing operations and trigger $3.3 billion
in liability payments.''

     ``It's not likely Enron will be able to raise the capital to
settle those payments and continue its business,'' said Meade.

     The large debts make it unlikely that investors will receive
much should the company file for bankruptcy, said investors.

     ``This will be a traditional bankruptcy in which equity
holders get nothing,'' said Edward Paik, who has 1.6 million Enron
shares among $7 billion in assets he helps manage for Liberty
Funds Group. ``This company doesn't have the safety net in terms
of assets that other companies do.''


Enron's Online Trading Unit Has Stopped, Traders Say (Update2)

Enron's Online Trading Unit Has Stopped, Traders Say (Update2)

     (Adds confirmation the merger collapsed.)

     New York, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s
Internet trading system, stopped allowing trades and quit posting
bids and offers for natural gas late this morning, say traders who
use the Web site.

     Dynegy Inc. canceled plans to buy Enron as credit ratings
companies cut the energy trader to junk status. The collapse of
the Dynegy takeover led analysts to speculate Enron will file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

     Enron said yesterday that the EnronOnline Web site handles
about 60 percent of its trading business, or about $2.8 billion a
day in trading on average over the last 30 days.

     ``We can log in, but there is nothing there, nothing to buy
and nothing to sell,'' said Juha Laiho, an energy trader at
Finland-based Fortum Oyj in Houston. ``It went down some time this
morning.''

     Traders had already been wary of making new contracts with
Enron because of concerns about its credit status.

     ``I don't think anybody is trading with Enron right now,''
Laiho said. ``Even late last week, people were not making new
positions with them. It was an unstable situation.''





Enron's 401(k) Plan Was Set Up for Fall: David Wilson (Update1)
2001-11-28 14:17 (New York)

Enron's 401(k) Plan Was Set Up for Fall: David Wilson (Update1)

     (Changes first, second, fifth, seventh and 12th paragraphs to
reflect today's events. Commentary. David Wilson is a columnist for
Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.
employees participating in a company-sponsored savings plan were
more vulnerable than usual to this year's collapse of the company
and its stock price.

     Common and convertible preferred shares of Enron, once the
largest U.S. energy trader, rose as a percentage of the plan's
assets last year for the first time since 1994, according to
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The stock amounted to 62 percent of assets in the so-called
401(k) plan, designed to help people save for retirement, at the
end of 2000. That figure was the highest in six years; in both 1998
and 1999, it had been less than a majority.

     Participants in the plan, which had $2.14 billion in assets
available for benefits, could only do so much to diversify their
investments. Enron, like many other companies, used stock rather
than cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of
the shares.

     And they could only guess at the year-end makeup of the plan's
assets until the end of June, reflecting SEC disclosure standards
for savings plans. By that time, the stock's drop -- which reached
99 percent today -- was already well under way.

                       Trio of Lawsuits

     Enron later reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter charges;
ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran partnerships
that accounted for some of the charges; restated its results since
1997; became the target of an SEC accounting investigation; and
accepted a takeover bid from Dynegy Inc., its biggest rival.

     The company's shares, which ended last year at $83.13, fell as
low as $1.05 today before a midday trading halt as Enron's debt was
downgraded to junk-bond status and Dynegy abandoned its offer.

     In response to the plunge, employees in the 401(k) plan --
which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax-free
savings, and takes its name from a section of the Internal Revenue
Service code -- have filed three lawsuits against Enron.

     The suits allege, among other things, that the Houston-based
company prevented employees from shifting investments within the
plan between Oct. 17, the day after its disclosure of the charges,
and Nov. 19 as the company made administrative changes.

     All three seek class-action status on behalf of the plan's
participants. The most recent filing came from the Gottesdiener Law
Firm, based in Washington, on Monday. It covers the longest time
period: November 1995 to now.

                        Falling Percentages

     Enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan's
assets at the end of 1994, the year before the period associated
with the Gottesdiner suit began. The figure reflected a one-time
company contribution of preferred stock, and rose from 62 percent
in 1993.

     Each preferred share has a face value of $100 and is
convertible into 27.304 common shares. This translates into a
conversion price of $3.66 a share, which was a bargain before
today's trading.

     The plan also owned a stake in Enron's former oil and gas
unit, which became EOG Resources Inc. after gaining independence in
1999. Add in those shares, and company stock represented about two-
thirds of the 1994 assets.

     Enron's common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of
401(k) assets available for benefits in 1995, 58 percent in 1996
and 53 percent in 1997 as the U.S. stock market rallied, lifting
the value of participants' investments in equity mutual funds.

     The shares represented 49 percent of the plan's assets in
1998. The proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999, when the
assets more than doubled -- exceeding the 56 percent increase in
Enron's share price that year -- to $1.62 billion.

                         How Much Choice?

     Then came last year, when the common shares recorded their
best performance in more than two decades even as U.S. stocks
stumbled. Enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and
natural gas prices, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, a market
benchmark that includes the company, fell 10 percent.

     Company shares in the plan rose in value by $652.7 million,
according to an SEC filing. The total includes shares bought and
sold throughout the year. By contrast, mutual-fund holdings fell by
$47 million and ``other investments'' rose by just $134,000, the
filing said.

     At year-end, the 401(k) plan owned 13.9 million Enron common
shares and 70,000 preferred shares, valued at $1.32 billion. This
total encompasses not only Enron's matching contributions to the
plan, but also employees' investments with their own money.

     The company generally provides a 50 percent match, in stock,
for the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan. Employees
can't sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment
choices until they reach the age of 50.

     Company contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the
plan's stock holdings, said Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman. The
figure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company
than usual for 401(k) participants.

                         Waiting for Data

     For the average U.S. plan account, company stock amounted to
19 percent of assets at the end of last year, according to a study
done by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and the Investment
Company Institute and published last week.

     In any case, Enron's approach to matching ensures that as much
as one-third of the contribution to an employee's account takes the
form of shares that they can't sell right away.

     Anyone who wanted to gauge how this approach, and Enron's
stock performance, affected the plan's financial position last year
had to wait until June 27. That's when the filing cited earlier
arrived at the SEC.

     Employee savings and stock-purchase plans, such as 401(k)
plans, don't have to submit annual reports until 180 days after
their fiscal year ends. They can even get a 15-day extension of the
deadline if they need one.

     By the time Enron's plan made its annual report, it was
already a bit too late to act on the information. The company's
shares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of
the submission. As the filing demonstrated, employees looking to
save for retirement had been set up for a fall.




Enron's Credit Rating Cut to Junk by S&P and Moody's (Update4)
2001-11-28 14:38 (New York)

Enron's Credit Rating Cut to Junk by S&P and Moody's (Update4)

     (Updates with analyst comment in third paragraph, Fitch
rating in fourth paragraph and shares in sixth paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's
Investors Service and Fitch, Inc. slashed Enron Corp.'s credit
rating to junk status as rival energy trader Dynegy Inc. rescinded
its buyout bid for the company.

     The cut could force Enron into bankruptcy. At least $3.9
billion in debt comes due immediately because of the rating cut,
and the company struggles with a cash crunch as it suspends its
online trading unit and some ``non-core'' payments. Enron's
trading business is also faltering as trading partners lose faith
in the company's ability to meet its obligations.

     ``This is a disaster,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a debt
analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``It is difficult, if not
impossible, for anyone to do trades with Enron's trading
operations in light of junk ratings across the board and Dynegy
walking away from the deal.''

     S&P reduced Enron's long-term grade six levels to ``B-'' from
``BBB-'' and withdrew its ``A'' short-term rating. Moody's cut
Enron 's credit rating to ``B2,'' five levels below investment
grade, from ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment level. Moody's
affirmed its ``Not-Prime'' rating on Enron's commercial paper.

     Fitch cut Enron's senior unsecured rating 10 levels, to
``CC'' from ``BBB-,'' and its short term rating to its second-
lowest ``C'' from ``F3.'' Fitch said a ``default of some kind
appears probable.''

                           Deterioration

     ``We saw the deterioration in the trading operations, and
that threw the merger in doubt,'' said S&P analyst Todd Shipman
and the author of the report.

     Enron has $15.5 billion of debt outstanding, according to
Bloomberg data. Its shares, which have fallen 99.2 percent so far
this year, lost $3.34 cents today and are now trading at 77 cents.

     Enron's stock had fallen by more than 50 percent since Nov.
19 amid growing skepticism that the Dynegy would complete the
acquisition.

     ``We became a lot more concerned when the stock didn't
stabilize,'' said John Diaz, Moody's managing director for energy
and one of the authors of the report. ``The drop in the stock
price put pressure on Dynegy to renegotiate the deal.''

                             Cash Burn

     Shipman said in his report that ``The willingness of Dynegy
to complete its planned acquisition of Enron has been compromised
by the continued drop in confidence in the capital markets that
the transaction would hold.''

     Credit analysts also focused on Enron's ``cash burn'' rate,
Diaz said. Enron said in its most recent filing last week that it
had $1 billion in cash, which was a lot less than the market had
expected, Diaz said.

     ``It came as a surprise to us and to others,'' he said. ``We
expected at least $2.5 billion so they would have staying power.''




Enron Expected to Sell Portland Utility to Northwest Natural
2001-11-28 15:07 (New York)

Enron Expected to Sell Portland Utility to Northwest Natural

     Portland, Oregon, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
nearly bankrupt energy trader, is expected to go through with the
sale of its Portland General Electric Co. unit to Northwest
Natural Gas Co., a spokesman for the utility owner said.

     Enron last month agreed to sell PGE to Northwest Natural for
$2.9 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt. Dynegy Inc. today
called off its planned purchase of Enron, saying the energy trader
breached covenants in the merger agreement. Dynegy had supported
the PGE sale.

     Northwest Natural filed its application to buy PGE with the
Oregon Public Utility Commission today. Enron representatives have
given the Portland, Oregon-based company no indication that they
plan to call off the sale, Northwest Natural spokesman Steve
Sechrist said.

     ``We think the transaction will be completed,'' Sechrist
said. ``Whatever happens to Enron, the deal has significant
benefits for customers and shareholders of both their company and
our company.''

     A spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron didn't return calls for
comment. PGE spokesman Scott Simms said he couldn't comment on
Enron's planned sale of the utility.

     Northwest Natural shares fell 32 cents to $24.02 in
midafternoon trading. Enron shares fell $2.91 to $1.20 before
trading was halted for Dynegy's announcement. Enron shares have
dropped 99 percent since the first of the year.

                         Commission's Role

     Marc Hellman, the administrator responsible for mergers and
acquisitions at the Oregon Public Utility Commission, said he is
unsure what would happen if Enron were to file for bankruptcy
protection.

     `` I can't recall it ever happening, and I've been here for
22 years,'' Hellman said. ``If it went all the way to the end,
where they're liquidating assets, you can't sell utility property
without commission approval. There are probably some issues where
our attorney general's office may look into it.''

     Hellman said he has heard nothing to indicate Northwest
Natural's purchase of PGE wouldn't go forward.

     ``Enron was getting cash from Northwest Natural for the
purchase, as well as shares,'' Hellman said. ``That aspect of the
transaction becomes a little curious if Enron is going through
bankruptcy.''

                          Debt Downgrades

     Moody's Investors Service today downgraded PGE's senior
secured debt to A3 from A2. Moody's also downgraded PGE's
unsecured debt, its junior subordinated debt and its preferred
stock.

     The ratings service said it had expected to downgrade PGE's
ratings once Northwest Natural completed its acquisition of the
utility.

     ``However, today's rating action is being taken in advance of
the expected closing of that transaction to reflect Moody's
concerns surrounding Portland General's ability to remain fully
insulated from the many financial challenges currently being faced
by its parent, Enron Corp., due in large part to lost investor
confidence in Enron,'' Moody's said in a statement.

Sempra Energy Interested in Buying Some Enron Assets (Update2)
2001-11-28 15:39 (New York)

Sempra Energy Interested in Buying Some Enron Assets (Update2)

     (Adds Enron comment in sixth paragraph, updates shares in
fourth.)

     San Diego, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Sempra Energy, an owner of
electric and natural-gas utilities, is interested in buying some
of Enron Corp.'s assets now that the energy trader's planned
merger with Dynegy Inc. has failed, a Sempra spokesman said.

     ``We are interested in some of Enron's hard assets and our
interest would lie in those assets that would have synergies with
our own operations,'' Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said. ``Beyond
that I couldn't give you more specifics.''

     Dynegy today called off its purchase of Enron, saying the
energy trader breached covenants in the merger agreement. Dynegy
had agreed to buy Enron for at least $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt this month. A federal investigation of accounting
irregularities at Enron had limited its ability to finance
operations and sent its shares plunging.

     Sempra shares fell 39 cents to $22.66 in late trading. Enron
shares fell $3.48 to 63 cents once they resumed trading after a
halt for Dynegy's announcement. Enron shares have dropped
99 percent since the first of the year.

     Houston-based Enron has an ownership interest in Argentina's
4,104-mile natural-gas pipeline system, the largest pipeline
system in South America. Sempra Energy International owns a
43 percent stake in two natural-gas utility holding companies in
Argentina. Sempra also is the owner of the San Diego Gas &
Electric and Southern California Gas Co. utilities.

     ``We are looking at selling our global assets that are not
core to our business, and so we'll be continuing with an asset-
sale program,'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``We are not
going to comment on who we've had discussions with or what the
status of those is.''

     In addition to its interest in Enron assets, Sempra has had
discussions with Enron employees who want to leave the company,
Kline said.

     ``A number of Enron employees have approached us, as we're
aware they've approached other firms,'' Kline said.




Enron Office Tower Project in Limbo After Dynegy Ends Purchase
2001-11-28 15:42 (New York)

Enron Office Tower Project in Limbo After Dynegy Ends Purchase

     Houston, Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s 1.17-million-
square-foot office tower project in downtown Houston has been
thrown into limbo after Dynegy Inc. abandoned its proposed
purchase of the country's largest energy trader.

     The 40-story tower at 1500 Louisiana, next to Enron's
current headquarters, is scheduled to be completed in January,
according to Hines Interests, the construction manager.

     The building, the first new Houston skyscraper since 1987,
features floors as large as 52,00 square feet to accommodate
Enron's trading activities and a circular sky bridge nicknamed
``The Saturn Ring'' that connects the new tower with Enron's
existing building and a parking garage.

     ``Dynegy occupies 700,000 square feet in Houston and the
thinking was that after they bought Enron they would move their
operations into the new tower,'' said Will Penland, senior
managing director at property broker CB Richard Ellis's Houston
office. ``I guess that has fallen by the wayside now.''

     Enron's shares tumbled $3.42 to 69 cents in late trading as
investors and analysts said the company may be forced into
bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's Corp. cut Enron's credit rating to
junk as bankers failed to raise $1.5 billion Enron needed to
operate until the deal was completed. Enron said it is suspending
all payments other than those necessary to maintain its core
operations.

     The Cesar Pelli & Associates-designed tower, called Enron
Center South, is clad in reflective glass and metal panels, and
features sun shades on its south face, according to Hines. The
building's seven-story base includes five 52,000 square-foot
floors. Each of the top 33 stories is 25,000 square feet.

     When the project was announced two years ago, Enron needed
more space to house a growing workforce. Its stock price hit a
peak of $90 a share in August 2000.

     The project kicked off a building boom for Houston, with
three other buildings now under construction that would add 2.05
million square feet to the city's office supply, according to
Prudential Financial. The largest of these is a Reliant Resources
project at 100 Main Street.

     This activity, combined with falling energy prices and job
cuts at Compaq Computer Corp., Continental Airlines Inc., and
other Houston employers, may cause the city's downtown office
vacancy rate to rise to the ``mid-teens'' in 2002 from 8.2
percent at the end of September, according to James Sullivan,
Prudential's real estate analyst.
