Ken, Lay Your Cards On the Table

"I want to make sure we restore that credibility." So said Enron CEO Ken La=
y in August, after his company's stock had fallen from over $80 to $36 sinc=
e January, after the shocking resignation of his handpicked successor, Jeff=
 Skilling, and after growing complaints about the company's incomprehensibl=
e financial statements.=20
Today there's mounting evidence that Lay--a senior statesman who helped cre=
ate Enron in the mid-'80s--may not be part of the solution. In the past two=
 months Enron's stock has sunk another 60%, to $16, amid concern that the c=
ompany's murky disclosure may be a sign of deeper business problems. A conf=
erence call that Lay held on Oct. 23, ostensibly to reassure skittish inves=
tors, was widely regarded as a disaster. Enron "wiggled, squirmed, and gave=
 a bunch of nonanswers," as one listener puts it. Even formerly docile sell=
-side analysts are turning hostile. After the call, Prudential's Carol Coal=
e downgraded Enron to a sell, "not because of things that we know, but beca=
use of things that we potentially don't know."
Enron's stock began its plunge in mid-October after the company announced i=
ts third-quarter results. As always, Enron made its earnings number--that i=
s, before a gigantic, $1.01 billion charge due to a slew of investments gon=
e sour. Worse, Enron was less than up- front about an additional $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholders' equity, caused by the early termination of co=
ntroversial outside investment partnerships run by former Enron CFO Andy Fa=
stow. Lay reassured investors that Enron's credit rating was intact but mad=
e no mention of Moody's, which after the call put Enron's debt on review fo=
r a possible downgrade. As Enron acknowledges, it is critical that the comp=
any's debt be rated investment-grade, given the requirements of its huge tr=
ading operations. Enron's debt is currently rated several notches above inv=
estment-grade, and at the end of the second quarter the company had $12 bil=
lion in debt, or a not unhealthy debt- to-capitalization ratio of 46%. But =
the most recent figures aren't yet available (Enron doesn't release a balan=
ce sheet with its earnings results), and there's concern about Enron's abil=
ity to meet its near-term liquidity needs.=20
The stock sank further when Enron announced that the SEC was inquiring into=
 the Fastow-run partnerships, which did a variety of bewildering deals with=
 Enron, raising questions about possible conflicts of interest. Lay contend=
s that the partnerships, named LJM and LJM2 (for Fastow's children, says on=
e analyst), were done merely to "mitigate volatility." A so-called Chinese =
wall--meaning that Enron and the partnerships were run as two separate busi=
nesses-- protected Enron shareholders, he insisted. But here's an extraordi=
nary line from one copy of LJM2's marketing material: "Enron board of direc=
tors has waived 'Code of Conduct' for A. Fastow's activities relative to LJ=
M2." (Enron says it claims absolutely no responsibility for what may have b=
een represented by an independent company.) As for Lay's assertion of a Chi=
nese wall, well, how can there be a Chinese wall within Fastow's brain? On =
Oct. 24, Enron announced a fall guy--Fastow would take a "leave of absence.=
" At the very least the partnerships demonstrate horrific judgment by peopl=
e other than just Fastow. Enron's board, for example, gave its okay. One do=
cument shows that Ben Glisan, Enron's treasurer, was also on the partnershi=
p's investment team. (Enron says that document is a draft.)=20
Perhaps the biggest concern is the true profitability of Enron's core busin=
ess, its energy trading operation. The heart of the Enron story, the stuff =
that captivated Wall Street, was the company's transformation from a stodgy=
 gas pipeline into a technology phenomenon that could make a market in anyt=
hing, from electricity to broadband. It's impossible to know if Enron has u=
sed the partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicles to influence its report=
ed earnings. Enron also mingles profits from asset sales with its trading i=
ncome-- and despite its pledges, in the most recent quarter the company pro=
vided less, not more, disclosure on that front. In addition there are quest=
ions about how aggressively Enron books trading-related revenue. In fact, a=
 knowledgeable source at a competitor says that Enron recognizes its revenu=
es at two to five times the rate of that company's. If energy trading is re=
ally such a fabulous business for Enron, why does it need to play so many g=
ames?=20
As for Ken Lay, who was once thought to be in Jack Welch's league, he has a=
ccomplished the truly remarkable feat of destroying much of what was left o=
f Enron's credibility in just a few short months-- along with some of his o=
wn. Some observers suspect that the problem is not that Lay is avoiding que=
stions, but that he doesn't know the answers. In either case, Lay is a long=
 way from keeping his promises.=20
Quote: Despite promises from CEO Ken Lay, Enron's financial disclosure is s=
till far from sufficient.

S.E.C. Opens Investigation Into Enron
By ALEX BERENSON

11/01/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a formal investigation in=
to transactions among the Enron Corporation and partnerships headed by Andr=
ew S. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, Enron said yest=
erday.=20
The commission's move comes as Enron struggles to reassure investors and it=
s partners that its profits are real and that its cash position is strong. =
Shares of Enron, the world's largest trader of electricity and natural gas,=
 have plunged 83 percent this year as investors question the company's comp=
lex and opaque accounting. Shares of Enron rose $2.74 yesterday, to $13.90,=
 ending a 10-day string of losses.
In addition, Enron's board said yesterday that it had appointed a special c=
ommittee to examine the transactions. The panel will be headed by William P=
owers Jr., the dean of the University of Texas law school, who was elected =
to Enron's board yesterday. The committee has hired William R. McLucas, a f=
ormer head of the division of enforcement at the S.E.C., as its counsel. He=
 is a partner in the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington.=
=20
Enron disclosed 10 days ago that the commission had opened an informal inqu=
iry into its transactions with Mr. Fastow. A formal investigation significa=
ntly increases the pressure on the company.=20
John Heine, a spokesman for the commission, said he could not comment on th=
e S.E.C.'s investigation of Enron. But, speaking generally, Mr. Heine said =
the opening of a formal inquiry enabled the commission to subpoena document=
s and was used when S.E.C. staff members thought that the companies or exec=
utives were not responding voluntarily to their questions.=20
If staff members ''run into situations where they feel they need informatio=
n to look further and the sources for that information are not cooperative,=
 the staff can go to the commission and recommend that the commission issue=
 a formal order of investigation authorizing that the staff issue subpoenas=
,'' Mr. Heine said.=20
When it disclosed the commission's informal inquiry on Oct. 22, Enron promi=
sed to cooperate fully with the S.E.C. ''We welcome this request,'' Kenneth=
 L. Lay, Enron's chairman, said.=20
A spokesman for Enron did not return calls yesterday.=20
Enron began this year on an apparently unstoppable growth streak. But the c=
ompany has suffered one setback after another. The company's efforts to bec=
ome a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband =
communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Jeffrey K.=
 Skilling resigned as chief executive, forcing Mr. Lay, his predecessor, to=
 resume day-to-day control.=20
Enron's problems came to a head in mid-October, when it disclosed that its =
shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped $1.2 billio=
n in the third quarter because of a deal with partnerships led by Mr. Fasto=
w. Because of complex accounting rules, the write-down was not apparent in =
Enron's quarterly earnings report. News of the write-down disturbed investo=
rs because it suggested that Enron might have found a way to hide losses, t=
hrowing the accuracy of its financial statements into question.=20
Last week, the company ousted Mr. Fastow, but it is now struggling to expla=
in the transactions to its shareholders and bond-rating agencies. Amid rumo=
rs that the company might face a cash squeeze, Enron used a $3.3 billion li=
ne of credit last week and is seeking additional financing. Still, some ene=
rgy companies are shying away from making trades with Enron that will take =
more than a few weeks to close.

Enron Partnerships Led by Fastow Face a Formal SEC Investigation
By John R. Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Securities and Exchange Commission elevated to a formal investigation i=
ts inquiry into Enron Corp.'s financial dealings with partnerships headed b=
y its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
Enron disclosed the SEC action late yesterday. As a matter of policy, the S=
EC doesn't comment on what it is or isn't investigating.
A formal investigation involves the SEC's enforcement branch going to the f=
ive-member commission and obtaining formal subpoena power to pursue its inq=
uiry. A person familiar with the SEC probe said the agency felt it needed s=
ubpoena power to compel the release of information by parties that have don=
e business with Enron.=20
Enron last week disclosed that the SEC had contacted the company as part of=
 what it described as an informal inquiry into the Fastow-related partnersh=
ips. At the time, Enron said it welcomed the inquiry and that it would coop=
erate fully with the SEC -- a position the company has restated repeatedly =
since.=20
While a formal order of investigation doesn't indicate that the SEC has dec=
ided that there is wrongdoing, it is a sign "of a decision to pursue the in=
vestigation," said former SEC enforcement attorney Jacob Frenkel. "It clear=
ly is one level up" from an informal inquiry, he said.=20
As part of its efforts to deal with the overall situation, Enron also annou=
nced the appointment of University of Texas law-school dean William Powers =
to its board. Mr. Powers will head a four-member board committee to look in=
to the Fastow-related transactions and other matters.=20
Former SEC enforcement chief William McLucas, who is now with the Washingto=
n D.C. law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, has been retained to advise =
the committee, Enron said.=20
The other members of the four-person board committee are all outside Enron =
directors: Frank Savage, chief executive of Savage Holdings LLC; Paulo Ferr=
az Pereira, executive vice president of the Brazilian-owned investment bank=
 Group Bozano and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and chief executive of =
Capricorn Holdings, Inc. Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay has=
 asked the committee to "take a fresh look at these transactions and take a=
ny appropriate action," the company spokeswoman said.=20
Enron has consistently said its dealings with the Fastow-connected partners=
hips were legal and properly disclosed to investors. According to Enron fil=
ings with the SEC, the company did deals involving billions of dollars of a=
ssets and Enron stock with entities related to the Fastow partnerships. Int=
ernal partnership documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and possibly others ma=
de millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow, who was replaced =
as chief financial officer last week, has consistently declined to be inter=
viewed.=20
News of the SEC investigation came at the end of what lately had been a rar=
e up day for Enron in the stock market. After plummeting for 10 straight tr=
ading sessions, Enron shares rose by nearly 25%. In 4 p.m. New York Stock E=
xchange composite trading, Enron rose $2.74 to $13.90 a share and was once =
again the Big Board's most active issue, with about 43.8 million shares cha=
nging hands. A little more than two weeks ago, Enron shares were above $33 =
each. About a year ago they were around $85.=20
Analysts and other observers said the rebound was partly due to bargain-hun=
ting as well as continued speculation about a possible takeover bid for Hou=
ston-based Enron, given its current severely depressed stock price. Startin=
g about two weeks ago, Enron suffered a sharp loss in investor confidence f=
ollowing big third-quarter write-downs, partly related to the Fastow partne=
rships, and the disclosure of the SEC inquiry.=20
Enron officials argue that investors have been overreacting and say the com=
pany is fundamentally sound. They have promised to be more forthcoming abou=
t the company's extremely complex finances. Investors need to know more abo=
ut the company's potential liabilities, said A.G. Edwards analyst Michael H=
eim. "Until you know the worst-case scenario, it is hard to move forward," =
he said.=20
To improve its liquidity, Enron is nearing completion of a new bank credit =
line of roughly $1 billion to be secured by gas-pipeline assets, say people=
 familiar with the matter. The new line would supplement existing credit fa=
cilities, which were largely used up last week when Enron drew down about $=
3 billion to help it weather the current crisis.=20

Broadband Trading's Prospects Narrow Fast
By Elliot Spagat
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/01/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Create a market, and they will come?=20
Last year, companies led by Enron Corp. envisioned a fast-growing, and very=
 profitable, new market trading broadband capacity. As demand burgeoned for=
 fiber-optic lines that carry Internet and other data to offices and homes,=
 they figured, people with too little or too much capacity would be eager t=
o trade it -- much like soybeans, oil and electricity.
But instead of a bustling market, it has pretty much been a bust, so far an=
yway. Plummeting broadband prices, a dearth of creditworthy customers and n=
ow Enron's financial woes have stalled the nascent market, and the costs ar=
e adding up.=20
Enron's broadband unit, for instance, had an $80 million operating loss in =
the third quarter on revenue of $4 million, down from revenue of $162 milli=
on a year earlier. The company also recorded a $180 million third-quarter c=
harge to restructure its broadband unit, which included cutting 400 to 500 =
jobs and losses on the sale of inventory, and plans to close offices in Lon=
don and Singapore.=20
Enron handled just 405 trades in the third quarter, down from 759 in the se=
cond quarter. Currently, the broadband market -- in which contracts to buy =
and sell capacity on fiber-optic networks are traded by brokers by telephon=
e, rather than on the floor of a physical exchange -- records fewer than tw=
o dozen trades a day. Many of the transactions take place between energy co=
mpanies rather than between users and suppliers.=20
That's less than what Enron and others creating the new market, including D=
ynegy Corp. and El Paso Corp., had expected. With characteristic bravado, t=
hey saw in telecommunications many of the same factors that drew them to ga=
s and electricity: a newly deregulated market, plenty of inefficiency and w=
hat seemed to be insatiable demand for the fiber-optic lines to carry Inter=
net and other data.=20
For example, if a big corporation needed to quickly expand its internal "In=
tranet" service to send traffic among its various offices around the U.S., =
it could in effect buy the capacity on the new market.=20
After making hundreds of millions of dollars trading in natural gas and ele=
ctricity, the companies were confident they could outmaneuver the giant tel=
ecom carriers, which never welcomed them, because the telecom companies wan=
ted to control capacity rather than see it become a tradable commodity. "It=
's worked so well for us in gas, it's worked so well for us in power," said=
 Stephen Bergstrom, Dynegy's president and chief operating officer. "There'=
s a lot of differences, but there's also a lot of similarities."=20
The energy companies, nearly all of which are based in Houston, saw the tel=
ecom industry as slow and secretive. Telecom carriers typically spend six t=
o nine months arranging multiyear deals to exchange network capacity or to =
serve major business customers. Their contracts, which aren't disclosed pub=
licly, often involve custom work -- for which they could charge premium pri=
ces. And if their service turns out to be unreliable, the buyer has little =
recourse.=20
Through trading of broadband capacity, Enron in mid-1999 saw the chance to =
offer telecom customers prices that were easy to understand and compare, be=
cause they would be based on standard contracts and instant delivery. Penal=
ties would be assessed when service faltered. Contracts could change hands =
frequently and last for as little or as much time as the customers wanted. =
Enron figured that time on fiber lines could be treated just like kilowatt =
hours of electricity.=20
Enron "kind of made it happen. The other energy players look like followers=
," noted Martin Gray, vice president for trading and risk management at Lon=
don's Cable & Wireless PLC, one of the few telecom companies to take a seri=
ous interest in bandwidth trading.=20
To back its efforts, Enron erected an 18,000-mile fiber network offering co=
nnections at blazing speed, and built 25 delivery points for companies to e=
xchange bandwidth. It also relentlessly prodded carriers and large business=
es to rethink the rules.=20
But most telecom carriers never warmed to bandwidth trading. "Houston is a =
bad word in their mind," said Jack Blunt, senior vice president of finance =
at RateXChange Corp., a San Francisco-based bandwidth broker that also oper=
ates a small electronic broadband-trading exchange. "The energy merchants a=
re perceived as cutting in on their business and trying to create a commodi=
ties market."=20
Efforts to create hubs, or points where service could be delivered, stumble=
d when other traders balked at how much information they would have to shar=
e if they used Enron's sites. Meanwhile, bandwidth prices were falling shar=
ply, in part because telecom companies overbuilt their fiber-optic networks=
, and in part because demand, while growing, didn't grow as quickly as expe=
cted. As a result, customers were reluctant to buy contracts for fiber-opti=
c capacity that would lock them into prices that might be much higher than =
rates they could get just a few months later.=20
At the same time, upstart phone companies and Internet service providers --=
 among the biggest potential clients for excess capacity traded on a broadb=
and market -- were running into serious problems, reducing the number of cr=
editworthy customers.=20
El Paso initially planned to invest $2 billion in its telecom business. A f=
ew months ago, it cut its projected investment to $1.5 billion. Last week, =
the company said it would cut back "radically" and limit its focus to its e=
xisting network in Texas and a delivery hub in Chicago. "The clear line of =
sight to success has become very opaque," said William Wise, chief executiv=
e of the Houston-based company.=20
Dynegy, which operates a 16,000-mile fiber-optic network connecting 44 U.S.=
 cities, reported a relatively moderate $15 million third-quarter loss in i=
ts telecom business. "We are not big on [being] first mover," said Mr. Berg=
strom. "We were second mover in gas, second mover in power, and we were sec=
ond mover in telecom."=20
Still, the Houston crowd isn't giving up on the market. An Enron spokeswoma=
n said the company remains committed to telecom, but is reviewing costs. Th=
e company remains a chief cheerleader in trying to develop hubs and set sta=
ndards.=20
Dynegy is "comfortable" with its current position, a spokeswoman said. Chuc=
k Watson, its chief executive, said demand has picked up sharply since Sept=
. 12 as companies have conducted more business by phone. He expects demand =
to grow substantially next year. But executives at several companies acknow=
ledge that it may take months, if not years, to create an active trading ma=
rket.=20
If Enron retreats further, the biggest winners would be the giant telecom c=
arriers that considered Enron a threat to their decades-old ways of doing b=
usiness, analysts say. "All eyes are on Enron," said Seth Libby, an analyst=
 at the Yankee Group research firm in Boston. "When they came into this mar=
ket, they were the catalyst, and they still are the catalyst to create band=
width as a commodity."

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is leading the action before =

What goes up, must go down. Enron (ENE) shares are once again sinking after=

Morgan Stanley wasn't quite so kind to shares of International Business Mac=
hines (IBM). The firms initiated coverage on the stock at neutral on valuat=

down 72 cents or 0.6% to $107.35 after finishing the primary session at $10=
8.07=20
Ballard Power Systems Inc. (BLDP) shares fell before the bell after reporti=

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Enron's weakness may be a buyer's strengt=

o the group:=20
Financial Times; Nov 1, 2001
By JULIE EARLE, MATTHEW JONES and SHEILA MCNULTY

With Enron's share price hovering around its low for the year, the question=
 of whether this is the right time to buy into the US's biggest energy trad=
er is not only being asked by small-time investors but also by potential ac=
quirers.=20
As of the market close on Tuesday, Enron's stock was down 67 per cent from =
October 16, when the company disclosed a surprise Dollars 1.2bn charge agai=
nst shareholders' equity that has provoked a crisis of confidence in the co=
mpany. The selling has hacked Dollars 17bn off Enron's market value in two =
weeks.=20
"The situation is one where Enron is likely to survive, but it is hard to a=
nalyse because we don't have all the information yet," says John Olson, vic=
e-president of research at Sanders Morris Harris, an investment banking fir=
m. "With the stock being crunched so badly, only people with a high appetit=
e for risk should buy."=20
That goes for acquirers as well, analysts say.=20
The SEC is conducting an unofficial enquiry into Enron's financial dealings=
. Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, has been replaced. Sharehol=
ders have subsequently filed a series of lawsuits against Enron. And not on=
ly has one of the main rating agencies downgraded Enron's long-term debt, b=
ut the other two are reviewing it for potential downgrade.=20
Other outstanding issues include how much Enron will get from the Dollars 4=
.5bn in asset sales it has been planning, including its Dabhol power projec=
t in India, where Enron and its foreign partners want to retrieve their Dol=
lars 1bn in costs spent building the now-defunct plant.=20
Analysts warn there may be more losses to come at the company's poorly perf=
orming broadband division, where Enron has warned it sees no immediate pros=
pect of recovery, despite recent comments by Dynegy, its rival, that the br=
oadband market is improving.=20
And there are worries Enron may have to take extra charges on its other off=
-balance-sheet vehicles.=20
Kenneth Lay, chief executive, has said the company is watching closely its =
operations in India, broadband and California, where Enron is one of severa=
l energy traders facing questions over accusations of a manipulation of pow=
er prices - which it denies. But if Enron had other impaired assets, it wou=
ld have announced them, he added.=20
The potential risks make it more likely, analysts say, that acquirers would=
 rather buy one or more of Enron's business units than the whole business.=
=20
Mr Olson says Enron's trading, outsourcing and pipeline businesses are all =
good growth businesses. The trading business, which has been growing 31 per=
 cent a year, has been making a 23 per cent return on equity, he says.=20
Energy outsourcing, growing at 50 per cent a year, has ROE of 62 per cent, =
and ROE at pipelines, where growth has been 7-8 per cent a year, has been 2=
4 per cent.=20
At midday yesterday, Enron's shares were trading at Dollars 12.64, up 13.26=
 per cent.=20
"The valuations are compelling," says Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities=
. Enron is the number-one marketer of natural gas and power in North Americ=
a. Mr Meade says Enron is the best platform to get into these two big busin=
esses.=20
Banking sources in London say Royal Dutch/Shell and BP have considered buyi=
ng Enron but have backed off because of concerns about a culture clash and =
the level of Enron's debts.=20
Banks have approached Enel, the Italian power utility, about acquiring Enro=
n, but it is understood to have rejected the idea.=20
Eon, the German utility group, was also named as a potential European buyer=
, but analysts say the regulatory hurdles may be too high because it is sti=
ll in the process of gaining approvals for its purchase of Powergen, the UK=
 electricity group with interests in the US.=20
"At this price a number of large utilities and oil groups will be looking a=
t Enron but the business is imploding so quickly that it's a real risk," sa=
ys one banker. Additional reporting by Fred Kapner=20
Executives campaign round the rating agencies=20
Executives from Enron, the embattled energy trading company, was visiting N=
ew York rating agencies yesterday as part of a campaign to defend the compa=
ny's investment-grade rating, write Sheila McNulty in Houston and Robert Cl=
ow in New York.=20
The team, led by Greg Whaley, Enron's president and chief operating officer=
, was to meet separately with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's =
and Fitch.=20
Moody's this week downgraded its long-term debt, citing deterioration in En=
ron's financial flexibility over the past two weeks.=20
At the same time as the company was launching the charm offensive it was pu=
tting the finishing touches to a financing deal. Enron said over the weeken=
d that it was searching for sources of liquidity to bolster its financial p=
osition.=20
In spite of its troubles, Enron's energy trading business has continued to =
thrive.=20
But that might no longer be the case if the company was downgraded below in=
vestment grade. Then Enron's trading counterparties might increase the amou=
nt of collateral they demand from Enron, putting pressure on margins. "Our =
concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability t=
o operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles of Sa=
lomon Smith Barney.=20
Even after the Moody's downgrade, Enron's long-term debt is still rated a f=
ew notches above junk by all rating agencies. Fitch, however, has put Enron=
 on review for possible downgrade and Standard & Poor's has changed Enron's=
 credit outlook to negative from stable.=20

COMMODITIES & AGRICULTURE: EIA to take over US gas report=20
Financial Times; Nov 1, 2001
By MARY CHUNG

The US Department of Energy said yesterday it would take over a closely wat=
ched weekly survey on natural gas from an industry trade group that has bee=
n publishing the data for the past seven years.=20
The report will be picked up by the Energy Information Administration (EIA)=
, the department's statistical division, after the American Gas Association=
 (AGA), which represents US natural gas producers and utilities, said it wo=
uld discontinue publication of its gas storage estimates at the end of the =
year.=20
Spencer Abraham, US energy secretary, said in a statement: "I believe it is=
 important the Department of Energy continue the reporting responsibility f=
or this vital resource."=20
The AGA's decision to stop providing the data follows allegations of manipu=
lation by some traders in the natural gas market over revisions in the surv=
ey.=20
"There was a flap over revisions in the numbers. That did cause us to re-ex=
amine the whole storage survey process," said Daphne Magnuson, an AGA spoke=
sperson.=20
The weekly data are used by many in the trading community to buy and sell n=
atural gas futures contracts, so any advance knowledge of storage volume re=
visions can give participants an unfair trading advantage.=20
Several complaints were filed by traders to the Commodity Futures Trading C=
ommission, the US regulatory agency, about discrepancies in the survey's da=
ta.=20
A CFTC spokesperson said the commission acknowledged the "exchange of infor=
mation with the AGA, which is still under review" but it would neither conf=
irm nor deny the existence of any investigation.=20
The natural gas market is a Dollars 90bn a year industry, representing 189 =
producers and local utilities including Duke Energy, Enron and El Paso.=20

What went wrong with Enron?=20
Since its stock hit a zenith in January, the company has been in a downward=
 spiral=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG and MICHAEL DAVIS=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
For Enron Corp., it's a long, long way back to late January, when Houston's=
 biggest company was flying high.=20
Jeff Skilling, who played a central role in transforming Enron from a pipel=
ine company to a trader of everything from electricity to paper to the weat=
her, was days away from taking over from Ken Lay as chief executive officer=
.=20
The stock had acquired a high-tech gloss, as the world's largest energy tra=
der had moved aggressively into the broadband business, where it hoped to p=
rofit from buying and selling space on high-speed data wires.=20
Today, the snapshot could scarcely be more different.=20
Enron's shares, which hit a closing high for the year of $82 in late Januar=
y, have been trending downward since mid-February. They hit a nine-year clo=
sing low Tuesday of $11.16.=20
Skilling is gone, Enron's credibility on Wall Street is in shambles, its br=
oadband unit has been significantly scaled back, and there's speculation th=
e company could be a takeover target.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is digging into business deals betwe=
en Enron and investment partnerships formerly run by its ousted chief finan=
cial officer.=20
Enron, which last week disclosed the SEC had begun an informal inquiry into=
 its affairs, said Wednesday it's under formal investigation.=20
The financial hits Enron revealed earlier this month, related to the invest=
ment partnerships known as LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, quickly trigg=
ered an expanding round of unanswered questions about Enron's balance sheet=
 and overall financial stability. A sharp decline in the stock price follow=
ed.=20
Investors and analysts, who are irked because they believe Enron won't expl=
ain its complicated affairs, are painting their own worst-case scenarios.=
=20
If Enron doesn't move to calm investor fears, they could become a self-fulf=
illing prophecy, Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International =
in Houston, wrote in a research report.=20
The vicious cycle potentially goes like this, he said: Fears drive down the=
 stock, the lower prices force credit agencies to consider downgrades, pote=
ntially lower credit ratings force trading partners to reduce business with=
 Enron, and Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow suffers.=20
But the fact is, questions have surrounded Enron for months. Enron has been=
 faulted for some of its deals outside of its key business of energy market=
ing and trading, which at the moment is considered healthy.=20
Wall Street's complaints that Enron's financial statements and disclosures =
were hard to follow and lacked key details were more easily brushed aside w=
hen Enron's stock price was high.=20
But this month's financial disclosures and Enron's steadily falling stock, =
which has shaved tens of billions of dollars from the company's market valu=
e, catapulted those questions to center stage.=20
A series of problems hung over Enron:=20
? In California, Enron was among Houston companies painted as chief villain=
s by Gov. Gray Davis and other top state officials earlier this year in Cal=
ifornia's energy crisis. Enron, still owed $570 million for unpaid power bi=
lls in California, drew negative publicity nationwide for its perceived arr=
ogance.=20
? Broadband lost its glow in March, when Enron and Blockbuster called off a=
 deal to bring movies over the Internet into homes. Almost a month later, E=
nron revealed it had cut about 250 jobs from its broadband unit. More cuts =
followed. The telecommunications industry melted down, but some analysts fe=
lt Enron was slow to disclose its troubles.=20
? Expensive investments Enron made in asset-based projects internationally,=
 such as power plants, didn't generate high enough returns. Enron has been =
trying to unload billions worth of these assets for two years. Earlier this=
 year, it said it would try to sell its $875 million stake in Dabhol Power =
Co. in India, which has been nothing but trouble for Enron almost from the =
time it got involved in the early '90s.=20
? Enron was still cleaning up Azurix, its unsuccessful foray into the water=
 and wastewater business. Part of a $1.01 billion write-down in the third q=
uarter related to Azurix.=20
? Over the past year, several high-ranking Enron executives have left. No d=
eparture was more jarring to investors than the August departure of Skillin=
g, who spent just six months as CEO.=20
Out of the blue, Skilling announced he was leaving for personal reasons. La=
y, who had remained as chairman, reclaimed the CEO's job.=20
The fact Enron's shares were already sagging fed speculation about the "rea=
l" reasons for Skilling's departure. Wall Street began cranking up its requ=
ests for better disclosures in Enron's financial reporting. Lay faced the i=
mmediate challenge of restoring Enron's credibility and convincing Wall Str=
eet more bad news wasn't on the way.=20
Then, something that until last week's earnings report hadn't gotten much b=
road attention acted as a lightning rod to focus all of Wall Street's conce=
rns.=20
Earlier this year, some analysts and investors criticized Enron for letting=
 its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, run the private LJM investment=
 partnerships that did business with Enron.=20
They wondered if Fastow, wearing his LJM hat, was doing deals that benefite=
d LJM but hurt Enron. Fastow, in June, stepped down from LJM, and Enron als=
o ended its financial arrangements with LJM.=20
When Enron released third-quarter earnings Oct. 16, the report contained $1=
.01 billion worth of charges in write-downs aimed at cleaning up problems d=
istracting Enron from its core business.=20
Included was $35 million recorded because of ending its relationships with =
the LJM partnerships. Because of that move, Enron also reduced shareholders=
' equity by $1.2 billion, something it mentioned briefly in its conference =
call with analysts but didn't note in its earnings news releases.=20
Wall Street was hoping Enron's third-quarter report would begin an era of f=
inancial frankness. While Enron did break down some of its data in new ways=
, Wall Street felt Lay tried to slip the equity reduction by it.=20
Instead, a national spotlight was turned on the LJM partnerships, including=
 in a series of stories in the Wall Street Journal.=20
Almost a week after earnings, Enron disclosed that the SEC was looking into=
 the LJM matters. Shareholder lawsuits quickly piled up, and Enron replaced=
 Fastow.=20
Investors and analysts have been trying to get details out of Enron about o=
ther financial vehicles it used to make investments without immediately tak=
ing on new debt or issuing shares. They fear Enron will be on the hook for =
billions of dollars of obligations related to these partnerships.=20
Meanwhile, Enron's stock price kept plunging and Moody's Investors Service =
on Monday cut Enron's credit rating a notch, though it still remains at a k=
ey investment-grade status.=20
Analysts believe Enron doesn't face an immediate cash crisis, nor do they t=
hink it's in danger of losing its investment-grade rating. If it were to lo=
se that rating, Enron would face a variety of negative consequences, includ=
ing some that would damage its trading business.=20
At the moment, analysts believe Enron's wholesale energy trading business, =
which is responsible for as much as about 90 percent of the company's opera=
ting earnings and relies heavily on access to capital and credit, is fine.=
=20
Wall Street hasn't gotten a sense that major trading players are pulling bu=
siness or increasing credit requirements with Enron.=20
There is evidence, though, that some smaller traders are shifting business =
away from Enron or requiring different trading terms.=20
Spokesman Mark Palmer said Enron is working with traders, mostly smaller on=
es more concentrated in Europe, "to arrange credit terms that they are more=
 comfortable with."=20
Enron represents 20 percent to 25 percent of the domestic wholesale energy =
market, so significant problems with its operation would cause widespread d=
isruption. On just one day last week, Enron handled about $4 billion worth =
of transactions through its EnronOnline.=20
Traders say Enron's problems haven't damaged commodities markets in general=
.=20
Enron, in an unsuccessful move to shore up investor confidence, last week d=
rew down about $1.1 billion from credit lines and banked it. It used anothe=
r $2.2 billion to pay off short-term debt obligations, known as commercial =
paper.=20
"We're going to do better," Palmer said, adding that he realizes Enron has =
its work cut out. "We are going to provide as much information as we can to=
 begin restoring investor confidence in this company."=20
On Wednesday, Enron took a step aimed at stemming concerns. William Powers =
Jr., the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, joined its board an=
d will head a special committee that will review deals between Enron and en=
tities with links to company insiders, such as LJM.=20
The company hasn't yet made its regular, detailed 10Q quarterly filing with=
 the SEC. The 10Q will include a balance sheet and various financial footno=
tes, which analysts will scour looking for signs of trouble or solidity.=20
Enron also must execute international asset sales worth about $600 million =
scheduled to close by the end of this year. Shedding other assets would als=
o help, though there is concern Enron will be forced to accept fire-sale pr=
ices, leading to more big write-downs.=20
Keeping a deal to sell power utility Portland General Electric on track is =
also important. The sale should bring Enron $1.55 billion in cash and take =
about $1.1 billion in debt off its balance sheet. The closing isn't expecte=
d until the latter part of next year.=20
Speculation is swirling that Enron is a takeover target for the likes of Ro=
yal Dutch/Shell, General Electric Co.'s GE Capital and others; could be sol=
d off in pieces; or is a bankruptcy candidate. Analysts believe bankruptcy =
is unlikely.=20
While Enron may make an attractive acquisition target, a buyout offer is un=
likely until the SEC inquiry is resolved, they said. Shares in Enron closed=
 up $2.74 to $13.90 Wednesday, likely on takeover speculation and because i=
t had been trading at such a cheap price.=20
Another possible outcome, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan S=
ecurities in New York, would be another large player taking a minority stak=
e as a strategic investment in Enron, providing liquidity to shore up its b=
alance sheet.=20
At the moment, Wall Street is inclined to give Lay some time to fix the pro=
blems.=20
"As time goes on in this crisis, the likelihood of Ken Lay emerging unscath=
ed gets lower and lower," said Feygin.=20

Formal upgrade of Enron investigation gives subpoena power to SEC=20
By TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Federal regulators have upgraded their inquiry of questionable financial tr=
ansactions at Enron Corp. into a formal investigation, giving officials the=
 power to subpoena witnesses and documents.=20
Enron disclosed the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wed=
nesday, saying it involved some, if not all, of the off-balance sheet finan=
cing partnerships the company has been criticized for in recent weeks.=20
The primary difference between the informal inquiry the SEC started more th=
an a week ago and a formal investigation is the power it gives regulators t=
o force companies to submit information. Changing an inquiry into an invest=
igation is relatively easy for regulators to do, legal sources say. The off=
icials simply ask the five-member commission for subpoena powers, a request=
 that is rarely turned down.=20
The SEC doesn't comment on investigations as a matter of policy, so it's no=
t immediately clear why the extra steps were taken.=20
Enron officials say they have cooperated fully with the SEC, but since the =
investigation most likely covers transactions involving companies other tha=
n Enron, it's possible subpoenas may be needed to gain information from tho=
se entities.=20
"There's no request from the SEC that we have failed to comply with," Enron=
 spokeswoman Karen Denne said. "We've cooperated voluntarily from the very =
beginning."=20
Enron's board of directors also formed a special committee to investigate t=
he transactions earlier this week and on Wednesday named William Powers, de=
an of the University of Texas School of Law in Austin, to its board of dire=
ctors to lead the special committee.=20
The committee will serve as a primary contact between the company and the S=
EC and will concurrently make its own detailed investigation.=20
If needed, the committee has the power to take disciplinary action against =
any Enron employee, officer or director who it determines "improperly parti=
cipated in the transactions," Denne said.=20
Powers, a career academic, is known for his studies in product liability. H=
e will be joined on the committee by board members Frank Savage, chief exec=
utive of Savage Holdings; Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of=
 Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bozano; and Herbert Winokur Jr., cha=
irman and chief executive of Capricorn Holdings.=20
The committee has named William McLucas, the former director of the SEC div=
ision of enforcement -- the group investigating Enron -- as counsel.=20
McLucas' Washington-based law firm, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, retained De=
loitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.=20
The SEC inquiry began shortly after Oct. 16, when steep losses in Enron's t=
hird-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partne=
rships created by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
The partnerships, referred to as a form of off-balance sheet financing, wer=
e formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against t=
he risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business, such as I=
nternet broadband trading.=20
Fastow's dual roles as Enron CFO and managing director of the entities were=
 a cause for concern for Wall Street, which pressured Fastow to cut ties wi=
th the outside partnerships in June. The company said it was careful to ens=
ure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but wh=
en the partnerships accounted for significant losses for Enron and a $1.2 b=
illion loss in equity value, analysts began to demand more details.=20
Last week the company replaced Fastow and began providing a few more detail=
s about its finances in order to maintain investor and client confidence. T=
he company has declined to give out further information on the partnerships=
, however, because of the ongoing SEC investigation.=20
Enron tapped a $3.3 billion line of revolving credit last week, putting abo=
ut $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure it has cash on hand and using the bal=
ance to repurchase short-term debtinstruments. The company is expected to a=
nnounce today or Friday that it has lined up another $1 billion to $2 billi=
on in credit from banks.=20

HOUSTON (AP) - The financial roller coaster ride for Enron Corp. is gaining=
 speed.=20
After dropping to a nine-year low a day before, shares of the nation's larg=
est natural gas and power marketer rose 25 percent on Wednesday to close at=
 $13.90 amid speculation the Houston-based company was a strong takeover ca=
ndidate.
But shares then fell 5 percent in extended trading after the company's anno=
uncement that the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a formal in=
vestigation into apparent conflicts of interest in dealings the company had=
 with partnerships led by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow=
.=20
The company, in a news release late Wednesday, said it created a special co=
mmittee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to res=
pond to the investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of dire=
ctors.=20
"I have asked the board to take this action to address fully and forthright=
ly investors' questions and concerns," said Enron chairman and chief execut=
ive Kenneth L. Lay. "We will also make every appropriate public disclosure =
during the course of the SEC's investigation."=20
However, Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. in New=
 York, said Enron still has much to do to restore investor confidence.=20
"With (stock) values this low, you've got two camps of investors: guys that=
 hate Enron and guys that want to be cautiously attracted to Enron," Gruber=
t said. "It's lead to the trading range being irrationally low and shares b=
eing oversold. It's not something the company wants."=20
Enron's stock is off 60 percent since the company reported a $638 million t=
hird quarter loss just over two weeks ago, dragged down by a one-time charg=
e of $1.01 billion attributed to various losses.=20

y in recent weeks and sent its stock plummeting to a nine-year low.=20
The nation's largest energy trader, scrambling to head off another shock to=

INDIA: Bank meeting on Enron Indian unit postponed-source.

BOMBAY, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Lenders to an Indian power plant majority owned b=
y U.S. energy giant Enron Corp have postponed a meeting to discuss ways of =
reviving the $2.9 billion project, a banking source said on Thursday.=20
The first phase of the controversial 2,184 MW plant, India's largest foreig=
n direct investment, has been completed, but work on the second phase was a=
bruptly stopped in June following a bitter dispute between Enron and the pl=
ant's sole buyer, a loss-making Indian utility.
The source said foreign banks could not attend the meeting, planned for thi=
s weekend in London. A new date has not yet been fixed, the source from an =
Indian lending institution added.=20
The meeting of lenders, which includes Citibank (C.and Bank of America Corp=
, was also called to consider two offers from Indian companies to buy out E=
nron's 65 percent stake in its Indian subsidiary, Dabhol Power Co.=20
The banker added that the lenders were also examining an investigation by t=
he U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into Enron's finances, but=
 declined to comment on what impact it might have on the selling of Enron's=
 stake in Dabhol.=20
BSES Ltd and India's largest private utility, Tata Power Ltd, have separate=
ly made offers to buy Enron's stake.=20
Dabhol's other shareholders are General Electric Co and U.S. contractor Bec=
htel, which own 10 percent each. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a=
 local utility which has been at odds with Dabhol, owns the remaining 15 pe=
rcent.=20
Maharashtra agreed in 1995 to buy the plant's entire output, but later said=
 it could not because Dabhol's power was too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused the utility of defaulting on its monthly payments,=

BG Extends Talks With ONGC, Reliance Over Gas Fields (Update1)

BG Extends Talks With ONGC, Reliance Over Gas Fields (Update1)

     (Adds background to deal in second, fifth-seventh paragraphs,
analyst comment in third, Enron's financial status in fourth.)

     London, Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- BG Group Plc said it has yet to
reach an agreement with Reliance Industries Ltd. and ONGC Ltd. in
their natural gas ventures in India, an accord central to
completing the $388 million bid for Enron Corp.'s stake in the
projects.

     BG has said the offer for Enron's 30 percent of the projects
is contingent on winning the right to oversee the developments.
Reliance, India's biggest private company, on Oct. 10 said it
claimed the right to run the projects. ONGC has also sought to
become operator of the fields.

     ``It's going to take a long time,'' said Jon Rigby, an
analyst at BNP Paribas. ``For BG, it's a deal worth pursuing, but
if the Indian companies are determined to take the operatorship,
then there's not a great deal BG can do about it.''

     Enron, the world's largest energy trader, needs the funds
from the sale of the Indian assets to boost its standing with
investors after Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday placed its
rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade and lowered
its long-term debt to two notches above junk status. Enron shares
fell to a nine-year low.

     The purchase of Enron's assets would gave BG a 30 percent
stake in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as
63 percent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The
fields hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas,
equivalent to more than two days of global oil demand.

     ``We will continue our discussions over the coming weeks and
make an announcement in due course,'' BG Group spokeswoman Nicole
McMahon said in an interview, without elaborating.

     India's gas production fell 11 percent between 1997 and 1999
because Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no
significant discoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas
have hurt growth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals
industries and hampered upgrading of its power plants, still
mostly coal-fed.

     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next
six years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand
sales.

US Utilities Are Slow To Make Life Harder For Enron

Enron Says SEC Inquiry Now a Formal Investigation (Update4)
2001-10-31 21:18 (New York)

Enron Says SEC Inquiry Now a Formal Investigation (Update4)

     (Updates with more on McLucas in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said the Securities and Exchange Commission opened
a formal investigation into dealings with partnerships run by its
former chief financial officer.

     The company's board appointed William Powers Jr., dean of the
University of Texas law school, to chair a committee that will
work with the SEC during the investigation, which began as an
informal inquiry last week. Powers was also appointed to Enron's
board. William McLucas, former head of the SEC's enforcement
division, was hired as the committee's lawyer.

     The SEC is investigating partnerships run by former CFO
Andrew Fastow that bought and sold Enron shares and assets. The
company's shares plunged 49 percent in October, in part because
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month that
buying back 62 million shares from a Fastow partnership cost Enron
shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity.

     The formation of a special committee is a ``reflection that
they recognize something has to be done,'' said A.G. Edwards
analyst Mike Heim, who rates Enron ``hold'' and owns no shares.
     Enron's suspect finances prevent it from borrowing in the
commercial paper market, where most large corporations go to find
low-interest, short-term debt.

     Enron wants to borrow $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The
company still is negotiating the loans, spokeswoman Karen Denne
said tonight.

                             Fired CFO

     The SEC began an informal inquiry from its Fort Worth, Texas
office last week and moved it to the commission's Washington
headquarters yesterday.

     ``We haven't seen the formal order yet, but it's my
understanding that the issues which were the subjects of the
informal inquiry are the issues that are part of this formal
investigation,'' Denne said.

     SEC regulators called Enron yesterday to say they were going
to start a formal investigation, Denne said. Enron delayed
announcing the move until Powers confirmed he would become
chairman of the special committee, she said. The announcement came
after the close of stock trading today.

     The company's share rose $2.74, or 25 percent, to $13.90
during regular trading on television reports that the company was
near to getting a new series of bank loans. The company's shares
fell as low as $13 in after-hours trading tonight.

                     Authorized to Discipline

     The special committee has the authority to discipline
directors or employees, Denne said, and will be reviewing
transactions like the Fastow partnerships.

     Lay removed Fastow as CFO and put him on leave of absence on
Oct. 24, the day after the company said the SEC was asking
questions about the partnerships.

     A company is more likely to be charged with wrongdoing by the
SEC after a formal investigation than after an informal inquiry,
former SEC Enforcement Director Richard H. Walker said. The agency
can subpoena bank, telephone and corporate records, as well as
compel witnesses to testify.

     Walker, who left the SEC in August, said the swiftness with
which the SEC upgraded it to a formal investigation is striking.

     ``It sends a signal that this is a high-priority,'' said
Walker, who starts tomorrow as legal counsel to Deutsche Bank AG.

      The SEC's decision follows months of investor demands that
Enron provide clearer financial reporting. Lay promised more
information about Enron's complex transactions and earnings when
he took over for Jeff Skilling, who resigned unexpectedly as chief
executive officer in August after seven months on the job.

                        Failed Investments

     After Lay's promises, investors and analysts said they were
caught off guard when Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $618
million after writing off $1.01 billion in failed investments.

     Of that, the company had $35 million in losses from dealings
with LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two Fastow-run
partnerships.

    Securing new bank loans became necessary after credit-rating
companies said that Enron was not providing enough detail about
potential liabilities.

     Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt
this week, though it kept the company above investment grade.
Fitch has Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard &
Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative.

     Falling below investment grade would trigger agreements that
would force Enron to repay bonds sold by affiliated companies such
as the ones created by Fastow. Enron has estimated its potential
liability from such partnerships at about $3 billion.

     A lower credit rating also reduces the amount of cash that
Enron can raise to back its electricity, natural-gas and
commodities trading operations.

     American Electric Power Co. and Exelon Corp. officials said
they lowered trading limits with the Houston-based company or
restricted their commerce to short-term deals concluding in
November or December.

                           Off the Books

     Enron set up the Fastow partnerships and other affiliated
companies to buy Enron power plants and other assets. By selling
to the partnerships, which issued their own bonds, Enron was able
to get immediate cash rather than wait for an outside buyer, as
well as move debt off its books.

     If affiliates can't generate enough money from the sale of
assets, Enron has agreed to make up the difference. Enron also
must buy out some investors if its stock and credit rating fall
too low.

     Three partnerships -- Whitewing, Osprey and Marlin -- have
about $3.3 billion in debt they plan to repay by selling power
plants and related assets.

     McLucas is a partner in the law firm Wilmer, Cutler &
Pickering. He was director of the SEC's division of enforcement
for eight years, and he oversaw the $600 million fraud settlement
with former junk-bond trader Michael Milken in 1990.

     Powers, 55, became dean of the University of Texas School of
Law in Austin last year. American Lawyer reported in May 2000 that
Powers had friends in Texas politics that included then-Lieutenant
Governor Rick Perry, who became governor when George W. Bush
became president, and Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom
Phillips.

WE HEAR A LOT about the importance of reliable earnings numbers, especially=
 when the stock market is rocky. But earnings aren't always the best gauge =
of a company's performance.
How's that? When business is sagging, some companies are tempted to massage=
 their earnings-per-share numbers to make it look as if things are better t=
han they really are. Usually, cost-cutting is the favorite technique - and =
there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But sometimes, desperate compani=
es shunt unpleasant items aside under the rubric of special one-time charge=
s, or point to murky "pro forma" results that don't include major liabiliti=
es. For proof of the potential unreliability of earnings numbers, take a lo=
ok at what's going on at Enron (ENE) these days. In cases like this, the va=
unted price/earnings ratio isn't always the best way to evaluate a stock.=
=20
Sales, on the other hand, rarely lie. Companies can't do much tinkering wit=
h their revenue figures without raising eyebrows over at the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission. (It is, after all, the top line on the earnings state=
ment.) If you want the straight scoop on a company's performance, revenues =
can sometimes be the best place to look.=20
With that in mind, we turned to the price/sales ratio for this week's Data =
Mine. Our basic premise was simple: A stock that trades at, say, 0.5 times =
revenues is cheaper than a stock that trades at 17 times revenues - and is =
thus more worthy of your attention. We also looked for companies whose P/S =
ratios are in the bottom half of their industry, where the real undervalued=
 gems usually reside. And to make sure we didn't uncover total dogs, we ins=
isted that our companies actually have earnings (most dot-coms need not app=
ly), that those earnings have grown over the past three years and that thei=
r stock prices have increased during the last year. (You can access this re=
cipe using our new screening tool.)=20
After all that, our universe of 7,498 stocks was winnowed down to just 38. =
Texaco also appeared, but since it recently merged with Chevron to form Che=
vronTexaco (CHV), we removed it. Of these, 10 were electric and/or natural-=
gas utilities. In general, the outlook for that sector is wobbly. Industria=
l demand for wholesale power remains weak, thanks to the slumping economy -=
 meaning prices continue to slip from their recent highs. But the companies=
 in the screen that have reported third-quarter earnings have shown steady =
revenue growth and solid earnings performance during this nasty economic sl=

The utility with the smallest P/S ratio here (0.3) is WPS Resources (WPS), =
which serves customers in Wisconsin and Michigan. It reported third-quarter=
 earnings of 76 cents a share on Oct. 18, beating the Street by 14 cents.=

lance sheet, but the transactions may come back to haunt the energy trading=
 giant.=20
If Enron's credit rating falls to below investment grade, it could be force=
d to sell more stock. But paradoxically, one of the most likely reasons it =
would be downgraded is because of a long-term inability to sell stock in an=
y form at a viable price.
That would mean the largest trader of gas and power in North America could =
face a severe cash crunch when it would be least able to meet the crisis. W=
hile investors say the near-term outlook is not as bleak as a recent plunge=
 in the company's share and bond prices suggests, default could occur if En=
ron's credit-worthiness is cut to junk bond grade.=20
With Enron reportedly securing a roughly $1.2 billion credit facility and p=
otentially a private equity investment recently, the chances of its being d=
owngraded soon look more remote, said an industry analyst.=20
However, "if Enron gets downgraded, there could be serious trouble with the=
 stock and these bonds," noted an analyst.=20
The potential avalanche of new shares would come from special financing veh=
icles the company used beginning in 1998 when it decided to focus on tradin=
g energy and de-emphasize businesses that require heavy capital spending, s=
uch as water utilities and power plant development.=20
The company took several billion dollars worth of assets that it wanted to =
take off its balance sheet, and shoved them into several share trust struct=
ures, which sold debt and equity. The trusts, called Marlin Water Trust II,=
 Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc., issued abo=
ut $3.4 billion in notes.=20
INTRICATE TRUST STRUCTURES=20
The trusts assured rating agencies the assets were at arm's length from the=
 rest of the company, and would not drag down the rest of Enron if they und=
erperformed, said Todd Shipman, the lead ratings analyst on the credit at S=
tandard & Poor's.=20
But the intricate trust structures are hard for analysts to understand, and=
 investor perceptions that Enron has been less than forthright about its co=
mplex dealings contributed to the plunge in the company's securities. A Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission probe into two Enron partnerships with a fo=
rmer chief financial officer and an equity write-down also pushed securitie=
s lower.=20
In the Marlin and Osprey trusts, Enron essentially set up special companies=
 that held physical and financial assets and then issued bonds backed by th=
ose assets. But in a sign of the difficulty in understanding their structur=
e, one analyst said Enron threw in preferred stock convertible into 50 mill=
ion shares of common stock, while another analyst said the stock was 100 mi=
llion shares.=20
The structures, which also include about 40 million shares convertible into=
 unregistered common stock, have a proviso to assure investors: the equity =
would be sold only if certain doomsday scenarios came to pass, and notehold=
ers had legitimate reason to be concerned about getting paid back.=20
One of the bleak scenarios included both Enron's shares plummeting, and the=
 company being downgraded to junk bond status by at least one rating agency=
.=20
Enron shares rebounded on Wednesday after a 10-day slide in which they lost=
 more than 60 percent, meeting the stock plunge scenario. Shares closed at =
$13.90, recouping some of the lost ground over the past 10 days, when it tr=
aded at $33.84.=20
JUNK BOND BOUND?=20
The scenarios seemed unlikely when the debt and equity was issued.=20
"People thought the notes would be rolled over, or the assets in the trust =
would be sold, when the notes were originally issued," said Jim McAuliffe, =
a fixed-income analyst covering energy at Morgan Stanley in New York.=20
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service cut Enron's senior unsecured rating to=
 two notches above junk bond grade, and put them on review for further down=
grade.=20
Fitch said the company is on "rating watch negative," and Standard & Poor's=
, which has Enron a notch higher, has it on a negative outlook.=20
"I don't consider a probability," said S&P's Shipman. For that to happen, E=
nron would have to be frozen out of equity financing in any form for the lo=
ng term, leaving it able to raise more capital only through debt.=20
A downgrade to below investment grade would require that Enron redeem the n=
otes in short order, said an analyst familiar with them.=20
Analysts disagreed whether the convertible preferred stock would have to be=
 sold in this case, but they agreed that it likely would be sold.=20
"These structures did not anticipate that scenario," said an industry analy=
st familiar with the structures.=20
In addition to the possibility of default on these notes, Enron's core busi=
ness, energy trading and marketing would likely be hampered by a sub-invest=
ment grade rating, said Shipman. Counterparties would cut credit lines, dem=
and more collateral be posted, and would likely demand more favorable price=
s.=20
Enron, however, appears to be sanguine about the trusts. Although a spokesm=
an from the company did not return calls for this story, Enron told The Wal=
l Street Journal last week the company believes it can repay the principal =
on the notes without having to issue more stock.

USA: UPDATE 3-Enron says SEC inquiry now full-scale probe.

By Jeff Franks
HOUSTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., swept up in a deepening crisis, sa=
id on Wednesday an informal inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com=
mission had become a full-scale investigation of questionable financial dea=
lings that have rocked the company in recent weeks and sent its stock plumm=
eting.=20
The nation's largest energy trader, scrambling to head off another shock to=
 its already-shattered credibility, elected University of Texas law school =
dean William Powers to its board of directors, where he was to lead an inte=
rnal inquiry into transactions that caused Enron to take a $1 billion charg=
e to third quarter earnings and name a new chief financial officer.=20
The company said on Oct. 22 the SEC was looking into its finances, but stre=
ssed that the agency had only requested information. The disclosure that it=
 was now a full-blown, formal investigation may indicate regulators did not=
 like what they saw.=20
Before the announcement, which came after the stock market closed on Wednes=
day, Enron stock rose $2.74 to $13.90 to end a 10-day tailspin that saw its=
 price drop to nine-year lows while losing $17 billion in market value. Ana=
lysts said bottom-fishing investors, along with speculation talk that Enron=
 may become a takeover target, had boosted shares.=20
Investors had been dumping Enron shares following disclosures that the comp=
any did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships ru=
n by former CFO Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last week by another Enron =
executive, Jeff McMahon.=20
Concern about possible conflicts of interest arising from the deals and the=
 company's failure to explain them had dropped the stock to levels not seen=
 since the early 1990s, caused a downgrade in credit status, and brought th=
e SEC in.=20
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive officer Ken Lay said the company was try=
ing to shore up its credibility with the appointment of Powers and the laun=
ching of an internal inquiry.=20
"I have asked the Board to take this action to address fully and forthright=
ly investors' questions and concerns," he said in a statement.=20
"Responding to the SEC offers us an additional opportunity to achieve this =
same goal for investors and we will cooperate fully," he said.=20
The company said a committee led by Powers would include several Enron dire=
ctors who do not work at the company and that it would have the power to "e=
xamine and take any appropriate actions with respect to transactions betwee=
n Enron and entities connected to related parties."=20
Powers, a 1973 graduate of Harvard Law School, has been at the University o=
f Texas law school in Austin since 1978 and was named dean in May 2000. He =
is an expert in torts law and has written extensively on products liability=
.=20
Enron also said the committee hired William McLucas, a former head of the S=
EC's Division of Enforcement, as its attorney. His firm, Wilmer, Cutler & P=
ickering, has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting =
advice, the company said.=20
An SEC spokesman would not comment on any aspect of the matter.=20
Enron was once a Wall Street darling touted by analysts and investors alike=
 as one of the world's most innovative firms. A year ago, its profits and s=
tock price were soaring as it transformed itself from a regulated natural g=
as pipeline company into a high tech wonder creating new Internet-based mar=
kets in an assortment of commodities.=20
But setbacks in broadband trading, overseas investments and the California =
power crisis took some of the shine off Enron's star. In August, the financ=
ial world was stunned when chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after jus=
t six months on the job, saying he wanted a lifestyle change.=20
Investors who thought Enron could do no wrong turned on the company, compla=
ining that its financial statements were incomprehensible and its managemen=
t unresponsive.=20
The capper came two weeks ago when Enron said that, along with the $1 billi=
on charge against its earnings, it also had cut shareholder equity by $1.2 =
billion because of the curious transactions with the Fastow-led entities.=
=20
Fastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been unable to say much because o=
f the SEC probe and a growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron.=
=20
To assure the financial world that it had plenty of cash, Enron tapped into=
 a $3.3 billion credit line last week.=20
But on Monday, Moody's Investors Service dealt the company a blow by cuttin=
g its credit rating to two notches above junk bond status. It warned furthe=
r cuts were possible.=20
Analysts said it was imperative that Enron fully explain the transactions t=
hat led to its fall from grace and disclose whatever liabilities they may h=
ave caused.=20
"Enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures," said Nitin=
 Khandkar, a portfolio manager with Dubai-based Al Majid Investment Co., wh=
ich owns Enron stock. "The accounting policies it follows should not be mer=
ely legal but should also reflect the company's true profitability."=20
"People are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst-case sc=
enario could be," said Mike Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons.

USA: Funds still shying away from former darling Enron.
By Judith Crosson

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DENVER, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Despite bargain prices, mutual fund managers are=
 not rushing to buy shares in Enron Corp. , the once high-flying energy sto=
ck struggling under a blizzard of bad news including a formal SEC probe int=
o some of its deals.=20
Fears of a credit crunch, murky business dealings and the SEC probe are kee=
ping potential buyers wary, although the stock rose 24.5 percent or $2.74 o=
n Wednesday to close at $13.90, its first rise after 10 straight days of lo=
sses.
"The book value is around $11.40 a share. That's why you're seeing buying t=
oday," said Rahim Kassim-Lakha, portfolio manager of US Global Investors' G=
lobal Resources Fund . On Tuesday Enron shares fell 19 percent to their low=
est level in nine years.=20
Kassim-Lakha's fund has only a small holding in Enron. "We actually have be=
en selling the stock. We've sold as high as $60. We've kept a very, very sm=
all position to maintain an interest in the company," he said. "We are not =
in any way overexposed to this stock," he added.=20
But the big question is what other problems are on the horizon for Enron, o=
nce the darling of Wall Street. The stock has been widely held by instituti=
ons, teachers' retirement funds and mutual funds. At the end of June nearly=
 70 percent of its shares were in the hands of 1,175 institutions, accordin=
g to data compiled by Thomson Financial's ShareWatch.FirstCall.=20
Enron said Wednesday that it has appointed a special committee to examine i=
ts finances and communicate with the Securities and Exchange Commission, wh=
ich upgraded its informal inquiry into the company's finances to a formal i=
nvestigation.=20
The SEC is investigating "certain of the matters that were the subject of r=
ecent press reports," the company said in a statement. That was a reference=
 to reports of murky off-balance-sheet deals with partnerships run by the c=
ompany's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.=20
QUESTIONS PERSIST=20
Portfolio manager Kassim-Lakha said he still wants to know more about why C=
hief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling abruptly left in August, more details =
about why Fastow had to vacate his duties and what the company plans to do =
to rekindle investor confidence.=20
"Maybe they need extra help or a team to come in and tell them what's best =
to do," he added.=20
The company said about two weeks ago there were off-balance-sheet deals wit=
h partnerships run by Fastow, prompting the SEC to launch a conflict-of-int=
erest inquiry. Skilling left in August after six months on the job, saying =
he wanted a change in lifestyle.=20
A company spokesman on Tuesday said Enron has pledged to restore investor c=
onfidence.=20
Rick Giesen, who managers the Munder Power Plus fund and who shed his Enron=
 position at the low $30, also said he felt there were too many uncertainti=
es to warrant a buy yet.=20
"We still can't quantify the maximum exposure here from a market standpoint=
," he said. At one point Giesen thought the stock might be a good buy aroun=
d $25, but was dissuaded by all the unanswered questions surrounding the co=
mpany.=20
"A lot of things need to run their course before you can make a reasonable =
assessment of the upside potential against the downside risk," he said.=20
Giesen said Enron could be hit by shareholder lawsuits and the company, the=
 biggest energy trader in North America, could see its volume decline. "Peo=
ple might not want to be the counter-party to Enron's trades," he said.=20
Market watchers are keeping an eye on some big funds like Janus Corp., the =
biggest holder of Enron with 42.8 million shares in its stable, according t=
o data reported at the end of June.=20
A Janus Capitol Corp. spokesman said the Denver-based fund does not comment=
 specifically on holdings, but spokeswoman Shelly Peterson added: "By simpl=
y looking at our June 30th filing it would be inappropriate to assume that =
that's our position today."
