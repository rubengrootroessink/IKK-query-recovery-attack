UK: Enron threatens double hit to credit tool market.
By Tom Bergin

11/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The credit derivatives market faced a double thr=
eat from troubled U.S. energy trader Enron on Thursday, leaving dealers div=
ided on whether the rapid growth of the market might be at risk.=20
Enron's troubles impact the market through credit derivatives contracts wri=
tten on the company, which would be triggered if it files for bankruptcy pr=
otection, and through deals transacted by its Enron Credit subsidiary, whic=
h specialised in trading credit protection on third parties.
Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow investors to hedge o=
r gain the risk of an issuer defaulting on a loan or bond. Default swaps, t=
he most liquid type of credit derivative, involve the buyer paying the prot=
ection seller an annual premium, measured in basis points.=20
Accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers said they had been appointed administrat=
or to Enron's European division on Thursday. Some dealers predicted that if=
 Enron goes under, the credit derivative contracts on Enron and entered int=
o by Enron would be unwound in an orderly way.=20
"It will be another good example of how the market does work... it will reg=
ain people's confidence in the market," said Guy America, vice president fo=
r credit derivatives at J.P. Morgan Chase in London.=20
IMAGE PROBLEM=20
However, other dealers predicted a messy conclusion.=20
"The impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market=
 overall," said a default swaps trader with a European bank.=20
The most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swap=
s, that of U.K. rail operator Railtrack , resulted in banks calling in lawy=
ers to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations.=20
Dealers said Enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market,=
 mainly in New York. As a privately negotiated market, it is difficult to g=
et accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on Enron, howeve=
r, dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on Enron had been=
 written.=20
"(It was) one of the benchmark names for the US credit (derivative market).=
..so you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit throug=
h default swaps," said the European bank trader.=20
UNCERTAIN CREDIT INSURANCE=20
Potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure =
of Enron Credit. The subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigati=
on tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt =
and failing to pay.=20
If end-users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the l=
evel of credit protection they expected, it may make it harder for banks in=
 future to convince more of their customers to start using the tools.=20
On the back of demand from end-users, Enron credit was active in the inter-=
dealer default swaps market. A filing for bankruptcy by Enron Corp. could t=
rigger settlement on all the contracts into which Enron Credit entered.=20
This would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would b=
e concentrated among the limited circle of banks, mainly Enron Corp.s bank =
lenders, which accepted Enron Credit as a dealing counterparty.=20
"It was not broadly accepted as a counterparty," said one dealer, who added=
 that he hadn't seen the firm in the market since October.=20
LENDERS FACE BIGGEST LOSS=20
However, most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credi=
t derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses=
.=20
"Counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure," said the=
 head of credit derivatives at a Euroepan bank.=20
Dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the Enron Credit trading bo=
ok but that this now looked unlikely.=20
"The banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently..were a=
lso involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid =
to take it into their own book," said one trader.=20
Shares in Enron fell 85 percent to 61 cents after a rescue deal by smaller =
rival Dynegy Inc fell apart on Wednesday. On Thursday the company said it m=
ay not pay previously declared dividends.

USA: U.S. stocks set to open flat to a little up.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher=
 on Thursday following some upbeat corporate outlooks, but mixed economic d=
ata and the aftermath of the near-collapse of energy trader Enron Corp. cou=
ld affect trading.=20
Enron , teetering on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions i=
n U.S. history, plunged 85 percent in frenzied trading Wednesday. It dragge=
d on the market as investors also sold amid worry that a rally from Sept. 2=
1 lows reached in the wake of the attacks on the United States was overdone=
.
"The Enron collapse may have significant ramifications on banks and other e=
nergy companies where contracts with Enron may now not be honored. And the =
Enron equity may be worthless," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist with =
brokerage Fahnestock & Co.=20
Equity index futures were up but at one point off earlier highs after the r=
elease of data at 8.30 a.m. (1330 GMT) that showed a rise in jobless claims=
 but also a rise in durable goods orders.=20
"There was a mixed response. We saw an encouraging number in the durable go=
ods but it's too early to see this as a sustained trend up and layoffs cont=
inue to be a real concern," Ackerman added.=20
The number of Americans lining up for first-time jobless benefits rose by 5=
4,000 last week, exceeding Wall Street expectations and showed continued we=
akening in the U.S. labor market. The data showed the number of so-called c=
ontinued claims rose by 301,000 to 4.02 million for the week ended Nov. 17,=
 the biggest one-week increase in 27 years.=20
Orders for costly U.S. durable goods surged at the fastest rate on record i=
n October by 12.8 percent to $184.8 billion, led by huge increases in order=
s for aircraft and defense capital goods. The data may help rekindle hopes =
that the economy has rebounded since the Sept. 11 attacks.=20
Equity index futures suggested a largely flat to slightly higher open. Dece=
mber futures for the S&P 500 index rose 1.70 points to 1,130.80 while futur=
es for the Nasdaq 100 added 8 points to 1,567. Futures for the Dow Jones in=
dustrials gained 7 points at 9,720.=20
Other indicators flagged a mildly higher open. The indicative Dow Jones ind=
ustrial average , which is based on prices of Dow stocks trading in Germany=
's Deutsche Boerse U.S. market segment, rose 45.95 points, or 0.47 percent,=
 to 9,757.81.=20
The Nasdaq-100 premarket indicator was up 9.2 points, or 0.59 percent, base=
d on trading ahead of the open in the tech-heavy index's biggest stocks.=20
Hand-held computer maker Palm Inc. rose in extended-hours trading on Wednes=
day and pre-open trade on Thursday after the company said it expects to mee=
t estimates. Palm rose to $3.7 pre-open from its Nasdaq close of $3.41.=20
Storage networking company Brocade Communications Systems Inc. rose to $30.=
30 ahead of the open from a close at $28.82. The company reported quarterly=
 operating profits fell sharply as the slower economy kept many corporate b=
uyers on the sidelines, although the results beat Wall Street forecasts.=20
Enron, which finished at 61 cents on Wednesday, was a little higher in pre-=
open trading, at 69 cents. Enron sank Wednesday after rival Dynegy Inc. pul=
led out of its planned $9 billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader=
. Credit rating agencies slashed Enron's bonds to junk status and shoved th=
e once mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy.=20
Enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants Citigroup Inc. and=
 JP Morgan Chase & Co. Inc. , which may suffer losses of more than $400 mil=
lion combined on their lending to the energy trading group, according to at=
 least one analyst.=20
On Wednesday, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average surrendered 160.74=
 points, or 1.63 percent, to 9,711.86, the largest drop in about a month an=
d the lowest close since Nov. 12. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index s=
lid 20.98 points, or 1.83 percent, to 1,128.52. The technology-laced Nasdaq=
 Composite Index dropped 48 points, or 2.48 percent, to 1,887.97.=20
In other pre-open activity, software provider FreeMarkets Inc. rose after r=
aising its quarterly revenue and profit outlook after several large custome=
rs renewed long-term contracts. Shares rose to $16.20 from a close of $13.5=
9.=20
H&R Block Inc. , the No. 1 U.S. tax preparer, rose to $37.25 on the Instine=
t trading system after closing at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange. The c=
ompany raised its profit forecasts for the current fiscal year as its secon=

UK: Enron Europe not seen in default on energy trade.

LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Beleaguered U.S. energy trader Enron so far has =
not defaulted on any of its over-the-counter energy swap contracts in Europ=
e, dealers said on Thursday. But many in the trading community have arrange=
d alternative trades to cover their exposure as news emerged that Enron had=
 sought protection from its creditors and appointed accountant Pricewaterho=
useCoopers as administrator.=20
Enron stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smalle=
r rival Dynegy fell apart on Wednesday. The company halted trading on its E=
nronOnline platform on the same day.
"They haven't had any defaults yet. But nobody's trading with them at the m=

said.=20
Dealers said Enron had been missing from the European oil OTC market for ov=
er a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as s=
igns emerged of financial difficulties at America's largest energy trader.=
=20
In the oil market, Enron's trading activities extended right across the pet=
roleum product chain as well as various Brent crude derivatives contracts.=
=20
They said the Dated to front line (DFL) Brent contract, which balances the =
risk of Dated Brent against the front-month IPE futures contract, had seen =
substantial activity on Thursday amid speculation that some players had mov=
ed to square off their positions against exposures to Enron.=20
"It's a case of closing up positions," a Brent trader said.=20
Dealers said Enron was believed to have closed positions on London's Intern=
ational Petroleum Exchange. The IPE declined comment.=20
The dealers said a shortlived price spike late on Wednesday on IPE and NYME=
X crude oil and NYMEX natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session=
 of short covering.=20
"There was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and =
WTI moved up. One broker was doing most of the buying and most people thoug=
ht he was covering for Enron. But the market came straight back down," said=
 one futures dealer.=20
An spokeswoman for the IPE said its compliance department was looking at En=
ron's positions on the market and had been talking with financial services =

"We will be able to maintain the integrity of the market," the spokeswoman =

Analyst: Enron To Have Minimal Material Impact On Brokers
By Chad Bray
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney analyst Guy Moszkowski said the=
 troubles at Enron Corp. (ENE) will not have a material impact on brokerage=
 firms' credit and counterparty energy trading exposure.=20
In a research note Thursday, Moszkowski said the credit exposure to Enron a=
mong the larger securities firms - Morgan Stanley (MWD), Merrill Lynch & Co=
. (MER), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) and Lehman =
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH) - is minimal and is largely hedged where it ex=
ists.
Among the larger brokers, only Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have "meani=
ngful" operations in energy trading, Moszkowski said.=20
"Against the backdrop of significantly improved risk management procedures =
in the industry, we believe exposure to Enron has been curtailed for some t=
ime now, particularly as concern regarding the firm's credit worthiness is =
hardly a new development," Moszkowski said. "However, given the sophisticat=
ion and complexity of energy contracts, we believe it is fair to assume the=
re will be some - albeit likely limited and, ultimately, immaterial - count=
erparty exposure at both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley."=20
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Strauss said Ci=
tigroup Inc. (C) - Salomon Smith Barney's parent - and J.P. Morgan Chase & =
Co. (JPM) could have a total exposure of about $800 million to Enron, inclu=
ding derivatives and secured lending. Total unsecured lending would amount =
to about $270 million, or 8% of the total amount syndicated, he said.=20
Strauss said the Enron mess will likely cost Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chas=
e about 5 cents a share and 10 cents a share, respectively.=20

Enron's Demise Leaves Counterparties With Tough Choices
By Sarah Spikes
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial troubl=
es have left counterparties with difficult choices.=20
Enron's significant trading presence in the U.K. electricity market means t=
here are many trading partners who are counterparties in deals with a compa=
ny that looks bound for bankruptcy.
Since Enron revealed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last mo=
nth related to controversial transactions with entities connected to former=
 Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the company has taken a nosedive th=
at was only momentarily relieved when it looked as if Dynegy might step in =
and rescue the company.=20
Most trading partners were quick to stop trading forward with Enron, althou=
gh some continued, and almost all U.K. companies have some exposure to Enro=
n. Several also continued trading short term contracts.=20
With the company as it is, there are two options for counterparties.=20
They can wait, anticipating that Enron will go bust, and then terminate con=
tracts, or try to invoke a controversial clause in their contracts and get =
Enron to put up more collateral.=20
An apparently much less likely option would be to sit tight and hope that a=
nother buyer for Enron steps in.=20
Of course, terminating contracts doesn't guarantee payment. While Enron app=
ears to have plenty of assets that could be sold to pay off its debts, the =
company's record of inaccurate earnings reporting sheds doubt on the value =
of its assets as well.=20
Terminating parties would be reimbursed, or charged, based on a marked-to-m=
arket value of their contracts.=20
U.K. power prices have declined sharply since the introduction of the New E=
lectricity Trading Arrangements in March, so parties with majority selling =
positions through Enron would suffer financial losses when they had to rese=
ll their power for a lower figure. But had they bought through Enron, they =
would be able to source the same power for less money on the U.K. market to=
day.=20
However, the immediate future of power prices is uncertain, making it diffi=
cult to know exactly which contracts will be in or out of the money. In Aug=
ust, just five months after the introduction of the New Electricity Trading=
 Arrangements, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced that who=
lesale power prices were down substantially and that price volatility on th=
e balancing market had all but stopped.=20
But this has changed with the onset of colder weather, after one of the war=
mest Octobers in recent history led to some complacency. The cost of having=
 to cover a short position has been spiking to well above GBP300/MWh routin=
ely, and prices on the power exchanges have soared for peak time periods.=
=20
The National Grid has also recently issued several warnings regarding a sys=
tem shortfall during peak hours.=20
The second option open to Enron's trading partners involves trying to invok=
e a muddied clause in the standard U.K. power-trading contract - the materi=
al adverse change, or MAC, clause.=20
Asserting that the downgrade of Enron's debt to non-investment grade status=
 clearly calls the security of their contracts into question, they may be a=
ble get Enron to put up more collateral in support of the contracts.=20
Before the downgrade, it might have been tough to invoke this clause, but i=
t's now a possible option.=20

Enron-Dynegy Merger Collapse Roils Europe's Power Mkts
By Sarah Wachter
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Amid news that Enron Corp. (ENE) will spin off its Euro=
pean operations, the collapse of a buyout from Dynegy Inc. (DYN) touched of=
f a bout of volatile, frantic buying in European power markets Thursday, pr=
ompting questions about financial liabilities for the region's power compan=
ies if Enron declares bankruptcy.=20
"There was panic this morning," a European power trader said, with frenzied=
 activity in Germany, Europe's largest power market. Prices for the most im=
portant long-term German contract - full-year electricity in 2002 - moved a=
 full EUR0.40 up and down from one deal to the next. The yield curve streng=
thened as much as EUR0.20 cents sheerly due to Enron's troubles, even while=
 electricity prices dropped, as buyers scurried to close out positions. Tra=
de was eerily quiet in the rest of the forwards market.
By midday, the Nord Pool Power Exchange, market operator for the Nordic reg=
ion, excluded Enron from trading and clearing financial contracts for the f=
irm's Scandinavian arm, Enron Nordic Energy, which had failed to post margi=
n requirements. The UKPX followed shortly thereafter, and suspended Enron's=
 trading rights.=20
Otherwise it was business as usual on other European electricity exchanges,=
 which offer the security of clearing and settlement. German bourses in Lei=
pzig and Frankfurt, the LPX and EEX, and the Netherlands' Amsterdam Power E=
xchange continued to allow Enron to trade Thursday in the spot electricity =
market.=20
It's a steep fall for the once-mighty Enron in Europe, said to account for =
as much as 20% of all power trades in the region. Enron built up its Europe=
an book through an aggressive push in the region, challenging regulations a=
nd filing lawsuits to pry open the region's notoriously slow-to-deregulate =
power markets.=20
Also midday Thursday, consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers said they will adm=
inistrate a split of Enron's European operations, but won't be responsible =
for the energy sales branch. Enron traders - considered among the best and =
the brightest in the industry - will be prize assets to be snapped up by ot=
her European trading houses, which are still expanding, as European power m=
arkets are poised for full market deregulation in coming years.=20
Many now wonder who will now fill the breach and continue to press for much=
-needed reforms.=20
"Enron was one of the few progressive companies promoting the trading busin=
ess," said Katrin Duerwald, an analyst with Germany's HEW Trading AG. "Cont=
inental power companies are conservative, and it's possible we'll enter a p=
eriod of consolidation now."=20
Others wonder whether such a big counterparty can be replaced, and whether =
Europe's nascent power markets may experience a downturn in activity.=20
"Markets will probably dry up a bit. It will be more difficult for companie=
s to trade. It isn't completely obvious to me that these guys will be able =
to have such an active market without Enron," said Vincent Gilles, utilitie=
s research head for UBS Warburg.=20
European power companies rushed Thursday morning to issue statements that t=
heir liabilities to Enron were limited, but analysts remain uncertain what =
the true long-term liabilities will be, if Enron declares bankruptcy.=20
Long-term contracts will be a little more difficult to unravel, says Commer=
zbank utilities analyst, Mark Robinson.=20
Deutsche Bank was one of the few to estimate its full liability Thursday, s=
aying it would come in under $100 million, according to a VWD press report.=
=20
Analysts say Enron did a good job of spreading around its counterparty risk=
 in Europe, so large power companies may not take a big hit, but small util=
ities could suffer significant financial damage, HEW's Duerwald says.=20
In Germany, close to 600 small utilities have recently entered trading, and=
 they tend to have lower risk management thresholds than big power companie=
s. They could either take a financial beating or decide trading is too risk=

Enron's clout is greatest in Europe's lesser-developed power trading market=

to a loss of liquidity if Enron collapses, a power trader said.=20
Traders said the fall of Enron has been a wake-up call for greater vigilanc=

REPEAT: Enron Bankruptcy May Lead To Losing Brazil Assets

RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) could lose the concession fo=
r its Brazilian assets if it files for bankruptcy, Brazil's power sector re=
gulator Aneel said Thursday.=20
"According to Brazil's privatization rules, local assets controlled by Enro=
n would be transferred back to state control in case of insolvency," said a=
n Aneel spokeswoman.
Enron controls Brazilian electricity distributor Elektro Eletricidade e Ser=
vico SA (E.EKO), which was acquired in 1998 for BRR1.479 billion ($1=3DBRR2=
.48). It also owns two gas-fired thermoelectric plants: Eletrobolt, with a =
capacity of 380 megawatts, and Cuiaba, with a 480-MW capacity.=20
The Houston-based company also owns important stakes in natural gas distrib=
utor Companhia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro (E.CDR), or CEG, and =
its smaller unit CEG-Rio.=20
In late April, Brazil's oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR), or Petrobras, =
agreed to pay $240 million for the stake Enron owns in CEG. Petrobras agree=
d to buy the 25.38% stake the U.S. energy group owns in CEG as well as the =
33.75% stake Enron has in CEG-Rio. The deal is seen closing in the next few=
 days.=20
CEG serves the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area, and CEG-Rio supplies indus=
trial towns in the greater Rio de Janeiro region and the interior of the st=
ate.=20
Enron, one of the heavyweights of the international power market, is widely=
 expected to apply for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the downgrading of i=
ts debt to "junk" status and the withdrawal of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) merger p=
lans Wednesday.=20
As reported, the Houston-based energy giant's shares, which traded as high =
as $84.87 this year, closed Wednesday at just 61 cents, 85% lower than thei=
r opening price of $4.11.=20
Enron said it was suspending all payments other than those needed to mainta=
in core operations.=20
The company could still try to sell its Brazilian assets, although the sale=
 of Elektro is unlikely given the large size of the company and the current=
 unfavorable market conditions, analysts said.=20
Elektro serves about 1.6 million clients in 223 municipalities in Brazil's =
industrialized state of Sao Paulo.=20

Fall Of Enron Rattling Nordic Electricity Market
By Frances Schwartzkopff
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COPENHAGEN -(Dow Jones)- The precipitous fall of U.S. power giant Enron Cor=
p. (ENE) hit the Nordic market Thursday, when the region's power exchange s=
aid the company's Scandinavian arm, Enron Nordic Energy, was excluded from =
trading and clearing.=20
The development - plus the continual stream of news about Enron's woes - tr=
iggered worries among market participants over their exposure, and also ove=
r the possibility of wider spreads on the Nord Pool exchange if Enron Nordi=
c Energy closes up shop and liquidity in the market falls.
By the company's own estimates, it is the leading electricity trader in the=
 Nordic market, where it first established its headquarters, in Oslo, in 19=
96. According to Enron Nordic Energy, it traded 77 terawatt-hours last year=
.=20
"If Enron would disappear from the Nordic electricity market, liquidity wou=
ld be substantially reduced and there is a risk that spreads would widen," =
said Bo Andersson, an analyst with Graninge Trading in Stockholm.=20
Nord Pool announced Thursday that Enron Nordic had failed to post required =
financial security margins, and as a result it was being excluded from trad=
ing and clearing of financial contracts. It is still allowed to trade in th=
e spot market.=20
The announcement followed an earlier one Thursday that contracts to which E=
nron Nordic Energy is a party would no longer be cleared automatically. Ins=
tead, each would be evaluated separately, and additional financial security=
 margins could be required.=20
In acting as the clearing agent, Nord Pool assumes the financial risk to en=
sure a contract is fulfilled. Nord Pool officials declined to say how large=
 the exchange's exposure would be, either in the financial or the spot mark=
et, should Enron go bankrupt.=20
But they said the exchange was prepared.=20
"I am relaxed and calm," said CEO Torger Lien, adding he hoped the rest of =
the market was too. "It's a bit messy when the larger players go bust, rega=
rdless of what business you're in. (But) we're set up to deal with this."=
=20
It's yet to be seen whether trading houses that have bilaterally traded con=
tracts with Enron not cleared through Nord Pool will be able to deal with t=
he company's closure, should it happen.=20
Traders declined to go on the record about their positions except to note t=
hat those contracts are at risk.=20
Upwards of 80% of power contracts traded bilaterally are cleared through th=
e exchange, according to Nord Pool estimates. What share Enron has of the r=
emaining portion is hard to say.=20
The total volume of financial contracts traded on Nord Pool in 2000 was 359=
 TWh, while the spot market's traded volume was 97 TWh. Another 1,180 TWh f=
rom the OTC/bilateral market were reported to Nord Pool for clearing.=20
Observers said Enron's troubles could also open the market to other players=
 and reverse opposition to mandatory clearing of bilaterally traded contrac=
ts.=20
Many traders have been opposed to the plan, which is currently under consid=
eration as part of Nord Pool's application to the Norwegian government to b=
ecome a licensed financial exchange and a licensed clearing house.=20
That may be one upside to Enron's demise, said Nord Pool's Lien. Otherwise,=
 he said, "Enron is an innovative, strong company. It's quite sad."=20
But, he added, "They haven't gone bust yet."=20

Enron's Demise Leaves Counterparties With Tough Choices
By Sarah Spikes
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial troubl=
es have left counterparties with difficult choices.=20
Enron's significant trading presence in the U.K. electricity market means t=
here are many trading partners who are counterparties in deals with a compa=
ny that looks bound for bankruptcy.
Since Enron revealed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last mo=
nth related to controversial transactions with entities connected to former=
 Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the company has taken a nosedive th=
at was only momentarily relieved when it looked as if Dynegy might step in =
and rescue the company.=20
Most trading partners were quick to stop trading forward with Enron, althou=
gh some continued, and almost all U.K. companies have some exposure to Enro=
n. Several also continued trading short term contracts.=20
With the company as it is, there are two options for counterparties.=20
They can wait, anticipating that Enron will go bust, and then terminate con=
tracts, or try to invoke a controversial clause in their contracts and get =
Enron to put up more collateral.=20
An apparently much less likely option would be to sit tight and hope that a=
nother buyer for Enron steps in.=20
Of course, terminating contracts doesn't guarantee payment. While Enron app=
ears to have plenty of assets that could be sold to pay off its debts, the =
company's record of inaccurate earnings reporting sheds doubt on the value =
of its assets as well.=20
Terminating parties would be reimbursed, or charged, based on a marked-to-m=
arket value of their contracts.=20
U.K. power prices have declined sharply since the introduction of the New E=
lectricity Trading Arrangements in March, so parties with majority selling =
positions through Enron would suffer financial losses when they had to rese=
ll their power for a lower figure. But had they bought through Enron, they =
would be able to source the same power for less money on the U.K. market to=
day.=20
However, the immediate future of power prices is uncertain, making it diffi=
cult to know exactly which contracts will be in or out of the money. In Aug=
ust, just five months after the introduction of the New Electricity Trading=
 Arrangements, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets announced that who=
lesale power prices were down substantially and that price volatility on th=
e balancing market had all but stopped.=20
But this has changed with the onset of colder weather, after one of the war=
mest Octobers in recent history led to some complacency. The cost of having=
 to cover a short position has been spiking to well above GBP300/MWh routin=
ely, and prices on the power exchanges have soared for peak time periods.=
=20
The National Grid has also recently issued several warnings regarding a sys=
tem shortfall during peak hours.=20
The second option open to Enron's trading partners involves trying to invok=
e a muddied clause in the standard U.K. power-trading contract - the materi=
al adverse change, or MAC, clause.=20
Asserting that the downgrade of Enron's debt to non-investment grade status=
 clearly calls the security of their contracts into question, they may be a=
ble get Enron to put up more collateral in support of the contracts.=20
Before the downgrade, it might have been tough to invoke this clause, but i=
t's now a possible option.=20

Europe Fin Services Cos To Take Small Hit From Enron
By Evelina Shmukler and Catherine Taylor
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Europe's financial services groups are expected to be =
hit by Wednesday's downgrade of Enron's debt rating to junk, but analysts s=
ay the impact isn't going to be as severe as it may first look on paper.=20
Many large European banks underwrote or arranged large loans for the troubl=
ed energy trading company, but they've sold off a large amount of that debt=
 to other banks or insurers, mitigating the effects on their provisioning a=
nd balance sheets.
That syndication, however, makes it unclear at this point how much Enron de=
bt paper each bank and insurer in the region is holding onto.=20
Enron's troubles are a "good reminder that there is still high unexpected c=
redit risk latent in the large corporate loan books of banks," said UBS War=
burg's Anik Sen. But he estimates that the large European banks' exposure r=
isk is still relatively small.=20
In total, he estimates an exposure risk of about 2% of the market capitaliz=
ation per large European bank - or around the intraday volatility of most b=
anks anyway. It represents about 5% to 10% of a bank's earnings as a one-of=
f hit, implying, he said, that the banks' capital is not at risk.=20
Most of Europe's major banks, and some minor ones, have helped to finance l=
oans for Enron. The bank's with the greatest involvement, according to Fox-=
Pitt, are Barclays, ABN Amro (ABN), Credit Suisse (CS), Societe Generale (F=
.SGS), Credit Lyonnais (CL) and Dresdner Bank AG (G.DRS).=20
Fox-Pitt estimates these six banks each has exposure of $400 million to $45=
0 million, and though the downgrading of Enron will increase financial mark=
et risk generally, they said these banks will feel the weakening effect mos=
t.=20
Enron's debt rating downgrading is "clearly a significant event for Europea=
n banks," Sen said, but he pointed out most of the large European banks don=
't keep all of those loans on their books.=20
"Banks are in the business of mitigating risk," he said. The few banks Sen =
is concerned about are those that keep the loans as part of their core busi=
ness, rather than selling them off. These banks' holdings, especially those=
 of some German and Italian ones, could be a concern for shareholders.=20
Also smaller European banks, to whom even a small loan could be significant=
, may find this situation a "painful experience," Sen said. Banks' Say Don'=
t Overreact=20

The large European corporates, however, tend to not hold onto such loans. B=
arclays, for example, has said in the past that it sells down at least 90% =
of what it provides via syndication.=20
A Barclays spokeswoman said Wednesday that the bank's exposure was not mate=
rial, but investors seem worried anyway. Barclays shares fell 4% Wednesday =
to 2093 pence. Thursday, shares fell another 1.5%, before recovering to a s=
midge about the previous day's close at 2106 pence.=20
Investment bank Nomura, however, staunchly maintained its "buy" rating on B=
arclays shares, explaining the size of the exposure is being substantially =
overestimated.=20
But Nomura also said the potential fallout from an Enron bankruptcy will co=
ntinue to weigh on shares of global wholesale banks until the issue is reso=
lved.=20
European banks' share prices have already begun to feel it: ABN Amro was do=
wn 1.2% to EUR17.73 and Credit Suisse fell 0.4% to CHF64.90 at 1215GMT. Soc=
iete Generale was down 0.8% at EUR61.75, and Credit Lyonnais fell 0.6% at E=
UR37.64.=20
Commerzbank shares were off 2.3% to EUR 19.54.=20
Commerzbank spokesperson Dennis Phillips said the bank's exposure to Enron =
"is a low double-digit million Euro figure, and it has already been account=
ed for in terms of provisioning for 2001."=20
French insurance group AXA SA (AXA) also said there would be no direct impa=
ct on the company, even though one of its subsidiaries is one of Enron's la=
rgest shareholders. An AXA spokesperson said that the subsidiary holds the =
shares in an investment fund on behalf its investors. AXA shares were up 1%=
 to EUR24.24 at 1230GMT.=20
In general, Europe's insurers are unlikely to have a large exposure to Enro=
n, said Tom Bennett, a European insurance analyst at BNP Paribas. As far as=
 their bond portfolios are concerned, they tend to make less risky investme=
nts than banks, he said.=20
"They don't invest in junk, it's the basic rule," he said. "People are prep=
ared to take much more risk [at banks]." Large, listed European insurers "t=
end not to invest outside the investment grade area, and Enron hasn't been =
that for ages."=20
In the U.K., both Standard Chartered PLC (U.STA) and Royal Bank of Scotland=
 Group PLC (RBSB) have some exposure to Enron, but spokespeople at both ban=
ks downplayed any potential risk.=20
Carolyn McAdam of Royal Bank of Scotland declined to say to what extent the=
 Scottish bank was exposed to Enron.=20
"All we're prepared to say just now is that Enron is obviously a very large=
 business, with a range of business interests and assets," she said. "And i=
t's far too early at this stage to reach any firm conclusions on the level =
of our exposure."=20
Standard Chartered also said it has some exposure.=20
"But it is very small. We're probably one of the smallest, if not the small=
est, lenders in one of the syndicates, so it's small stuff for us," Standar=
d Chartered spokeswoman Pamela McGann said.=20
She declined to quantify "small," but said, "it's not something that's goin=
g to keep me awake tonight, that's for sure."=20

Dollar Under Pressure on U.S. Economic Woes, Enron Situation

11/29/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires=20
NEW YORK -- The dollar was under pressure Thursday, weighed down by a combi=
nation of the Federal Reserve's somber outlook for the U.S. economy, waning=
 U.S. consumer confidence and concerns about the financial woes of Enron Co=
rp.
In morning New York trading, the euro was at 89.04 U.S. cents, up from 88.8=
2 cents late Wednesday in New York. The dollar was at 123.07 yen, little ch=
anged from 123.06 yen late Wednesday.=20
The greenback was also at 1.6480 Swiss francs, compared with 1.6465, while =
sterling was trading at $1.4254, down slightly from $1.4259 late Wednesday.=
=20
The dollar managed to get a brief respite from U.S. durable goods data for =
October, which showed orders for big ticket items sharply rebounded by a re=
cord amount, more than reversing September's large drop.=20
But the overall tone for the dollar remains weak, amid a growing sense that=
 the U.S. might not be able to rebound from recession as fast as previously=
 thought.=20
"The dollar is a little heavy across the board," said Robert Sinche, head o=
f global currency strategy at Citibank in New York. "Unless you get somethi=
ng completely outrageous, it looks likely to remain that way."=20
The dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and th=
e yen, as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions.=20
While the Enron situation doesn't have a direct effect on foreign exchange =
markets, analysts said that it wasn't helping dollar sentiment.=20
"The market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions," said Mr. S=
inche. "Enron...is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst."=20
As is often the case, the euro's gains appeared to be more a result of pess=
imism towards the U.S. rather than any optimism about the euro zone.=20
The market largely shrugged off third quarter euro-zone gross domestic prod=
uct data earlier Thursday which came in exactly as expected: up 0.1% on the=
 quarter and 1.3% on the year.=20
The dollar's direction Thursday will also be influenced by U.S. shares, wit=
h prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the Enron woes=
.=20
Analysts said a sustained move above the 89 cent level could set the euro u=
p for a test of 89.45 cents and then 90 cents, which is expected to offer m=
ore formidable resistance.=20
Its difficulty in making a concerted push for 90 cents is probably down to =
the potential outflows related to the Morgan Stanley Capital International =
indexes rebalancing, and the Deutsche Telekom/Voicestream deal.=20
The first phase of the new MSCI weightings comes into effect Friday, and sh=
ould involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities.=
=20
So far, this seems to have been discounted, although it could still help to=
 keep a lid on the euro.=20
The lockup period for Voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their Deutsc=
he Telekom shares expires Dec. 1, which could prompt them to offload the st=
ock, in effect resulting in sizable euro-zone outflows.=20
Benign inflation data from Switzerland out earlier Thursday - up only 0.3% =
in November on the year - has paved the way for the Swiss National Bank to =
cut interest rates at its next meeting Dec. 7.=20
"With the market looking only for a rate cut of 25 basis points, we would e=
xpect the Swiss franc to remain capped around current levels," said UBS War=
burg analysts.=20

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today expr=
essed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken=
 steps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being ex=
perienced by Enron, including instituting a trading halt.=20
"Although we didn't completely cease trading with Enron until yesterday, in=
 the course of our normal credit practices, we took steps to limit our expo=
sure to Enron. We currently have approximately $100 million in non- collate=
rized exposure to Enron. We are closely monitoring this unfortunate situati=
on to determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate," said Richa=
rd J. Osborne, executive vice president and chief risk officer for Duke Ene=
rgy.
Osborne was referring to Dynegy's announcement that it is terminating the m=
erger agreement with Enron and the decision by major rating agencies to dow=
ngrade Enron's long-term debt below investment grade.=20
"The market is larger than any one player and is very resilient. Enron's ro=
le and activities in the energy market have significantly diminished over t=
he past several weeks. And, market liquidity is provided by many active tra=
ding and marketing companies that have effective risk management practices =
and sound capitalizations," Osborne noted.=20
"We at Duke Energy are committed to our customers and fulfilling our contra=
cts and services without disruption. We also continue to see strong growth =
opportunities ahead and are extremely confident in our ability to achieve o=
r exceed our financial targets this year and next," Osborne said.=20
The company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its s=
tated guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent compound annual growth in earnin=
gs per share from a base of $2.10 in 2000. Based on the strong results repo=
rted for the first three quarters of this year, Duke Energy had previously =
communicated it will likely exceed 15 percent earnings growth in 2001. Yest=
erday's developments do not change that view.=20
Duke Energy, a diversified multinational energy company, creates value for =
customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets a=
nd expertise. Duke Energy manages a dynamic portfolio of natural gas and el=
ectric supply, delivery and trading businesses -- generating revenues of mo=
re than $49 billion in 2000. Duke Energy, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.,=
