We did establish with Product Control, but you know how I feel about that.  We are still getting a number of calls from Commercial people asking to prioritze, hence the need for the note.  I am okay to deal with exceptions as they arise.  

I did speak with Kim and we are utilizing there team to help build files.  Thanks.

I need to speak with you about this week's schedule to coordinate travel plans with UBS - Stamford.  Please give me a call.

Regards,
Bill

I thought we did establish Product Control on Friday  - let's just deal with Dave issues on priorities as we catch them between us.

Did you meet with Kim?

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

You may want to send a note to your commercial team to channel all new customer requests through Dave Forster and me.  I would like to be copied to make sure Dave has a clue as to what are real priorities.  Once we get up and running and the volume drops, I would be happy to coordinate this effort.
