Louise,
 
It is my understanding that we will be buying the gas in Argentina from either the northern or eastern end of ENAP's production system in the Magallenes Region of Chile, down near the Tiera del Fuego.  I know that there is an interconnect point to purchase gas off TGS at the northern end of ENAP's system.  Nonetheless, you will find attached the presentation that the South American office put together for our visit with ENAP's management regarding Enron's presence in South America and the terms & conditions for a notional gas marketing agreement (the last three slides).  This was set up for delivery into TGS as outlined.  I have a call into Federico as well and will provide any further clarification if necessary.  Don't hesitate to call with any other questions.  We should have the revised letter agreement with ENAP signed up within the next week.
 
Thanks,
Chris
