No problem.  Could I please have the BHLP update ready for next week's version?  

In addition, what was the outcome of the Mariner update meeting with Tim Detmering?  Plus, I have been thinking about the Mariner board member representation from Enron (mostly ECR).  Wouldn't be appropriate to have Tom Byargeon as a board member? Production Offshore does have MEGS/Pluto and their commercial group's focus is on the deepwater GOM. 

Regards, Jean

Can you please add something on Bridgeline to your weekly deal update just so I keep up to speed on that.
Can you email to Tammie going forward as well as me as she will be keeping a file for John.

Thanks

Louise
