He has not talked to me. He cc'd me on an email this morning - to which I replied. I planned on conversing with him this morning, but the email beat me to the punch.  He has been working independently on this effort. 

I had a lengthy conversation with Trevor last night, spoke with Sherman this morning and also met with Karen.  I have made Brian very aware of Karen's efforts to clean up BHLP - I do not understand why Deanna Washington is involved with BHLP at allm
