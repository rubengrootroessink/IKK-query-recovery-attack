Louise,

I think that John (see below) raises a valid point regarding our credit dis=
missal of the airline industry.  Enron does a very good job "wooing" a sect=
or doing good times, but as soon as the commercial operations get tough we =
dump like a hot potato.  As such, when we will try to entertain the airline=
 sector in the future to do risk management and hedging through Enron, subs=
tantial ill will this from prior disposal will have been created.  Do we ca=
re? =20

I have got to think that there should exist sufficient origination opportun=
ities for companies going into bankruptcy -- maybe for Lydecker's organizat=
ion?

Just a thought, Mrha

Jean, =20

I am forwarding the credit watch list for your review.  I have one concern =
as a member of the origination team ("NO TRADES"-- Nine Energy Services, LL=
C and all Airline counterparties (including but not limited to the followin=
g):  Air Canada, Airtran Holdings, America West Airlines, America West Hold=
ings Corp., American Airlines, Inc., AMR Corp., Chautauqua Airlines, Contin=
ental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Jet Blue Airways, Midway Airlines, Northwe=
st Airlines, Sabina Blanca SL, Southwest Airlines, United Air Lines, U.S. A=
irways and the VAL Group.)  I would hope that we are not just abandoning th=
is segment of the industry.  I know Enron has been courting these counterpa=
rties for the last few years to hedge their energy needs.  I hope we are do=
ing whatever is possible to work through the financial issues.  If Enron is=
 going to keep market share in this industry we need to think about how we =
manage the risk and retain the customers.
