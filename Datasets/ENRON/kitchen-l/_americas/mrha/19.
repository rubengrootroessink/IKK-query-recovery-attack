Louise,

I think what I really wanted to convey is the following:

1. John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.

2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of "contract focus" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.

3. Based on Kevin Miller's memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha
