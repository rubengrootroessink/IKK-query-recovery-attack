Linda
It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday at Enron Field and to learn more
about Enron Producer One. Looks like you have a winner. I define that as
solving a producer's problem before, sometimes, the producer knows the
magnitude of the problem.

please keep us in mind when you have case study success stories involving
pipe line and gathering systems and measurement issues.

Again, all the best to you. If I can help further, please holler.
