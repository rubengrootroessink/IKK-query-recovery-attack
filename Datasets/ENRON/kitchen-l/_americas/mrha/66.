Jean,

I talked with Mike last night and I think that it would be beneficial if yo=
u sat down and talked with him about his expectations and try and get him a=
n answer on his situation by the end of this week.  He will be in this afte=
rnoon and will be available to talk with you.  He has re-confirmed his fait=
h you in that you will be able to go to bat appropriately for him and has a=
voided pushing it very much until now.  He is looking for an answer by the =
end of this week if at all possible.  I know that we cannot tie his compens=
ation to future business that he may bring in through deals with AEP.  Howe=
ver, I strongly believe that taking care of him properly at this point in t=
ime will bear significant fruit for our P&L through 2001.  This may or may =
not be my place to transmit this to you, but I felt it was appropriate as I=
 believe it will have a real impact to our business.  I have developed a st=
rong commercial relationship with Mike and plan on continuing it after he l=
eaves Enron as he will be a good source for getting my group into deals.  M=
ike has been a strong commercial resource for Enron over time, particularly=
 in light of the fact that he has put his future role at AEP on hold to get=
 this deal done. He clearly has been an unselfish, integral commercial reso=
urce create significant value for Enron on a very difficult, complex deal.

Nonetheless, I would talk to him this afternoon and try to get him taken ca=
re of this week to close the loop appropriately.  I am preparing a closing =
celebration plan for your review later today.

Thanks,
Chris
