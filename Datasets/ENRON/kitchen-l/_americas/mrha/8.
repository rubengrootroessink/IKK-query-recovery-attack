Louise,

Reliant did not acquire the land on Friday evening because:
Enron does not have a complete chain of title. We only had it going back to our acquisition of the land.  They have gone to the court house this weekend to get relevant documents.
We will not indemnify them on potential environmental issues - but they should have done due dilgence this past weekend.

I am confident that we will send the land to either Texas Brine or Reliant.  Reliant will be contacting me today regarding the prior two issues and as stated on Friday, they have already cut a cashier's check for $3 million.  

Regards, Mrha
