Louise,

I am under the assumption that we should be moving forward with the sale of Pluto/MEGS to Duke Energy Field Services as well as the sale of the Napoleonville Land to Texas Brine.  In addition, I am trying to work out a transaction to sell the pad gas in Dow Wells 13 & 14 to an outside counterparty that would be leasing that storage capacity from Dow.

Are there any types of transactions that would be "inappropriate" to close?  For example, if we do an outsourcing deal for three years, how do we know that Dynegy will honor the contract?

Regards, Jean
