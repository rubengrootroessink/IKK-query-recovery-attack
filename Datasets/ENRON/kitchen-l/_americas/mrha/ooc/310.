Subject:	Organizational Changes - East Power

We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success.
