We can talk about it at 10:00am, however, I do not think the split will work as you propose. The vast majority of the industrial process load uses more than 25 MW on peak which is and should continue to be the focus of ENA. The target companies and sites we will focus on down here will  average somewhere in the 10-20 MW peak range(remember, non-process load, aggregation of sites).

After EES bought back the minority shareholders, there has been increasing overlap in the marketplace between EES/ENA. The reasoning behind deliniating where and how each group will focus was to alleviate the external overlap, reduce any friction between the groups, and increase both groups productivity. 

I don't think there should be any issue on the Fertilizer companies, but I'll doublecheck.

Talk to you at 10:00am.
