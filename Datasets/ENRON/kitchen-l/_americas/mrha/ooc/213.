'For the Record' questions for the ENSIDE Newsletter.  I will send you several issues so that you can see final form.


I usually break it into four segments to keep it simple. If someone wants to elaborate on a point or digress, that is OK.

I.  	Background/Education

II.	Industry Experience

III.	Goals/Priorities for the Future

IV.	Personal Business Philosophy

Let me know what else you need!
