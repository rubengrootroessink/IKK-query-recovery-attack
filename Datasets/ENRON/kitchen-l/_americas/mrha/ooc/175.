     Dear Louise,

     Thank you for your registration to FORTUNE's Most Powerful Women
     in Business Summit to be held October 3-5, 2001 at the Ritz-Carlton
     Huntington Hotel & Spa in Pasadena, Calif.

     We're sorry to have to tell you this, but the response has been
     tremendously strong, and we've reached capacity.  As of now, we're not
     able to accommodate your registration. You've been added to the
     waitlist for the Summit. However, we'll notify you by August 15 if a
     space becomes available.

     In the meantime, if we can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate
     to call us at 212-522-8478.

     Best Regards,

     Amy
