Christie:

Thanks for your fast response.  I look forward to hearing back from you
and/or Louise with the data requested.  We have already had a large number
of inquiries about the case, even though it's not yet officially listed for
release.  I have a feeling we have a "best seller" on our hands.

Regards,
Chris
