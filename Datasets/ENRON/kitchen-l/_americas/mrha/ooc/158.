Louise--Enjoyed talking with you. We're inviting our Summit speakers and
panelists to invite a guest for Thursday evening, as follows.....ignore the
Aug. 13 deadline, but please let us know as soon as you can. Thanks!....

Louise--We're so looking forward to seeing you at the FORTUNE Most Powerful
Women Summit, and we'd like to extend an additional invitation: Would you
like to have a notable Los Angeles-area woman as your guest for our gala
evening Thursday, October 4? The dinner, at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena,
will include our keynote session with Jack Welch and also a special
performance by Tracey Ullman on "Women of Style and Substance."

The idea here is two-fold: to give speakers like you the opportunity to
include a special guest in one of the highlight sessions of the summit, and
to sprinkle the evening with some of LA's most influential women. We ask
that you keep this theme--powerful women of LA--in mind as you decide whom
to invite.

Please let Suzanne O'Leary (212-522-9444) or me know your suggested guest's
name and contact information by e-mail or phone by Monday, August 13, which
will allow us to coordinate the list and invitations. In the next few
weeks, we'll send an invitation to the person you suggest and note that
we'd like her to join us for the evening as your guest.

Thanks much, and all the best--Pattie, 212-522-2120
