Louise-
 
Please accept my sincerest apology for the mistake of including the EA message in the last EnTouch. As you know, this electronic newsletter is to be a vehicle for information and Eric and I mistakenly thought this was news for all.  It will not happen again.
 
In addition, I am trying to find out why the Messaging Administration changed the EOL bullets into question marks. I intend to find out where the disconnect is between what I submit and later approve, and what is printed the next day. 
 
I have told them that this should never happen.
 
Please let me know what else I can do to make our internal communications better.
 
Kathie
