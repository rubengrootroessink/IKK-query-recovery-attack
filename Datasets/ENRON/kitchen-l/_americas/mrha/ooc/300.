Hi Kim -

Dennis Vegas and I would like to set up a brief 15 minute meeting with John.  experienceENRON has already been supporting his commercial team, however, we would like to increase John's awareness about the repertoire of services in our group that can potentially help his team achieve their revenue goals.  By talking to John, it will also help us understand what opportunities exist in his organization and where we can add value. 

Dennis and I have been meeting with the wholesale services business unit leaders and would like a few minutes to meet John.  If possible we would like to combine a meeting with John and Louise, but let us know what John prefers.

Thank you.
Carrie
