Per Sarah Davis' voice mail:

As we prepare to open Enron's child care center this fall, we invite you to join Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Sarah Davis on a tour of local child care centers to observe best practices in the Houston child care community. Your feedback is vital in helping us develop the best child care center for our employees. Though the tour will consume a significant part of your day, we believe that the knowledge gained from our site visits will be worth it. 

The tour will take place on Thursday, May 3rd. Our agenda follows:

	10:30 AM	Depart from front of Enron building via van
	11:15 AM	Tour Creme de la Creme Town and Country facility
	12:45 PM	Tour Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility
	2:15 PM	Tour Cathedral House Montessori School downtown facility
	3:30 PM	Debriefing Session (EB 1679) 
	4:15 PM	Adjourn


Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedules to participate in this tour! Please RSVP to me at X-36202 no later than Wednesday at 10:00 AM to confirm your attendance. We look forward to seeing you Thursday!


Regards,

Charla Stuart
