Believe it or not - I am still finalizing the individual plans for each of hte Enron Americas. I notice we are currently picking up all 19 people from Gary Hickerson's group which I presume is a mistake.  I assume we will get some form of allocation based on the work he does for ENA but  probably not $11.64 million/annum.  I am going to let the accounts team know there is an issue but could one of you let me know who is responsible for the plans in your group.

Just thought I'd check that I wasn't missing something.

Thanks

Louise
