I don't have all the facts to agree or disagree.  Until John Z has approval to trade currency, I wouldn't think you would want to go down this path.  In addition, I'm sure  you know hegding currency this big and late of Fridays is tough.

By the way, I agree with Zufferli on this.

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.
