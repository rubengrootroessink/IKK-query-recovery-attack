Hi Rahil,

I'm attaching two EnronOnline cases that were put into our system couple of
weeks ago.
The second, short case, is a classroom handout that summarizes EOL's
success and signals new challenges.
Just FYI--we are now developing a multimedia EOL case, which will be
released on CD ROM.  It will have links to video interviews with Jeff, Ken
and Louise.

We are very happy with our Enron cases; they will most likely become
bestsellers.  It was a great learning experience for me and Prof. Bartlett,
and you were a big part of that experience.  Thank you so much for all your
help!  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or need
anything else.
Regards,
Meg
