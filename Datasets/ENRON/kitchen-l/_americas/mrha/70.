Please do not forward this message to anyone.  This email articulates the f=
rustration that we have had with EES since the very beginning of this year.=
  Per your recommendation for pricing, we contacted Don Black who forwarded=
 us to Sean Holmes who forwarded us to Richard Zdunkiewicz.  Chris is meeti=
ng with Richard this morning, but I am highly doubtful of its effectiveness=
.

Like Chris, I am tired of communicating with a lot of VPs who are not accou=
ntable for their business.  I do not understand why EES does not see the va=
lue in capturing the tolling spread between gas and power.  Compressor load=
 is much more manageable than their standard retail customer. =20

If need be, should I go talk to Delainey? Whalley?  I am trying to be patie=
nt, but I want to close some compression deals this quarter.

Regards, Mrha

Jean,

Per your request, here is the e-mail that showed up in my inbox without eve=
n a phone calle to Lacye or me.  I was specifically told by Scott Gahn that=
 he had talked to Dave Delainey and Janet Deitrich about involving EES orig=
ination in this loop and they agreed that it did not make sense.  We were r=
eferred to Jim Wood who we talked to and he responded back to us that he di=
d not believe that EES would be able to work with us as our deals did not f=
it their new "standardized" pistol.  We then moved to Don Black and you kno=
w the rest from there.  We keep having these people show up in our world an=
d I am tired of it because all they do is waste our time and stick their ha=
nd out for having done nothing.  John Kiani called Jodi Thrasher (an analys=
t who he had been working with) to sniff out the purpose of this meeting an=
d she told him that Greg Sharp had called it to determine which people we s=
hould be working with per EES' "standard products & services".  This is the=
 absolute last thing I want to do because we are bringing highly valued cus=
tomers (via centralized predictable loads to manage) that can create signif=
icant value for Enron (from more of a wholesale perspective than anything e=
lse).  Trying to fit this to EES' standard pistol will kill this business a=
nd continue one of the worst relationship/partnerships that I have experien=
ced in my career to date between EES and ECS.  Remember, this is the same g=
roup who went so far as to negotiate and put in writing what they could do =
with Stagecoach for the summer option and then back out two weeks ago which=
 made us look bad in front of TGP and nearly jeopardized the deal.  Bo Barn=
well notified the customer without talking to Andrew first.  This is in dir=
ect contradiction to what Scott Gahn and Jim Wood told us as well.  Please =
let us know how you want to handle to get this meeting terminated and get t=
hese people out of our life.

Sorry for the long-windedness but I am clearly fed up.  Thanks in advance f=
or your help.  We will be meeting with Richard Zdunkiewicz at 11:00 and we =
will let you know how that goes.  Let me know how your conversation with Do=
n Black goes.

Thanks,
Chris =20
