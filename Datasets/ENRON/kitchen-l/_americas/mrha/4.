Here's the deal:
=20
There is some P&L that needs to be taken whether we sell or not: (1) a depr=
eciation catchup (impairment) that has not been taken of approx $647,000 (r=
emember approx $4 million was taken in the 3rd qtr, but upon calculation, n=
ot enough) and (2) a depreciation catchup for the 4th qtr (thru November, a=
ssuming a quick sale) based on a units-of production depreciation method (t=
o avoid impairment problems going forward) of approx $2.2 million.  These t=
ogether are approx $2.8 million of loss, but again, I have suggested that t=
hese need to be taken whether we sell or not.  The sell/hold decision re: t=
he Duke deal is a loss of $1.95 million (adjusted NBV after impairments/dep=
r catchup of $16 million, less the $14.1 of sales proceeds) in exchange for=
 the $14.1 million in cash.  So, sale is proposed at below book.  Jean/Lisa=
 would think of the Duke deal as Mariner/Burlington cash flows being discou=
nted at 12%, plus a premium of $1.3 million. Evidently they have found some=
 reserves upside, thus the premium above the base cash flow annuity. Any qu=
estions, pls call me - x 37665.
