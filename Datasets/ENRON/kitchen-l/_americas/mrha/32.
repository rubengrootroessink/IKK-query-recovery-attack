Gerald,

Please find attached our C.A. with Marathon's modifications.  After receiving appropriate legal examination, I would like to turn around this C.A. A.S.A.P. (i.e., today). 

Best Regards,

Jean

Jean,

Thanks for your note. Please find attached the CA with some minor
changes. If acceptable please sign and return two copies for our
signature. Also on a separate note, we have named a manager to pursue
this strategy going forward. I would like to introduce you to Walt Madro
on my return at the end of the week.

Regards

Paul

Subject: Asset Management Outsourcing Arrangement Proposal
Importance: High


Paul,

As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a
draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management
outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify
initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further
refined by a transaction team.

I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in
the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal
department.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, 

Jean
