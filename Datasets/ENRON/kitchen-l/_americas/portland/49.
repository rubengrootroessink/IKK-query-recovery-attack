Mike signed on Friday which is great news.  Richter, Heizenrader, and I are all waiting on language that gets us comfortable with the California litigation risk.  In case you were wondering, we are not talking to one another about this language.  Each person is working independently on this.  We have been waiting on Michele Cash for a week now on proposed language (and for me, a copy of Enron's corporate bylaws explaining officer indemnification).  I will keep you posted.
