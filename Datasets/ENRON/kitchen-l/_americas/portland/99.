Transcripts of Lay's and Skilling's interviews are available as well.  PBS didn't have this scheduled on its program listing for Houston last night, but from what I hear, everyone on the interview panel was grilled on the show (Skilling takes on a fairly aggressive stance).

Hope both of you and Scott are all doing well.

Affectionate thoughts,
- Rahil
