	As a heads up, we just got an unconfirmed report that Jeff Gertz, investigative reporter for the New York Times, is apparently writing a "front page story" for the NYT.  While still in draft, the article will focus on "Enron price gouging in California."  That's about all we know at this point, but will try to learn more details.     

	By way of background, I understand that Gertz is a Pulitzer prize winning journalist.  He has a reputation of being aggressive.  His last two NYT articles have been on the California situation and were entitled "Some Evidence Of Overcharges" (Mar 23) and "Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency is Weak in Oversight of Utilities" (also Mar 23).   By way of some of my personal interests, he also broke the story on the Los Alamos Wen Ho Lee spy case and subsequently in February a sccop on the FBI bungled investigation of Lee.
