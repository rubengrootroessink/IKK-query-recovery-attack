Per Chip's note, this is still s/t change.  The DASH is drafted to allow for approval subject to Delta signing and Hancock providing a financing commitment letter.  Neither of those have occured, but are expected to occur today.

Chris,

This draft is still subject to Dave Gorte's comments in which case I would hold off sending it to Louise.  I hope to have his comments soon.
