These guys move fast.  Besides requiring a little editing, I told Allegheny that we would prefer to wait till Monday so that we have time to place phone calls to agencies/gov officials in Nevada before it hits the wires.  I dont think we need to mention Enron in the release.  I will copy you on a later draft.

Chris:
Per my voicemail, attached is the Press Release regarding Allegheny's 15-year natural gas tolling agreement with Enron's Las Vegas Congeneration facility. Please note that Enron is NOT mentioned in the release.  

According to Allegheny, this deal was closed this morning at 6am. At this point, Allegheny is not sure if they are even going to issue this release, but they would like our approval just in case they decide to move forward and release it. If they do decide to issue the release, they are aiming to do so TODAY. Therefore, please provide your comments to me asap. 

Thanks in advance for your help and please contact me with any questions.
