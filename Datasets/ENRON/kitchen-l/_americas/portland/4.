Louise,

Although nothing is going particularly well, here is what West Power Orig is focused on:

1. Sell Turbines
2. Sell Longview/Equipment
3. Close Sale of Saguaro
4. Sell San Joaguin ERC's - no bid for all; several smaller bids
5. Close Muni Commodity Deals - LODI, WAPA
6. Procure Retail Supply - RFP to 10 Generators
7. Assist Mid-Market w/ Coverage - playing catchup
8. Transmission - San Fran and other 
9  Joint Development Agreement - Roseville

I am obviously at your service to help on anything else.

Regards,

Chris Calger
