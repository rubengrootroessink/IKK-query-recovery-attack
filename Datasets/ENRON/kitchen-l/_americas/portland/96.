Amy,

Louise is back from maternity leave and I think will want to get back up to speed with where we are in Portland regarding these contracts. When you get Tim to finalise his "plan" I suggest we discuss with Louise and then decide how best to proceed.

Amy-
Attached are the original numbers submitted for Belden, Motley, Swerbin, and Wolfe.  Also included are what the numbers could possibly look like for Richter.  If you have any questions or need additional information, please let me know.  Thanks.
