I have to say.  It's kind of nice not having a deal with them.

We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a structure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short position in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the legal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract and the requirements for this potential deal.  Notional terms:
