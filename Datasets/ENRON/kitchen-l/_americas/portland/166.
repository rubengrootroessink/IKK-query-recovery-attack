Louise:

I am repsonsible for Middle Market Coverage for West Power in Portland.   We spoke a week or so ago re: the ENA/EES customer split methodology.  I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday (April 9/10).  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details. 

I had asked John Lavorato if he wanted to meet, but he indicated (see below) that it would be more appropriate to meet with you.  Tim B. also indicated I should try to meet you as well.   Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you.

Thanks!

Chris

Chris

You should meet with Louise.  She is focused on the Power Business.  I will sit in if I'm available.
