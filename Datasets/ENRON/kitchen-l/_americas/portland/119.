Louise,

If you think the message was weird, let me tell you about the conversation...launch a public campaign against the mayor of Portland, the Port of Portland, align ourselves with the pro-Salmon environmentalists, pass legislation, and if we are lucky we get 800 prime acres for residential development!  Don't expect to see it on the hotlist.

Cheers,

Chris

Mark Frevert's office received the following phone call - please could you deal with it.

"Fred Boern (no company) has a non-disclosure agreement with PG&E relating to the cooling tower at the power plant at Troger on the Columbian River.  Needs to speak to someone to enable this.  His number is 503 440 2523"

Thanks

Louise
