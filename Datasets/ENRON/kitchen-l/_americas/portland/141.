Louise,

The lawyers are turning docs and expect to have the escrow account set up and funded by the end of the week (19th to set up and 20th to fund).  Delta told us they will fund this week.  I was speaking with Dean Vanech on a separate deal and he matter-of-factly said that he thought that we were done on the turbines, just wrapping up the paperwork.  I will let you know if (i) anything changes or (ii) the $ shows up.

Regards,

Chris
