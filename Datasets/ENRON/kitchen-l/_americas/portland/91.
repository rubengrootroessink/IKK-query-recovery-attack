We are not done.  On Friday when we were prepared to sign, Black Hills Energy Capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent, Black Hills Corp.  At noon today they said that the signature was on its way.  At 4:00PM we heard that they will issue a L/C instead of the Corp guarantee.  The L/C approach is fine, but I am concerned with this flaky behavior.

Our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with Black Hills Energy Capital tonight/tomorrow morning.  They would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an L/C for $15MM by Thursday.  If not, we can terminate at any time prior to close of business Monday.  I will update when something changes.
