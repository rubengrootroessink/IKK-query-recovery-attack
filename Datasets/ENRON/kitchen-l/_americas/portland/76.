Louise,

As of today, I intend to be at Monday's PRC (Sue is doing fine) and catch an 8:30PM flight back.  I am preparing a PRC report for you and Tim in the event I do not make it.  The report will be easier to deal with than the PEP reports and will reflect my summary evaluation of Analysts, Associates, Managers, Directors, and VPs in my group.
