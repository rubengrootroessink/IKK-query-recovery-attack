After your and my conversation this am, our Legal team had meeting with Allegheny's.  

Meeting went well.  

Insurance still open, but we developed what should be a path to agt.  Other two major issues (remedies under default and legal venue) along with numerous minor issues were hopefully on way to being solved.  Docs to be exchanged again tonite. We'll see.

Since that meeting, new issue arose re letter agt.  It dealt with ensuring that the agts made by EPMI in ltr agt re collateral were final once Allegheny gave us notice that they were OK with Security Agts.  Issue not substantive and we will agree to their change.  Trying to get date of ltr agt to be today.
