John,

In case you bump into Ken Lay...a few months ago he asked us to look at a 65MW peaker project in Utah (Don Sanders).  We passed on the investment.  We pursued a marketing deal.  Yesterday Mike Etringer closed a services deal where we deliver gas and market power.  First services deal in Utah.  Risk-Free $1-$3/MWh plus $0.02/MMBtu.
