Subject:	Getting organized

I am getting organized for my impending forced outage (I sound like a turbine) and I wanted you to start emailing me a weekly update - like the ones you have previously.  Please email to both Tammie and I as she will be keeping a file for John and I want to make sure I keep up to speed.

Thanks

Louise
