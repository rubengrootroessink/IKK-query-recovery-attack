I have not spoken with him, but spoke to John Gillis and several NEPCO people on the project.  I will follow up with Keith.  FYI I am thinking of submitting a non-binding proposal tomorrow to buy the project  (I am preparing a few slides for your review on the value proposition).

Do you already speak to this guy or do you want me to ring him to ensure we are dealing with this project appropriately.

Louise,

Calpine, NRG, Reliant, and Enron have expressed interest.  Calpine has been in the lead, but that complicates NEPCO's (and Enron's via the CTG)  position as RAC has a moratorium on taking any Calpine risk. As of today, the leader is NRG based on their submission. There is a new permitting process in the Northwest that will significantly slow new projects. This project is already permitted and not subject to the slowdown.

 John Gillis attempted to call you last week to explain the details of the opportunity.  John has a relationship with the developer and  is ready to discuss at your convenience.  His phone is 425-415-3100.

Keith Dodson

I understand financing fell through on this project and we have Chris Calger's group looking at the project - can you please keep me in the loop on the way forward on this project for NEPCO to ensure the best solution for Enron.

Thanks

Louise
