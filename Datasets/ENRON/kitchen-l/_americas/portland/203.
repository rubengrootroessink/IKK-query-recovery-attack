louise,
no hi how are you doing?  no how is it going up there in portland?  you just come in and go right for the west desk's eol jugular.  

as everyone knows, the west power desk has a spotty record, at best, on maintaining eol volumes.  there are some good reasons for this and some lame, tired excuses which i'm sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future.

i currently don't get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution.  from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates, ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are.  it looked like there were two one-month deals on ice that day totalling 20,000 MWh.  in contrast, we had 87 transactions totalling 269,000 mwh.  if i'm reading it right, the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison!

We look at ICE volume reports every day and they are doing about 10-20% of the volumes (and # transactions) we are doing on EOL.   We are doing 300-350 transactions per day in East Power and ICE does approx. 45-50 transactions per day.
