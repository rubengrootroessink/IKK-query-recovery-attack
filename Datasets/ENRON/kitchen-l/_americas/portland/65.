Louise,

This is incomplete with some bids expected next week.  A lot of companies had a late start due to the 4th of July holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension.  Bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo.  Bids are in addition to all sunk costs:

McCook Metals - 	$20MM (this is an ongoing, slow negotiation)
PPL Global - 		$15MM
Reliant			$10MM


Indicated that they will submit bid later today/over weekend/early next week:
Calpine
Allegheny
AES
Sempra
Williams
El Paso
NRG
Dynegy

I expect some of these wont show up.


Out for various reasons:
Mirant
Constellation
Entergy
FPL
PG&E
Orion
PSEG
Tractabel


If we end up with 5-6 positive bids, even if they are non-binding, I think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed/sold (DASH in process).  

One interesting note: Allegheny wants to see our offer.  If we have several reasonable bids ($10-$20), it might make sense to offer a high outlier.

I will update. 

Regards,

Chris Calger
