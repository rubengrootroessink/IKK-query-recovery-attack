as a desk that has generated a tremendous amount of cash over the last couple of years and holds vastly more margin from its counterparties than our counterparties are holding of ours, how does this policy change impact us?  i have asked this question every six months for the last two years and the answer has typically been that it is too hard to implement.  with respect to capital, the west power desk has been subsidizing other parts of ena for a while.
