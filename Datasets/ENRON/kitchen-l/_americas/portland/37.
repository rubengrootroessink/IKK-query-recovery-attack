I believe John Milar works for Eric Gadd.  He has spoken with a couple of my guys about developing a LM2500 at one of Transwestern's compressor stations.  Despite what I told Eric a couple of months ago, they seem to be moving forward.  They have received pricing from EEOS and asked Bill Williams in our Tech Services Group to check the EEOS numbers.  I will look into it further and report back.
