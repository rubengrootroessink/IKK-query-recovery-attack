Calpine just confirmed the following:  Tomorrow they will commit to 50-100 per day of Kern expansion.  They will commit 100/day if Enron commits to take 50 of it if the project sale does not close.  If Enron does not commit to the 50, they will only go in for 50 and Enron will not have any rights to it.  

Bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100/day of transport to 0-50 per day.  We will need to decide on this tomorrow morning. 

Chris
