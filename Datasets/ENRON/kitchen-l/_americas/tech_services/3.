I spoke with Wayne Mays - he spoke with Coleman and Virgo and confirmed my understanding:  Wayne's RC has the following people:

Portland:
Bill Williams - Development
Mark Mullen - Development
Larry Soderquist - Transmission
Stan Gray - Transmission
Don Hamond - Transmission
Jodi Blackburn - Contracts
Patty Deas - Admin

Houston:
Walter Koffer - Transmission

Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because:
- the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
- West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-year. 

This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski already left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.
