Hi Louise,

I told Jay about this yesterday and so you may have heard from him already but I wanted to make sure you knew that the metals deal count has gone up from an average of about 450 per day to aproximately 1200 per. I see J Aaron and EDF Mann being the primary counterparties doing the trading.
