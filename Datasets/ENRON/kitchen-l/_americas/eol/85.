Same data by counterparty, also showing percentage today versus last-two-week average, is in the enclosed spreadsheet.  Most counterparties are at or near typical rate.  Many of the larger counterparties are trading at a faster pace (Aquilla, Dynegy, Reliant in particular).  AEP, Calpine, Cinergy Marketing, Sempra and Mirant are at least 50% off their typical pace, particularly AEP and Calpine.
