Jay -- This won't be pulled into the banner tomorrow as the banner below relates to trading on EOL directly. -- David

Hi David.  This is the popup that we displayed until today:


EnronOnline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage 
Enron credit exposure.  While transactions may be available, customers entering into transactions
should carefully evaluate their positions and Enron's current credit status before transacting.
By entering into a transaction, customers are agreeing that the foregoing shall supercede any
inconsistent representations made by Enron in any agreements between Enron and such customer.
