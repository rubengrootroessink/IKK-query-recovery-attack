I've expanded the counterparty list to all those that typically do more than 50 trades per day.  Additionally, liquid power products have been added in.  One final note:  on the previous spreadsheet, the position under a particular column indicated the starting position for that day rather than the ending position for that day.  In this version, each number represents the end-of-day position for the given date.  Effectively, all the numbers slide over 1 column.
