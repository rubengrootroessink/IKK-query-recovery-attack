Louise did look at this, but she's not involved in EOL anymore.  The new head of EOL is Jay Webb and he's over here next week.  I'll ask him whether it's still on the agenda.

Have we thought of letting traders access EOL via WAP or having a more friendly format for hand held devices,  Thereby keeping more eyeballs and keeping ourselves as the platform of choice due to convienience?  No more having to stop trading when at Henley or Wimbledon!
