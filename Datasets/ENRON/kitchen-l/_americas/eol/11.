Louise,

Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News.

Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.

Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion.

Please advise if you agree.

Dave
