So the time has come for me to say good bye to Enron. It has been quite a ride. I have met a lot of great people like yourself and working here was always fun.
Now lets see what the future holds........

Please keep in touch. You can reach me under 001-936-271-0770 for at least another month and my private e-mail is

It would be great if you fired me a quick mail with your contact details so that I can keep in touch.

Take care y'all


Tobias
