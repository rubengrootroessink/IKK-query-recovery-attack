Louise/Rahil -- I wanted to ask your artistic opinion on this agency's site.  I am thinking about hiring them to update the look and feel and tour for EnronOnline.  They have done some very interesting things with movements within photographs, 3-D, layers and typography.  I'll work through the proper approval channels (Greg Piper, Jay Webb and Brad) before doing anything, but I just wanted your artistic opinion.
