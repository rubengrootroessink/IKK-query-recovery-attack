Louise:

I saw that this was cancelled. FYI, I'm in Atlanta Tues. and Wed. next week, Houston on Thurs. and Friday. I can make myself available anytime, except I have a scheduled customer meeting Wednesday from noon to 5 PM in Atlanta. I'm in Florida today, but will be in Houston tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben
