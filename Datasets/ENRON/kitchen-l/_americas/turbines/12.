Louise,

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

Regards,

Chip Schneider
