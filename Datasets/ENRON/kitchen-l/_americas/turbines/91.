Sure thing. I want to run it by Duran and Calger first, if that's OK, to make sure were all on the same page relative to what Janet and I previously proposed.

I should have something for you tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben

OK.

By the way, did you have a discussion with CALME on the carrying costs on the Westinghouse 501D5A?

Ben

EEL is now selling its 9FAs (previously mentioned for Arcos), I referred John Sherriff to you to see if you have any potential outlets for these turbines. So in case someone telephones you, that is where the call comes from.
