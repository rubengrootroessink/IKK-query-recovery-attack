Rob,

For our teleconference with Louise Kitchen this afternoon.

We have updated the summary of the 11N sale effort document which is attached below, it details the hot list of 8 potential buyers in the West and Brazil.

 

The document below is a historical list of 90 potential buyers that we have offered the equipment to.

 
The "turbine sale summary ver 2.doc" is the standard document that we have been emailing potential buyers at the initial expression of interest.
