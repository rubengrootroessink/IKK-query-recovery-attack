Louise:

Welcome back.

As I indicated in my voice-mail, I have to go to Knoxville, TN for Wednesday meetings with AES and TVA on our Haywood project. I will call you tomorrow morning to answer any questions you have on the turbine report or other activities. I will also be in Houston all day Thursday and Friday.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,

Ben
