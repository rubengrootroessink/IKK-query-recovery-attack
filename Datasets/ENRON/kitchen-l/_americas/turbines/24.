Louise,

Here are the screen captures plus the latest long description version.  On the short desription the option price has been modified to $450k.  The $10,000 number was only a placeholder.

Steve,

Here is a document containing the three screen captures we discussed.  I hope they are not too difficult to see.  Let me know if you need anything else.
