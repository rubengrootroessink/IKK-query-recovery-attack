Louise:

We will receive the $2 million when AES and TVA execute an interconnection agreement for AES' Haywood project. While it is possible that this agreement will be executed this month (50%), it's equally as likely that it will happen Q4. AES is currently under construction on their Haywood project, and as such, they need to get this agreement wrapped up ASAP. Our role in this is to utilize our resources (primarily our consultant who is a former TVA Director) to help AES through the process (and in doing so, we will receive our upside payment of $2 million). We are doing everything we can to reach this milestone in Q3.

We can talk about this before our conference call if you like. 

Regards,

Ben

I am assuming we'll get this money booked this month - I am concerned over Fred's comment from the meeting last week.  We need it.  Let me know
