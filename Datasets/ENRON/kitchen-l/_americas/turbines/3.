Dear Friends

Naturally the news about Enron has not escaped anyone and I will come back to
his in a while.

But first and foremost I would like to thank you for the great gesture to
receive the ABB delegation late last month. You kept the meeting despite the
turmoil and managed to make the meeting very productive. To me that illustrates
a great company with great people staying together but also staying close to
partner and the business also in difficult times. Our discussions where
productive and for me personally a good illustration of the competence and
knowledge in your organisation.

Back to the recent news I understand that the ownership structure will change
for Enron but we from ABB sincerely hope that the knowledge, spirit and
entrepreneurial spirit that formed Enron will be preserved in the new
organisation. We look forward to opportunities to develop and build projects
together with you for the benefit of both organisations.

If there is anything we can do further to support your business please call Mike
as before and I will make sure he gets the backup needed.

Be Proud and Look Forward to See You Again!

Bo Normark
