We received two financing commitment letters from Hancock.  In general, the letters are good and suggest that Hancock is genuinely in the deal, but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals.  Chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get Hancock to call Ben Glisan to assure us that they are in (Hancock wants a lot of future business from Enron).  In the meantime, we are innovatively stalling GE by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them.  I think we will get both sides of this trade done.
