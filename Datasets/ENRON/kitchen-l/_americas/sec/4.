Louise,
 
I spoke with Travis this afternoon and received clarification regarding the notification provison for asset sales as discussed in Section 7 of the Dynegy merger agreement.  Travis agreed no notification is required for the sale of assets listed on Schedule 7.1.  Notifcation is needed for required asset sales as part of a regulatory requirement.
