Louise -- Here are the designs that Mike G. is using to finalize developement of the web site this week.  They maintain the color scheme you requested and have been modified slightly to meet with UBS branding requirements.  The secure area screen will not have the MyContent section since we are not launching with Portal Builder.  I hope this meets with your approval.
