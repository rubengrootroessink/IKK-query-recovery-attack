Re: the HSR waiting period issue:

We can proceed with our plans, but all correspondence will be handled through the UBS call center in Connecticut. 

I plan to start doing this tommorrow morning, assuming we get the Connecticut fax and phone numbers tonight.

Detailed changes:

	- Fax number will be in Connecticut, and will roll to here.
	- Connecticut call center person will answer any Help Desk calls, which will then be transferred here.
	- Connecticut call center will send PA faxes in accordance with instructions from here.
	- Cover letter will have UBS letterhead, but will be unsigned and will specify Connecticut numbers
	- Splash page will be modified to show Connecticut numbers
	- Once we reach Closing Date, the numbers will be permanently forwarded to here.
	- All future correspondence (and the bulk mailings) will specify the Houston number

The concern is that during the waiting period, we need for UBS people to represent UBS interests on all official correspondence with customers.

Please call me if you have any concerns. I plan to put out the revised Splash page and start the Top 50 marketing efforts at about 10:00 am tomorrow morning.
