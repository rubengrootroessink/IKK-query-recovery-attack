I had planned to call Per Dyrvik this morning (at Lou Eber's suggestion). Can I proceed? (Don't want to get in the middle of something you are working).

Working Ya (as Shankman would say).  It appears they will offer guarantees but I am awaiting confirmation.

Dave, as per previous discussions, I am very concerned with Canada not using UBS AG as the contracting party. Additionally, Lou Eber has confirmed with me a number of times that UBS AG does not guarantee subsiduaries but rather UBS is " good for it". This will not work.

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.
