Anne,

I received your voice mail. We are working with each vendor to assign the contracts or enter into new contracts as required in order to ensure that content is available on relaunch of the system.

Affected contracts are:

Intelligence Press - no agreement required.
Accuweather - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Dow Jones - have verbally agreed to continue service to the new entity
Reuters - working on new month-to-month contract with them.

We will work with Leslie on getting written consents.

Thanks,

Dave
