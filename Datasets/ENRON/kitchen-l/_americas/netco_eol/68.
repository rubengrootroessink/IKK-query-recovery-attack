Louise,

In the event that some of the people who are being offered positions in UBS do not take them, but instead resign, and we therefore keep someone in UBS who otherwise would have gone to the estate, I thought we should agree potential bonuses.

To be clear: these bonuses would be paid ONLY if the individual wound up going to UBS instead of the Estate as currently planned.

If you agree, please let me know and forward to Amy Fitzpatrick. This should allow us to respond quickly as events develop.
