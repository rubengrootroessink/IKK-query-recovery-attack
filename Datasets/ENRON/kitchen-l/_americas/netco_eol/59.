Mark -

At Louise's request we have added some "disclaimer" text at the bottom of the splash page that will be released when we are ready to start re-signing customers. The intent is to assure customers that their registration forms, etc. will not be used should the deal btwn. UBS and Enron not go through.

Please review the disclaimer (below, or you can view the entire splash page via this link - https://hyperion.eoltest.com:8143/new_jsp/marketing/temp_register/index.html) and send your comments to Kal or me.

In the event that the above-mentioned transaction between UBS Warburg and Enron is not closed, all Customer Registration Forms, Password Applications and Electronic Trading Agreements received by UBSWenergy will be considered null and void and will not be transferred to any subsequent entity.

Thanks,
Erica Bess Duncan
