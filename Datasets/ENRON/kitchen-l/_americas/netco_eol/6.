Subject: Re-cap of branding decisions



All

In order to be clear about all the discussions that have taken place
on
the brand issues I've been asked to summarise the final decisions:

1. Website: the url is www.ubswenergy.com

2. E-mail address: firstname.lastname@ubswenergy.com

3. Company marketing name: UBS Warburg Energy

4. Company legal entity name: UBS Warburg Energy LLC

The first three are to be reviewed after approximately 6 months.

Notes:

1. When referring to the new company in text, the website should
always
be referred to as 'UBSWenergy.com' and not just UBSWenergy - case can
be either upper or lower

2. The corporate identity rules of UBS Warburg are to be followed
when
producing any company material either for internal or external use.

The above was agreed with Heidi Baumann, Pat O'Donnell and John
Costas.
