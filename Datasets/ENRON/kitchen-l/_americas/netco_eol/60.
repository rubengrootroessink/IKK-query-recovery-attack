Dave,

I left you a voice mail about this.  I like version 2 and it will be the one which is the most likely to go with the activex control and require the least number of site changes.  I don't have a problem with the UBS colors in general.  I do not believe we have enough time to make their colors work correctly.  In the next version, we can do it right.

Let me know what you think on this.
-Michael

Attached please find copy of the 6 designs that we came up with.

         
-  UBSengergy2 will be the best one that flows well with the rest of the site.
-  UBSengery5, and UBSenergy8 will complement well with the orange navigation on the trading page.

Heather has asked us to come up with 6 and 7 with red navigation.  This color absolutely will not go with the active-x.  As we discussed yesterday, we will not being able to make any changes on the active-x.

Please call me if you have any questions.  We will need your decision by the end of the day today.

Thanks.

Christine Dinh
