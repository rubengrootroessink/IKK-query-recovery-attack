Louise,

As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP:

1) PA and ETA approval
2) Agreement on new company name ("Netco" replacement) and new online system name ("NetcoOnline" replacement)
3) Approval of Press Release

I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase.

Thanks,

Dave
