Louise,

Although our actual content contracts are under conrol, it looks like we may need to spend $250,000 for infrastructure (Portalbuilder license).

I will investigate further this afternoon to see if there are any alternatives. 

Do you want us to spend the money if the alternative is no content?

Dave
