Peter, Louise has requested a review of the various forms to be utilized in NETCO.  It is my current understanding that Canada trading will be included.   Therefore, we need you to review the Canadian physical forms.  I have mentioned the matter to Bradford, who will be calling you with Credit concerns and suggestions.

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.
