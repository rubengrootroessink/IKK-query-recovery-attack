I talked to Kim Kaase and she said the cost of the bookcases is $2,000 each and it will take 8-9 weeks to arrive.  The reason we did not order them originally because we both thought they would go perfect with your new furniture.  She will need to get approval from you if you would like to order them.  They have been asked to watch the spending.  If you want we can take them with us when we move and see what it looks like and if you don't like it we can bring them back.
