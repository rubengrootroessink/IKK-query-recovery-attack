Kevin Presto wants to know if it's okay to take the office next to John's-06102?

I received a call from a Candice Karpakis with Williams Company and she wanted a list of our trading group.  She has done business with Enron for 15 years and has worked closely with Steve South on transportation on the Northwestern pipelines.  She would like the list so she knows who she should contact to do business.  I told her I would need to get approval before I could send anything.  What are your thoughts on this?

I did an expense report for you but it's only $314 so I thought I would wait and see if you had any additional expense I could add.

I packed your files and sent them to Don Miller.  I put a list of the files that were sent on your wall behind your monitor.

I will have my cell phone with me so please do not hesitate to call me.
