This week each business unit across Enron has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources on a going forward basis.  Current EIM Management, as well as Jeff McMahon, Louise Kitchen and I, have been fully involved in this process as it relates to EIM.
 
While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding each individual business.
 
I ask for your continued patience.  I know that I may be asking a lot. 
 
Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family at Thanksgiving and know that we are working hard on finalizing all details.  No significant organizational announcements will take place next week.
