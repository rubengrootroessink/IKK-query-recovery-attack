Hi Louise,
I am hearing that you and Rob discussed the Canada Svc agreement and settled on a number in the ballpark of $7M, which is comparable to last year. There is one change from last year that we may want to consider- the treatment of the Regulatory Affairs activity charged from Corporate. Last year Rob was not burdened with this cost. This year we discussed pushing these costs to the appropriate commercial teams. Please review the two attachments below and advise. Currently our proposed service agreement amount totals $10M.

The Public Affairs amount included in the Agreement currently is $2,156,000.  See attached schedule for calculation.  In the prior year, we did not include an amount for Public Affairs in the Agreement.

Faith,
I spoke with Laura just after sending this and she is looking at it today.  However, she indicated also that Rob Milnthorp had discussed a $7MM number with Louise.  As you can see, the number we are proposing is significantly higher.  I'm sure I will be working with her on this tomorrow.  Just wanted to provide you with an update.  Please let me know any information you may hear from Louise if Rob circles back around with her.

Thanks,
Edie
