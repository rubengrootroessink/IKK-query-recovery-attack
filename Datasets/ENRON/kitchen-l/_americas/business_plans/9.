Enclosed you will please find the 2002 plan which has been revised for Expenses.  

The Indirects have increased based upon known allocations.  Additionally, the increase is related to the fact that IT had been incorrectly capitalizing most of the development support in 2001 until 3rd quarter  when we started reversing the capitalization.

Enclosed you will please find the 2002 Margin and Expense Plan related to your estimated cash flows for 2002.

Cash Flows were based on the current book and subsequent monthly liquidations over 2002.  To this average monthly balance, we added the average monthly increase in Gross Book Balance which has been provided by your group.  

Drift numbers have decreased considerably from 2000 due to decreased interest rates.  Please advise if you would like us to update this schedule for any changes to your new business estimate for 2002. 

Please feel free to call me or Clara if you have any questions.
