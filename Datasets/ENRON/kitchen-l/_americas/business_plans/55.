Louise, the $10.9 million negative in the plan as presented to you consists of:

	Inland		$4.6 MM
	Masada	$2.9 MM
	Linder		$3.4 MM

	Total		$10.9 MM

These assets had been scheduled originally to go into raptor 2.  Without a raptor hedge, these represent the difference between estimated valuein a monetization and carrying value.

In addition to the above, the following items are incorporated into the $20.7 MM delta ENA exposure vs. base value

	Noram rig	$0.9 MM  --  The purchaser defaulted on purchase.  Our expectation for value is now lower.
	Ecogas		$2.4 MM  --   We acquired this asset after the budget.
	Canfibre LOC	$4.5 MM  --   This contingent liability may or may not be paid depending upon certain performance tests at the Lackawanna Plant
	Calpine		$2.0 MM  --  This is a drilling commitment.  I always view these on a dry hole basis.

	Total		$ 9.8 MM

I hope this clarifies the numbers.  Dick.
