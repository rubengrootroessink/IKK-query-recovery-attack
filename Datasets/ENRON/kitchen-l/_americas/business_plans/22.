Louise, 
Attached is the schedule as requested. Please refer to the comments I've listed. I'd like to revisit this schedule with you when you get a chance. 

 
I'm still working with IT to resolve the allocation issues. I've listed the numbers that I think are appropriate for the 2001 forecast.

Additionally I'm attaching the allocation from Global Finance. I'll schedule a meeting with them to review this allocation if you'd like.
