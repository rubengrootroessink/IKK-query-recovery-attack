Hi Louise,
just wanted to confirm that you agree with the movement of the margin plan related to Offshore to Office of Chair before we make these changes. Thanks!

Effective July 1, the Offshore Team under Jean Mrha is being eliminated.

Per Jean's discussions with John Lavorato,

The 3Q & 4Q origination plan of $7.812M for Offshore will go to Office of Chair.  
The accrual margin for MEGS is being transferred to  ECR.
The direct expenses will be reallocated to Jean's team.  The offshore team was incorporated in Jean's other teams.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Wes

As agreed please move MEGs to ECR as the management of this should reside with Mariner who are the counterparty in the transaction.

Thanks

Louise
