Louise --

While I have already reduced the allocation to EA by 15% or over $400,000, I have talked with Accounting regarding your concerns and have suggested a few changes to the allocations.  The new suggested allocations are EA 30%, EGM 20%, EIM 20%, ENW 20%, EBS 10% and EEOS 5%.  This is based on services provided and headcount within the various business units.  The services include media relations, events, marketing & advertising, and internal communications.

There is no increase in headcount.  We are at 10 positions, which is the exact same number we have had since February 2001.  In fact, I reduced the size of the group by 2 positions when I was promoted to lead the department in May 1999.  The two reductions are one less person in Marketing and Advertising, and one less person in Events.  While the number of employees has fluctuated at times this year with departures from the group and prior to hiring a replacement, I currently have no openings and the group has 10 total employees.

Our allocation is huge compared to other business units.  Please provide data to support this for our budget meeting.  I am particularly surprized we are getting more headcount next year too.

Thanks
