Canavan) requesting
access to Enron in Houston, Texas

2. Regional Security will authorize and forward these names to Enron
security.

3. UBS employees should go to main lobby reception desk at 1400 Smith
Street in the North Tower to obtain their temporary ID's.  UBS
employees should inform the receptionist/security officers that their

receptionist/security personnel will give the UBS employees a
temporary

UBS
employees will be required to show a valid state(Drivers License) or
federal(passport) identification prior to the issuance of this
temporary ID card.

business days.  If your visit to Enron will exceed 7 business days
