Louise, with Pope's departure, I need to find someone to run Enron Direct Canada. I will do it in the interim, but it needs someone full-time - driving the business. I wanted to get your thoughts re approaching Dave Forrester. I understand (from Pope) that Dave may have an interest in returning to Calgary.

Regards
