I have suggested a slightly edited version of the draft policy.   I think classifying assets qualifying for transfer as "Problem" and/or "Orphan" may clarify the criteria.  Also, I am assuming that the intent is to except Energy Capital Resources assets from the policy and have so indicated.  On the other hand, as written, the policy would apply to Principal Investing assets.
