Louise, although I am very much a supporter of the consolidation of Enron investing functions, including Special Assets, and I think the ideas Kevin Garland has expressed as objectives are excellent, I am also sorry to be leaving ENA.  I like the direction you and John have set and enjoyed working with you.  I hope to have that opportunity again.  Dick.
