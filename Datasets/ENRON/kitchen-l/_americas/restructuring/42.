Because the original DASH was based upon a $10 million (gross) sale price in a deal that fell apart, RAC is requiring another DASH since the sale to SCF will be for $9 million gross.  The delta net to ENA is negative $.5 million. 

DASH will be coming to you today.  We are set to sign final documents tomorrow.  Thanks.  Dick.
