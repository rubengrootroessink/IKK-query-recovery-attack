Attached is the final version of the Charter Review for our meeting with Skilling tomorrow.  I intended to get this out sooner, but preparations for our energy tech conference tomorrow kept me fairly occupied this afternoon.

I need to go through one last time with my calculator, but do not anticipate there will be any additional revisions.  I need to speak at the conference from 8:30 to 9:00 a.m. tomorrow and will come directly to the 33rd floor thereafter.  I believe we meet at 9:45 a.m. with Skilling.

If you need to reach me this evening, my cell number is (713) 854 5232.

Regards,

MLM
