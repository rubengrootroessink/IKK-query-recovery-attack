It may help if I complete sentences:

Per Drew Tingleaf's request, attached are updated board resolutions for Chips and Salsa.  As you will note, the resolutions have the effect of delegating to Mark Frevert authority to approve funding and declaring the DeAcero [contract conditions precedent satisfied or waived, or the contract terminated.]

Sorry about that.
