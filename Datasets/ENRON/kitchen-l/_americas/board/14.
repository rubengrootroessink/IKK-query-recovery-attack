Periodically, the Executive Compensation group provides a report to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Management Committee member stock holdings.  Such holdings include:

shares held in a family trust
your personal brokerage account
in certificate for, or
in an IRA
any shares held in connection with Company Plans (i.e. ESOP, savings plans, phantom shares, option grants, or restricted stock grants), although shares acquired that held free-and-clear should be included.

Because of your inclusion in the Management Committee, we will be requesting this data from you prior to each report (usually on a quarterly basis).  Your response is greatly appreciated.

Please provide me with your current personal ENE stock holdings as of 8/31/01.  I have access to shares held in the Company Plans (last bullet above).  Please respond by Thursday, September 20, 2001.  

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions at 713-853-7769.

Thanks!

Sharon
