The next BOD and Committee meetings will be held on October 8-9.

The deadline for commercial groups to submit agenda items to Rick Buy is Thursday, September 27. Please contact me as soon as possible if you know of anything that may be added to the Finance Committee Agenda.  Please include the presenter's name and the contact responsible for the presentation.  

Attached below is a template to be used for the presentations.  Please note that each presentation needs to be portrait and in black and white.  Please see guidelines in attached presentation for further information.  Your help in communicating this to the appropriate commercial personnel is appreciated.

The final approval process and deadlines will be communicated soon.   I will forward the notification memo sent to the commercial teams once it is distributed.  

Please call if I can help.

Thanks,
