Louise,

Quick follow-up on Allegheny, just in case you get a call today.  I have come to learn that Peter Skrgic is now the former President of Allegheny Energy Supply, having just retired in the last month.  He has been replaced by Mike Morrell, who is also the CFO, until someone can be found to replace him.  Morrell should be very familiar with Allegheny's financing plan for these assets. 

To the extent that you want to pass the detailed financing conversation on to me, I am more than happy to have that conversation with Morrell. Also, just so you know, apparently Goldman is going to be the lead banker on the equity offering.  

Let me know if you hear anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Don
