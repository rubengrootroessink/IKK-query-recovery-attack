John,

Quick update on sale of NA to Duke.  Stuart got them up from $120MM to $135MM (should be close book value of asset at closing).  Waiting to see if they try to knock us for issues discovered during due dili including GE/Power Systems lawsuit.  Stuart is sitting down with them tomorrow to negotiate Purchase and Sale Agreement.  At best, could  be in a position to sign this up next week.  I assume we need to DASH this or do you want to handle some other way?

Regards,

Don
