Attached is a draft press release regarding Duke's purchase of our New Albany facility.  Duke expects to release late in the day on Thursday, June 28.  They will be meeting with the employees on Friday.

It is not much different than Cinergy's or AES's releases when they purchased peakers.  Please forward all comments to me at your earliest convenience.  While I am out of the office, I am accessing e-mail and voice mail or you can page me at 877-576-8750.  Thanks.

Eric
