She recently moved to support Corporate development with two other attorneys.  Kay Mann, who also supports EA, has been assigned the EBS responsibilities.

I thought Mordaunt was EBS - obviously not.

Louise:

My understanding from legal was that Corporate Development as represented by Donahue and the business unit had to sign off.  He brought Mordaunt into the picture for his legal side.  I don't like going outside of EA anymore than you do, but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non-solicitation language requires this type of sign off.

Why are there so many people outside of EA involved in this?

Louise:

I have given to your admin a copy of the Cogentrix CA and have bracketed the language that needs your approval.  Legal had originally told me that I needed Detmering and Donahue to sign off.  Detmering has told me that either you or Lavorato need to sign off.  Per my conversation with Donahue, he is o.k. because Kristina Mordaunt has signed off on the language.  

We have a little over a week to get a preliminary, non-binding bid in, if the original schedule holds, and we have held off as long as we can signing any language along these lines, but we are now starting to be backed against the wall.  This language represents the best we are going to be able to accomplish in this situation.

Regards,

Charlie
