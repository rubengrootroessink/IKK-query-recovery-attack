Louise,

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Don
