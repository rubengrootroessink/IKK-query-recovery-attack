Hi Louise,

Hope all is going well! Please advise re: Asset Marketing plan. We've received buyoff from Don Miller for the attached plan. I believe that you had mentioned potentially assigning a margin target to him, and would appreciate your input on this. 

The expenses for the quarter currently appear on the management summary that we supply to you each Monday.

 If  you have any questions, please call me at x30352. Thanks!
