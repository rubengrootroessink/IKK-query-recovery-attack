Just received a call from Sam Behrends at LeBoeuf.  He just spoke to the FERC about Cinergy 203.  They are working on 203 as we speak.  Appear to have everything that they need. He reminded them that we want to close this quarter.  Sam's best guess is early next week for order to be issued.  He said, once they finish writing order, it goes upstairs for a couple of days and then usually takes two days to get published.  Still leaves plenty of room for 1Q close (on or around the 27th).

I will let you know if I hear anything else.

Thanks,

Don
