Louise,

As I mentioned in our meeting today, attached is a map with a general description of Orion's assets.  Given the location of Astoria, I am sure we would find it interesting.  However, it is generally understood in the market that Goldman is selling the company (not assets). 

I got to know these guys pretty well last year when we (Delainey and I) spent some talking with them about a JV with our peakers.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Don
