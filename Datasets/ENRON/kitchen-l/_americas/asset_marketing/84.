The short news is that things are fine with application.

I spoke with Anthony Wilson of Allegheny who's been working with the SEC staff to get the order issued.  He expects to have the order either today or early next week.

Starting Monday, you can reach me at joanne.rutkowski@bakerbotts.com


I'll be back to you ASAP with other contact info.

best

Joanne
