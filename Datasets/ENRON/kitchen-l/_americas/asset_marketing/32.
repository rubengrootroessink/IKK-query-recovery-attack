I plan on speaking with all the interested bidders in the morning to determine the big issues from a valuation perspective.  Thus far, almost every one has highlighted the recent decline in power prices (none bidders said size was an issue).  Once I have spoken with the bidders, we need to agree on the process of getting back to AIG.

Let me know if you all have any thoughts.

Thanks,

Don
