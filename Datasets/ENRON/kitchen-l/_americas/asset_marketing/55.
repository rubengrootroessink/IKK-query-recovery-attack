Do you care if they mention the price?  At this stage I don't.

Attached is the proposed Press Release from Allegheny announcing the completion of the acquisition. It looks good to me--Enron is only briefly mentioned. Please review with all the appropriate parties and let me know your comments as soon as possible. Allegheny is planning to release this tomorrow as soon as the deal is closed. 

Thanks,
Jennifer
