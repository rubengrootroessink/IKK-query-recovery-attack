Louise

I'm sorry but you will need to complete the entrust form with your election otherwise you will remain on core benefit and your current pension contributions.  Core cover is 1x life assurance, 40% permanent health insurance and 1 unit of Group personal accident.  I will send your a manual entrust form to your home address for you to complete if necessary

regards
Julie

Should I just assume its OK to leave everything as I think it will just roll over - I didn't have any medical etc out there for this year.

Thanks
