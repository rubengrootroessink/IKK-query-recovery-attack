David:  I've conferred with J. Donnelly and the business.  We prefer to keep
11 of 13; not 14 of 19.  This is how we intend to submit the schedule.
Regards.  EVC.

John/Diane,

I just spoke with Lavo. He believes group B should be:

Shively
Arnold
Belden
Presto
Allen
Benson
Calger
Davis (yes Dana M)
Milnthorp
Motley
Sturm
Swerzbin
Grigsby
Zufferli
Martin
Neal
Herndon
Maggi
Tycholiz

and should be 14 of 19 (ie we could swap out 5).

On group c, is this the other 75 or so key commercial and support employees
we talked about at the outset?

On retention contracts, can you send me example?

David

Please note that we have tightened the non-solicitation language in the
retention agreements for for the Group A & B employees.
