Ken Rice recommended that at refer this person to you.  He has been with Dell for 6 years and is interested in joining one of Enron's trading or origination businesses.

Do you have any interest in him?

I would send him to - EES- both Dave Delainey (or Janet Dietrich) or ENA - Louise Kitchen or Dave Duran.

This guy is one of the people from Dell Ventures that we have worked with.  He is interested in joining Enron (specifically the trading/origination side of Enron).  I think he might fit best in ENA.  Who should I refer him to?

Kevin;

Thanks for the time this morning.  As I mentioned, after 6+ very successful
years at Dell in program management, product management, and business
development, I'm starting to consider the possibility of leaving.  Given my
experiences here, leveraging the power of commoditizing (Intel-based
servers) markets, a natural next step is a company like Enron.  Any
appropriate introductions would be greatly appreciated.

Regards ... msg

P.S.  I've also sent your name to Ray Bell at SmartPipes.  What they're
doing could be a natural complement to Enron's efforts in the bandwidth
space.
