FYI.

Do you still want me to call the names on the list, or shall we just send Billy a list of who we ideally would like?

I agree, let's just talk about it tomorrow.  Thanks for being flexible on moving our meeting.

Billy,

Several things I am hoping to go over with you Monday pm, but main thing is that ENA OTC is concerned that the names currently slated for the A&A PRC don't make sense.

Louise has asked me to call them and see if each are keen to do it, but main objection was the number of people from Power trading being distracted at their busiest time of the year. I told Louise that I was sure if we wanted to switch one or two around you wouldn't mind, however, I would confirm with you before suggesting alternates.

David
