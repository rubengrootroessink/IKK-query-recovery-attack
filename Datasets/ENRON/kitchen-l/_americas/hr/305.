All is under control:

a - We've set up a "Work-out" group under Cindy Skinner and will be producing the stats and making sure we don't cop out.
b - as above. Several have gone across wholesale already. stats will show this and progress on others.
c - Fair to say we have total clarity of direction here now! All memo's will be out by Monday, Cindy Olson has sent an email to HR community (re Embargo on HPL staff) and I believe Mark H is drafting something for other OTC's. Fran and Michele Cash (I also put another guy on this yesterday) have all in hand.
