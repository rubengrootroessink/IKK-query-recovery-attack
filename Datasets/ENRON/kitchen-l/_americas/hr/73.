Louise, 

The attached DASH is not final, but may circulate later today.  Mark Haedicke has the legal risk memo - the attorney (Karen Jones) characterizes the risk as very low (our information and knowledge reps are qualified and capped at 10%).  We are hoping to sign as early as today or Monday, but funding may not occur until after Sep 30 (we will push hard to get funds in this quarter).  Regardless of cash timing, income recognition of approx $1MM can be accounted for in Q3 as planned.

Regards,
