I regret to announce that Sean Crandall has tendered his resignation from Enron.  He has decided to return to his native land of Utah to join Duke Energy's trading team.  Sean made tremendous contributions to our trading floor during the past few years.  He will be sorely missed.  Please join me in wishing Sean the best in his future endeavors.
