Hi Louise

I don't know what to say - I really enjoyed working with you.  The time I spent on EnronOnline was the most enjoyable part of the entire time I spent at Enron.

I hope you are ok. 

I don't think I will be asked to stay by the administration team - so my contact details are as follows:

Amita Gosalia

Tel: 01753 669240

Good luck and hope to hear from you.

Best wishes to Marcus and hugs for Scott.

Regards

Amita
