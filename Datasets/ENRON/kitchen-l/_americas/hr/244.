Kari,

John wants us to look at a new contract for Tych which is more in line with the ones we have done just recently. Can you:

?	Let me know what John's original spreadsheet indicated as a recommendation
?	What we have given him in his current contract (signed last Nov)
?	What we have given to his direct reports.

I'll get with Louise/John and agree what is appropriate.

David
