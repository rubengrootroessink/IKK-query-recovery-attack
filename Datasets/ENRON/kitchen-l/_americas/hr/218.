Louise,  I spoke with Max Yzaguirre yesterday who told me that you had a conversation with him about handling the mexico performance management process in your absence.  Is that the case or do you want to remain the supervisor in PEP for Jamie Alatorre?  Can you please advise so I may correct the information in PEP. Thanks a million!  Hope you and the new baby are doing well.
