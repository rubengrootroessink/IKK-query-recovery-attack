Do you remember Steve Vavrik?  Wants to move back to the East Coast.  Can you offer him anything in that region.  Remember he has a power plant background.  Perhaps with Rahil's fuel cell opp, or at Brooklyn Navy Yards?

Thought that culture management meeting was actually quite useful.  The "Ken & Jeff" pres is woeful, so we need to keep working our bit so there's something interesting to say.

Steve's resigned, going back to Boston where his wife has a job.  I said I'd see whether NA can use him or EES, (he's not keen to leave the company).  I also asked him to talk to Chris McKey re metals in New York.  (Chris, perhaps you could give him a call if he doesn't).

He is likely to end up at Calpine, Intergen or Dynegy if we can't place him.
