I talked with Jeanie Slone today regarding the project  you'd like me to work on for the next few months.  I told Jeanie I will be  able to start on August 13th.  (I will be out of town August 1-4th, then  again August 7-10th.)  I would sure appreciate your calling or e-mailing me  before the 13th with a quick overview of what you see my role in this transition  before I show up on the 13th--what needs to be done, issues, what has been done  to date, who I will be working with, etc.
 
My home number is 281-482-3920
Mobile is 713-854-4380
E-mail address is shak@ev1.net .  
 
    Thanks!
