Louise & Marcus,

Immigrate Visas
The attorney's have advised that the Approval Notice has still not been received.

Deferred Comp
Tim Callahan has a meeting with PricewaterhouseCoopers today regarding deferred comp.  You will be advised as soon as I have results of their meeting.

Richard Frank
I understand Rick has touched base with you regarding the tax preparation issue for employing Scott's nanny.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me and if everything is going okay.

Nanny
I contacted the nanny's former employer twice on Tuesday, 3 July.  I didn't want to leave a message on the answering machine.  Therefore, I will try again this evening.

Scott
Birth Certificates obtained today.  Information to you regarding US passport in process.  

Cheers!

Welcome Summer!
Best Regards,
Bobbi
