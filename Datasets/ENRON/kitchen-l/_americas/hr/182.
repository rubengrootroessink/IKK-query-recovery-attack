Ms. Kitchen

My name is Matthew Bray and I would be interested in speaking to you about
any potential commercial development opportunities that might be available in
your group at Enron. I have been consulting for several energy companies over
the last nine months but am now seeking a full time commercial development
position with a leading energy company. I believe my gas and power
development experience, knowledge of all sectors in the energy value chain
and ability to secure customers would allow me to contribute to the bottom
line success of your group.

Enclosed below is a copy of my resume. Please let me know if you would like
to discuss in more detail. I can be reached at this email address or by phone
at (512) 346-4974. I look forward to talking to you soon.

Regards
Matt Bray
