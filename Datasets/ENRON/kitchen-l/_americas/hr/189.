Louise:

I have revised what I sent you earlier per our discussions on Friday and have already started working with Tom Martin on Texas Gas Orig.  Please let me know when you have spoken with Jean about my assuming P/L responsibility for Bridgeline and I will get started on that activity.

Regards,
Brian
