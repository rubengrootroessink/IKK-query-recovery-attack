For what ever reason, in the system, he is coded in the executive committee job group.  Your reports only include job groups of MD down to Managers.  Ranabir is coded wrong because he is not an executive committee member and this is why he is not in any of your reports.  I will get with is HR rep and get this corrected. If you would like, in the meantime, I can run the report information on him.
