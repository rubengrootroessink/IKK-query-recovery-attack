Louise and Marcus,

Received the new Approval Notice with Marcus' name spelled correctly this week.  No action required as the new visa stamp has already been obtained.

PwC, the compensation team and I met this week regarding the proposed deferred compensation scheme.  An issue was raised for PwC to research before moving forward.  Will keep you updated.

Regards,
