Louise and Marcus,

We're still in the waiting period with the green card process.

I confirmed that Louise can elect to participate in the domestic health plan. This will allow participation in the prescription drug program and a network option with co-payments, rather than turning in all receipts for reimbursement.  As we discussed, you do not want any changes until after the baby is born.  Let me know when you would like to get together to discuss the advantages/disadvantages of switching to the domestic plan.  

PwC sent over a draft of their deferred compensation scheme today.  I have forwarded to the compensation team for review and comment.

Try to send over a copy of Louise's new social security card this week.  Also, we would like to follow up on your unreimbursed medical claims.

Regards,
