Sorry Louise!

Actually she is a temp, I am currently evaluating whether we are going to keep her longer term, ( clearly one of the issues is whether I can afford for all our secrets to come winging their way over to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! )

Just joking.  Hope you come over and visit us soon.

This was mistakenly sent to me - of course that's not an issue but read the name in the last paragraph from Caroline Mudd.  You have hired someone called Louise Kitchenham!
Hope you're well

I can be there in body, but the spirit may be weak. The night before I host an annual Cricket Club dinner for 120 people.

The general consensus is that it would be best to run the offsite on a Saturday.  So far however, there does not seem to be any Saturdays in September that everyone is available.  We are therefore going to try and aim for Sat 6th October.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible whether will be able to make this date. 

Any questions, please call me (x35419)

Thx
Caroline

As mentioned in Joe's note, we are currently setting up departmental offsites.  This will be an opportunity for you all to get together and discuss how your group plan to achieve its goals and vision.  Ideally this will be held on a week day, however, market and business demands may mean running it on a Saturday.

If possible, please let me know your availability over the next few weeks.  Louise Kitchenham will also be contacting you to follow this up.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks
Caroline
