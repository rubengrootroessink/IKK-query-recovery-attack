Mary,

PwC has introduced a deferred compensation scheme to Louise Kitchen that would allow UK foreign nationals to defer income tax free under certain circumstances.  They will be sending over details on Monday.  The idea would involve the existing Enron deferred compensation plans.  Let us know who we should work with on your team.  We will be moving quickly on this.

Regards,
