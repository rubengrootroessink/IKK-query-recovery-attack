At the end of the year when promotions happened we increased people's salaries if they were below the "first year" director recommended salary.  are we going to do that at the midyear?  if so, could you please instruct as to what the suggested "first year" directors salary should be and amy fitzpatrick will let us know what adjustments should be made.
