We're looking at this as we speak, along with the PRC.  Don't want to repeat the nightmare.

I want to put as much discretion as possible in the hands of the business units.  The "strawman" we're looking at would have a very basic matrix, with a discretionary business unit component (that really gives the OTC's the freedom to do what they want).  

I think we need the basic matrix to avoid EEOC problems, and to not drive a/a's toward wanting to work in just one part of the organization.

I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way. 

I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise.

We haven't use the standard formula's here for several years.

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year.
