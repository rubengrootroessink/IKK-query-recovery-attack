Louise,

I have spoke with Faith this morning and the 2 economic administrators for Central's books.  The business was being reflected in 4 different books on the report I received from you/Faith, Central Mid-Market, Mid-West Gas, Central Origination, and Middle Market-Central Gas Total.  This break out is inconsistent with the manner I reconcile this business daily and provided difficulty in determining the tie out to each of the originators.  This is one business, not to the specific of me, but to a group of talented people who I want to represent in the most accurate manner.  I simply wanted to prevent the information for this group being represented in a different method than I would be presenting on their behalf.  

Laura

I am trying to get the people below you - not your number - how does it split out?  Does no-one else get any credit?

Faith,
Per our discussion, enovate and Central are the same.  enovate/Chicago and Central Desk/Houston should be included in my teams numbers and are reflective of my goals/objectives for the year 2001.  One number should be viewed as Central/Origination.

Thanx,
Laura

It might be quicker to just take the number from the DPR and split it out into a number by originator, as we do need the information for Monday's prc.  The numbers below are the total per region which need dividing up by originator.

Frank		$8,261,000
Enovate	$6,219,000
Laura		$2,357,000
Fred		$19,465,000

Please send back the divided numbers to both Faith and I.

Thanks

Louise

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!
