Louise, regarding our 2 external analysts in the Monterrey Office, which are now "Outside Contractors", and according to our previous conversation, I am sending you the numbers you asked for: 

Gabriela Cantu and Alejandra Reyes, both have a Bachelors Degree in Economics from the TEC in Monterrey (Equivalent to the US MIT), with post-graduate degree in Finance. Both work for us and help us elaborating the newsletters, doing Nat Gas Market research, and helping us quote derivatives to customers, and elaborate natural gas and fuel oil presentations. 

We did not hired them directly. We contracted an HR company, to which we pay a monthly charge in exchange for technical services performed by their personnel.  In principle, this scheme helped us find the right people since we could ask for a change in personel if we desired.  It also gave us other benefits like not having a head count increase at that time. We also have a signed confidentiality agreement with both of them. 

Today, we pay the HR company the following, per person, in US Dollar Equivalent per month: 

Services Invoice:		$1,660.00 
15% VAT Tax of the invoice:	   $250.00
Total Payment :			$1,910.00  

However, net income to each analyst per month is around $780.- USD per month. 

Gabirela Cantu has been helping us since January 2000, and Alejandra Reyes since December 2000. 

It is not a great expense, and they are of great help to our team. 

Best regards.
