I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 


Let me know if you need anything else.

thanks

bob
