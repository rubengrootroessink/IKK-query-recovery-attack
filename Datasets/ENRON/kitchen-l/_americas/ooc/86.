Louise,

The iBuyit approval level updates you are requesting for Enron Americas are nearing completion and will be ready to be migrated into production on Friday. We have taken a shot at drafting a proposed communication for your consideration in advising your employees of the changes.  

Please advise if you would need any assistance in distributing the communications. Additionally, can you please confirm your approval to migrate the changes into production on Friday.

Thanks
John
