Louise --

My recommendation for an approval process for EnTouch is as follows:

1)	The deadline to provide information for that week's issue of EnTouch will be Wednesday at 12:00 pm.  All information submitted after that time will be held until the following week.
2)	A draft of EnTouch will be forwarded to each business unit head (or their designee) and commercial group head (or their designee), who has a Business Highlight or other information appearing in that particular issue.  E-mail, phone or in-person approval will be required from either a business unit head (or their designee) or commercial group head (or their designee) prior to distribution to Enron Messaging Administration on Thursday at 2:00 pm.
3)	If approval is not received prior to the deadline, the Business Highlight or other information will be pulled until approval is received.
4)	In the event a business unit or commercial group provides information that crosses business unit or commercial group lines, all affected business units and commercial groups will receive the draft and a representative of each involved party will be required to approve per instruction # 2.

I believe this process will alleviate the two problems that have occurred over the past few months.  Please advise.

Additionally, I have attached the list of contacts Kathie uses for gathering EnTouch information.  It includes the primary contacts and their secondary contacts.  Please feel free to comment on this list.

Thanks.

Eric
