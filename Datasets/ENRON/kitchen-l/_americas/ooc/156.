Next Wednesday, at 3:30p.m. David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs is bringing a group of 20 - 25 institutional investors to Enron. This meeting is part of a two day trip where these investors will be meeting with our peer merchant companies and other energy companies.  Jeff will be leading the meeting, but if you are free, it would great if you could attend.  There is no presentation, it will be mainly Q and A. Let me know.  Thanks.  MEK
