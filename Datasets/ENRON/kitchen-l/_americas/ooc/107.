John,
 
In regard to the Enron Chicago office and my responsibilities in Houston/ENA-Central Gas, I can be reached at home at 713/528-9854 or my cell phone 312/541-1225.
 
I have been in constant contact with my employees in the Chicago office, Houston office and those who are currently on the road on business.  All have been accounted for and we will be staying in contact throughout the evening.
 
Regards, 
Laura Luce
