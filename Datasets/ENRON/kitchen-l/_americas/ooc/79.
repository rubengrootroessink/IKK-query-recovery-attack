With Luce - not Shively (he'd gone).  They are all upset by Jean's approach, nothing to do with John Grass at all.  I think we move on NUG and worry about the way forward for Jean when we have our gas meeting - the origination heads plus Hunter and Arnold.  
 
I think both her and Hunter feel that Jean is saying they do not know how to do their own jobs - eg managing Peoples.  Apparently there have been a few conversations between Jean and Origination/Trading Group heads but not Laura.  
 
She fully agreed we want to keep Grass.
