	Please see the attached file that reflects the multiple for each asset sale.  As you can see for assets that had losses, we show no multiple.  Additionally, there are some assets that have no EBITDA at all (that we are aware of), thus we show no multiple.  Please let me know if this is what you expected.  Thanks!
