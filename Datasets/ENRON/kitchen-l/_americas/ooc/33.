Attached is a summary report of the EWS tactical (revenue driven) and strategic (educational) visits to Enron supported by experience ENRON in third quarter 2001.

At experience ENRON, our goal is to support the EWS deal development teams by creating powerful Enron experiences that result in greater favorability and familiarity of Enron while differentiating us from the competition.

Our role is to:
Reduce time and labor costs associated with planning and execution of customer visits
Coordinate BU subject matter experts (SME's) to tell the Enron story, i.e. EOL, trading, etc.
Customize agendas aligned with Enron and customer objectives
Shorten sales cycles 

We are here to support your team in reaching your goals.  Please call with questions or changes.
