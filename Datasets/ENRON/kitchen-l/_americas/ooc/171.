Last year, Enron employees generously donated a record $2.8 million to the United Way, an amount which exceeded our goal of $2.3 million by nearly half a million dollars.  This year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $2.9 million.  When matched dollar for dollar by Enron, our total contribution would be $5.8 million.

This goal is a challenging one, but we believe it is achievable with your help.  It is also a far-reaching goal with the United Way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater Houston area.  

To kick-off this year's campaign, please join us for the EWS Leadership Giving Reception in the Bluebonnet Ballroom at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 1700 Smith St. on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.  The adopted agency for EWS this year is the Center for the Retarded.  Representatives from the center and recipients of Enron's United Way Scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you.  We will also review the campaign objectives for this year.

Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs, we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston with 49 members, and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership.  Your support this year will help Enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group.

Whatever your decision regarding your pledge, we need 100% participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of EWS.  Your contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our community.  When you give, you change a life right here in the Houston area.

Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail at zulie.flores@enron.com or by phone at ext. 3-3908 by Friday, July 27 and join us in setting the standard for EWS by giving generously and getting your pledge in by August 10.

Mark and Greg
