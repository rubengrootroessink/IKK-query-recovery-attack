Please find the latest draft of the Wholesale pitch included below as an attachment.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.
