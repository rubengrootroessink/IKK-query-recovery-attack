John and Louise,

I wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed the Beaver Creek offsite and to thank you for the invitation.   I think everyone was impressed with how well this trip was organized - it was first class all the way.  The recreational and social activities were fun, the meetings were informative, and the relationships that were formed and strengthened with other business unit leaders should prove invaluable.  

Thanks again!

Craig Breslau
