Scary yes, but how can you even consider it's reality?  How the hell do you
think they developed the film?  It's not likely, given their proximity to
the approaching plane, that they would have had a rat's ass chance in hell
of escape.  Use your noodle you MBA pencil neck!

Guys:

I'm not sure this picture is for real, but it's scary enough anyway.
