The EWS Leadership Reception is tomorrow.  Please mark your calendar.  We would like to encourage you to attend.

The reception will be held on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm at the new Crowne Plaza Hotel, located just down the street at 1700 Smith St.  We will be in the Bluebonnet Ballroom (see directions below).

Your participation in the 2001 campaign is critical to Enron's success.  We would like to again encourage you to consider joining the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston, and we ranked in the top 25 nationally.  Let's put Enron on top again this year!

To make your 2001 United Way contribution, you can access the online system at https://hrglobal.enron.com/.

Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail or at ext. 3-3908 by 5:00 pm today.  We look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Mark and Greg
