The e-mail that was sent out many weeks ago about the off-site indicated that it would run from Wednesday night to Saturday AM.  It is now running Thursday until Sunday.  Calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $13k for one roundtrip and a total of $20k for two round trips.  I had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in Oregon on Saturday night.  It is a good friend of mine and my wife's.  It's in eastern Oregon and is about a four hour drive away.  I see the following choices before me:

1.	Don't go to Colorado.  Tell you guys that I'm a family man and not a company man.
2.	Go to Colorado and fly home commercial on Friday night, leaving at about 4 PM.  Incremental cost of flight would be $500.
3.	Go to Colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early Saturday afternoon.  Incremental cost of flight would be $7,000.
4.	Don't go to wedding.  Tell my wife that I'm a company man and that it is critical that I ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30-something Enron folks all weekend.

While I have authority to place millions of dollars of the company's money at risk, I don't feel comfortable signing up for a $7,000 extra flight without talking to you guys.  #3, the jet set answer costs quite a bit more, but it dramatically increases the amount of time that I spend in Colorado.  #2 is cost-effective but gives me less than 24 hours in Colorado.  #4, while perhaps appealing to you, doesn't work for me.  #2 is probably preferable to #1, just requires a lot of travel time to me.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
