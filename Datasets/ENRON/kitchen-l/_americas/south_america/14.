We have final confirmation for the week of March 19th.  I will send a preliminary agenda out asap. At this time we are planning  a one day visit in Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Rio.  Our overall business review will be in Sao Paulo.   At this point we are trying to schedule Argentina for Monday in order to minimize travel time.

Orlando, I have firm dates for you now for Jeff's visit to So. America.  

He is scheduled to arrive in Sao Paulo on Monday, March 19 at 9:20 a.m. on the Continental non-stop flight from Houston.  He is scheduled to depart Sao Paulo on Sunday, March 25 at 10:45 p.m.  He is available to you Monday through Friday that week, but wishes to arrive in Rio around mid-day on Friday, March 23, to take some personal time over the weekend.

Jeff would like to hold employee meetings in the Sao Paulo, Rio, and Buenos Aires offices in addition to visiting with customers and government officials.  If it is important for him to travel to Bolivia, he will do it.  If he does indeed travel to Bolivia, please advise of any visas, etc., that are required.

Please send me an outline of where and when he will travel as soon as possible.  Many thanks for your assistance.  SRS
