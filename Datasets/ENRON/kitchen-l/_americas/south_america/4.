We will be handing this draft out today. 

We met with Goldman and Citibank yesterday and have reviewed the regions macro econ status. 

We need to get you more active in our activity. I do not think everyone knows your team exists. Put John Lavoratto, louise kitchens and Jim Hughes, stan horton  on you e mail list at least. I would reccomend you set a meeting up with them directly to let them know what your team is doing. I will talk to them again today. 

I am in Houston next week. I will stop by.

Good work everyone who saw the first draft was surprised we had this in house expertice. 

MFG
