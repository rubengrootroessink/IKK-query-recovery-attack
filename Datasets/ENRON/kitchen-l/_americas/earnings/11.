Attached is a summary of origination income YTD. It does not include the value of the Alamac put ($1.9mm) which will be realized in the third Qtr. or the $5.5mm for the ECP sale which was booked in Q1. As I mentioned this AM, I believe a conservative analysis of our current pipeline puts us at about $145mm for the year.
