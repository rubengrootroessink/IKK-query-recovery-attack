Dear Louise,
I just got your e-mail. I am so glad to hear you're happy with the painting.
I am working on the yellow one and will let you know as soon as it's
finished. I look forward in seeing those pictures...
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a wonderful new year filled with
joy, love and success for you and your family.
Take care and keep in touch.
Happy Holidays!!
Sincerely,
Barbara.
