Louise, just to give you a quicmk up date...  This past couple of weeks, we have traded the following: 

Volume:	5.43 BCF's
Origination:	$163,500
Our total numbers to date are : $3.0 Mill, and 126 BCFs.
The number of trades has slowed down a bit as we expected, but we've been pretty busy following up with Deemed ISDAs and Master Agreements.
We have received in the last 2 weeks 8 executed long confirmations, and are working with legal and our customers with a list of long confirms. 

I would like to talk to you regarding other deals we have been pursuing with other groups, and get some feedback from you.  I'll call you. 

Best regards.
