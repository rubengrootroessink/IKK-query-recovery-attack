Louise,

I want to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to talk to you about career opportunities with the Mexico Group. I understand that this is a tough time but I believe that that my experience and career can be useful to help in the developing of business in Mexico.
I worked for almost 10 year in mergers & acquisition and investment banking in Mexico before joining Enron's Mergers & Acquisition and finance Origination Group headed by Frank Stabler in the former EI / CALME. Currently, I am a Manager at the Enron Xcelerator group leading a business development project in the transportation industry. However, given the current environment at Enron, the project will unlikely be funded.
I am attaching my resume for your review and I would like to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to discuss about a potential career opportunities in your group. 
 
Thanks.
