Louise, thanks for your prompt response.
I am getting a fair response from our guys in Monterrey, although we have not submitted a proposal, yet.
I am loading them with information, in order for them to prepare the proposals during the next weeks.
Then, we will see how good & creative the proposals turn out.

On a different issue, I had an informal talk with Sergio Gutierrez ( David's eldest brother from DeAcero)
last week in Monterrey, over dinner. I would like to share the outcome with you, only.

Regards,	jaime____

I had a meeting this morning with Dr. Luis Tellez (former Secretary of Energy), who is currently COO of Grupo DESC.
He is also very interested in receiving a proposal from Enron. 
They are preparing all the information we will need, and he offered to send it before the end of the week. DESC's needs
are 150 MW, in 22 separate sites. Luis wants to have a proposal by the middle of next week, in order to discuss it with
Mr. Fernando Senderos, Chairman & CEO of DESC, and his boss, who will out of the country for one month, as of July 21.
This is another opportunity that looks promising, although our proposal will be compared with others coming from a single
plant scheme ( 250 or 500 MW), where we have a disadvantage at heat rate and pricing.
I believe we have to be more creative, in the way we portrait our import scheme. Lets talk about it.
