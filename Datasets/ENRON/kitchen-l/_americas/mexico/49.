Thanks.

We had reasonably good meetings with Ford and GM yesterday (Mike Curry on point for this). GM may be able to bring Delphi and Celanese to the table. Both companies are interested in further discussions. I am meeting with Enron engineers today to have a look at the practical geographic limits for power delivered across the proposed tie (displacement obviously increases the physical limit) to help identify additional target customers.
