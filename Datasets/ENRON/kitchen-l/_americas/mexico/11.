I guess by your response, Bob's group (or some subset) remains intact?  If so, we can cover with his group.  Rimbau may be in his group already. 
 
Does the Mexican group survive?  Given the circumstances, we should consider going to Tractebel and see if we can go ahead sell them the entire project. I bet the IDB would be glad to be rid of us!
 
Let's talk on Monday when you get a chance.

Surely we can cover this from within Virgo's team?
