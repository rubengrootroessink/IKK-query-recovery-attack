I have been attempting to reach Jaime Alatorre to obtain his accomplishments and have update his profile with no luck (both voicemail and emails have been sent.) Did he send it directly to you?  The rest of Mexico is in the binder integrated into the mix.  Hope that helps.

The files are great - thankyou very much.

Could you put together a separate file specifically on all the Mexico people for Monday (incorporating the emails we have received from Steve, Jaime and Jaime)

Thanks
