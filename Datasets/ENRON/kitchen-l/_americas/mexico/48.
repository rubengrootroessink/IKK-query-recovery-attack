Title: Mexican Power Markets: CFE Looks to Industrial Generators for Excess Power, but Many Questions Remain

*********************************************************************** 

SURPLUS INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY COULD RELIEVE MEXICO'S SUMMER POWER SHORTAGE 

Power plants being built under the Comision Reguladora de Energia's (CFE) 
Independent power producer program will not be available until the end of the 
year, leaving a very tight market during the summer peak demand season. 
President Vicente Fox recently announced that the CFE would increase the 
capacity that industrial generators could sell back to the national grid. The 
initiative was met with resistance by many members of Mexico's Congress, 
however, and has been suspended pending judicial review. The success of the 
program will depend on three factors: 

*  Is there enough surplus capacity available where it is needed? 

*  Is the CFE willing to offer an attractive price? 

*  Will the courts allow it to happen?
