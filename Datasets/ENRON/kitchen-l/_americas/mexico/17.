Louise, just want to give you some good news, this morning at 8:50 am, we closed a transaction with Vitro.
They bought a Natural Gas Financial Swap for 100 contracts per month, for 7 months, starting Apr02, ending Oct02.  This a 7 Bcf trade which shows a lot of trust in our company and the new merger.

Best regards.
