Just to mention to you that we just closed the deal we spoke about this morning, with Grupo Alfa's petrochemical subsidiary (Alpek):    70 Contracts a month, for 21 months, Apr01-Dec03 in the Tetco-EPGT and Houston Ship Channel Indexes. This was a 14.7 BCFs and a $300,000 USD NPV'd...

So we are at about 150 BCFs and $3.6 MM.

Best regards.
