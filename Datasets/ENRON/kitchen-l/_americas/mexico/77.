John and Louise, I just want to inform you that last friday, we reached our 2001 Volume and Origination targets for Risk Management trades in Mexico.  We have been marketing financial derivatives to industrial customers in Mexico, and aggressively expanding our cutomer base, and it is finally paying off.
Our targets for this year were: To reach a volume of 84 Bcfs of Natural Gas equivalent trades, and Origintaion of  $1.9 Million dollars.

Today, we have 98 Bcfs of gas, and $2.130  Million dollars in origination. Our efforts to expand this market will not ease, but we are very happy for this results down here, and wanted to share this with you. 

Best regards.
