Max:

I have attached a "technical risk template" that should serve as an outline for the presentation. You may also want to discuss some of the major commercial terms and conditions that are driving schedule, performance, and cost.

You don't need to address each technical risk item in infinite detail, but we should focus on the key items of scope definition, construction execution, and contractor analysis that can impact value.  The objective is to identify what we need to pay attention to as we begin to ramp up the capital expenditure.  Defining and managing construction risk has become a popular topic given the status of the Dabhol and Cuiba projects.

We also need to take some time to discuss/settle the outstanding EE&CC invoice (now EEOS).   I would like to agree a payment number and move on down the road with EEOS.  The system we have going forward should ensure that no EEOS costs are incurred/transferred to the EA origination group until you and the Tech Services representative have pre-approved them 

Regards,
Brian
