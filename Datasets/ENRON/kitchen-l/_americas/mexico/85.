FYI.  One would hope that, statistically speaking, I'm in the clear for a while.

Best regards - Max

Max,

I would find it doubtful that that the flight crew would test the aircraft in such a fashion, during a scheduled flight with pax aboard. Anytime there is a problem with flight control that is VERY serious. I'm glad they seemed to have handled the situation. It probably was not a VOR problem but more likely a flight control problem i.e. control surfaces, rudder, ailerons. The VOR fail message could have been due to a power down of the avionics consistent with a post emergency-landing procedure.

I have a commercial pilot certificate and have done some charter work. In addition I've flown a 757 in the simulator at United and know how many back ups those things have. They are very redundant.

I'm really glad everything turned out okay.

All the best,
Andy

Andy:

I was actually the person to whom this happened.  I was on an AeroMexico flight yesterday from Mexico City to Monterrey.  Within minutes after leaving Mexico City the plane started to hump up and down and then started fishtailing.  It is unclear whether this was something the pilot was doing to test the plane or not.  We quickly circled back to Mexico City, but came in very, very low on our approach (and seemed to be losing speed).

In any event, as I was exiting the plane, I looked into the cockpit and saw the message "VOR2  FAIL" on the center display.  Being an admitted greenhorn at these things, I didn't know what else to look for or where to look for it, so there may have been something I overlooked.

The crew was very short on details, but they appeared very rattled by all of this.  One of the flight attendants told a fellow passenger who was complaining about being late that he should simply be thankful he was still alive.  [Probably not what they teach in flight attendant school as the optimal response, but . . . . . .]

In any event, I appreciate the info below and would appreciate any additional info this message may lead you to.  I'd love to know whether or not the adrenaline surge was warranted.

Best regards - Max

a VOR is the standard instrument for navigating an aircraft under an IFR flight plan. It is the receiver that allows the plane to be flown on bearings from ground stations. If it were to fail there would be loads of backups, although if you are on a scheduled flight their operations manual would dictate that the flight be terminated as soon as practicable in the event any primary component, such as this were to fail. Where were you that you were able to monitor the performance of this instrument ? The flight deck ?

if it shows VOR2  failure - any idea what that is?  it was a 737.
