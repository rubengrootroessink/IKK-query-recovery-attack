FYI.

I've asked for more accurate analysis of what differences are and may need your help to get an agreement to either increase bases for those say below $100k base or give everyone an "allowance" as part of the initial first 12 month transition.

We have this issue in every deal we do, the benefit coverage is good
overall, but employees pay more for the coverage. It's income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits.  Benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
Citigroup and we don't want to do anything with subsidy or anything else.
Happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp. and ben. philosphy to
deal with the benefits.

John,

I am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs. Perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem. My
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical/dental premiums.

> Your correct on the costs.  I will be in a meeting most of the afternoon
today, but I should be able to have you a spreadsheet on Monday showing some
different scenarios on how NETCO employees paychecks would be affected
paying for their own benefits based on their salary range and coverage tier
(Employee Only, Employee Spouse, Employee & Child, Family).

> I'm not sure if I read this correctly but seems to me medical costs are
significantly higher under Citi groups arrangements. I've asked Neil and
Jeanie to work with you to illustrate if they are. I may need to get them to
subsidise for first 12 months the difference, if I can prove some hardship.

> David, below is an initial draft of our current benefit plans compared to
SSMB's plans.  The main difference is employee's for SSMB pay for benefits
out of pocket instead of having Flexdollars cover a portion of the cost.
