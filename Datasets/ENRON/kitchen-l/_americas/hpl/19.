Team:

We are fast approaching our June 1 date to Close the HPL transaction.  A critical path items is to complete the unwind of the monetizations of HPL assets.  There are a number of converging activities that will require legal resources, so it is important that we clear out as many activities as possible so we don't reach legal gridlock at the end of May.

Tim Despain, can you lend your support to Ranabir/Shirley to move Hancock and Prudential to act?  Let me know if further resources/attention is needed.  Right now Hancock/Pru are the bottlenecks. 

Anne, I will call HCC and see where we are on unwinding the Project Rock meter monetization based on the documents you sent them.

Ranabir, can you prepare a schedule showing when we will have each monetization unwound and what the critical items/actions are for each.

Let me know if you need additional resources.  Lets get this done!

Thanks,
Brian
