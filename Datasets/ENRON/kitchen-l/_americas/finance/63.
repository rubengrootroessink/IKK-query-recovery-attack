Louise:

As an additional follow-up, as part of the approval process, I was told that ENA and EE&CC have the right to opt out of this fund at any time during the first twelve months without cause and without penalty.  If this is something that neither you nor Dave want to do, then I suggest exercising this option.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss
