Sorry. A bit behind on my emails. Still hustling to find $ for quarter end. I may try to call you a bit later on storage but we did not see that deal. Storage doesn't fit any of the capital pricing scenarios we have laid out - balance sheet, prm, or off balance sheet. I think, given that it's a liquid asset, it should be priced more like prm activity than pure debt if it is to attract a capital charge.
