Capital curve model is complete. We are running several pricing scenarios to validate the mechanics to ensure that the new zero curve does accurately reflect interest expense. We should be ready to go by the end of next week. I would like to implement the week we return from the offsite. As you can see below, while we have priced several deals to date, only two have actually closed and funded.

thanks,

Robert:

Do you have a summary of the deals so far that are in the capital book?  Do you keep a spreadsheet?  Let me know.

Thanks,
