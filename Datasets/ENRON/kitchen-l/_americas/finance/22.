Greg Adams in Corp is preparing a 9/30 look at funds flow/operating cash flow at the corporate and business unit levels for delivery Monday. I'd prefer to distribute that to you than cobble together figures from 9/24 (latest data dump) given the large amount of activity (Wimpy, Inventory, Mahonia) that took place the last week of September.
