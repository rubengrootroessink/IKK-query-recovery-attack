I am game for gathering the group.  Can you give me a list of the names of the individuals? Any other words of wisdom -- as I am still a bit confounded by the point of the exercise.  Do you have time for lunch one day or could you give me a quick ring?

Best of luck on your upcoming project.  It is definitely the best project I have ever worked on!  Boy or girl?  Let me know if you find yourself in need of any of the baby gadgetry stored in my attic.
