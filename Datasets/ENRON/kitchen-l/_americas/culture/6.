Jean,
 
Saw the first pass of names today with their progression history.  We don't have a 100 yet, but I think once we refine the searching/gathering tool we can get close.  ( We have had problems gathering the data due to multiple sources of data retention ... have to piece the history together) Trying to only use names that have an impressive history and are ranking in the top three performance categories.
 
I will have good examples with progression history for tomorrows meeting.  
 
Robert
