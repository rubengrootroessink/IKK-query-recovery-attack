Looks good.  I need to find a different version of Code of Conduct that more closely mimics EPMI and PGE version.  The agreement in Appendix B right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings.  
 
Agree that we need to finish up details of (a) data transfer and (b) transistional services agreement.
 
In my discussions on Friday, the transitional services will be "agent" type activities.  Enron needs help in making sure that it can service its contracts.  No UBS Warburg Energy employee will make commercial decisions for Enron - simply perform directed activities.
 
The question of data transferred is still outstanding, but I will hopefully know more on Monday am.  I am checking on exactly how much Counterparty info will be held by UBS Warburg Energy.
 
I plan on being in your office first thing Tues am.
 
Thanks,
 
Jim

Here is what I had come up with. My thought is that the bold Roman

numeral headings would make up an agenda, which we should send to

Cindy Marlette on Monday, along with a list of those who will

attend for UBS.  The subheadings, which would not appear on the

what we send to FERC, would be the main items for discussion.

I don't think your approach and mine are very far apart.  I might

be somewhat less affirmative about raising the Section 203 issue.

It will surely come up as we describe what will or will not be

transferred.

I also think it would be very helpful to clear up the points about

the approach to existing Enron customers, and the transitional

arrangements before the meeting  I would like, in any event, to

put something into the MBR application on transition arrangements

that is more definitive--in the right way--than footnote 12 of the

draft I sent out yesterday.

Nick --

Here is a draft of some talking points on the FERC meeting.  May

need to shorten.  I am very concerned about the data UBS will

acquire and the access to contracts, and implications for 203.
