Dan: Relative to support of California issues for "EES/OLDCO", once Jim and his group begin supporting  NETCO, there will be staff remaining (clearly, staffing will be tight, and it's still my hope that Jim decides to stay with "OLDCO/NEWCO) in regulatory affairs (5 professionals including myself) to support you and others on California as well as all other issues for "EES/OLDCO as well as NEWCO....Thanks...Rick

Jim - 

Following up on our discussion.......

Thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting(s) to get the appropriate team(s) prepared to testify on January 24, 2002.

I realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks, and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the CA book and the CPUC activities as critically important.


Thanks - Dan
