Amy,

Jennifer Plunkett (212-713-1445) will order the publications and reprints for you from our fulfillment house. Please let
her when you need them, and she will let you know if that is possible.

About the folders, you will need to order those directly from Corporate Services (Teresa Carroll, 201-352-3034).

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Claudia
