Liz,
I've granted you access as requested.  I did notice that there were a few others listed to have access to Louise' mail.  I'll delete those names.

Hi Joy,

Louise Kitchen has requested me to have access to her calendar, contacts and Inbox.  I need to have the ability to create, delete and edit appoints in her calendar.  I need to be able to review and reply to emails on her behalf.   Louise wants to confirm that only Tammie Schoppe and myself  have access to her calendar, contacts and inbox.  Please  do a thorough search to be sure no one else can view her information, including those in the London office.  Call me should you have any questions.


Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor x31935
