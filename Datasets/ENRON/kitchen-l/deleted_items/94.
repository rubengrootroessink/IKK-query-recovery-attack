=09=09Dear Afternic Member ,   Will your .org names be affected by the upco=
ming registry shift?   No doubt you know that the VeriSign registry agreed =
to divest itself of the .org domain as part of VeriSign's deal to retain bo=
th its registry and registrar business units.  That means that a new regist=
ry will be running .org by this time next year.  But the divestiture's impa=
ct on .org registrants remains uncertain.   Rumors have suggested that .org=
 will be reserved exclusively for nonprofits or officially recognized nonco=
mmercial organizations, that other .org registrants will lose their names o=
r their ability to transfer or renew them.  Others have suggested that thes=
e rules will apply only to new registrations, grandfathering those existing=
 before the new registry takes over.   The ICANN names council weighed in e=
arlier this month with recommendations against evictions, transfer restrict=
ions, and registration restrictions by the future .org registry, but neithe=
r ICANN nor registry applicants are obligated to accept these recommendatio=
ns.  One that looks likely to win acceptance, though, is the suggestion tha=
t the new registry strive above all to differentiate .org from other gTLDs.=
   This is good news. Regardless of what happens to the 2.5 million current=
ly registered .org names, any effort to establish a stronger identity or br=
and for .org will enhance the value of .org names.  If no registration rest=
rictions accompany the registry transfer, .org will play a far more signifi=
cant role in the aftermarket.   Regards, [IMAGE] Peter Girard, Director of =
