Intellor Group announces "Web Services Reality - Spring 2002" a unique, first of its kind, virtual conference paradigm for educating IT professionals!

Web Services is undoubtedly the number one strategic technology direction that you need to be informed about in 2002.  Web Services Reality - Spring 2002 will offer thought-leading content to IT professionals worldwide through a state-of-the-art virtual classroom environment.

This is the first in a new "Reality" series of virtual conferences - conferences that are delivered entirely over the Internet, where attendees can be full interactive participants without leaving the office. The conference emphasis and tone is on getting the real unvarnished truth on new technologies and avoiding hype. Keynotes, in-depth tutorials, and track sessions are delivered by industry thought-leaders and IT practitioners with early-adopter experience.

Web Services Reality is aimed at IT professionals who want to understand the latest technologies for solving real-world e-Business integration problems. Track sessions will have a common context of:
- including case-study, technology demonstration or 'lessons learned' material
- delivering practical 'how-to-apply' information rather than bland discussion of technologies
- occasionally challenging conventional wisdom with discussion of new, pioneering, potentially controversial, techniques or technology applications.

Find out how you can participate as a Track Presenter without having to spend days out of the office or fight for limited education and travel dollars.  http://www.intellor.com/links/?pg=WSRP
