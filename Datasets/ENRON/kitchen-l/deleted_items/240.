Deirdre McCaffrey was in Global Markets.  We (Hunter and I) believe Deirdre is an extremely strong asset to be in Netco.

The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.  Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).  I assume there are no problems but if so let me know.

Larry Hunter	- Documentation
Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination
Larry Cash - Gas Settlements
Jon Lewis - Risk
