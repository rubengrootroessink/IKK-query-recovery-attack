Marcus and Louise:

Thanks very much for the outfit and blanket.  Jill can use all the blankets she can get at this point.  She is doing great, and even sleeps a little at night.

If you have time, feel free to stop by some evening.  The extended family is all gone, so things are a little more sane around the house.

Regards,

Dan
