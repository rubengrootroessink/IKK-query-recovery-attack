Can we have a meeting at 9:00AM Monday morning to discuss the Transition Services.  I will try to get conference room 49c1.  
Jim, please invite anyone else from your team that you feel would be helpful.

Mary, we will plan on patching you in by phone.

Mitch

Jim,

There is a lot of confusion over the scope and scale of services that the estate will require from UBS over the next several months.  During the negotiations over the Transistion Services Agreement, it was clearly contemplated that the estate will need UBS to schedule and purchase power as an agent of the estate.  However, most of the UBS team does not understand or expect to provide these types of services.  I know that you have coordinated with Greg Whalley but I feel it is necessary that we have a broader coordination meeting between the two organizations.  I think this meeting needs to happen at your level.

Thanks,

Paul
