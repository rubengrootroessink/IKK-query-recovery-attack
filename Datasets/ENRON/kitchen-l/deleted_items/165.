=09=09Dear Afternic Member ,  Ought-one is nearly done.   It leaves in its =
wake perhaps the most tempestuous 12 months in domain name history. Absent =
the streaking Internet market, domain investors' strategies were tested. Co=
llections of traffic-catchers, properties developed as proof-of-concept sit=
es, and portfolios of single names and logical sets vied for buyers' attent=
ion. Some sellers culled their holdings, releasing names they were unable t=
o sell. Others swooped in to grab them, and in some cases enjoyed more succ=
ess than their predecessors.   Gauging the domain name game by sales activi=
ty on Afternic, the second and fourth quarters showed unprecedented strengt=
h, suggesting that 2001 far outclassed previous years in aftermarket transa=
ction volume. But for those domain investors that identified and thrived on=
 reliable market patterns, this year threw a serious wrench into the works:=
 new TLDs.   The namespace changed more radically than some realized when .=
biz and .info entered the root. Initial assessments of new gTLDs' crashing =
success and failure are laughably premature especially considering many of =
the most valuable .biz names haven't been released. It may be years before =
their true impact is felt on the 'net and their true value is reflected in =
the aftermarket. But if netizens begin to recognize meaning in the string a=
t the right of the dot, the current valuation logic will soon become obsole=
te.   In one way or another, the namespace will undergo massive change in 2=
002, but as always the aftermarket will provide the first indications of it=
