Linda Guinn is in the legal department for the estate.  I will coordinate with Richard Sanders to make sure that UBS obtains copies of what is sent to Linda.  Michelle

OK

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?
