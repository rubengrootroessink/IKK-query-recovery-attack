> We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has specia
l events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at t
he Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting appr
oval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spok
en with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon even
t.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval thr
ough UBS prior to booking any formal event.
