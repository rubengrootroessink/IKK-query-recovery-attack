Lisa - preliminary flows

Day 1 Names:

1.CRC AV Ldn to review list of 162 to check for existing
relationships. The list will be updated with the relevent MF ref so
that DMAC Stam can enhance as required
2.CRC-AV Ldn to add MF static data fields to the list -
RXM/Reporting/Nace etc
3.CRC-AV Ldn to derive RXM details, Nace and reporting codes
4.Distribute
5.DMAC Stam to update MF
6.Whilst DMAC is updating the list, CRC-AV Ldn to vet names using
local research tools. This is the quickest approach. Any names we
cannot identify, we will forward to Debbie Brackett with a request
for info. Debbie should liase with Legal to avoid duplicity. If KYC
docs form part of the Legal assessment, then one of the Legal guys
should be making that statement. We will assume (?)
resolutions/capacity language presumably is included in the ISDA
docs, so not necessary for KYC.

Day 2 Names (process needs to be understood and agreed prior to day 2)

1.Account forms to be revised to cater for new products (Marek to
provide details)
2.Houston CRC/vetting to get familar with forms and requirements
3.New accounts to be raised by Marketer and approved by business head
(who)
4.Marketer sends form and docs to Houston CRC/vetting
5.Houston CRC/vetting conduct KYC/credit assesment in conjunction
with Legal
6.Once approved, Houston CRC/vetting send form (with RXM/reporting
data) to Houston DMAC
7.Houston DMAC send form with UBSWE mnemonic to DMAC Stam
8.DMAC Stam add to MF
9.DMAC Stam send to CRC-AV Ldn

Pls review for discussion on Friday

     Has your follow-on mtg happened - Glass is very concerned about
the
     process for both day 1 and beyond.

     Andy,
     Has a list of FSA vetting reuirements been sent to Debbie
Brackett?
     Bill wants to know what will be an issue since we wil not have
all
     docs day 1?

     How will the process work going forward?

     He wants an update by end of today how Andy vs Credit vs legal
will
     coordinate vetting documentation both for the start up names and
going
     fwd.  Specifically BD resolutions have been problematic at Enron
which
     we know we need for FSA.  Also, what will this A/V group in
Houstone
     be searching for vs what legal is obtaining thru the legal doc
     process.

     Andy- Please take the lead on this.  I will assist whereever I
can.
