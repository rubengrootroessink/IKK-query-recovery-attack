Louise, attached please find a revised version of Enron Canada's third quarter origination report.  Further to your request, we have corrected the numbers and have ensured that the numbers have been correctly allocated with respect to each originator.

Please note that the numbers for "De Stefano", "Di Stefano" and "Pastega" (maiden name) have been combined into one number for Cyntia Di Stefano.

 

Regards, Rob
