Louise

Have been thinking about you over the past few weeks and hope that you and
Marcus are OK.

I missed the last posting date to the States by weeks so am sending you an
e:Christmas message.    Hope you all have a great time - having a little one
makes a big difference to Christmas - Milly is so excited, but we are even more
excited about seeing her face when she opens her pressies and sees that Santa
has eaten his mince pie!!

Would be really good to see you in the New Year - all the best for 2002.

Love from Ches, Media Star and Milly Moo
