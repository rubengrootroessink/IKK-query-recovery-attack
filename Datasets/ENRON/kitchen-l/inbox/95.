Hello

Long time no see or hear!!

Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark
as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm
not supposed to be using it oh well.

How is America? I had no idea that you where there or that you had  had a
baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples
whereabouts.  How old is you little boy and what's his name.

It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail
mad  to try and fill in my time.  Only got 2 days left and then I am
finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New
York.

I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died  at the
beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and
mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having
Christmas here instead.  My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2
summers and a bit of winter.  she originally came to help me with Louisa
just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum
looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to
look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are
not always a straight 9-5.  Louisa goes to nursery during the week  and mum
and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as
useful as a chocolate fireguard )  My sister is an art director for Vidal
Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in
London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting `places, still
single no children but loves Louisa to bits.

Anyway enough about me, how is life in America,  do you work or are you a
lady of leisure?  Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at
school yet is he?  does he look like you or your husband?  Louisa is blond
with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like
my sister and my dad.  I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist
with her as she was born with a lump in her neck (which he has told us will
have to be removed in later years) she also has a mark on the back of her
head and a birthmark between her lip and her nose which a lot of people
comment about but I am very used to.  She has noe to go and see another
specialist about these 2 things and then hopefully eveything will be sorted
out, apart from that ahe is nearly 3 but every thinks she is at least 4 as
she is very tall and well built unfortuanately the only thing she has got
from her father is his Majorcian temperment!!

Say hello to your mum and dad and Paul, if you are in the Uk at the same
time as me let me know as I would love to see you all.  Bye for now

Love Jo and Louisa  xxx
