Dear Louise-

I had a request from Keith Fraley as he was departing...

He is interested in purchasing from Enron the equipment used by his group for the mapping function.  This would include a couple of PC's, a couple of servers and the big plotter.  Is this something that can be pursued?

Please let me know..

Thanks,

Julie  :-)
