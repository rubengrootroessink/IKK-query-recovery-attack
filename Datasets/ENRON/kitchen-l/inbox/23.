63 PA's sent.
3 signed PA's returned (Entex, Coral, Tucson Electric)

We are taking over the marketing initiative from Originators as of this afternoon.

Still waiting for legal approval of the Guarantee form, but I have a copy, so we're sending it out as draft, anyway.

Subject:	UBSW customers ..... 2/6/02

This is the listing of customers that have received PA and registration forms, either from Stamford or Houston.  At this time, the listing does not include the "big" packets that the Marketing group is mailing.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
