     I have no further comment, from UBS Legal standpoint, on either the
     one-way or two-way ISDA Credit Support Annex Paragraph 13, pending
     the text to come defining "Material Adverse Change".

     Will have comments on the Gas Annex tomorrow and the Power Annex as
     soon as possible after I receive it.

     I will be in Stamford tomorrow at 203.719.8958.

     Best regards.
