Louise,

I am currently working in behalf of the estate of Enron.  That said, I have not been given any direction on what to work on.  My background prior to ENE was natural gas trading-- if there is a need for anyone with a trading background working for the estate in your area, would you please let me know?

Additionally, prior to recent events, Fletch Sturm approached me to trade power.  Unfortunately, I decided to wait till the end of the year.  At some point, after you get everything moving in the right direction, I would be interested in working for you at the new company.

Regards,

Mike Bridges
