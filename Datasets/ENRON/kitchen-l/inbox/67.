Hey you

All expenses (including your Mum and Dad's transfer) are being billed to Kristen, who will give us an itemized bill at the end.

Beds & table are taken care of.

Great wine selection..........

Ellie

Also a couple of things - I need to pay for Mum and Dad's transfer - can I pay ahead of time on my amex?

Could you remind Kristin that the two beds need making into one in one of the bedrooms and we need an extension to the table.

Thanks

Me
