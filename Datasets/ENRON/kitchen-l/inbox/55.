Jennifer,

I was wondering if you could take a look at the attached.  I would like to modify some of it tomorrow and then submit to UBS for approval.  I would like to get your input on this and some other marketing materials we are pulling together.  Give me a call when you have a chance.  

Regards,

Chris
