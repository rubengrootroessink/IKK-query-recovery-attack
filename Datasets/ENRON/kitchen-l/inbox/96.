Louise,

I am a head hunter in London, and I specialise in the energy sector. Would
you be interested in returning to the UK to work for a company with ambition
and a strong balance sheet to support its intentions in online trading.

You would be an excellent choice of person to lead this effort.

Can we discuss this - I can be reached at the numbers below?

Best Regards,


Richard
