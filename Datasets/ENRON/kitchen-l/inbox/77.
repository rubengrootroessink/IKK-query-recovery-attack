 Setting up oil n products options book.  Nice people...alot of ex enron. It
feels very much like enron used to be b4 we grew out of control.  But there
is a guy here with equally bad shirt taste as Marcello!!
 Seems a shame mark wright and a few others went to williams and that isn't
lookin too rosie.    I actually found out about enron's demise when i was
away in honeymoon, (great wedding present!!)  but still sounds like the best
place to be considering everyone else was in the pub!!
Will the UBS job b in Houston back in london?
Well keep in touch and if ur in london and fancy a beer let me know.
take care
Jonesy
