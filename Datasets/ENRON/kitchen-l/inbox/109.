Just talked to Leslie Reeves about the meeting today.
 
Did I miss something?  Did we ever talk about a presentation
around readiness for a January 20th implimetation?
 
Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.
 
After the holidays, I would like to get in your calendar and 
discuss how Operations gets included more upfront.
 
thanks
