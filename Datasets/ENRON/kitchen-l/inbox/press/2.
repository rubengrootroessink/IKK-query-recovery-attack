Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.
