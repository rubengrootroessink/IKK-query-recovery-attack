Dear Louise,

I hope everything is well at your end.

Given the fact that UBS seems be the buyer of the Enron trading part in the US I was wondering if you think it is worthwhile to think about (or discuss) an extension to Europe (or the Netherlands in particular).

I am currently still employed by Enron although we are currently in the process of closing down the Enron Amsterdam office (I therefore attached my private contact details).

Best regards,
Dirk van Vuuren
