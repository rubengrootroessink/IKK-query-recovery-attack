Precision Dynamics' Smart Band(TM) RFID Wristbands Use Tag-it(TM) Smart
Label Inlays from Texas Instruments

SAN FERNANDO, Calif. and DALLAS, Dec 13, 2000 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --
Precision Dynamics Corporation, an international leader in identification
products, announced a new line of identification wristbands, Smart Band(TM)=
,
that incorporates Tag-it(TM) smart label inlays from Texas Instruments Radi=
o
Frequency Identification (RFID) Systems. Using TI's RFID smart label=20
technology,
Smart Band provides advanced data storage and a more accurate and secure=20
method
of identifying and tracking hospital patients, prison inmates, and patrons =
at
entertainment and recreation facilities.

Tag-it smart label inlays are an easy-to-integrate, cost-effective and
consumable RFID solution. Consisting of an integrated circuit, an antenna a=
nd
requiring no batteries, Tag-it RFID inlays are paper-thin, flexible and
programmable. The programmable feature of Tag-it allows application-specifi=
c
information to be written to and retrieved from the tags at any time. In
addition to providing a unique identification number, Precision Dynamics Sm=
art
Band can contain data on the location of hospital patients or prison inmate=
s.
These could also hold information on the status of an inmate's commissary
account or automatically debit a patron's account each time a purchase is m=
ade
at a theme park, vacation resort or other attraction. Information on the RF=
ID
Smart Band can be changed or locked to protect it from being modified.

Smart Band can be read by handheld RFID scanners, or by fixed-position read=
ers
installed in an entryway or other access point in the facility. The technol=
ogy
allows users to seamlessly transfer information from its computer systems t=
o=20
the
Smart Band, or vice versa, potentially eliminating human transcription erro=
rs.
The Smart Band can also be positively linked to digital photographs in a
database to help ensure more accurate processing of patients, inmates and
patrons.

"Smart wristbands, using TI's RFID technology, are a more accurate and secu=
re
method of identification that will improve business operations in numerous
environments," said Jim Bensman, Market Development Manager of Precision
Dynamics.

Precision Dynamics Corporation has developed three Smart Band solutions=20
designed
for specific markets that use TI's Tag-it smart label technology: 1) Sentry
Smart Band, 2) Clincher Smart Band and 3) Visa Smart Band. The Smart Band=
=20
family
of products combine RFID and bar coding technology making them compatible w=
ith
existing computer systems.


1. The Sentry(R) Smart Band(TM) - Hospitals/Healthcare Facilities
Upon admission, an RFID smart label containing the patient's data is
printed on demand and applied to the Sentry Smart Band.  Benefits
include:

-- Allows patients to be accurately identified without being moved or
touched
-- Creates a permanent record which can be updated at any time
-- Instantly tracks a patient's location anywhere in the facility
-- Reduces erroneous procedures and medication

2. The Clincher(R) Smart Band(TM) - Law Enforcement/Corrections
The Clincher Smart Band can be used by police departments and
correctional facilities to properly identify and process inmates.  Upon
arrest, each inmate is assigned a Clincher Smart Band, which contains a
unique ID number and can also accommodate his or her photo.  Benefits
include:

-- Hands-free identification and tracking of inmates throughout the
facility
-- Facilitates electronic roll calls and location of patients on demand
-- Instant verification through a link to database of inmate photos
discourages wristband tampering and prevents erroneous releases
-- Can be configured to debit inmates' commissary accounts each time a
purchase is made

3. The Visa(R) Smart Band(TM)  - Recreation/Entertainment
The Visa Smart Band can be used by the recreational and entertainment
industry for access control at concerts, sporting events or amusement
parks.  Upon entering a facility, each patron is given a Visa Smart
Band with an RFID chip that is detected each time the individual passes
through one of the portals located in key locations throughout the
facility.  Benefits include:

-- Tracks the location of patrons as they pass electronic gateways
-- Electronically controls patrons' access to specific attractions
-- Debits patrons' account each time a purchase is made
-- Prevents fraud and unauthorized use of wristbands by linking photos and
patrons' accounts
-- Researches patrons' traffic patterns and activities cost-effectively
