Broadcom Unveils World's First Gigabit Ethernet Controller with Support
for PCI-X Standard=0F=3DBCM5700 Demonstrates Higher Performance and Lower C=
PU
Utilization Than Any Other Commercially Available Solution

IRVINE, Calif., Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation
(Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadba=
nd
communications, today extended its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet=
=20
with
the introduction of the world's first Gigabit Ethernet Media Access Control=
ler
(MAC) chip that supports Peripheral Computer Interconnect (PCI) and PCI-X=
=20
local
bus interfaces for use in network interface cards (NIC) and LAN-on-Motherbo=
ard
(LOM) implementations.

The company's first Gigabit Ethernet MAC, the Broadcom(R) BCM5700, which co=
mes
with a comprehensive suite of software, sets a new standard in the industry=
=20
for
performance and on-chip integration. Broadcom's high performance 10/100/100=
0
BASE-T MAC is complemented by its broad family of Gigabit Ethernet transcei=
ver
chips and will enable the company to provide customers with complete
MAC/transceiver solutions that will drive down the cost of Gigabit Ethernet=
 in
next-generation servers, workstations, and desktop computers. Furthermore,
Broadcom's strategic alliance announced today with 3Com Corporation, the mo=
st
preferred brand and channel for network interface cards and LOM networking
solutions, will further accelerate customer migration from Fast Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet.

"By delivering leading edge MAC, transceiver and software technology with
unprecedented levels of integration, Broadcom is driving up performance whi=
le
driving down the price points to enable widespread adoption of Gigabit
Ethernet," said Marty Colombatto, Vice President and General Manager of
Broadcom's Networking Business Unit. "Broadcom's initiative to develop Giga=
bit
MAC technology is strategic to our overall commitment to deliver to our
customers the highest level of integration and performance for the advancem=
ent
of corporate networks."

Broadcom's first generation Gigabit Ethernet controller provides an
unprecedented level of integration, combining support for 10/100/1000 Megab=
it
per second (Mbps) operation, dual high-speed on-chip processors, 128KB of
integrated on-chip memory, advanced packet classification engines, and PCI
/PCI-X 1.0 local bus interconnects in a single-chip solution. Triple speed=
=20
(10,
100, and 1000 Mbps) support with standard-based auto-negotiation allows=20
server,
workstation and desktop computer manufacturers to build solutions that can
transparently interface with Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
technology over the existing Category 5 cabling infrastructure, and provide=
s=20
an
easy path for migrating legacy 10 Mbps and 10/100 Mbps networks to Gigabit
speed.

The BCM5700 is the industry's first Gigabit MAC to incorporate the recently
approved PCI-X v1.0 local bus interface specification allowing data transfe=
r
rates of up to 1.066 Gigabytes per second between the controller and the=20
system.
Support for PCI-X enables Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC to maintain traff=
ic=20
at
Gigabit speeds in I/O intensive server applications where multiple=20
communication
and storage peripheral devices share the same I/O bus. Broadcom's support f=
or
the new PCI-X interface demonstrates the company's commitment to delivering
leading edge I/O technology for servers and workstations.

According to Bert McComas, analyst for InQuest Market research, "By the mid=
dle
of 2001, we expect that PCI-X will be enabled in new mainstream server=20
platforms
from all leading server vendors. PCI-X builds on the momentum of PCI as the=
=20
most
widely supported I/O standard in the world, and defines a clear path to=20
satisfy
next generation server I/O performance demands."

Gigabit Ethernet provides ten times the performance of today's 10/100 BASE-=
T
server, workstation, and desktop network connections. This leap forward in
performance is especially critical for today's servers and workstations tha=
t=20
are
already being bottlenecked by aging 10/100 Ethernet connections. With Inter=
net
traffic doubling every three to six months, accelerating the performance an=
d
communication speed of the server is critical for enhancing end-users'=20
Internet
and e-Business experience.

Early tests show the BCM5700 raises the bar for the competition in both
throughput and host CPU efficiency. By focusing on total performance of the
system, the architecture of the BCM5700 enables servers and workstations no=
t
only to communicate faster but also to reduce the consumption of valuable=
=20
system
resources needed to reach Gigabit communications speeds.

PCI-X is an extension of the widely accepted PCI standard for data transfer
between CPUs and I/O peripherals and is becoming widely used by manufacture=
rs
for speeding the flow of data within servers, storage area networks and=20
network
switches. Backwards compatible with the high performance PCI local bus
specification, PCI-X offers an immediate solution to the increased I/O
requirements for high-bandwidth applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibr=
e
Channel, Ultra3 SCSI and high-performance graphics. PCI-X supports 32-bit a=
nd
64-bit operations at frequencies up to 133 MHz, allowing data throughput of=
=20
over
1 Gigabyte per second.

Broadcom also offers the most complete suite of software for server=20
applications
supporting all leading operating systems. This software suite is already
undergoing extensive system-level qualification by leading server OEMs.
Broadcom's server software package includes multi-vendor fail-over, IEEE=20
802.3AD
port aggregation, Layer 3 switch-independent Smart-Load-Balancing(TM),=20
Hot-Plug
PCI, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging, and IEEE 802.1P traffic prioritization for
Quality of Service (QoS), cable analyzer, and advanced diagnostics and cont=
rol
functions. The combined BCM5700 MAC and server software solution demonstrat=
es
superior functionality to any other Gigabit Ethernet NIC or LOM solution
commercially available today.

A complete NIC and LOM solution is achieved by combining the BCM5700 with o=
ne=20
of
Broadcom's market leading Gigabit Ethernet transceivers, which support the=
=20
three
Ethernet speeds - 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps - in a single-chip solution with
intelligent networking functions, such as cable diagnostics and auto networ=
k
detection. Having shipped over a million Gigabit Ethernet ports, Broadcom
continues to extend its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet, with the
broadest, most advanced family of Gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Broadcom's
Gigabit Ethernet transceiver architecture is the only solution that has bee=
n
proven in actual high-volume field deployment. Furthermore, Broadcom's Giga=
bit
Ethernet transceiver architecture has completed over eighteen months of
extensive system- and device-level testing in real-world and "worse-case"=
=20
cable
plants by hundreds of engineers in dozens of test sites worldwide.


Pricing and Availability

Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC and Phy chipset solution is available now a=
nd=20
is
priced at $59.
