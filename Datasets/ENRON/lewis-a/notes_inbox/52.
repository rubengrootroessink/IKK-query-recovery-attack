[IMAGE]Announcing a brand-new Special Report by America's #1 stock picker....


Dear Investor, 


Louis Navellier, the financial advisor who has helped his subscribers beat 
the market more than 3-to-1 over the past three years, has just completed a 
Special Report I thought you'd want to know about. 

Called Wall Street's Next Big Blue Chip Winners, this report reveals Louis' 
market-beating strategy for choosing the right stocks and explains how you 
can position your portfolio for tremendous profits -- even in today's tough 
market conditions. Plus, it details 8 powerful stocks that are set to reap 
you fast profits:

The top software blue-chip of the Internet age. This company has quickly 
become the global leader in "firewall protection." Simply put, firewalls keep 
hackers and viruses out... keeping corporate networks secure. And that is a 
huge growth business. This company's sales should reach $425 million this 
years, a 93% increase over last. And there's no slowdown in sight. The time 
is right for you to get in for great gains in the upcoming months!
The "most surprising" company on Wall Street. Analysts keep getting the 
profit forecasts wrong, wrong, wrong! But that's no surprise to anyone inside 
the technology  industry. While chipmakers like Intel and AMD battle over 
shrinking markets, this dynamic innovator carved out the leadership position 
in high-tech's "next big thing." As demand shifts from deskbound PCs to  new 
Internet technologies, this company owns the most lucrative high-bandwidth 
markets... positioning itself (and you if you invest right away) in the sweet 
spot of the technology boom. 
Money-doubler in 4 to 6 months? The potential is certainly there -- and that 
may prove to be a very conservative target. This company has developed one of 
the most important medical devices of the last 20 years. And the lucrative 
markets for its products grow wider every day. Don't miss out!
Plus 5 more rock-solid companies with great profit-making potential!

Each one of these companies is on a record-setting roll -- stealing market 
share like mad... recording staggering sales and profit gains... and setting 
new productivity standards in its industry. And each company's stock is 
likely to soar 25%, 50% or more over the next 2 to 4 months alone. 

There's no time to waste. Click on the link below to request your copy of
