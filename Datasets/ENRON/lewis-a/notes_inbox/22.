Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Tuesday's Short Trader Alert Ariba, Inc. (ARBA) lost 7 1/16=20
points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?

Beyond The Numbers

When will the Election madness come to an end?

The U.S. presidential election was held 6-weeks ago. Since then=20
there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president=20
of United States. Each passing day this matter has gotten more=20
complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with=20
the entire situation. Traders convey the message that the financial =20
markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election, in =20
either direction, will have very little effect on the markets. As one=20
frustrated trader said =01&Mostly markets are looking for an end to this=20
matter, not many care at this point who the next president will be=018.=20
We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed. However,=20
as the cloud clears, markets should be able to find a clear direction=20
from there. As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor=20
George Bush will most likely be the next president.=20

Even negative news is boosting stock prices

Just a few weeks ago, no news was good news for US financial=20
markets. Readers may recall even when there was positive news=20
announcements made by companies, stocks continued to trade=20
lower. However, in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted=20
many better-known names warnings about the upcoming quarterly=20
earnings and about their entire year=01,s outlook. Interestingly enough,=20
following the =01&bad =01&news most of these stocks have rallied to recover=
=20
some of the recent losses. We are still confused about this reaction=20
and trying to make sense of it all. This interesting development brings=20
back some important memories. Some time ago (12-15 months ago)=20
we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left=20
the business or were forced out because they too could not make=20
sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then.=20
Of course, the entire street is aware of what has happened to the=20
Nasdaq in last 8-months.?=20

Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced=20
similar opinions. Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like=20
Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Hedge fund manager Julian=20
H. Robertson, and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult=20
to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news. What's=20
puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher=20
despite the companies loosing money. We believe it is worth pointing=20
out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd.



Sector Analysis

Another big name warns

Tuesday after the close one of the better-known names in the PC world,=20
Compaq Computer (CPQ) warned the company=01,s earnings would fall=20
short of analysts=01, expectations. Following this earnings warning, the=20
box maker's stock briefly dipped down to $19=20
 before bouncing back =20
to finish the session around $20. Given this is the third box maker to=20
pre-announce negative earnings, it may be worth watching the=20
component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the=20
computers. Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc=20
drive makers, memory producers, modem, network card/network=20
suppliers, audio/video and other component makers.=20

Dow Transports may stall around 3000

In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting=20
from lower crude oil prices. Some of the best performers within the =20
sector were airlines and railroads. As we are approaching the critical=20
resistance level of 3000, we like to alert readers to watch for possible=20
profit taking. Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as 2,970 =20
before settling at 2,905. Tuesday=01,s move up put the index at a 7-month=
=20
high. If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move=20
lower, Transportation index may challenge the resistance level and=20
move higher if the markets as a whole moves higher.
