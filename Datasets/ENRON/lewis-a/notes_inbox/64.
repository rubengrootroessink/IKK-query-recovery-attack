THE JANUARY EFFECT DID IT START THIS SPRING? by  Kansas City Board of Trade,
Kansas City, Missouri

(December, 2000) When we embarked into the year 2000, industry analysts
questioned whether the phenomenon known as the January Effect would occur as
many changes were in store. There were many questions about Y2K and any
technical glitches that might appear. Thankfully, there were not any
problems, but a very different year was in store for the markets...

AND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:


WILL THE ELECTION EVER END?  by AIC Investment Advisors, Inc.

(December 4, 2000) For millions of Americans familiar with hotly contested

(December 1, 2000) Despite the fact a record amount of soybeans were
