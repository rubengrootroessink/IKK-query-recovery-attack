Are Your Suppliers Loyal?

As online customers discover their web services being
increasingly discontinued, their trust in any web company
or site is likely to decrease.

Ad Pricing: Did We Jump the Gun?

Solid content providers with a real audience are being
forced out of business because the integrity of their CPMs
cannot be preserved. Maybe we got it wrong in promoting the
web as such an accountable tool.

Neil experienced his first flak attack recently. But he's

choosing the right site name. And variations.

Is Flash Really 99% Bad?

Usability is a factor that designers must take into
account. They also have to create high-impact web
advertising. For now, Flash seems to be the most stable and
flexible tool for creating rich media from scratch on the
web.

When Being Ignored Is Bliss

You ever gawk at traffic running smoothly? Didn't think so
-- it's the accidents that grab our attention. So if your
press release is being ignored, think of this: At least the
journalists aren't writing about your demise.
