1.  Introduction

Earnings season will start to slow down next week, giving way
to economic data.  Most attention will be given to the third
quarter GDP number, as it will show whether or not the
economy has slipped into a recession.  Military strikes and
bioterrorism may also affect trading, particularly if events
become suddenly better or worse.

Hancock Financial Services {JHF} all reporting quarterly

Details on those companies' earnings reports are presented in
the table below.

Company                Ticker     EPS        Date
                                  Estimate

3.	Economic Releases

Economists will receive confirmation next week of whether the
economy slipped into a recession during the third quarter and
if a recovery will begin in the fourth quarter.  Q3 U.S. GDP
will be released on Wednesday and is expected to show a 0.7
percent drop - an indication that the economy has entered
into a recession.  On Thursday, the National Association of
Purchasing Manager's Index for October is expected to show
that the economy is continuing to retract.  Ironically, the
markets could trade upwards following the release of both
reports since negative economic numbers would all but assure
that the FOMC cuts rates for a 10th time this year when it
meets on November 6.

Economic releases scheduled for next week are listed in the
table below.
