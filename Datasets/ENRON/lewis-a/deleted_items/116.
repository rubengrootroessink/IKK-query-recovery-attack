_Brek Energy Corporation To Be New Name of Company As Stockholders Agree That The Energy Sector Offers Route to Success 
Hong Kong, Jan 30, 2002 -- First Ecom.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: FECC, 
BSX: FECC, FECC BH), a company with interests in gas and oil exploitation and electronic payment solutions held its 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, January 29, 2002 at the Pacific Place Conference Centre, Annapurna Room, 88 Queensway, Hong Kong, SAR.
   Stockholders were asked to vote on six items: 
1) To elect seven directors to serve until the next annual meeting 
   of stockholders and until their successors have been elected 
   and qualify; 
2) To ratify the appointment of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to serve 
   as independent public accountants for the 2001 fiscal year; 
3) To approve the amendment of First Ecom.com's Articles of 
   Incorporation to change the name of First Ecom.com to "Brek 
   Energy Corporation"; 
4) To approve the amendment of First Ecom.com's Articles of 
   Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of 
   First Ecom.com common stock; 
5) To approve the amendment of First Ecom.com's Articles of 
   Incorporation to authorize the issuance of preferred stock; 
6) To approve the adoption of First Ecom.com's 2001 Stock 
   Option/Warrant Plan; and: 
7) To approve such other matters as may properly come before the 
   annual meeting or any adjournment of the annual meeting. 
Stockholders approved all items except the creation of a new class of preferred stock and no other matters were brought before the meeting. While the proposal to create a new class of preferred stock received more affirmative than negative votes, it did not receive affirmative votes equal to a majority of the total outstanding shares as is required by law to amend the Company's articles.
The seven directors elected by First Ecom stockholders were Gregory Pek, Ravi Daswani, Douglas Moore, Ian Robinson, James Pratt, Marc Bruner, and Mart Bakal. They will serve as directors until the next annual meeting or until their respective successors are elected and qualified.
Mr. Ian Robinson, Chairman of the Board, began the meeting with an overview of the Company's operations during the past year and its plans for the future. He first stated the promises that the board had made during the previous Annual Meeting had been kept.
Mr. Robinson went on to emphasize that the Company was now primarily in the energy business as the board believed that this was the fastest route to creating shareholder value. He stressed that the Company's acquisition of a large shareholding in Gasco Energy Inc., was the first move in its strategy of becoming a major participant in the energy sector by positioning the Company between the junior and senior players in the industry. He indicated that the coming year was going to be a very active year for the Company, which was now wholly focused on creating shareholder value.
Mr. Robinson said, "The year 2001 was a year of rebirth for the Company. (After) sifting through numerous proposals in search of opportunities that would benefit both the Company and its shareholders in the near and long term... we announced our shift in business focus from Internet payment processing to energy." 
He stressed that the Company would play to its strengths including the financial expertise of the board and management, "(which) will, in our judgment, be of enormous value to small energy companies, which are often very practiced in finding the right holdings but less so when it comes to dealing with the financial aspects of being a publicly listed vehicle or dealing with large listed companies," said Mr. Robinson.
He continued by saying, "Operating under the name of Brek Energy Corporation, the Company will continue to acquire projects in the energy sector during 2002 in addition to those we have acquired via our holding in Gasco Energy. Gasco is a good example of the type of projects we will be considering."
He went on to say that the Company had not abandoned the payment processing industry and that the Company's wholly owned subsidiary First Ecom Systems Limited would continue to build that side of the business by focusing on the Asian region.
The Chairman's Statement is available for download on the Company's Web site (www.firstecom.com) under the Investor Relations section.
