THE WEEK/ A Corporate Crime Wave?
By George Gilder
The Wall Street Journal
January 11, 2002

Crime may have declined in the streets but, by the recent inflammation of
the pundits, you would think there has been an outbreak of corporate
criminality. The Internet, communications, and stock-market booms of the
1990s, it seems, were based on a pervasive series of felonious acts. A
wide array of businesses, from Global Crossing to Loral, from General
Electric to Enron, artfully inflated the worth of their shares through the
creation of Potemkin businesses. If you believe the news coverage,
corporate leaders are racing to despoil, mulct, defraud, poison, pillage,
and ruin their own businesses, their nation's soils and waters, their
retirement funds, and the world economy.

This flood of factitious crimes, this parade of snaffled fat cats and
scapegoats, happens every recession. Rather than ruing economic reverses
as effects of public policy errors and miscalculations, public officials
turn the tables and treat bankruptcy and crash as culpable schemes of
particular white-collar criminals.

Some of these alleged crime lords are familiar. Gary Winnick was party to
a previous potlatch at Drexel Burnham, where he played a key role in
financing the communications infrastructure through MCI,
Telecommunications Inc., Turner broadcasting, and McCaw Cellular. Then he
and his associates were alleged to have ravaged savings and loans by
inducing some of them to buy those companies' high-yield securities before
a government ban briefly destroyed their value. Finally Mr. Winnick boldly
launched the world-wide fiber-optic networks of Global Crossing, with, it
is implied, the intention of bilking investors and crashing bandwidth
prices in what Fortune calls "perhaps the greatest executive ripoff in the
history of enterprise" but what is better described as the most efficient
global buildout in telecom history.

FRIDAY FEATURE/ Wesbury Tops List of Forecasters
From The Wall Street Journal, January 7, 2002:

"Bearish Wesbury Tops List of Forecasters
In a Rough Year for Economic Divination"

"It was a rough year to be an economic forecaster. Few economists
anticipated a full-fledged recession. Fewer still expected the aggressive
response of the Federal Reserve that sent short-term interest rates to
their lowest level in 40 years. Then the Sept. 11 terror attacks occurred,
forcing everyone to revise their forecasts all over again.

"But for a small group of bearish economists, everything seems to have
gone as expected, leading them to the top spots in The Wall Street
Journal's economic-forecasting survey for 2001.

"Atop the pack was Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik,
Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment bank that specializes in
fixed-income securities. Long before the National Bureau of Economic
Research finally declared last month that the U.S. had fallen into
recession in March, Mr. Wesbury had factored recession into his forecasts.
He called for meager economic growth in the first half of 2001 and then a
contraction by the third quarter. As it turns out, he was right on."

What the Journal forgot to mention, of course, is Brian's other perch --
chief economist of The American Spectator. Brian's columns are everything
we want from the otherwise dismal science: sharp, solidly backed and
infused with the deeper wisdom of the supply side. Brian brings political
wits as well -- he was chief economist for the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress during the epic budget battles with the Clinton White House. And
now he's got a year's worth of bragging rights.

By the way, last year's rampage notwithstanding, Brian for the long-term
is among the biggest bulls around (which is another reason we like him).
In the Journal's 2002 survey, he's one of only five economists -- out of
fifty polled -- to peg the potential long-term U.S. productivity growth at
greater than three percent.

P.S. The Spectator economics crew is having a great season all around. Our
great friend Larry Kudlow of New York's Kudlow & Co. (and now of CNBC's
excellent "America Now," with Wall Street provocateur James J. Cramer)
came in right behind Brian at number five in the Journal's 2001
forecasting derby. See the Spectator Interview with Larry in our April
2001 issue, accessible online at http://www.gilder.com/amspec/

FRIDAY BONUS/ Homeland Security
The Heritage Foundation Homeland Security Task Force was formed days after
the September 11. Comprised of some of the best homeland security experts
in the world, the Task Force was asked to make specific proposals on how
best to eliminate the vulnerabilities exposed on September 11. The Task
Force was co-chaired by two veteran policymakers regarding terrorism and
homeland security: former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and L. Paul
Bremer, Chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism and
Ambassador-at-Large for Counter-Terrorism under President Ronald Reagan.

The Task Force this week released a comprehensive study entitled
"Defending the American Homeland" that "calls for significant changes in
the way government at all levels -- local, state and national -- works to
counter terrorism." The report also focuses on: Infrastructure Protection
and Internal Security; Civil Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction;
Intelligence and Law Enforcement; and, Military Operations to Counter
Terrorism.
