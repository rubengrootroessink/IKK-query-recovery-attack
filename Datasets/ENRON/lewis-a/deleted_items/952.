quityAlert.com.     QUALCOMM Announces New Wireless Solution for the Transp=
ortation Industry=1DNew BREW Application Offers Low-Cost, High-Value Soluti=
on to Small Affiliate Fleets and Owner Operators for Improved Communication=
s and Productivity   SAN DIEGO, Oct 29, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM In=
corporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), the leader in mobile communications for the tran=
sportation industry, today announced OmniOne(TM), a low-cost transportation=
 application for digital mobile phones that will provide trucking companies=
, affiliate fleets and subcontractors a powerful, portable communications t=
ool that enables drivers and dispatchers to receive and send load assignmen=
ts, status updates and other information. The OmniOne application is design=
ed to run on QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless(TM) (BREW(T=
M)) platform, a standardized applications execution environment for wireles=
s devices.   "OmniOne is a high-value tool that empowers owner-operators an=
d affiliate fleets to work more productively while on the road," said Chris=
 Wolfe, president of QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions. "Currently, more=
 than 80 percent of owner-operators rely primarily on public pay telephones=
 and personal mobile phones to receive their work assignments and to report=
 status to their customers. OmniOne eliminates this inconvenient process, a=
llowing drivers and logistics companies to communicate information with gre=
ater efficiency, saving time and money while improving customer service."  =
 OmniOne seamlessly integrates with current QUALCOMM OmniTRACS(R) and OmniE=
xpress(R) systems, features two-way data and voice communication, data inte=
gration, store-and-forward guaranteed messaging, and other services such as=
 mapping and directions.   QUALCOMM's BREW platform is a thin, standardized=
 execution environment that resides in handsets. Native BREW applications a=
re written in C/C++. While BREW supports programming in other languages, su=
ch as Java, C/C++ is used as a primary language by significantly more devel=
opers worldwide than any other language, according to International Data Co=
rp. QUALCOMM's BREW initiative is the only approach that offers developers,=
 OEMs and carriers a complete, end-to-end solution for wireless application=
s development, device configuration, application distribution, and billing =
and payment. The complete BREW solution includes the BREW Software Developm=
ent Kit(TM) (SDK) for developers, the BREW application platform and porting=
 tools for device manufacturers, and the BREW Distribution System (BDS) tha=
t enables developers and their carrier customers to get applications to mar=
ket and coordinates the billing and payment processes for them. Carriers' B=
REW-based services will enable consumers to customize their handsets by dow=
nloading applications over the air from a carrier's application download se=
rver.   QUALCOMM has helped the transportation industry become more efficie=
nt since 1988 when the introduction of the OmniTRACS mobile communications =
system provided transportation companies with an innovative and effective w=
ay of managing logistics. Its fleet management solutions continue to set th=
e standard by offering products and services that meet the demands of a con=
stantly changing marketplace. With the introduction of OmniExpress, a Code =
Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based digital wireless communications and t=
racking system, along with asset tracking and other industry-leading techno=
logies, QUALCOMM continues to expand into new mobile markets. With a Networ=
k Management Center that processes more than seven million transactions eac=
h day and over 400,000 QUALCOMM mobile systems shipped to businesses in mor=
e than 32 countries on four continents, QUALCOMM continues to lead the indu=
stry in providing wireless data solutions.   QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qua=
lcomm.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wire=
less communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digit=
al technology. The Company's business areas include CDMA chipsets and syste=
m software; technology licensing; the BREW applications platform; Eudora(R)=
 e-mail software; digital cinema systems; and satellite-based systems inclu=
