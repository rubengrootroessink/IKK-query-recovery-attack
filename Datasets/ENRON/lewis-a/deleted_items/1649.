1. Overall Sentiment

The first official day of what is known among retailers as
the "Christmas Sell-Through Season" began early Friday
morning, Nov. 23.

In the market research I currently do for Ticker Magazine,
a 123Jump.com property, I phoned into S.G. Cowen in
Manhattan that day, and the receptionist told me the
financial district was a "ghost town."

One of the few days, she said, when the subway ride from
Brooklyn into the financial district was "heavenly." There
wasn't even a crowd outside the local Macy's department
store.

We should all hope that a crowd did gather outside Macy's,
as well as the rest of the retail outlets, not only in
Manhattan, but also across the U.S., that opened at 6:00
a.m. Eastern time that day to receive the throngs of
shoppers wanting to get a head start.

The drive to those retail outlets should be much cheaper
compared to how it was just two months ago.

On my weekly Saturday taxi ride to the supermarket, the
local convenience store posted its price for a gallon of
regular - $0.99.99 - down from $1.02.99 from the previous
Saturday.

My driver had predicted a drop to under $1.00 by Christmas.
On the drive last Saturday, he also mentioned that the
traffic was unusually heavy.

Based on this rudimentary observation of the onset of the
Christmas Sell-Through Season, we're off to a good start.

Still, it is too soon to tell.

For folks curious about how retailers are doing during this
period, a good source is www.telecheck.com, a division of
Equifax (EFX) that monitors check processing.

Meanwhile, it has been eight solid weeks of advances for
the popular indexes since the last 52-week bottom Sept. 21.

It should be pointed out that after the prior 52-week
bottom April 3-4, the marker rallied for about eight weeks
into early June, stalled, shuffled sideways for most of
that month and during July, and then began another slide
during August and early September.

All during that time, the TV stock market channels, dead-
tree media and online media continued to trot out the usual
gang of "chief market strategists" who talked about a "V-
shaped" recovery in 2002.

Put it into technology, they said. They said this in
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August,
September, October and, of course, the final week of
November.

Do you folks think this spiel will change next month, or
the month after that?

Sooner or later (hope it's not later), they will be right.

Overall, the charts of the world's stock exchanges mostly
reflect the charts for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes:
a 52-week bottom on or around Sept. 21, followed by an
advance to near the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).

There are a few exceptions, the most notable being the
Russian stock market. This market has been among the top
performers in 2001, as the following link to a one-year
chart, courtesy of Yahoo! Finance, will display:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3Dmtms&d=3Dc&k=3Dc2&p=3Dm50,m200???2. Observat=
ions??With the Russian stock market doing so well, it has definitely?been a=
 contrast when one compares the current situation to?this time three years =
ago.??Three years ago, Alan Greenspan was bailing out the Russian?currency =
by dropping interest rates and speeding up the?printing press that pumps U.=
S. currency into the world's?banking systems.??It worked. October 1998 was =
the bottom for the U.S. stock?market and most of the world's stock markets.=
 The rest is?history. The most amazing bull market in U.S. history.??Earlie=
r this month, Vladimir, the Russian Prime Minister,?Putin traveled to meet =
President George W. Bush. They got?along well. Arm-in-arm. Good Old Boy-to-=
Good Old Boychik.??During this diplomatic interlude, the Russian government=
?announced that it wasn't giving in to pressures from the?OPEC cartel to dr=
op its daily output of crude oil.??We seem to have come full circle. Instea=
d of Alan Greenspan?bailing out the Russian economy, it is the Russians who=
 appear?to be out bailing Alan Greenspan.??My take on the current situation=
 in Afghanistan: It's still?a sad place, and it will be this way for perhap=
s decades,?regardless of what kind of government is established that?loosel=
y resembles a "democracy." Were I the CEO of an?automobile/truck company, o=
r an electronics component contract?manufacturer, I wouldn't consider locat=
ing a plant there in the?near-term.??The more I study the writings of Herna=
ndo de Soto and his?understanding of why some nations have succeeded in the=
?past 400 years, while others continue to be mired in social?strife and pov=
erty, the more it makes sense to me.??Since Sept. 21, when more than 1600 s=
tocks reached 52-week?lows on the NYSE and the Nasdaq, the number of stocks=
?making new highs has averaged around 100 for both major?U.S. stock markets=
.??However, the number of the stocks making new lows has?averaged less than=
 50 since that date.??Clearly, the market is sending a message that it want=
s to take?a chance on hundreds, if not thousands, of beaten up stocks on?th=
e hope that a turnaround in the U.S. economy in 2002, whenever?it occurs, w=
ill result in accelerating revenues and profits.??When the U.S. economy was=
 roaring along at a 6% annual rate,?and Optical Networking, Internet, and e=
merging Telecom stocks?were reporting year-over-year revenue growth rates o=
f 500%,?investors were more than willing to buy stocks priced 10 years?into=
 the future on the assumption that the next 10 years of 500%?annual revenue=
 and earnings gains were a done deal.??Nothing ever changes on Wall Street.=
 The name of the game is to?anticipate future revenues and earnings. Someti=
mes, though, this?anticipation goes to an excess.??No, I don't think some F=
allen Angel stock that went public during?1998-1999 that bottomed out at 2 =
a share Sept. 21, and then?rallied to 5 a share by Nov. 23, is headed for 5=
0 a share by?Dec. 31, 2001.??Moreover, I don't think these stocks will be p=
riced at 50 a share?on Nov. 23, 2002, purely on "anticipation of rising rev=
enues and?earnings."??But, I've been wrong before.??Certainly oil and its d=
erivative fuels, natural gas, propane,?heating oil, gasoline and diesel are=
 sexy right now. So is gold,?since we're all worried about hard economic ti=
mes.??In terms of raw materials, or commodities, to use the?general term, I=
 would advise readers to watch the copper?futures prices.??When George and =
Vlad met last week, George did say in a?press conference that he and Vlad d=
id agree about reducing?the production of nuclear, but they failed to agree=
 about?curtailing the production of nuclear missiles.??To make it simple, R=
ussia and the United States, much less?any other country in this world, can=
 make nuclear bombs.?Terrorist organizations know how to make nuclear bombs=
. The?information is available on the Internet.??It's the delivery system t=
hat makes the difference.??The preferred method of delivery of a nuclear bo=
mb is via?an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile, or ICBM.??In other words,=
 it's not about the bombs, it's about the?missiles. Russia and the United S=
tates have already made?enough nuclear bombs to destroy all the planets in =
the?solar system from Mercury to Pluto.??This missile disarmament argument =
has been going for four?decades, going back to the Kennedy Administration s=
ince 1960.??The more things change, the more they stay the same.???3. Weekl=
y Portfolio Results??The stocks in my Sharebuilder.com investment plan adva=
nced?0.6%. This surprised me, for I thought this portfolio of 31?stocks wou=
ld lose money for the week of Nov. 19-23.??The S&P 500 gained 1.03% for the=
 week, while the Dow 30?advanced 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.=
24%.??Among the sectors I follow, the biotechs did the best. The?Merrill Ly=
nch Biotech HOLDRs Trust (BBH) gained 4%.?Semiconductor stocks as represent=
ed by the Philadelphia?Semiconductor Index (SOX) pulled back 3.5%.??Conclus=
ion: The Overall Tech Market is still searching for?a leader as it pertains=
 to a specific industry group.??As for the Ones to Watch Portfolio, which, =
at this point,?is a leftover from February 2001 when I "inherited" this?new=
sletter, the only remaining stocks from February are two?semiconductor stoc=
ks: Xilinx (XLNX) and Broadcom (XLNX).??Xilinx is the premier programmable =
logic device company. Of?course, the folks at Altera Corp. (ALTR) would dis=
agree.??Still, from a low of 19.52 on Sept. 21, Xilinx has managed to?advan=
ce back to 34.73, but still under its 200-day simple?moving average (SMA). =
That chart pattern since Sept. 21 is?also true for the popular averages.??C=
onclusion: Xilinx hasn't broken its long-term trend. The same?could be said=
 for dozens of leading semiconductor stocks.??Broadcom, though, has managed=
 to rally from a Sept. 21 low of?18.40 to 46.45 and also above it s 200-day=
 average, the?first time in nearly a year.??However, the 50-level is a majo=
r source of price resistance.?This is Broadcom's third try at the 50 resist=
ance since?early May 2001.??The water-related stocks from the Ones to Watch=
 Portfolio I?"purchased" Aug. 1 are in the black. I personally own all?thre=
e of them: American Water Works (AWK), Tetra Tech?(TTEK), which splits 5-fo=
r-4 next month, and SCP Pool?(POOL). The latter two stocks are components o=
f the?Standard & Poor's 600 SmallCap Index. American Water Works?is a compo=
nent of the S&P 500 Index that a German company,?RWK, wants to purchase for=
 $46 a share in cash.??Among the other 14 remaining stocks in the Ones to W=
atch?Portfolio, EarthLink (ELNK), 1-800Flowers.com (FLWS),?Jack Henry & Ass=
ociates (JKHY), Intercept Group (ICPT),?Alloy Inc. (ALOY), Catapult Communi=
cations (CATT),?Register.com (RCOM) and Copart Inc. (CPRT) have rebounded?a=
bove the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since the?dramatic sell-off du=
ring Sept. 17-21.??The others - Efunds (EFDS), SEI Investments (SEIC),?Phar=
maceutical Product Development (PPDI), Daktronics?(DAKT) and SonicWALL (SNW=
L) - are stragglers. Still trading?below the 200-day line.??SonicWALL, whic=
h competes in the firewall space, has been a?disappointment compared with o=
thers in the sector:?McAfee.com (MCAF), Internet Security (ISSX), Network?A=
ssociates (NETA) and Symantec (SYMC).??Of the Sweet 16? Tech stocks I've be=
en tracking since late?July, four have advanced above the 200-day line: Bus=
iness?Objects (BOBJ), Nokia Corp. (NOK), Vodaphone Group (VOD)?and Genentec=
h (DNA). The former three are foreign firms,?while the latter has participa=
ted, perhaps even initiated,?a gradual rise in biotech and genomics stocks =
since late?July.??In the aftermath of the dramatic one-week panic sell-off?=
Sept. 17-21, the remaining 12 have rebounded above the 50-?day line: Verita=
s Software (VRTS), I2 Tech (ITWO),?Micromuse (MUSE), Alcatel (ALA), Comvers=
e Tech (CMVT),?Network Appliance (NTAP), EMC Corp. (EMC), Juniper Networks?=
(JNPR), CIENA Corp. (CIEN), BEA Systems (BEAS) and Corning?Corp. (BEAS).??T=
he 50-day day line has also begun to slope upward for most?of them. From a =
chartist's perspective, this is an?encouraging sign.??However, that 200-day=
 line looms as a major area of?resistance for these Fallen Angels from the =
technology?arena. Technical indicators are one thing, but fundamentals,?nam=
ely, earnings, earnings, earnings, will determine how?far these stocks adva=
nce in 2002.??A major factor in long-term investment success entails two?in=
gredients: first, developing a plan based on investing?fixed amounts on a r=
egular basis, and second, resolving to?stick with it through good and bad m=
arkets.??I currently have 31 positions in my Sharebuilder Plan. That?practi=
cally qualifies it as a mini-mutual fund. I make?regular monthly purchases =
on the fourth Thursday of each?month.??This morning, the plan purchased who=
le or fractional shares?in the following stocks: American Water Works (AWK)=
, Biomet?(BMET), Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), Daktronics (DAKT), Jack?Henry &=
 Associates (JKHY), Micro General (MGEN), Sigma?Aldrich (SIAL), SurModics (=
SRDX) and Tetra Tech (TTEK).???4. Sector Watch: The Brokers??Investor's Bus=
iness Daily is a good source for beginning?investors and traders to learn h=
ow stocks in the same?business or industry are divided into groups, their o=
verall?fundamentals, and how they are performing in comparison?with other s=

sier for individuals?to track stock groups.??By using a charting feature co=
urtesy of Yahoo! Finance, I?pulled up the chart, including the 50-day and 2=
00-day?simple moving average (SMA) for Merrill Lynch (MER):??SEE: http://fi=

 Broker/Investment Banking group. Its?one-year chart has closely tracked th=
e S&P 500 (which I?also pulled up). The charts are similar: a rebound from =
the?lows in September, followed by an eight-week rebound above?the 50-day l=
ine but below the 200-day line.??More important is the long-term trend from=
 the high of 80?in February. For Merrill stock to inspire confidence, it?ha=
s to break this trend by advancing to at least above 70.??Other stocks from=
 the group, though, have outperformed?Merrill's 57% advance since putting i=
