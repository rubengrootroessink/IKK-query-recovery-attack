On Oct. 1 we recommended 13 Telecosm stocks that were being given away at "firesale"
prices. As of this writing, most of these stocks are up between 30% and 50% in
10 days.

We recommended the liquidation of these stocks as the $NDX pushed into Fibonacci
Cluster resistance this week.

Another buying opportunity may present itself in mid November. Anyone wishing
a list of these stocks, please reply to this email subject:  "Firesale". Include
your name and phone contact.
