    Globalstar USA and Calence Announce Satellite Access to VPN Networks   =
SAN FRANCISCO, Jun 6, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Globalstar USA/Caribb=
ean, a leading provider of satellite-based mobile services, and Calence, In=
c., a full service network integrator based in Tempe, Arizona, today announ=
ced a new technology solution that allows Globalstar customers to establish=
 a Virtual Private Networks (VPN) via satellite. The Calence integrated tec=
hnology solution allows customers to use industry leading VPN products from=
 companies such as Cisco and Microsoft on the Globalstar satellite system. =
  Globalstar USA launched Globalstar Data Services in December 2000. The Gl=
obalstar GSP-1600 phone by Qualcomm acts as a wireless modem and attaches v=
ia data cable to a laptop computer or a personal digital assistant (PDA). P=
reviously, Globalstar data customers could remotely access Internet sites, =
search engines, most consumer email and instant messaging. The next challen=
ge was to develop a solution that would enable satellite phone customer to =
access a VPN on a narrowband channel. By integrating the critical technolog=
ies required to deliver this secure solution, Calence gives Globalstar Data=
 Services a much broader commercial appeal by addressing concerns about net=
work protection.   "This technology solution by Calence expands our family =
of business applications by giving Globalstar customers secure access to th=
eir office network from the field," said Dennis McSweeney, vice president a=
nd general manager for Globalstar USA. "By providing satellite connectivity=
 and by working with leading companies like Calence, we continue to lead th=
e satellite services industry."   After installing the selected network ser=
ver hardware and the VPN software, a customer connects the computer to the =
Globalstar phone, logs into the data system and launches the VPN applicatio=
n. The VPN software provides 56 bit encryption and is compatible with vario=
us corporate network systems including Cisco's VPN (using IPSec) and Micros=
oft's VPN (using PPTP).   "Many of us take remote access for granted in met=
ropolitan areas. The Globalstar and Calence VPN solution truly fills a busi=
ness need for secure access to data in remote parts of the U.S. or the worl=
d," said Joel Pogar, director of information security for Calence. "Calence=
 is committed to being the best network integrator on the planet. Our succe=
ss with Globalstar reflects that commitment."   Availability   Individuals =
and businesses can purchase Globalstar phones and service, including data, =
through Globalstar USA and Globalstar Caribbean distributors. A list of mor=
e than 700 dealer locations throughout the U.S. and Caribbean can be found =
