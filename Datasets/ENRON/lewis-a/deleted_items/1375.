<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Greater hopes for a speedy turnaround in the U.S. economy
helped Equities and the U.S. Dollar advance during a week
cut short by America's Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed at 9,959.71, up 125.03, on Friday
and traders will be watching to see if it can climb above
the psychologically-important 10,000 mark. In a quiet
commodities sector, short-covering and firm cash markets
propelled Cattle and Hog futures higher, while tight
supplies and supportive technicals boosted Sugar to a nine-
week peak. Grains and Soy products were generally quiet and
little changed, although Soyoil enjoyed a sharp gain. Crude
Oil sagged amid a standoff on production cuts, while Silver
continued to lose its shine and dipped to an eight-year low.

- Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator
