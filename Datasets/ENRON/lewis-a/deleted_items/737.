To OTC Dispatch Subscribers:

Congratulations to our subscribers who timed our last pick
just right. On Wednesday May 30th we came out with a Trading
Alert on PETP. We warned our subscribers (heavily) that it
was NOT a long-term investment, but rather a short-term
potential flip. Those of you who are of a trader-disposition
decided to give it a whirl, and had a good trading
opportunity.

When we told you about PETP, it had just closed at $1.15. We
made it clear that we felt the trading range would be tight.
Here is what we said:

> If the stock trades up to $1.43 our technical indicators
> consider it a sell. Stop loss indicators have been issued
> for $1.08. The expected trading range is tight, so be
> cautious!

The next day, June 1st, the stock opened at $1.34! Those of
you who read our Trading Alert would NOT have bought at that

price, since you knew the OTC Dispatch Technical Indicators
considered it a sell at $1.43.

For those of you who were patient, the stock traded between
$1.23 and $1.39 that day, giving you a tight range in which
to execute your trades. Judging by the response we got in
your emails to us, many of you picked up a 5-10% gain. Nice
work!

To those of you who tried to trade the stock but got beat
on poor execution, remember that the OTC Dispatch Trading
Alerts are ONLY meant for short-term speculative trading
purposes.

Generally however, the OTC Dispatch covers companies that
we think represent a 6-18 month hold period. In other
words, most of our picks are micro-cap stocks that
deserve to be held for a considerable period of time
before selling.

For our new subscribers, please remember therefore that
there is a DIFFERENCE between our Trading Alerts and our
regular stock picks. Trading Alerts are short-term
high-risk swings, and our regular picks are meant to be
held for the longer term.

Many of our subscribers often email us their own picks,
and ask us to write them up. We appreciate that feedback -
always! - and we may write up your stock pick if we think
it is a good one. But remember! - we do an enormous amount
of due diligence and most stocks do not make it through
our criteria.

And now for an OTCBB Highlight or two!

Oh for the wonderful days of only a a bit more than a
year ago, when the OTCBB was rocking! Do not fear, it
is coming back. But we could not help but be impressed
by some interesting stats.

Total dollar volume on the OTCBB last year around this
time was about $7 billion per month (this does not
account for double-counting). Right now it is at around
$1 billion per month.

Average daily dollar volume right now therefore is
around $50 million. Last year it was $350 million.

Average daily volume right now is about 270,000,000
shares. A year ago it was about 450,000,000.

What we find interesting is that, while daily trading
volume is more than 50% of what it was a year ago, daily
dollar volume is around 15% of what it was. This is
important because dollar volume has not been this low
since 1993. Yet share volume is still around early 1999
levels!

The total number of OTCBB-quoted issuers has been
relatively static for the last few years (except for
the 1997-99 spike, but mandatory reporting took the
number back down to historic levels by 2000).

What does all this tell us? What we are all-too-well
familiar with - average share prices of OTCBB-quoted
companies are at HISTORIC lows. We believe many OTCBB
stocks will provide 5 to 10 times ROI over the next 18
months, but the trick is determining which ones. Most
of them are volatile, and many won't make it. Our
mission is to tell you about the ones that have the
best chance of doing extremely well.

Until next time, good speculating!
