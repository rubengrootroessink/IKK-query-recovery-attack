Dear Daily Reckoning Reader,

Bad news dominates the financial headlines lately: The economy
is slowing. Mutual fund inflows have fallen by half. Consumer
confidence is at a 7-year low. Earnings warnings are up 96% from
a year ago. The Nasdaq is down almost 60% and refuses to revive
despite rate cuts...

But that's exactly why Bill asked me to write to you today. You
see,  I'd like to show you a few companies that go against the
grain...and are poised to give great returns...

What's more, I'd like to introduce you to an extraordinary new
way to make money off the success these companies are going to
enjoy.

Earlier this month when Bill was in Baltimore, I mentioned a few
temporarily market-forgotten old economy companies that are so
cheap now, they're going to explode even if Wall Street never
gives them the red-carpet push it gave the dot-coms. It's all
there in the bottom line... And he said: "Lynn, I think you're
on to something... You have to write it up for the Daily
Reckoning readers." So... Here it is.

When you follow the link included below you'll find a unique way
to make money from the following companies:

-- A defense company ready to cash in on the Bush-Cheney
administration. Even if this company maintains its growth rate
of the previous three years, it's poised to be a knockout
20-bagger in 10 years. In fact, by my calculations... its
"intrinsic" value discounted for the risk-free rate of the
3-year Treasury bond is a whopping $2,032. That makes the $90
price tag today a mere pittance... and a "sure thing" for our
10-year plan.

-- Give it any good news at all, and this second company will
likely double in a year. And right now... it's selling for only
half its annual sales. The company misstepped under a shiftless
CEO, and Wall Street drove the price down to bargain-basement
prices. But now the man who led the company to strength in the
past is back at the helm. It should grow 13% a year when it gets
back on track, but even if it only matches the S&P's lower 11.8%
average, it's still worth $114.26. And that makes today's price
of $32.85 a big, fat 70% off sign in our book.

-- Celebrate bad news by buying a winning retailer just when
everyone says it's the wrong thing to do. That's how buying low
and selling high is done. This company owns two off -- price
retail giants. Both have a track record of outperforming their
peers over the long run in any kind of environment. And now it's
going for $33 - about a third of what we estimate to be the true
value - $101.45. And that's conservative...

The Key to Long-term Investment Success: Big Profits, Small Risk
And Consistency, Consistency, Consistency...

But there's more. When you read the enclosed report, you'll
learn that whenever we make an investment recommendation in The
Fleet Street Letter, profit potential is important -- but it's
not enough. The Nasdaq is littered with stocks that are down 90%
that major Wall Street firms said had great "profit potential"
last year.

Instead, we look for a proven track record, a realistic
potential for above-average long-term gains, and a level of risk
that is far below our potential gains. That is key. That's the
way we've done it since we published our very first privately-
circulated investment advisory back in 1938.

For a select group of investors, the profits to be made over the
next 10 years will be greater than the last 10... In fact, I
believe you could increase the value of your portfolio ten-fold
or more over the next 10 years! To learn how you can come along
for the ride, simply follow this link:

But you must do this today. The offer included is open to you in
this e-mail only.

Thanks for reading,

Lynn Carpenter
