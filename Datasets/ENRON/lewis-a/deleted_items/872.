   Broadcom Updates Second Quarter 2001 Financial Outlook; Conference Call =
Scheduled Thursday, June 7, 8:45 a.m. Eastern Time   IRVINE, Calif., Jun 6,=
 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq:BRCM) today updated t=
he outlook for its financial performance for the second quarter ending June=
 30, 2001.   "The continued weakness in the technology sector requires that=
 we lower expectations for second quarter revenue to a decrease of between =
32% and 35% from the first quarter," said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadc=
om's President and CEO. "Although current demand conditions continue to be =
soft, we are starting to see some signs of stabilization in the business fo=
r the second half of the year. We also continue to introduce new market-lea=
ding products and to gain important design wins with customers that positio=
n us well to compete effectively in our markets as the economy recovers."  =
 "In response to the numerous acquisitions made in the last two years and t=
he current more challenging economic climate, we are taking steps to stream=
line our business," Nicholas continued. "Accordingly, in the first quarter =
earnings conference call on April 18, we indicated that we were conducting =
a thorough review of all of our business units with the intent of making re=
ductions in some areas and increasing the level of strategic investment in =
others. We are beginning to implement these plans during the current quarte=
r. This will result in business unit re-alignment, net staffing reductions,=
 facility consolidations, and other actions that will result in an associat=
ed charge to be taken during the second quarter."   Conference Call  Broadc=
