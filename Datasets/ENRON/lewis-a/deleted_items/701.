Interactive Tactical Group?s Virtual Floor Plans, firefighters and other em=
ergency personnel can consult a virtual representation of a building?s inte=
rior and figure out exactly how to handle a crisis situation.  This lifesav=
ing idea is the brainchild of ITG founder Michael Quan, who says: ?I think =
