Though there are a few acts currently under
development, the research clearly supports the Arabel
management's decision to focus a substantial amount of
its time, energy and development budget on a
Multi-Cultural Pop Act. The US success of the
Backstreet Boys is directly attributed to their initial
success in Asia and Europe. Given the multicultural
competitive edge, combined with critic's acclaim of the
music (lyrics, composition, arrangement), the Arabel
act could meet, if not exceed, Backstreet Boys success.

The idea is to bring together five of the best English as
a first language male performers in North America
between the ages of 17-22, regardless of their ethnic
heritage or belief system. The vision is to show that
through pop music, diverse cultures do get along and
can thrive as both a pop and business entity.

Economic, geographic, technological and social trend
research overwhelmingly supports the management's
decision to go in this direction. Developing countries
have been leading the globe in GDP for the past few
years, with China leading the way. It is estimated that
by 2010 China will have a middle class population of
500 million and India will have a middle class of 450
million. (For an enhanced demographic report:

ct.htm)

Foreign corporations, especially in economically
developing countries, will find the Multi-Cultural Act
concept very attractive for sponsorship and product
endorsement. Whether to increase their local visibility
through affiliation with a North American pop group or
to use this as a means to expand to other geographic
markets, Arabel will target both traditional and
non-traditional youth oriented sponsors.

For the last 10-15 years the youth culture in North
America has become increasingly more socially
conscious than ever before, but has also grown up with
an appreciation and acceptance of ethnic and cultural
diversity like no other previous generation. Especially
since 9-11 we believe an act that promotes pro-cultural
diversity by visual example will be readily accepted by
mainstream North American youth. Teens from other
regions around the world continue to be infatuated with
North American culture. Product and performance
sales for North American pop acts continue to break
records in these regions.

A Multi-Cultural Act will provide performers that
different ethnic groups around the globe can relate to
and identify with. This 'role model' appeal does not
only impact product sales (which can have certain hit
songs released with the chorus remixed in various
languages), but from a business perspective as well.
The focus on a Multi-Cultural Act is more than just a
short-term astute strategy. It not only allows Arabel to
remain true to its core value of business growth
through the strengths inherent with ethnic diversity, it
also positions the company on the ground floor of the
developing economies whose creative industries will
also be looking to develop through joint ventures with
North American companies.

The Company has retained 'The Investor Online' Group
for Investor Relations, to implement and maintain an
ongoing market awareness program for an initial
period of six months. See the complete Research
