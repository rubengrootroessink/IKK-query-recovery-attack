Markets pulls back on more negative news
Wednesday we talked about the possibility of market getting ahead of 
itself on too much optimism. Just one day after the triple digit gain, Dow 
gave back virtually all its gains thanks to Hewlett Packard and JP Morgan. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. warned trading revenues will probably decline 
in the quarters ahead and the company will have to realize some write 
downs relating to venture capital funds. Hewlett Packard warned the  
slowdown in IT spending has spread globally to other economies around 
the world, especially Asia and Europe. Wednesday RealTimeTraders 
speculated that Asia and Europe might be the next in line to feel the 
effects of the technology slowdown. If these two regions do indeed start 
to show signs of weakness, it may become a major problem to some of  
the US Corporations. 
We believe Thursday everyone will closely watch Intel Corp's comments 
to determine if a turn around is in sight. Given HP's comments, the analyst 
community will pay close attention to comments from Intel and other multi-
national corporations for any signs of a global slowdown. Hewlett Packard 
finished the session lower by $1.34 to close at $28.71 on 9.3 million shares. 
Dow finished the session lower by 105 points, Nasdaq finished the session 
lower by 17 points and the S&P finished the session lower by 13 1/2 points. 
Markets may continue to come under pressure on Thursday as a result of 
the slew of negative news that was announced after the close on Wednesday. 
As described below Wells Fargo announced a huge charge as a result of bad 
venture capital deals. Brocade Communications (BRCD) warned earnings 
would be below previously expected. American Eagle (AEOS) reported may 
same store sales that were significantly below street estimates. And a 
California court handed a verdict against Philip Morris (MO) worth more 
than $3 billion. 
Stocks to watch
INTC - Shares of Intel Corp. have been trading in a very narrow range over 
the past few weeks as investors await to see what the company will say in 
the mid quarter update on Thursday. It seems Advanced Micro Devices  
(AMD) has been winning the war on price, and this morning CS First Boston 
echoed the same concerns and said it expects Intel to lower EPS estimates 
tomorrow.
WFC - After the close Wells Fargo reported it will recognize an after tax non-
cash charge of approximately $1.13 billion in the second quarter related to 
impairment of some of its venture capital securities. The company said the 
bulk of the charge, which equates to $0.65 per share, comes from reductions 
of non-cash venture capital recognized in late 1999 and 2000. On this news 
the stocks traded lower by 3% in after hours.
Sector Analysis
Small Stocks continues to do well
In the past few weeks some of the small stocks have been powering higher in 
anticipation of improving economic conditions. Readers may want to take note 
the small stock index Russell has gained almost 20% in the last 2 months. 
However, note the index does have some resistance around the 517 level. 
Wednesday the Russell 2000 lost 3.90 points and closed at 512. If technology 
stocks pick up momentum, this index may see further upside. Those who like

Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Thursday weekly jobless claims will be released at 8:30 AM, current 
consensus estimate is 417K. Then wholesale Inventory data for the month 
of April is expected at 10 AM. Friday there are no economic reports to be 
released. Therefore, bond market activity will most likely depend on 
technical indicators. Wednesday the September contracts finished the 
session higher by 1 tick to close at 101.01.

Wednesday's NYSE advance/decline reading was 1215/1856 Vs.
