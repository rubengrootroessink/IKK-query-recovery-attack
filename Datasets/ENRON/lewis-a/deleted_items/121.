Natural Gas Futures Rally on Late Short-Covering=20

23% from when it began as the prompt month at $2.619 per MMBtu. The March c=

ental signals. Look for support at $1.76-$1.80. Mild weather across much of=
 the nation and the huge storage excess sent prices mainly downward all mon=

the close, started buying. The market still carries a huge $0.965 forward c=

Merrill Lynch Top Executives Involved in Enron Partnership=20

A report that Merrill Lynch executives invested in a limited partnership, L=
JM2, which was used by Enron to inflate earnings and hide debt from shareho=
lders, has sent the investment company scurrying to deny any wrongdoing. Me=
rrill Lynch invited managing directors and senior executives to invest in t=
he partnerships after it helped Enron raise $349 million for the partnershi=
p from pension funds and other institutional investors. Critics say that so=
me investment banks may have been less stringent in their scrutiny of Enron=
 because senior executives were doing business with it and had a vested int=
erest in its profits, raising questions about conflict of interest. The inv=
estments may be subject to congressional examination after the House Energy=
 and Commerce Committee subpoenaed Enron's partnership records, including t=
he identities of investors. Enron has revealed that its former CFO made $30=
 million from 2 partnerships, including LJM2. Merrill Lynch says tha! t the=
 investment partnership is in line with common industry practices. Merrill =
Lynch claims that it was offered to qualified external as well as internal =
investors, which would not be a conflict of interest.=20

 on-line energy transactions from CFTC control. Those exempted markets made=
 up the bulk of Enron's trading operations. The CFTC is working with the Wh=
ite House on auditing and accounting standards, and the combination of its =
market supervisory functions under one agency division. Although at least 8=
 other congressional probes are being conducted into the financial and acco=
unting facets of Enron's demise, the Senate Energy Committee's authority is=
 limited to the effects of Enrons meltdown on energy markets and consumers.=
 Legislators at the hearing saw little impact from Enron on US energy marke=
ts. Some on the panel referred to it as business failure, not an energy mar=
ket failure. Even though the chairman of the NYMEX has not call for any gre=
ater regu! lation of over-the-counter markets, he has called on regulators =
to treat on-line exchanges and traditional pit-based ones equally.=20

Derivatives at Root of Enron Collapse

Enrons extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting practices, lie=
 at the root of its fall into bankruptcy. Enron had used profits from its d=
erivatives trading operation, which was little understood by investors, to =
mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees ma=
y have been fraudulently manipulating those profits. Enron reaped huge prof=
its from derivatives.  But it lost billions on most everything else it did,=
 including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail natural gas and power,=
 water systems and technology stocks, but used its expertise in derivatives=
 to hide these losses. Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose va=
lues are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, =
stocks or bonds. They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. E=
nron's use of derivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be=
 directly linked to its collapse. On the outside, they were used to create =
the compan! y's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partn=
erships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went s=
our, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 =
billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bank=
ruptcy. But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside sp=
ecial purpose vehicles. It appears that some Enron employees used dummy acc=
ounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss en=
tries for the derivatives Enron traded.=20

Williams Shares Plunge 22% on Telecom Debt

Shares of Williams tumbled 22% yesterday after it reported it may have up t=
o $2.4 billion in costs from Williams Communications which was spun off las=
t April. Williams may have to pay $1.4 billion in Williams Communications d=
ebt if its credit rating falls below investment grade. It also may owe $750=
 million in Williams Communications fiber optic-network leases and $250 mil=
lion in other expenses. Shares of Williams Communications dropped 80% last =
year as growth evaporated with the dot.com collapse. In the past month, Wil=
liams sold securities and cut capital spending to strengthen its balance sh=
eet amid increased scrutiny by credit-rating agencies in the wake of Enrons=
 collapse. It also plans to sell assets to maintain the all-important inves=
tment-grade debt rating. Because of the debt review, Williams delayed repor=
ting 4th quarter results that had been scheduled for release yesterday. The=
 review will have no direct impact on Williams Communications business, the=
 company s! aid in a statement. However, the stock market is in the process=
 of evaluating the situation and is assuming the worst. Williams shares fel=
l $5.3, to $18.78 yesterday. Its 7.75% coupon maturing in 2031 fell about $=
42 to $921 per $1,000 face value from $963. That pushed the yield up to 8.4=
8% from 8.08%. Williams's convertible preferred stock, which was sold this =
month at $25, tumbled $3.93 to $21.65 per share. Enron had $724 million in =
losses from telecommunications in the 3rd quarter. Global Crossing filed fo=
r bankruptcy protection Monday after it accumulated $12 billion in debt it =
was unable to repay because of falling sales. Shares Williams Communication=
s fell $0.29 to $1.34 yesterday.=20
