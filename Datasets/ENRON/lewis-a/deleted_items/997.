Dear CultureFinders:

Thanksgiving is less than a month away and the long Thanksgiving weekend
marks the start of holiday celebrations in the arts, with productions of
perennial favorites A CHRISTMAS CAROL and THE NUTCRACKER opening all across
the country. And that's just the beginning.

We searched CultureFinder's calendar and found hundreds of Christmas
sing-alongs, Messiah sing-alongs, Holiday concerts, Yuletide celebrations,
Festivals of Carols, Gospel Holidays, Kwanza Festivals, Christmas pageants,
Winter Solstice concerts, An Appalachian Christmas, A Celtic Christmas, A
Scottish Christmas, A Caribbean Christmas, A Renaissance Christmas, A
Medieval Christmas, A Tuna Christmas, A French Baroque Noel,  A Cantorial
Chanukah, A Klezmer Chanukah -- just to name a few. And new events are
added daily.

So, before making your travel plans, check out your destination city at
www.culturefinder.com and why not put some culture into your holiday plans.

Eugene Carr
President
