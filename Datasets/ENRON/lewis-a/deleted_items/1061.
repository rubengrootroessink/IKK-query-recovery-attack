: TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC   (EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's=
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  =
 The Registrant (the "company" or "TI") announced third-quarter financial r=
esults that show the company's third-quarter revenue was $1849 million, dow=
n 9 percent from the second quarter and slightly better than the company's =
outlook issued in July for a decline of 10 to 15 percent. Orders, which had=
 fallen 10 percent sequentially in the second quarter, declined 4 percent s=
equentially in the third quarter to $1638 million. Semiconductor orders wer=
e about even with the second-quarter level.   TI's overall book-to-bill for=
 semiconductors continued to rise sequentially, and TI's DSP book-to-bill e=
xceeded one for the second consecutive quarter. DSP revenue was up 10 perce=
nt sequentially and orders were up 11 percent sequentially. Orders for high=
-performance Analog turned the corner and increased 10 percent sequentially=
.   Inventory was reduced by $182 million from the end of the second quarte=
r. Despite the decline in revenue, days of inventory were reduced to 58 fro=
m 72 at the end of the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $334 m=
illion, and free cash flow was $22 million. The company also repurchased $1=
52 million of company stock.   SUMMARY  OF  FINANCIAL  RESULTS  For the thi=
rd quarter of 2001, TI reported the following:   - Total revenue for TI was=
 $1849 million, down 41 percent from $3149 million in the year-ago quarter =
and down 9 percent sequentially due to weakness in Semiconductor.   - Cost =
of revenues in the third quarter was $1424 million, compared with $1637 mil=
lion in the year-ago quarter. Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to d=
ecreased Semiconductor revenue.   - Research and development (R&D) totaled =
$358 million, down from $533 million in the third quarter of 2000 primarily=
 due to acquisition- related charges for in-process R?in the third quarter =
of 2000.   - Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was=
 $312 million, down from $453 million in the year-ago quarter due to saving=
s resulting from restructuring activities and tight spending controls.   - =
Other income (expense) net decreased from $565 million in the third quarter=
 of 2000 to $37 million in the third quarter of 2001, primarily due to a ga=
in on the sale of Micron stock in the third quarter of 2000.   - The income=
 tax rate for the quarter was 47 percent.   - TI orders in the third quarte=
r were $1638 million, compared with $3250 million in the year-ago quarter a=
nd $1704 million in the second quarter.   Results for the third quarter of =
2001 include net special charges of $37 million, of which $19 million is se=
verance cost for a worldwide cost- reduction program and $16 million relate=
s to the restructuring charges for the closing of three Semiconductor facil=
ities (Santa Cruz, California; Merrimack, New Hampshire; and Tustin, Califo=
rnia). Of the $16 million, $15 million is for the acceleration of depreciat=
ion over the remaining service life of the facilities. Also included is amo=
rtization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of $56 mill=
ion.   For the second quarter of 2001, results include net special charges =
of $252 million, of which $214 million is severance cost for a worldwide co=
st-reduction program and $35 million relates to the restructuring charges f=
or the closing of three Semiconductor facilities (Merrimack, New Hampshire;=
 Tustin, California; and Santa Cruz, California). In addition, TI recorded =
a $68 million increase to the income tax provision to adjust to the expecte=
d tax rate for the year. Also included is amortization of goodwill and othe=
r acquisition-related intangibles of $58 million.   For the first quarter o=
f 2001, results include net special charges of $50 million, of which $11 mi=
llion is severance cost for first-quarter employee acceptances under the U.=
S. voluntary retirement program, $16 million is severance cost for restruct=
uring actions in international Semiconductor locations, and $25 million rel=
ates to the closing of a Semiconductor manufacturing facility in Santa Cruz=
, California. Also included is amortization of goodwill and other acquisiti=
on-related intangibles of $59 million.   For the third quarter of 2000, res=
ults include investment gains of $425 million, included in other income, fr=
om the sale of 5.6 million shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) commo=
n stock, and net special charges of $163 million, of which $112 million is =
for purchased in-process R?costs from the Dot Wireless, Inc. and Alantro Co=
mmunications, Inc. acquisitions, $41 million is for pooling of interests tr=
ansaction costs from the Burr- Brown Corporation acquisition, and $10 milli=
on, net, is for several Semiconductor and Sensors & Controls restructuring =
and other actions in the U.S., Japan and Europe. Also included is amortizat=
ion of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of $41 million.  =
 For the second quarter of 2000, results include an investment gain of $121=
1 million, included in other income, from the sale of 20 million shares of =
Micron common stock. Also included is amortization of goodwill and other ac=
quisition-related intangibles of $25 million.   For the first quarter of 20=
00, results included net special charges of $29 million for actions includi=
ng the closing of a Sensors & Controls manufacturing facility in Versailles=
, Kentucky, and TI's acquisition of Toccata Technology ApS. Also included i=
s amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of $25=
 million.   Additional information relating to these items appears below un=
der the heading "Special Charges and Gains."   OUTLOOK  It appears that thi=
rd quarter of 2001 will mark the bottom for semiconductor orders, and the f=
loor for revenue should be set in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter TI rev=
enue is expected to decline about 10 percent sequentially, mostly due to no=
rmal seasonal declines in Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) as we=
ll as continued weakness in Semiconductor.   Specifically, TI expects the f=
ollowing for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter:   - In Semic=
onductor, revenue will decline about 5 percent as continued growth in DSP i=
s more than offset by declines in other products.   - Sensors & Controls re=
venue will be about even.   - E&PS revenue will decline by about $110 milli=
on, or 60 percent, as the back-to-school season for educational products en=
ds.   - Operating margin will decline about 9 percentage points before the =
effect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisitio=
n-related intangibles, reflecting the lower revenue level and further reduc=
tions in inventory.   - Non-operating income will decline about $10 million=
 reflecting lower interest rates.   - Loss per share will be about 6 cents =
more in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter, before the eff=
ect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-r=
elated intangibles.   For 2001, TI expects the following:   - R?of $1.5 bil=
lion, excluding acquisition-related amortization and purchased in-process R=
&D, compared with the company's prior estimate of $1.6 billion and last yea=
r's $1.6 billion.   - Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, unchanged from =
the prior estimate and down about 35 percent from last year.   - Depreciati=
on of $1.6 billion, compared with the prior estimate of $1.5 billion and up=
 about 30 percent from last year.   SEMICONDUCTOR  Semiconductor revenue in=
 the third quarter was $1453 million, down from $2692 million in the year-a=
go period. Revenue was down from $1657 million in the second quarter due to=
 continued weakness across most Semiconductor products, excluding DSP.   As=
 a result of lower revenue, Semiconductor had a $219 million operating loss=
, compared with an operating profit of $681 million in the year-ago period =
and an operating loss of $37 million in the second quarter.   Analog revenu=
e was down 45 percent from the year-ago period and 16 percent sequentially =
due to broad based weakness in demand. In the first nine months of the year=
, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from Analog.   DSP r=
evenue decreased 37 percent from the year-ago quarter due to broad based we=
akness in demand but increased 10 percent sequentially due to strength in w=
ireless. In the first nine months of the year, about 25 percent of total Se=
miconductor revenue came from DSP.   TI's remaining Semiconductor revenue d=
ecreased from the year-ago quarter and sequentially.   TI's Semiconductor r=
evenue in key markets was as follows:   - Wireless revenue was down 42 perc=
ent from the year-ago period but increased 16 percent sequentially. In the =
first nine months of the year, about 20 percent of total Semiconductor reve=
nue came from wireless.   - Revenue from TI's catalog products, comprised o=
f high-performance Analog and DSP, declined 52 percent from the year-ago qu=
arter and 16 percent sequentially. In the first nine months of the year, ab=
out 15 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from catalog products.  =
 - Broadband communications revenue, which includes digital subscriber line=
 (DSL) and cable modems, was up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter but dec=
lined 53 percent sequentially. In the first nine months of the year, about =
5 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from broadband communications=
.   - Semiconductor orders were $1308 million, compared with $2884 in the y=
ear-ago period and $1321 million in the second quarter.   SENSORS  &  CONTR=
OLS  Revenue was $222 million, compared with $245 million in the year-ago p=
eriod due to overall market weakness, and down from $257 million in the sec=
ond quarter due to seasonal patterns in the heating and air conditioning in=
dustry and market weakness.   Operating profit was $45 million, or 20.2 per=
cent of revenue. Operating profit in the year-ago period was $43 million, o=
r 17.5 percent of revenue. Operating profit in the second quarter was $52 m=
illion, or 20.2 percent of revenue.   EDUCATIONAL  &  PRODUCTIVITY  SOLUTIO=
NS  (E&PS)  E&PS revenue was $179 million, compared with $175 million in th=
e year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue increased by $50 million due to b=
ack-to- school sales of educational products.   Operating profit was $67 mi=
llion, or 37.3 percent of revenue, compared with $64 million, or 36.3 perce=
nt of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit increased 76 percen=
t from the second quarter's $38 million due to seasonality.   FIRST  NINE  =
MONTHS  OF  2001  For the first nine months of 2001, TI reported the follow=
ing:   - TI revenue was $6414 million, down from $8843 million in the first=
 nine months of 2000, due to Semiconductor. The decrease in Semiconductor r=
evenue for the first nine months of 2001 was primarily due to weakness acro=
ss most Semiconductor products. The decrease in Sensors & Controls was prim=
arily due to overall market weakness. E&PS was up slightly due to strength =
of educational products.   - Cost of revenues was $4452 million compared wi=
th $4544 million in the year-ago period. Cost of revenues decreased primari=
ly due to decreased Semiconductor revenue.   - R?totaled $1216 million, com=
pared with $1306 million in the first nine months of 2000. The decrease was=
 primarily due to acquisition-related charges for purchased in-process R?in=
 the first nine months of 2000.   - Selling, general and administrative exp=
ense was $1060 million, down from $1268 million in the year-ago period prim=
arily due to cost reduction actions and reduced profit sharing.   - Other i=
ncome (expense) net decreased from $2039 million in the first nine months o=
f 2000 to $201 million for the first nine months of 2001, primarily due to =
the sale of Micron stock in 2000.   - The income tax rate was 46 percent.  =
 - Orders were $5239 million, down from $9601 million for the same period a=
 year ago, primarily due to weakness in Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders=
 for the first nine months were down, primarily due to a combination of wea=
k electronic end-equipment markets and excess customer inventories. Sensors=
 & Controls orders were down due to overall market weakness. E&PS orders we=
re up slightly due to strength of educational products.   FINANCIAL  CONDIT=
ION  In the first nine months of 2001, cash and cash equivalents plus short=
-term investments decreased by $1011 million to $2992 million, primarily du=
e to capital expenditures. During the third quarter of 2001, cash and cash =
equivalents plus short-term investments decreased by $22 million due to the=
 repurchase of the company's common stock.   Cash flow from operating activ=
ities was $1039 million in the first three quarters of 2001.   Capital expe=
nditures totaled $1554 million in the first nine months of 2001, compared w=
ith $1789 million in the first nine months of 2000. Capital expenditures to=
taled $312 million in the third quarter of 2001 versus $585 million in the =
year-ago quarter.   Depreciation for the first three quarters of 2001 was $=
1145 million, compared with $869 million in the same period a year ago. Dep=
reciation for the third quarter of 2001 was $414 million, versus $319 milli=
on in the year-ago quarter.   Debt-to-total-capital ratio was 0.10 at the e=
nd of the third quarter, the same as at the end of 2000.   In June 2001, th=
e Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accou=
nting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and O=

001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have ind=
efinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual imp=
airment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets wi=
ll continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The company will apply=
 the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets begin=
ning in the first quarter of 2002. Application of the non- amortization pro=
visions of the Statement is expected to result in an increase in net income=
 of $100 million ($0.06 per share). During 2002, the company will perform t=
he first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived =
intangible assets as of January 1, 2002 and has not yet determined what eff=
ect, if any, these tests will have on the earnings and financial position o=
