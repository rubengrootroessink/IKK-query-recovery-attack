Catch of the Day: Barrel of monkeys

Where will entrepreneurs make money from short-range
wireless (radio) technology? In wireless LANs for the home?
In airports? Offices? Given the times, maybe they should be
looking for opportunities in smaller markets.

After his last company, a wireless ASP, netted him "zero,"
Mike Stemple founded a more modest wireless company. His
two-month-old firm, Nomad Labs, installs wireless systems
primarily for zoos and aquariums. Nomad doesn't make
hardware; it uses off-the-shelf PDAs and standard wireless
access devices (802.11b for now; Bluetooth perhaps later).

The idea is that visitors -- at first, only teachers and
rich patrons -- borrow a wireless-equipped Windows CE
handheld from the zoo. While they're wandering through
exhibits, they can look up information (including streaming
movies) from the zoo's servers, or get alerted that events
(like feedings) are about to start.

They can also be marketed to; for example, to renew their
donation (useful since few zoo members ever visit a zoo's
Web site).

There are only a hundred zoos and aquariums in the U.S., so
Mike's upside is capped. Nomad is, however, self-funded, and
is not in need of big venture money. In the future, Mike may
extend Nomad's domain to other "edutainment" markets and to
trade shows.
