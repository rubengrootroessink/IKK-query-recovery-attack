Press Release

Wamex Secures Bridge Funding to Help Get Internet Trading System Online

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 29, 2001--Wamex Holdings Inc. (OTC:WAMX -
news) today announced that it received the first cash payments as part of
an advance towards the funding it needs to get its Internet Trading System
online.

Macrocom Investors, LLC, a New York financial firm, has agreed in
principle to initial financing in the amount of $500,000, with the
prospect of further investment when due diligence is completed, according
to Sascha Mundstein, Wamex CEO.

The advance, Mundstein speculated, could be the first increment in a total
financing package that will enable Wamex to fulfill its role in the
"Instox" joint venture pledged to bring its Internet Trading System online
worldwide, and generating revenues.

"The funding is contingent on Macrocom's satisfaction that the Internet
Trading System software really works, and we know that it does -- it has
been demonstrated," Mundstein said.

The Wamex CEO expressed the hope that this financial boost signals major
progress toward the total recovery of Wamex, which he has been working to
achieve since taking over the company late in 2000.  Wamex is 50% partner
in a joint venture with Trat.net Ltd. and CSCO Ltd., officially named
"Instox." Instox is developing the Web site that will bring investors
international access to a direct, online, one-on-one, "no middleman"
trading facility, wherein third party price manipulation and distortion
may be greatly reduced or eliminated.

"The day Instox opens the Internet Trading System to investors will be the
day the investment business begins a radical change for the better,"
Mundstein said.

Press Release

Wamex to Complete Problematic 3-Year Audit and File Its 10K With SEC

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2001--Wamex Holdings Inc. (OTC:WAMX -
news) today announced the impending completion of a problematic 3-year
audit, which will pave the way for the filing of an up-to-date 10K annual
report with the SEC.

The audit and 10K filing will remove a significant obstacle to the
re-listing of WAMX stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, Sascha Mundstein, CEO,
speculated.

"Hopefully, we will complete the audit in the very near future and the
filing of the 10K annual report will follow shortly," Mundstein said. "The
pursuit of an accurate audit has been an arduous task, and we will be
happy to put it behind us. We are geared to keep Wamex dealings absolutely
accurate and above board in the future."

Wamex lost its listing in mid-2000 after two of its officers were charged
with illegal dealings. They have subsequently left the company. The
company itself, Mundstein said, has never been accused of any wrong-doing.

The audit was complicated by a convoluted trail going back to 1998,
involving problems such as monies deposited in subsidiary and alternate
companies by previous management, before Mundstein took charge last year
to rescue Wamex. Former executives connected to these transactions have
long since resigned from the company and foregone any control of its
stock.

The prospect of Wamex's return to the OTC Bulletin Board, and the
projected opening this year of the "Instox" international Web site,
offering the private investor a chance to trade one-on-one without
middlemen and price distortion, Mundstein said, "puts our corporation back
on the track leading to stability and profitability."

statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or
results may differ from the company's expectations.
