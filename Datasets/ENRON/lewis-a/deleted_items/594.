Economic News:
==============

Economic Reports Last Week Were Uniformly Positive
 Nice Ending For 2001 - Bodes Well For 2002 Recovery
 Spring Recovery More And More Likely - A Good Bet


*November Durable Goods Orders fell -4.8% -
  Ex volatile transportation sector orders rose +1.1%
*Jobless Claims rose +7,000 to 392,000 - Four Week
  Moving Average fell -25,250 to 413,250
*December Consumer Confidence rose to 93.7 - See Below
*November Existing Home Sales rose +.6% to 5.21 mil rate
*New Home Sales in November rose +6.4% - See Below


Last week's economic reports were uniformly positive,
and given that a few of them are truly "forward looking",
the implications for 2002 are getting better and better.
When combined with the prior week's reports, we are
becoming more and more confident, barring an exogenous
event, that an economic recovery will be underway by Spring.
Perhaps Ed Hyman is right - it may have already begun.

Longer term readers know that we place a lot of importance
on the outlook for the consumer, given that consumer
spending drives approximately two thirds of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP).  Naturally, we were particularly pleased, then,
that the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey
confirmed the nice gain in the Univ. of Michigan Sentiment
Index that we reported last week.  However, there is a "but."

The "but" is the disconnect between the sharp increases in
sentiment and the soft holiday selling season.  True there
was a late inning rally, and yes a major discounter reported
recent weekly sales at the top end of their target, but the
overall selling season was sloppy, and driven by price.

One rationale might be that consumers are somewhat concerned
about the labor market, given the rise in the unemployment
rate and the recent lackluster gains in personal income.
To us this would be a plausible explanation, and implies that
sluggishness will continue for a while longer.

However, the Durable Goods report, without the volatile
transportation sector, has now improved for two consecutive
months - not eternity by any standard, but it does imply that
the pressure on the beleaguered manufacturing sector is ending.
If so, then there will be a lagged response favorably
impacting both jobs and income.

While the housing market was also strong, we again caution that
in our view the strength is overstated given November's warm
weather.  Simply put, more people can shop for a house in
nice weather than poor weather.  More shoppers, low rates
equals more sales.  Simple as that.  But still there are
some positive implications as the supply of new homes on the
market is the smallest in almost a year.

Overall, then, a pretty good ending to 2001.  And, as you
know, our view is for a recovery to be underway by Spring.
But, the war against terrorism is not over, and may in fact
be expanded, and even without an exogenous event the slope
of the recovery is far from certain.  So, enjoy the New
Year Holiday as we look forward to 2002.  Stay tuned !
