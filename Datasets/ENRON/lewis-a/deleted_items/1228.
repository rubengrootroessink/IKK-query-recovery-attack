BARRON'S says "It's time to buy stocks... a reliable indicator
now says that stocks are a better bargain for long-term
investors."

MONEY magazine says: "Most stocks are undervalued right now."

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL reported: "...those who bought stocks on
any sudden drop tended to profit."


Dear Daily Reckoning reader,

Using a complex mathematical model, our friends at the Fed
recently determined that "the market" is now 17% undervalued.
Barron's, the WSJ and Money jumped at the story.

"Not so fast," your persnickety editors said. And we put Lynn
Carpenter on the case...

The last time the market was this "cheap," says the Fed, was in
1998 when they determined it was 16% undervalued -- and it did
in fact prove to be an excellent buying opportunity.
"Historically, undervaluations for this indicator in the range
of 10%-20% have represented good buying opportunities," says a
special report by The Fleet Street Letter.  (Link provided
below...)

But there's a catch. Not all stocks will benefit.

The real question becomes: which stocks do you buy? The popular
"must-own" stocks of the day... those likely to be the subject
of mass market speculation? Or time-tested true value stocks
sound enough to withstand any blow to the economy?

There's the rub. You buy the stocks that would have done well
regardless...

You'll recall Lynn is the editor of The Fleet Street Letter, our
resident expert on value investing. In a time like this, the
Daily Reckoning relies on Lynn to steer us clear of the latest
public whim and fancy.

Rather, the 10 stocks Lynn selected for The Fleet Street
Letter's 10-For-10 "Wealth Recovery" Portfolio have a history of
safe, solid, reliable earnings, shrewd management, low debt
levels, growing sales, recession-resistant products and a
powerful cash flow. And they're nothing like the "must-own"
losers being touted by last year's geniuses on Wall Street.

These stocks are so sound, in fact, they've beaten the market by
210% in these, well, less-than-predictable conditions. The
stocks Lynn has selected reflect diversified businesses that can
steadily prosper no matter what the economy does. "We screened
over 2,678 shares before selecting just 10," says Lynn.

Now Lynn says she will send you these free reports absolutely
risk-free. And they are yours to keep with no obligation even if
you decide not to continue your subscription to The Fleet Street
Letter:

* Put a Portion of Your Funds Into All 10 Stocks: "We've
carefully balanced all 10 stocks so that they 'fit together' in
earning you profits and protecting your money. If one part of
the economy gets soft, another will pull ahead."

* Buy Only a Few: "The fundamentals of these individual
companies are so solid, you don't have to worry about having
bought the wrong stock.'"

 * Even Create a "Paper" Portfolio and Track Their Progress:
"Without having a cent in these securities you can judge their
performance. Get completely comfortable... even show them to a
trusted financial advisor."

The Fleet Street Letter has been successfully assisting
investors since 1937, and while today's market may seem
difficult, if you trust the wisdom that experience brings,
you'll understand why these stocks are shrewd buys - for any
market.
