Dear Investor,

At my Technology Investing advisory, we reap HUGE GAINS from the
opportunities other investors miss.

OUR SECRET WEAPON?  A laser-like focus on All-Tech, All-the-Time.  You
see, most investment advisors pride themselves on a broad reach across
dozens of industries.  They claim that gives you more opportunities to
profit.

But that's JUST BALONEY.  There's no way one individual -- or even a
substantial team -- can spread himself that thin and still do quality
research...especially when it comes to the complex world of high tech.

That's why my team and I do ONE THING, and one thing only.  We target
the hottest growth markets of technology -- from microchips to software
to biotech.  And we reap the profits most investors miss.

DID YOU OWN Immunex, for example?

I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of this fast-growing
biotech firm.  When that deal was announced yesterday, it included a 17%
premium for our Immunex stock.  But our profits -- locked in after I
advised clients to sell in an urgent email bulletin -- were much higher
than that.  We banked 105% GAINS in just 8-months' time.

I hope you owned Immunex.  But if you didn't, don't worry about it.  In
just a moment I'll tell you all about my current #1 PICK -- another
overlooked stock that should DOUBLE YOUR MONEY at least in 2002....then
multiply it 5-times over by 2007.

BUT FIRST, an important lesson to be learned from Immunex.  Don't
believe everything you hear on Wall Street.

Back when we bought Immunex, traders were down on almost everything
related to the drug industry.  And I agreed with them -- to a point.
You see, the big drug companies are facing intense pressure from generic
drug-makers.  Merck's big disappointment is a perfect example -- 0%
earnings growth next year.  That's pitiful in today's drug hungry world.

But as the baby boomers pass into their "golden years," drugs are still
a HUGE PLAY.  just not in the traditional way.  Most big pharma
companies -- like Merck, Pfizer and J&J -- have really slipped when it
comes to new drug development.

But INNOVATIVE biotechs like Immunex are a totally different story.
Their R&D is RED-HOT.  So when Wall Street tarred the traditional firms
and biotechs with the same brush...we stepped in to pick Immunex up for
a song.

Eight months later, we're 105% RICHER.  Now, we're about to pull off
another profit coup just like it -- but with MUCH BIGGER potential.  And
this time around, YOU have the opportunity to join us.

Here's the truth about today's so-called communications "fiber glut"
that everyone keeps talking about:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down -- very
noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!
That means there isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.
After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, a
tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore our economy --
are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today, commerce and
security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems.  Virtually nothing
moves without it.  That's how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans get paid through
direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of Americans even
begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently said they're 60%
loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until you
understand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network much
past 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC -- because the network
spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to a
standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world.  Internet
traffic systems currently run faster in Australia, Europe and even South
America.  That's because we push out more data than everyone else -- but
we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up fast!  Otherwise
business, the economy and our national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber glut?"  Because
 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is "dark" -- that is, it's
not activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of
the components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE --
possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to
multiply our money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-times
higher.  So what changed?  Spending on communications networks dried up.
 Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need
isn't just vital for the economy anymore -- it's a question of NATIONAL
SECURITY!

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.  This stock
has a long ways to run -- but it's already UP 37% since October 1st, in
recognition of this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained to the
limits.  And get this --- data traffic is DOUBLING every year now.  That
means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to get your FREE Special
Report now.
