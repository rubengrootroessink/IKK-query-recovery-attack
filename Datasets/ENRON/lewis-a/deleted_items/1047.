""Frank,
We had a good call today- JNPR met the criteria at 3:00PM, it was at $26.45,
within 30 minutes it had gone up to $27.32. Not bad, about 3% Plus, there
was
another stock that I didn't call- SURE it met the systems criteria at 10AM
when the stock was at $12.20- I couldn't find the news that was driving it
until it was over $13 and so I didn't call it, but it just proves again that
the system continues  to work like a charm! By the way, SURE closed today at
$15.32- If I had found the news, we all could have made over 20%. A couple
of
people bought it anyway, one in particular bought it a little earlier at
$11.00 a share and sold at $14. Not bad! Have a great night! Oh one last
story from the room that I wanted to tell you, we had a good call yesterday
as well BLDP-we called it at $27.10 and it went as high as $28.30. The funny
thing was that a new member who had been with us for only 30 minutes bought
it and made almost $500. Their first day was $500 and today they made even
more! That is what I am talking about! That's the kind of stuff that is
happening in the room. By the way, he made that $500 on a small amount of
money! Talk to you soon! And thanks again so much for the system!

Michael aka ChatMaster""

Have a nice day.

*580% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 7 weeks if you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would
have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in
the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
