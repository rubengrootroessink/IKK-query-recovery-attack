nstruments reported earnings that top estimates by $0.01. Analysts on the a=
verage expected the company to report a loss of $0.04 the latest earnings c=
ame in at a loss of $0.03.  The problem with this picture is the future out=
look. According to the comments from Texas Instruments decline in semicondu=
ctor sales is expected to bottom in the fourth quarter. Despite the optimis=
m the company failed to say when it will return to profitability.  It is al=
so worth pointing out that Texas is expecting to report a loss of $0.06 for=
 the fourth quarter. According to First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 20=
 brokers had expected the company to to lose only a penny.  We at RealTimeT=
raders believe it is important to highlight that the company is expecting t=
o register a sequential revenue loss of 10%. We believe this may also press=
ure the stock. We strongly suggest readers watch the analysts comments and =
rating/earnings estimate changes.  Technical analyst point out that the sto=
ck recently bounced off the long term support around $20-22 area. Given the=
 negative outlook and the market volatility may lead potential retest aroun=
d mid-September levels. Copyright(c) 2001 RealTimeTraders.com, Inc. All Rig=
