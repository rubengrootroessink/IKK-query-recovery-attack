June 4, 2001 - Stocks rose Monday on comments from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan that inflation is under control, giving traders
hope for further rate cuts.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ slipped fractionally to 257, and
the Nasdaq climbed 6 to 2155. The S&P 500 added 6 to 1267, and the Dow
rose 71 to 11,061, back above the important 11,000 level. But volume dried
up to its lowest level of the year: 976 million shares on the NYSE and 1.3
billion on the Nasdaq. Advancers led 19 to 10 on the NYSE, and 20 to 17 on
the Nasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at

After the bell, Comverse Technology (NASDAQ:CMVT) rose after beating
estimates by a penny with 43-cent earnings, and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) rose
after reaffirming estimates.

During the day, GoTo.com (NASDAQ:GOTO) did something that Net stocks
haven't done much of lately: the stock rose 2.57 to a new 52-week high of
26. The stock has led the ISDEX off its April 4 bottom.

Traders took Oracle's (NASDAQ:ORCL) announcement that it will report
earnings on June 18 as a good sign, because the company did not warn.
Oracle gained .24 to 16.10.

Semiconductor stocks were weak on a warning from Cypress Semiconductor
(NYSE:CY) and concern that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will warn when it holds its
first-ever mid-quarter update on Thursday. A downgrade to Broadcom
(NASDAQ:BRCM) also hurt chip stocks.

Juniper (NASDAQ:JNPR) rose 1.96 to 44.75 on optimism that it will announce
a new product this week. Some analysts are concerned that the next new
product introduction may not occur until the fall.

Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) plunged 5.32 to 49.85 on worries about pricing
pressure and increasing competition.

New issue Simplex Solutions (NASDAQ:SPLX) continued to rocket, up 11 to 39
in the wake of its conference call and a Robertson Stephens Buy rating.

RealNetworks (NASDAQ:RNWK) surged 1.43 to 12.43 on optimism that trouble
between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and AOL (NYSE:AOL) could mean more
business for RealPlayer and less for Windows Media Player.

Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose 1.20 to 20.05 on comments that it is not in talks
to buy Marconi (NASDAQ:MONI).

Nortel (NYSE:NT) gained .59 to 14 after announcing it will reprice
employee options.

MyPoints.com (NASDAQ:MYPT) rose .95 to 2.55 on news that it will be bought
out by a UAL (NYSE:UAL) unit for $2.60 in cash.

Another nice day today, but the very low volume still argues for more
downside. Today through Wednesday is a possible cycle turn window, so
whichever way stocks move on rising volume this week could dictate
near-term direction. 1200 on the S&P 500 and 2000 on the Nasdaq remain our
lines in the sand; above those levels, the market looks okay, and below
those levels, a retest of the lows becomes likely. The Dow (first chart)
took out both the important 11,000 level and its main downtrend line
today, but the low volume calls the breakout into question. Critical
support on the index is 10,750, a trendline off the March lows. The S&P
500 (second chart) cleared the important 1265 level, the neckline of a
potential inverted head-and-shoulders bottom, but again, the breakout came
on the lowest NYSE volume of the year. A move above 1275 would be a big
plus, and 1254-1265 is first support. The Nasdaq (third chart) is firmly
back above its September downtrend line, which is now around 2050-2080,
but the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 (fourth chart) could both be forming bearish
rising wedges (the blue lines), and the Nasdaq 100 is still below its
September downtrend line.
