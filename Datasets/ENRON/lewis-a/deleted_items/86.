[IMAGE]      We know how scary debt can be. We have helped hundreds of peop=
le settle their debts, avoid filing bankruptcy and build strong happy futur=
es.   We can and will do the same for you!   Here are the answers you reall=
y need to know:   Q. Is our Debt Settlement the same as debt consolidation?=
  A. No. With our ...Debt Settlement Program we negotiate on your behalf to=
 actually eliminate your debt. Debt consolidation requires you to obtain a =
new loan in order to pay off your existing debt.. If you have too much debt=
 and/or bad credit, it is highly unlikely that you would be approved for a =
consolidation loan.    We work for YOU!  Debt Rescue is not a credit counse=
ling service. Credit counseling services work for your creditors and may ea=
rn a percentage of what you pay to the creditors. Consumers utilizing these=
 credit counseling services are expected to pay back 100% of their debt thr=
ough small monthly payments. This could result in an increase in the overal=
l debt and may damage your credit profile.     CLICK HERE for more informat=
