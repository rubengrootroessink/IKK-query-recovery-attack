Ohio's Largest Private University Deploys Antigen for Proactive E-mail Secu=
rity   E. NORTHPORT, N.Y., Nov 27, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Sybari Software,=
 Inc., the premier developers of Antigen, a comprehensive antivirus, conten=
t-management, and e-mail security solution for Microsoft Exchange and Lotus=
 Domino environments, today announced that the University of Dayton (UD), w=
hich was recently ranked No.16 of 200 colleges and universities who were ac=
credited with the title of being one of Yahoo's Most Wired, has selected An=
tigen for antivirus and security protection of their Lotus Notes/Domino ser=
vers that support more than 10,000 students and nearly 2,000 faculty member=
s and administrative and research personnel.   "NIMDA," "SIRCAM," "LOVE," a=
nd "MELISSA" have clearly demonstrated how crippling a virus can be in term=
s of lost time, data, and productivity. The University of Dayton could not =
afford to join the growing number of universities and large organizations t=
hat have experienced the staggering costs of data recovery and downtime ass=
ociated with these and other malicious viruses. After conducting a full eva=
luation of server products from such companies as Trend Micro and McAfee, U=
D concluded that a server-level solution offering multiple scan engines and=
 superior file filtering capabilities, coupled with a strong vendor commitm=
ent to delivering a proactive line of defense from Internet and e-mail-born=
e viruses, would provide the level of protection UD needs today and in the =
future.   "We selected Sybari's Antigen for many reasons including trusted =
scanning, which means less processor time, the ability to quickly block any=
 files or file type, multiple scan engines, and the 24 x 7 uptime," said Su=
san McCabe, Director, Lotus Integration for the University of Dayton. "We d=
on't need to take our servers down to apply updates. Antigen truly gives us=
 all of the features we feel are important and delivers the best value."   =
Sybari's Antigen is the only solution with a choice of up to five leading s=
can engine technologies from: Network Associates, Norman Data Defense, Soph=
os, and two Computer Associates engines from their Etrust offering. Since n=
ew viruses may survive one engine, Antigen institutes an extra measure of p=
rotection by enabling users to run multiple-scan engines, virtually elimina=
ting network infection. Antigen comes equipped with Content Management faci=
lities that provide the proactive support needed to maintain a virus free g=
roupware environment. With the Antigen File Filter (AFF), administrators ca=
n filter e-mail attachments by file name, type, or wild card. A pre-emptive=
 content management feature like this can prove extremely useful while wait=
ing for signature files from anti-virus vendors with proprietary engines an=
d virus labs.   "We pioneered this industry with our flagship release of An=
tigen for Lotus Notes/Domino environments in the nineties," said Rocco Donn=
ino, vice president of sales, the Americas, for Sybari Software. "Our lates=
t release of Antigen further validates our commitment to developing highly =
specialized solutions for messaging platforms and its selection by such a p=
restigious university confirms our success in turning out winning solutions=
."   ABOUT SYBARI  Since 1995, Sybari has the led the market in providing i=
